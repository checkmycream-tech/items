            <li>It is truly amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li>I am happy that it was available to buy online.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>The lotion feels nice and does indeed have a therapeutic effect.</li>
            <li>This rose</li>
            <li>A friend of mine&#x27;s family raised race horses and she told me they used to get it for the horses and used it for their own aches and pains.  </li>
            <li>real;y did not have a rose scent not unpleasent but just did not like the scent</li>
            <li>Amusing product.</li>
            <li>Works and feels nice.</li>
            <li>The smell is stong rose scent.</li>
            <li>So why do you add aloe vera or rose scent to a solvent?</li>
            <li>I read that this stuff can be effective in relieving the swelling/pain.  </li>
            <li>The Aloe Vera with the Rose Scent does not burn me like the reg DMSO does.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cream DMSO.</li>
            <li>But it is nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of metallic tasting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like to mix it with the aloe version which reduces the chemical smell of the aloe version and reduces the overpowering rose scent of this version.</li>
            <li>Nice creamy texture</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>The 70% solution does an effective job without skin irritation.</li>
            <li>The rose smell got cloying too.  </li>
            <li>cool stuff  great shipper</li>
            <li>Smells good and easy to rub into skin.</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs quickly, and I&#x27;ve experienced none of the itching that sometimes occurs with liquid formulas.</li>
            <li>Especially nice is the rose scented formula with aloe vera - much better than it&#x27;s natural scent.</li>
            <li>and I just love the rose scented DMSO, I use it for just about everything.</li>
            <li>my favorite ointment for sore knees and hands, smells nice, and helps a lot</li>
            <li>It kind of powder rose smell that reminds me of cheap purfume.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping for this amazing product which I use for my arthritis pain.</li>
            <li>A bit strong on the rose.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I add NSAID pain creme on top.</li>
            <li>Have used DMSO for years, the rose fragrance is light doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>this stuff has given her more relief than anything I&#x27;ve seen before.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many aches and pains</li>
            <li>As a rule, I test products applied to my skin and so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough of how impressed I am with this product.  </li>
            <li>and I have not been able to do that for 4 months</li>
            <li>and I am able to function.</li>
            <li>And I always feel better soon after or when I wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s potent.</li>
            <li>It alleviated my frozen shoulder pains somewhat when I slept, but it also caused headaches so I had to return it.</li>
            <li>This cream appears to be working as well or better than many of the prescription creams my wife needs for her psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Works better than prescription meds for pain.</li>
            <li>I love the smell keeps the skin</li>
            <li>This cream has Aloe Vera in it which I love</li>
            <li>Maybe gel is better.  </li>
            <li>That ones ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this...</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic, it truly works miracles on aching shoulders!  </li>
            <li>and I was not quite sure how that was going to affect the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>I have used it before and is satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>and I think that the recommended strength of 70% probably works even better.  </li>
            <li>I had to smear a lot more on my knees before I could taste anything.  </li>
            <li>and I am able to survive the day.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to read and educate yourself before using any product.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, and have been using it for years for all kinds of pain.  </li>
            <li>Works even better with Bengay.</li>
            <li>Most relief I have had.</li>
            <li>I think it is helping me since I started it, I feel so much better,</li>
            <li>Only two days of using this product and I am impressed!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, I guess, as I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li>I will try to update review when I have more knowledge.</li>
            <li>And everyone likes the smell, had no garlic scent anywhere so love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It is better than any sports cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>We tried the cream and it helped soooo much!!!!</li>
            <li>I have heard great things regarding this substance and I have high hopes of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast effect, easy to use</li>
            <li>The Rose Scented version is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Works quickly and is a nice cream</li>
            <li>It works well and is odorless except for the mild Rose scent.</li>
            <li>also love the fragarance; rose being my favorite flower, so that has won me over first.  </li>
            <li>I love to rub it into sore areas at night and sleep comfortably all night because of the relief of this ointment.  </li>
            <li>really works it smells good</li>
            <li>That is mostly true - the Rose scent is quite strong and the product applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to do this for going on 4 months, it hurt when I mopped or swept as I clean for a living.  </li>
            <li>the DMSO Cream with Aloe Vera Rose Scented rather than the straight liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Am pleased to report that the Cream worked well for me after 6 days of nightime use,</li>
            <li>LIKE THE SMELL, BUT DOESN&#x27;T SEEM AS STRONG AS THE GEL OR ROLLON.</li>
            <li>Right now I feel that this product is better than F/S, so I am glad to have resolved this issue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First of all a product that can penetrate a cell wall is amazing.  </li>
            <li>To me it smells more like Noxzema than roses, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>In fact, I love the light clean scent of this cream.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much, I am quite happy with my item.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to know some of these companies actually know their products very satisfied</li>
            <li>Secondly, the mixture of aloe and dmso along with the rose oil producing a very healthy nourishment for your cells along with a palatable aroma.</li>
            <li>A fine product.</li>
            <li>was using a product that a friend gave me and was pleased with it, so when I could not get it any more this seemed the logical way&lt;</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is non greasy!</li>
            <li>(make sure you read up on clean hands, clean skin and why) for reducing inflammation and pain.  </li>
            <li>Also great for shoulder, back, neck, and knee pain.</li>
            <li>It is unlawful to represent in any way that this product is useful or safe to use for medicinal purposes.</li>
            <li>My skin is silky smooth when I use this.</li>
            <li>Such a great find.</li>
            <li>Only experienced the sulphur taste on 3&lt;br /&gt;occasions</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t really care for the rose scent and it does not work as well at the unsented gel</li>
            <li>I have issues with my legs and get leg cramps, works great and especially at night.</li>
            <li>Not only is this cream good for pain due to inflammation but it is at its best for any type of burn including sunburn.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t now what I tore, but it doesn&#x27;t even matter now :) I do use the full strength DMSO for acute issues, but for daily use, this is better</li>
            <li>A word of caution when using this product,  make sure your hands are clean when applying this product as anything on them will be absorbed with the dmso into your skin.  </li>
            <li>Good price, easy package to open, smell is not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>Some what effective without the normal DMSO odor.</li>
            <li>Worked wonders- first morning after using cream the day before was much better.  </li>
            <li>through-the-skin delivery means that it has to be extremely pure to be safe.</li>
            <li>but I now know I need pure DMSO in order to make an educated decision on whether DMSO works or not, in my situation that is:)</li>
            <li>A true miracle cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural remedy kind of person, I loathe pharmaceuticals.</li>
            <li>Use twice a day and make sure to wash wherever you put it as it is a solvent and will dissolve anything already there and move it straight into your body.  </li>
            <li>It has worked very well on my Achilles tendon, as a matter of fact better than my prescription cream.</li>
            <li>In fact,  this product made my skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this brand to several friends who have also gotten good results.</li>
            <li>Its not bad at all.</li>
            <li>No bad after taste that people warned me about.</li>
            <li>it quickly and super-effectively delivers substances through the skin and into the bloodstream, and magnifies or “potentiates” their effects.</li>
            <li>’s super efficient</li>
            <li>smooth n soft almost out and time for more</li>
            <li>Obviously, if that will solve my problem, it will have to be more potent.</li>
            <li>Getting mild arthritis in my fingers.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a toothache, I put it on the side of my jaw and was amazed at how quickly it cleared up.</li>
            <li>It takes care of my iliotibial band pain without the dreaded DMSO smell &amp; acts quickly.</li>
            <li>I figured a cream was going to be most appealing for her since it could be easily measured and familiar to the average person who is used to allopathic cures.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are no other ingredients listed (that I could find) as to the nature of the rose fragrance or the aloe cream.</li>
            <li>may be ok, but a week of intense itching kind of outweighs any possible benefits.</li>
            <li>Brings swelling down and  also pain level is greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>It has a very creamy texture and is easily applied.</li>
            <li>Am now able to go about&lt;br /&gt;exercising and stretching with more ease whereas before using the Cream, had limited flexibility&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>DMSO easily penetrates the skin and brings along impurities and other substances that may be hazardous to health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rose sent was just what had been looking for to use daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shared this product with several of my friends who have pain from acute injuries and arthritis.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth trying out.</li>
            <li>It was instant relief and the Rose scent is a plus</li>
            <li>It does seem to work better on soft tissue than on bone pain.</li>
            <li>Does not smell like roses, smells more like the old fashioned Noxema.</li>
            <li>seen sooner results had it been applied more frequently.  </li>
            <li>This formulation of DMSO is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind of dmso I buy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and mix tiny amounts in with other ingredients to make my own moisturizer that works almost like magic.</li>
            <li>Long time favorite!</li>
            <li>The price is right at Amazon,</li>
            <li>But it worked right away for aches and pains.  </li>
            <li>Well, I am sure this company has great intentions, but after reading up on DMSO, I discovered that it&#x27;s not a good idea to have other &#x27;carriers&#x27; like rose fragrance and aloe vera lotion combined with DMSO.</li>
            <li>It fixed places on my face that were becoming bothersome.</li>
            <li>This is an easy to use product for those that are not as familiar with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Works like a great pain  reliever for topical discomfort such as sore muscles or arthritis.  </li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t live without this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>it is helping the pain in my leg very much..</li>
            <li>think this is a good dmso  starter product, if you want to try it but are a little nervous about it.  </li>
            <li>I think it might be too strong to use alone, but mixed with coconut lotion, Vit E lotion, Aloe Vera gel and lotion, etc, it makes a super skin healer and wrinkle remover.</li>
            <li>I just love simple remedies!</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because each time I used it people would make comments about a funny smell when I walked in the room.</li>
            <li>For me, it really seems to be worth the price paid.</li>
            <li>First timer with this product.</li>
            <li>Finally, something that was able to take the edge off my nerve pain.  </li>
            <li>I tried it first on my thumb</li>
            <li>The scent is ok, and I get the aftertaste in my mouth for several hours.</li>
            <li>I felt a noticeable difference the first time I used the DMSO cream.</li>
            <li>I used this consistently for over a month, three to four times a day.</li>
            <li>I had been using a DMSO roll-on, but this seems to work better, especially on the arthritis in my neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li>and I have only had it for about 5 days, but it sure has taken the edge off of my pain problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ok, this stuff works, I uses in on my back neck shoulders..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy some more in the future when I run out.</li>
            <li>is LIKELY SAFE when used as a prescription medication.</li>
            <li>Did exactly what I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li>this stuff works better than anything I ever used, I got my life  back.  </li>
            <li>Years ago I used dmso on bursitis in the left shoulder and it alleviated the pain within hours.</li>
            <li>Bought for a friend, exactly as described...</li>
            <li>Will make sure my next purchase is.</li>
            <li>First time user.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>love the stuff, on my second container.</li>
            <li>Had results the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>I really like my DMSO!</li>
            <li>Phenomenal results for my lower back pain.</li>
            <li>This cream has a pleasant smell and this is a big plus for me because most scents I do not enjoy!  </li>
            <li>Works great as a soothing massage cream, or in combination with other topical over-the-counter pain relieving creams.  </li>
            <li>So far it seems to take away the itching a lot &amp; has no bad odor at all.  </li>
            <li>Absorbine Jr and icy Hot are better.</li>
            <li>Helps control dry scaly skin makes it appear more youthful</li>
            <li>good size jar,should last a long time.</li>
            <li>pleasant smell and seems to be helping slowly with pain and stiffness in joints.  </li>
            <li>but I would certainly suggest  trying it if you have joint or muscle pain.  </li>
            <li>It certainly did not help my tennis elbow.</li>
            <li>Much safer and pure.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is nice and strong enough to cover up any other icky smell that the dmso might have.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t smell as much  </li>
            <li>I have used DMSO for sometime and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>really loves the cream, she has recommended it to her friends and coworkers and they have all ordered some too.</li>
            <li>It is working very well on a pulled muscle</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I had so much pain in my elbow.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Cream really does help to reduce nerve and arthritis pain.  </li>
            <li>Really does help to take the edge off chronic pain.</li>
            <li>I really do like this cream.  </li>
            <li>IT REALLY HELPS WITH RELIEF FOR ARTHRITIS PAIN.</li>
            <li>I did not use it much.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make you smelly like liquid DMSO and it is very soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li>Cream worked better than expected my wife loves it.</li>
            <li>It really helps my arthritic shoulder although the DSMO does not seem</li>
            <li>Whether the DMSO is responsible there&#x27;s no way to know.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well for relieving my foot pain.</li>
            <li>It does work but not as well as the straight undiluted version.  </li>
            <li>According to WebMD:  It&#x27;s important to note that DMSO is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li>THIS REALLY DIDN&#x27;T DO IT FOR ME, BUT GET YOUR HANDS ON SOME ABSORBINE JR  VETERNARIAN LINEMENT, COMES IN A SPRAY OR GEL</li>
            <li>, it really does help..</li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>Whoever gets the eventual cold sore will be very happy to have this in his cabinet.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>, it works fast.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>intense pain</li>
            <li>this product shipped fast which I appreciated.</li>
            <li>Very emollient and absorbent into the skin.</li>
            <li>product has reduced dependence on nsaids by 90%  absolutely takes the edge off.  </li>
            <li>I rub it in very well and leave it on as I dress.  </li>
            <li>and I get pain relief fast.</li>
            <li>Fast ship,good product</li>
            <li>My pain was so intense that I had and MRI done</li>
            <li>I am ordering 3 more for other relatives.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think it worked, but then I used a little more of the product and boy</li>
            <li>It clearly states on the back of the label that it is intended for use as a solvent only and that it is unlawful to represent in any way that that this product is useful or safe to use for medicinal purposes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, and it works well enough that I continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT!</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect instant results if you&#x27;re pain has been chronic (more than a short period of time).</li>
            <li>I have not used it enough to give adequate feedback.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend product and vendor, worked well for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Now I have  added other rose dented products to use daily.</li>
            <li>The order went smoothly and received product at expected date.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still need to get surgery though since my scar adhesions are so thick they won&#x27;t go away on their own.</li>
            <li>DMSO has a low toxicity rating and may very well be a “miracle” pain reliever and have many other beneficial uses, but its biggest plus is also its biggest minus—</li>
            <li>This is a new product for me</li>
            <li>All said I either had to have surgery or live with the pain.  </li>
            <li>Very fast service and the cream helped the pain in his back.</li>
            <li>It definitely smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Works well so far!  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I take a dry towel and wipe off any that hasn&#x27;t been absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my sister who suffers shoulder pain and at 85 doesn&#x27;t want to brave another surgery to replace her shoulder joint.  </li>
            <li>Forgot to mention - completely healed my shoulder...</li>
            <li>It is an old time remedy and surpasses all the drugs on the market for relief of muscular and joint pain</li>
            <li>This can be beneficial in some situations, but potentially very harmful in others, and that’s likely why the research on DMSO is so contradictory.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives her some relief; how much relief depends on a variety of factors, especially the weather.  </li>
            <li>This cream has indeed a pleasant scent and, as previous reviews have stated, seems to penetrate deeply, carrying previous medications with it.</li>
            <li>I am still in the experimental stages for the purposes that I am using it.</li>
            <li>this product seems to help my arthritic hands a bunch, so i rub it into my hands nearly every night</li>
            <li>please make this is a bigger economic size</li>
            <li>She is 82 years old and has knee pains.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use products that are not prescribed by your health professional.</li>
            <li>So far, no garlic taste in my mouth either.</li>
            <li>this is my second order of this stuff, it really helps and I do not have to take pills.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural solvent and carries everything else with it directly into the blood stream.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to DMSO, but this compound seems to take the sting our of it.  </li>
            <li>I used the cream for seven days and the pain completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>What I hate about this stuff is that every time we show someone how great it is, they wind up going home with our jar!  </li>
            <li>Hurt my back and when I have my wife rub this on my back, it takes the pain right away.  </li>
            <li>The reaction was most unpleasant and the rose scent was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>the price is right, you don&#x27;t have to use much of it; making a jar last three or four times as long as a Blue Emu or Australian Dream.</li>
            <li>Seems to calm it down</li>
            <li>Any impurities or toxins present will be carried directly into the bloodstream.</li>
            <li>I was somewhat skeptical to try DMSO and chose the one with rose scent.</li>
            <li>for my frozen shoulder, nothing really helped (I tried a LOT of stuff), until I received a cortisone shot which allowed me to finally get some decent sleep (on my back and other arm&#x27;s side).</li>
            <li>The healing potential is profound.  </li>
            <li>Great product without the usual awful smell :)</li>
            <li>Have experienced painful piriformis muscle pain in buttock area, tried physiotherapy, muscle relaxants&lt;br /&gt;massage therapy and over the counter pain meds with limited to no relief.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;60 Minute segment on DMSO, doing research and reading reviews both good and bad, decided to&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any effects, good or bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The scent is pleasant without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It is truly amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li> I am happy that it was available to buy online.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> The lotion feels nice and does indeed have a therapeutic effect.</li>
            <li> This rose</li>
            <li> A friend of mine&#x27;s family raised race horses and she told me they used to get it for the horses and used it for their own aches and pains.  </li>
            <li> real;y did not have a rose scent not unpleasent but just did not like the scent</li>
            <li> Amusing product.</li>
            <li> Works and feels nice.</li>
            <li> The smell is stong rose scent.</li>
            <li> So why do you add aloe vera or rose scent to a solvent?</li>
            <li> I read that this stuff can be effective in relieving the swelling/pain.  </li>
            <li> The Aloe Vera with the Rose Scent does not burn me like the reg DMSO does.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream DMSO.</li>
            <li> But it is nice.</li>
            <li> I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of metallic tasting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like to mix it with the aloe version which reduces the chemical smell of the aloe version and reduces the overpowering rose scent of this version.</li>
            <li> Nice creamy texture</li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> The 70% solution does an effective job without skin irritation.</li>
            <li> The rose smell got cloying too.  </li>
            <li> cool stuff  great shipper</li>
            <li> Smells good and easy to rub into skin.</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs quickly, and I&#x27;ve experienced none of the itching that sometimes occurs with liquid formulas.</li>
            <li> Especially nice is the rose scented formula with aloe vera - much better than it&#x27;s natural scent.</li>
            <li> and I just love the rose scented DMSO, I use it for just about everything.</li>
            <li> my favorite ointment for sore knees and hands, smells nice, and helps a lot</li>
            <li> It kind of powder rose smell that reminds me of cheap purfume.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping for this amazing product which I use for my arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> A bit strong on the rose.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I add NSAID pain creme on top.</li>
            <li> Have used DMSO for years, the rose fragrance is light doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> this stuff has given her more relief than anything I&#x27;ve seen before.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many aches and pains</li>
            <li> As a rule, I test products applied to my skin and so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough of how impressed I am with this product.  </li>
            <li> and I have not been able to do that for 4 months</li>
            <li> and I am able to function.</li>
            <li> And I always feel better soon after or when I wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s potent.</li>
            <li> It alleviated my frozen shoulder pains somewhat when I slept, but it also caused headaches so I had to return it.</li>
            <li> This cream appears to be working as well or better than many of the prescription creams my wife needs for her psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Works better than prescription meds for pain.</li>
            <li> I love the smell keeps the skin</li>
            <li> This cream has Aloe Vera in it which I love</li>
            <li> Maybe gel is better.  </li>
            <li> That ones ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this...</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, it truly works miracles on aching shoulders!  </li>
            <li> and I was not quite sure how that was going to affect the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I have used it before and is satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> and I think that the recommended strength of 70% probably works even better.  </li>
            <li> I had to smear a lot more on my knees before I could taste anything.  </li>
            <li> and I am able to survive the day.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to read and educate yourself before using any product.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, and have been using it for years for all kinds of pain.  </li>
            <li> Works even better with Bengay.</li>
            <li> Most relief I have had.</li>
            <li> I think it is helping me since I started it, I feel so much better,</li>
            <li> Only two days of using this product and I am impressed!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I guess, as I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> I will try to update review when I have more knowledge.</li>
            <li> And everyone likes the smell, had no garlic scent anywhere so love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It is better than any sports cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> We tried the cream and it helped soooo much!!!!</li>
            <li> I have heard great things regarding this substance and I have high hopes of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast effect, easy to use</li>
            <li> The Rose Scented version is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Works quickly and is a nice cream</li>
            <li> It works well and is odorless except for the mild Rose scent.</li>
            <li> also love the fragarance; rose being my favorite flower, so that has won me over first.  </li>
            <li> I love to rub it into sore areas at night and sleep comfortably all night because of the relief of this ointment.  </li>
            <li> really works it smells good</li>
            <li> That is mostly true - the Rose scent is quite strong and the product applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I have not been able to do this for going on 4 months, it hurt when I mopped or swept as I clean for a living.  </li>
            <li> the DMSO Cream with Aloe Vera Rose Scented rather than the straight liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Am pleased to report that the Cream worked well for me after 6 days of nightime use,</li>
            <li> LIKE THE SMELL, BUT DOESN&#x27;T SEEM AS STRONG AS THE GEL OR ROLLON.</li>
            <li> Right now I feel that this product is better than F/S, so I am glad to have resolved this issue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First of all a product that can penetrate a cell wall is amazing.  </li>
            <li> To me it smells more like Noxzema than roses, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> In fact, I love the light clean scent of this cream.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much, I am quite happy with my item.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to know some of these companies actually know their products very satisfied</li>
            <li> Secondly, the mixture of aloe and dmso along with the rose oil producing a very healthy nourishment for your cells along with a palatable aroma.</li>
            <li> A fine product.</li>
            <li> was using a product that a friend gave me and was pleased with it, so when I could not get it any more this seemed the logical way&lt;</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is non greasy!</li>
            <li> (make sure you read up on clean hands, clean skin and why) for reducing inflammation and pain.  </li>
            <li> Also great for shoulder, back, neck, and knee pain.</li>
            <li> It is unlawful to represent in any way that this product is useful or safe to use for medicinal purposes.</li>
            <li> My skin is silky smooth when I use this.</li>
            <li> Such a great find.</li>
            <li> Only experienced the sulphur taste on 3&lt;br /&gt;occasions</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t really care for the rose scent and it does not work as well at the unsented gel</li>
            <li> I have issues with my legs and get leg cramps, works great and especially at night.</li>
            <li> Not only is this cream good for pain due to inflammation but it is at its best for any type of burn including sunburn.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t now what I tore, but it doesn&#x27;t even matter now :) I do use the full strength DMSO for acute issues, but for daily use, this is better</li>
            <li> A word of caution when using this product,  make sure your hands are clean when applying this product as anything on them will be absorbed with the dmso into your skin.  </li>
            <li> Good price, easy package to open, smell is not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Some what effective without the normal DMSO odor.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders- first morning after using cream the day before was much better.  </li>
            <li> through-the-skin delivery means that it has to be extremely pure to be safe.</li>
            <li> but I now know I need pure DMSO in order to make an educated decision on whether DMSO works or not, in my situation that is:)</li>
            <li> A true miracle cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural remedy kind of person, I loathe pharmaceuticals.</li>
            <li> Use twice a day and make sure to wash wherever you put it as it is a solvent and will dissolve anything already there and move it straight into your body.  </li>
            <li> It has worked very well on my Achilles tendon, as a matter of fact better than my prescription cream.</li>
            <li> In fact,  this product made my skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended this brand to several friends who have also gotten good results.</li>
            <li> Its not bad at all.</li>
            <li> No bad after taste that people warned me about.</li>
            <li> it quickly and super-effectively delivers substances through the skin and into the bloodstream, and magnifies or “potentiates” their effects.</li>
            <li> ’s super efficient</li>
            <li> smooth n soft almost out and time for more</li>
            <li> Obviously, if that will solve my problem, it will have to be more potent.</li>
            <li> Getting mild arthritis in my fingers.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a toothache, I put it on the side of my jaw and was amazed at how quickly it cleared up.</li>
            <li> It takes care of my iliotibial band pain without the dreaded DMSO smell &amp; acts quickly.</li>
            <li> I figured a cream was going to be most appealing for her since it could be easily measured and familiar to the average person who is used to allopathic cures.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are no other ingredients listed (that I could find) as to the nature of the rose fragrance or the aloe cream.</li>
            <li> may be ok, but a week of intense itching kind of outweighs any possible benefits.</li>
            <li> Brings swelling down and  also pain level is greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> It has a very creamy texture and is easily applied.</li>
            <li> Am now able to go about&lt;br /&gt;exercising and stretching with more ease whereas before using the Cream, had limited flexibility&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> DMSO easily penetrates the skin and brings along impurities and other substances that may be hazardous to health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rose sent was just what had been looking for to use daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shared this product with several of my friends who have pain from acute injuries and arthritis.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth trying out.</li>
            <li> It was instant relief and the Rose scent is a plus</li>
            <li> It does seem to work better on soft tissue than on bone pain.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like roses, smells more like the old fashioned Noxema.</li>
            <li> seen sooner results had it been applied more frequently.  </li>
            <li> This formulation of DMSO is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only kind of dmso I buy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and mix tiny amounts in with other ingredients to make my own moisturizer that works almost like magic.</li>
            <li> Long time favorite!</li>
            <li> The price is right at Amazon,</li>
            <li> But it worked right away for aches and pains.  </li>
            <li> Well, I am sure this company has great intentions, but after reading up on DMSO, I discovered that it&#x27;s not a good idea to have other &#x27;carriers&#x27; like rose fragrance and aloe vera lotion combined with DMSO.</li>
            <li> It fixed places on my face that were becoming bothersome.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use product for those that are not as familiar with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Works like a great pain  reliever for topical discomfort such as sore muscles or arthritis.  </li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t live without this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> it is helping the pain in my leg very much..</li>
            <li> think this is a good dmso  starter product, if you want to try it but are a little nervous about it.  </li>
            <li> I think it might be too strong to use alone, but mixed with coconut lotion, Vit E lotion, Aloe Vera gel and lotion, etc, it makes a super skin healer and wrinkle remover.</li>
            <li> I just love simple remedies!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because each time I used it people would make comments about a funny smell when I walked in the room.</li>
            <li> For me, it really seems to be worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> First timer with this product.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that was able to take the edge off my nerve pain.  </li>
            <li> I tried it first on my thumb</li>
            <li> The scent is ok, and I get the aftertaste in my mouth for several hours.</li>
            <li> I felt a noticeable difference the first time I used the DMSO cream.</li>
            <li> I used this consistently for over a month, three to four times a day.</li>
            <li> I had been using a DMSO roll-on, but this seems to work better, especially on the arthritis in my neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> and I have only had it for about 5 days, but it sure has taken the edge off of my pain problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ok, this stuff works, I uses in on my back neck shoulders..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy some more in the future when I run out.</li>
            <li> is LIKELY SAFE when used as a prescription medication.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li> this stuff works better than anything I ever used, I got my life  back.  </li>
            <li> Years ago I used dmso on bursitis in the left shoulder and it alleviated the pain within hours.</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend, exactly as described...</li>
            <li> Will make sure my next purchase is.</li>
            <li> First time user.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> love the stuff, on my second container.</li>
            <li> Had results the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> I really like my DMSO!</li>
            <li> Phenomenal results for my lower back pain.</li>
            <li> This cream has a pleasant smell and this is a big plus for me because most scents I do not enjoy!  </li>
            <li> Works great as a soothing massage cream, or in combination with other topical over-the-counter pain relieving creams.  </li>
            <li> So far it seems to take away the itching a lot &amp; has no bad odor at all.  </li>
            <li> Absorbine Jr and icy Hot are better.</li>
            <li> Helps control dry scaly skin makes it appear more youthful</li>
            <li> good size jar,should last a long time.</li>
            <li> pleasant smell and seems to be helping slowly with pain and stiffness in joints.  </li>
            <li> but I would certainly suggest  trying it if you have joint or muscle pain.  </li>
            <li> It certainly did not help my tennis elbow.</li>
            <li> Much safer and pure.</li>
            <li> The rose scent is nice and strong enough to cover up any other icky smell that the dmso might have.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t smell as much  </li>
            <li> I have used DMSO for sometime and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> really loves the cream, she has recommended it to her friends and coworkers and they have all ordered some too.</li>
            <li> It is working very well on a pulled muscle</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I had so much pain in my elbow.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Cream really does help to reduce nerve and arthritis pain.  </li>
            <li> Really does help to take the edge off chronic pain.</li>
            <li> I really do like this cream.  </li>
            <li> IT REALLY HELPS WITH RELIEF FOR ARTHRITIS PAIN.</li>
            <li> I did not use it much.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you smelly like liquid DMSO and it is very soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li> Cream worked better than expected my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> It really helps my arthritic shoulder although the DSMO does not seem</li>
            <li> Whether the DMSO is responsible there&#x27;s no way to know.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well for relieving my foot pain.</li>
            <li> It does work but not as well as the straight undiluted version.  </li>
            <li> According to WebMD:  It&#x27;s important to note that DMSO is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> THIS REALLY DIDN&#x27;T DO IT FOR ME, BUT GET YOUR HANDS ON SOME ABSORBINE JR  VETERNARIAN LINEMENT, COMES IN A SPRAY OR GEL</li>
            <li> , it really does help..</li>
            <li> It really does work</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Whoever gets the eventual cold sore will be very happy to have this in his cabinet.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> , it works fast.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> intense pain</li>
            <li> this product shipped fast which I appreciated.</li>
            <li> Very emollient and absorbent into the skin.</li>
            <li> product has reduced dependence on nsaids by 90%  absolutely takes the edge off.  </li>
            <li> I rub it in very well and leave it on as I dress.  </li>
            <li> and I get pain relief fast.</li>
            <li> Fast ship,good product</li>
            <li> My pain was so intense that I had and MRI done</li>
            <li> I am ordering 3 more for other relatives.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think it worked, but then I used a little more of the product and boy</li>
            <li> It clearly states on the back of the label that it is intended for use as a solvent only and that it is unlawful to represent in any way that that this product is useful or safe to use for medicinal purposes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, and it works well enough that I continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect instant results if you&#x27;re pain has been chronic (more than a short period of time).</li>
            <li> I have not used it enough to give adequate feedback.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend product and vendor, worked well for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Now I have  added other rose dented products to use daily.</li>
            <li> The order went smoothly and received product at expected date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still need to get surgery though since my scar adhesions are so thick they won&#x27;t go away on their own.</li>
            <li> DMSO has a low toxicity rating and may very well be a “miracle” pain reliever and have many other beneficial uses, but its biggest plus is also its biggest minus—</li>
            <li> This is a new product for me</li>
            <li> All said I either had to have surgery or live with the pain.  </li>
            <li> Very fast service and the cream helped the pain in his back.</li>
            <li> It definitely smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Works well so far!  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I take a dry towel and wipe off any that hasn&#x27;t been absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister who suffers shoulder pain and at 85 doesn&#x27;t want to brave another surgery to replace her shoulder joint.  </li>
            <li> Forgot to mention - completely healed my shoulder...</li>
            <li> It is an old time remedy and surpasses all the drugs on the market for relief of muscular and joint pain</li>
            <li> This can be beneficial in some situations, but potentially very harmful in others, and that’s likely why the research on DMSO is so contradictory.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives her some relief; how much relief depends on a variety of factors, especially the weather.  </li>
            <li> This cream has indeed a pleasant scent and, as previous reviews have stated, seems to penetrate deeply, carrying previous medications with it.</li>
            <li> I am still in the experimental stages for the purposes that I am using it.</li>
            <li> this product seems to help my arthritic hands a bunch, so i rub it into my hands nearly every night</li>
            <li> please make this is a bigger economic size</li>
            <li> She is 82 years old and has knee pains.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use products that are not prescribed by your health professional.</li>
            <li> So far, no garlic taste in my mouth either.</li>
            <li> this is my second order of this stuff, it really helps and I do not have to take pills.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural solvent and carries everything else with it directly into the blood stream.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to DMSO, but this compound seems to take the sting our of it.  </li>
            <li> I used the cream for seven days and the pain completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> What I hate about this stuff is that every time we show someone how great it is, they wind up going home with our jar!  </li>
            <li> Hurt my back and when I have my wife rub this on my back, it takes the pain right away.  </li>
            <li> The reaction was most unpleasant and the rose scent was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> the price is right, you don&#x27;t have to use much of it; making a jar last three or four times as long as a Blue Emu or Australian Dream.</li>
            <li> Seems to calm it down</li>
            <li> Any impurities or toxins present will be carried directly into the bloodstream.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical to try DMSO and chose the one with rose scent.</li>
            <li> for my frozen shoulder, nothing really helped (I tried a LOT of stuff), until I received a cortisone shot which allowed me to finally get some decent sleep (on my back and other arm&#x27;s side).</li>
            <li> The healing potential is profound.  </li>
            <li> Great product without the usual awful smell :)</li>
            <li> Have experienced painful piriformis muscle pain in buttock area, tried physiotherapy, muscle relaxants&lt;br /&gt;massage therapy and over the counter pain meds with limited to no relief.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;60 Minute segment on DMSO, doing research and reading reviews both good and bad, decided to&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any effects, good or bad.</li>
            <li> It is essential for anyone who works out regularly and gets minor muscle strains and pain.  </li>
            <li> The choice of the other process used in the various applications in the sole responsibility of the user.</li>
            <li> This made it different from other similar  creams</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would help with inflammation, but at least in my case I did not see or feel any difference.  </li>
            <li> The product, allegedly, has the misfortune of causing one to small like garlic, immediately and intensely.</li>
            <li> Have not used it long, nevertheless it seems to help.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t always remember to apply 2x a day because the pain is so minor</li>
            <li> I expected- Only 70%.</li>
            <li> Will use this long term.</li>
            <li> Need to let the cream dry.  </li>
            <li> This is probably less likely to cause irritation.</li>
            <li> : 77-90% DMSO is typically applied under medical supervision every 3-8 hours for 10-14 days.&lt;br /&gt;For shingles (herpes zoster):</li>
            <li> She only puts it on every other day or so, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and then a few minutes later you will taste it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Drinking water does not really help -</li>
            <li> the next day it was dead - we raise whitetail deer.</li>
            <li> My order came sooner than expected</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, DMSO readily penetrates the skin, so it carries these impurities rapidly into the body.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both products were as expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers say that this product avoids the DMSO smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps my need is not as severe as other Reviewers.</li>
            <li> /joint where I have been having extreme pain</li>
            <li> I can twirl my thumb in a circle and bend it with my other hand</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s NOT a hot menthal cream.  </li>
            <li> I use this product with others because it has the ability to help absorbsion  of other medicines into the skin.  </li>
            <li> DMSO IS AN AGENT TO HELP TRANSFER  OTHER MEDICINE.  </li>
            <li> This arrived days before it was expected!</li>
            <li> I used it on burns or any other skin problem and it seems to sooth the area and heal whatever the issue is.</li>
            <li> DMSO has been a lifesaver for severe pain in my hips due to bursitis.  </li>
            <li> and when I work I have to be very careful of how I hold it and use it</li>
            <li> I thought this would smell better but after using it a few days, a bad chemical odor began to annoy me.  </li>
            <li> We bought this when insurance wouldn&#x27;t pay for a prescription product after considering horse liniment at the feed store that also contains DMSO, the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on sour muscles loves the product.</li>
            <li> I used to use DMSO 35 years ago, when it was undiluted, did not smell good and caused a nasty taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> She noticed less and less pain, she said it reduced her pain from severe-keeping her from moving-to a slight ache.</li>
            <li> Less stinging with this than with the gel.  </li>
            <li> My forearm hurts a bit less than it did when I started using the cream.</li>
            <li> Diagnosis was that I have bulging discs, arthritis and some slight stenosis but not yet a candidate for surgery.</li>
            <li> He suffers from neck pain and finds DMSO to work very well!</li>
            <li> The pain and stiffness was cut down by half!  </li>
            <li> I could not live without this product as I use it at least 2-3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to take effect but is helpful.</li>
            <li> The 30% strength takes the edge off the pain in my knuckles,  and when this is gone,  I&#x27;m going to try something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> AT AMAZON, A LITTLE CHEAPER</li>
            <li> Like this but after reading am a little concerned because it is not pharmaceutical grade.</li>
            <li> It did burn a little but then burning sensation faded.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> My husband rubs this in firmly</li>
            <li> Ive been using this everyday and its helping the joints and tendons.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> apply it at night a few hours before bed</li>
            <li> she is 63 and pretty tough, use to having to do things herself unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It is not a strong but it eresembles a perm with flowers.</li>
            <li> My husband used it for a painful back and big toe and reported it worked well.</li>
            <li> The small is swept.</li>
            <li> No more pain.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I was skeptical, but I tried it on my recently injured knee, leg strain.  </li>
            <li> not sure if did serve it purpose.</li>
            <li> Really unbelievable.</li>
            <li> If so the effect is small and slow.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get moving.  </li>
            <li> complaint is the sulfur taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I am not particularly a rose fan, but the scent is needed to cover up the dmso smell.</li>
            <li> The relief is almost immediate and lasted at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Cream is thick.</li>
            <li> Faintly floral but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my husband who was having leg pains behind his knee.</li>
            <li> The promo for this product implies that this is somehow decreased in their concoction, but that is another reason I haven&#x27;t applied it.</li>
            <li> It does not have the bad smell that some of the other DMSO products have.</li>
            <li> but I did notice a bad taste in my mouth and a slight amount of nausea.</li>
            <li> And some of the prescription creams are outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> I have terrible pain with Lyme disease, especially in my hands.</li>
            <li> The scary warnings plastered all over kept me from applying it.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m sad to say no relief at all.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> but I twisted my knee the other day and the pain was terrible.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is supposed to work on a lot of things including cold sores.</li>
            <li> So I am afraid to use this product.</li>
            <li> It works for very difficult muscle and joint pain.  </li>
            <li> I have bad knees.</li>
            <li> and I get really bad pain</li>
            <li> Both of us have bad shoulders and find that this takes the edge off the pain.  </li>
            <li> Smells bad did not help with pain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the product or the seller.</li>
            <li> and it said very dangerous to use this cream!  </li>
            <li> Rather than watch her take horrible pain meds, I ordered dmso.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Has given great relief for the pain and swelling in palm of hand. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Works great will buy again</li>
            <li> A true miracle cream. I have multiple chronic illness that cause nerve pain, joint pain, and abdominal pain. This makes the pain go away. When I have over exertion pain this helps me keep working. Also great for shoulder, back, neck, and knee pain. Sometimes I add NSAID pain creme on top. Sometimes the DMSO is enough. This is the only thing that works for my severe pain. No side effects like pain pills.</li>
            <li> received fast...all good!),</li>
            <li> Have used DMSO for years, the rose fragrance is light doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this! I have bad knees. This works great.  The rose sent was just what had been looking for to use daily. Now I have  added other rose dented products to use daily.</li>
            <li> may be ok, but a week of intense itching kind of outweighs any possible benefits.</li>
            <li> Godsend for my MIL&#x27;s arthritis.  We were about to put her on Humera type meds...this stuff has given her more relief than anything I&#x27;ve seen before.  She is actually smiling and sitting up in bed and laughing. It is MAGIC!  Forgot to mention - completely healed my shoulder...don&#x27;t now what I tore, but it doesn&#x27;t even matter now :) I do use the full strength DMSO for acute issues, but for daily use, this is better so you don&#x27;t smell as much  I recommend this to everyone I know - and everyone I know gets similar results - why aren&#x27;t people screaming about this stuff from the rooftops????</li>
            <li> I have used DMSO for sometime and it works very well.  It is an old time remedy and surpasses all the drugs on the market for relief of muscular and joint pain</li>
            <li> This is the only way my husband will use DMSO.  Great product without the usual awful smell :)</li>
            <li> On time delivery and well packaged. Have not used it long, nevertheless it seems to help. It has a very nice smell.</li>
            <li> know using it no info as yep</li>
            <li> Product description that is not shown on the picture: This product is intended for use as a solvent only. The choice of the other process used in the various applications in the sole responsibility of the user. It is unlawful to represent in any way that this product is useful or safe to use for medicinal purposes.</li>
            <li> Very fast service and the cream helped the pain in his back.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers say that this product avoids the DMSO smell.  That is mostly true - the Rose scent is quite strong and the product applies smoothly.  A little goes a long way.  The lotion feels nice and does indeed have a therapeutic effect. However, in order to get the desired results, you do need to apply it liberally to the affected area...and then a few minutes later you will taste it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is the sulfur taste in my mouth.  All DMSO products enter the body through the skin and shortly after application I experience a low-grade nausea and sulfur taste that lasts quite awhile.  Drinking water does not really help - it just needs to be assimilated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps my need is not as severe as other Reviewers. In my experience &amp;#34;Penetrex&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Pain Block&amp;#34; provide similar relief with no side effects.</li>
            <li> Have used DMSO since the 1980&#x27;s when the only way to get it was to purchase from hardware store as a solvent.  It is the BEST treatment for aches and pains of any nature.  Especially nice is the rose scented formula with aloe vera - much better than it&#x27;s natural scent.</li>
            <li> On time delivery. Good smell.</li>
            <li> DMSO has a low toxicity rating and may very well be a “miracle” pain reliever and have many other beneficial uses, but its biggest plus is also its biggest minus—it quickly and super-effectively delivers substances through the skin and into the bloodstream, and magnifies or “potentiates” their effects. This can be beneficial in some situations, but potentially very harmful in others, and that’s likely why the research on DMSO is so contradictory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DMSO’s super efficient through-the-skin delivery means that it has to be extremely pure to be safe. Any impurities or toxins present will be carried directly into the bloodstream. In addition, substances already on the skin when DMSO is applied, such as body lotions, will be carried into the blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More at  virginiahopkinstestkits.com/dmsorisks.  html</li>
            <li> As always, a great product.  I&#x27;ve tried the gel and it irritates my skin.  This rose scented cream is the best option for me.  I am not particularly a rose fan, but the scent is needed to cover up the dmso smell.</li>
            <li> it iis a very good cream.</li>
            <li> Some what effective without the normal DMSO odor.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom when she was complaining about severe hip pain from all the moving boxes she was carrying up her stairs...she is 63 and pretty tough, use to having to do things herself unfortunately. She went in for an adjustment but was still in pain. Rather than watch her take horrible pain meds, I ordered dmso. I&#x27;m a natural remedy kind of person, I loathe pharmaceuticals. I figured a cream was going to be most appealing for her since it could be easily measured and familiar to the average person who is used to allopathic cures.&lt;br /&gt;She started using this dmso cream, putting it on in the evenings before bed, then again in the mornings. She noticed less and less pain, she said it reduced her pain from severe-keeping her from moving-to a slight ache. She doesn&#x27;t always remember to apply 2x a day because the pain is so minor she forgets.&lt;br /&gt;She really loves the cream, she has recommended it to her friends and coworkers and they have all ordered some too. I just love simple remedies!</li>
            <li> Amazed at the different uses this item has!</li>
            <li> It is working very well on a pulled muscle</li>
            <li> Works great.  A friend of mine&#x27;s family raised race horses and she told me they used to get it for the horses and used it for their own aches and pains.  She said her husband and father only used this for all sorts of pain.  So I decided to try it when I saw if here on Amazon.  Actually, I was purchasing something else when i saw it and decided to order it also.  It is great.  I don&#x27;t have many aches and pains but I twisted my knee the other day and the pain was terrible.  In a couple of day, it was gone.  I used it in the morning and evening only.</li>
            <li> Helps with the tendinitis in my wrist.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to take effect but is helpful.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister who suffers shoulder pain and at 85 doesn&#x27;t want to brave another surgery to replace her shoulder joint.  It gives her some relief; how much relief depends on a variety of factors, especially the weather.  DMSO was an ingredient her nurse practitioner suggested.  We bought this when insurance wouldn&#x27;t pay for a prescription product after considering horse liniment at the feed store that also contains DMSO, the active ingredient. This is probably less likely to cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I had to wait three weeks for another product to use with this for purpose of the treatment.  As a rule, I test products applied to my skin and so glad I did.  The reaction was most unpleasant and the rose scent was not what I expected.  I would like to return this product.  Please inform me of the process.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It helps with all my aches and pains.</li>
            <li> Smells good and easy to rub into skin. It comes with disclaimer to label of no medical value, but it has seemed to lessen some of the  stiffness in my knee. As it has not cause any harm, no rash or itchiness, I&#x27;ll keep  using it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on sour muscles loves the product.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gift always provides the highest quality DMSO products and there&#x27;s no exception here.</li>
            <li> Good price, easy package to open, smell is not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought it, but never used it!  I read somewhere and it said very dangerous to use this cream!  So, I decided to just skip it!</li>
            <li> I swear it helps my sore knee! Would recommend to others. Gave to a friend with back pain, and she said it helped her too.</li>
            <li> I ordered DMSO for for father. He suffers from neck pain and finds DMSO to work very well!</li>
            <li> My skin is silky smooth when I use this. I stopped using it because each time I used it people would make comments about a funny smell when I walked in the room.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the additional aloe vera!</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells good</li>
            <li> I had so much pain in my elbow.  Had to get cortisone injections. Pain improved and then would come back.  It has been 1 year after using this product that I have been pain free!!!! Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This cream has indeed a pleasant scent and, as previous reviews have stated, seems to penetrate deeply, carrying previous medications with it. For me, it really seems to be worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> Only use Dmso,cream a few&lt;br /&gt;Times but  I can feel  a real&lt;br /&gt;Difference</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I am a massage therapist and use it on my hands too as they tend to lock up a lot.</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead if time, love it and in great position</li>
            <li> Cream is thick. It smells good and does what it is supposed. Arrived on time &amp; I&#x27;m happy with my purchase . Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get what you&#x27;re supposed to use it for?</li>
            <li> It works for joint pain.</li>
            <li> had no instructions,what reallysed for..had to look up what,why i bought it..i tried it..as for sore muscles, no order,stinging..feels good.don&#x27;t know how often to use...</li>
            <li> First timer with this product. I know that it&#x27;s penetrating since I can taste it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase..</li>
            <li> Finally, something that was able to take the edge off my nerve pain.  Cream really does help to reduce nerve and arthritis pain.  I&#x27;ve shared this product with several of my friends who have pain from acute injuries and arthritis. Everyone who&#x27;s tried it has purchased some. Really does help to take the edge off chronic pain.</li>
            <li> just started using it, and i can feel the pain easing up in my lower back</li>
            <li> I received it in a timely manner and I absolutely love this stuff.  I tried it first on my thumb/joint where I have been having extreme pain and when I work I have to be very careful of how I hold it and use it or I get a jolt of pain that hangs for some time.  I don&#x27;t know if it is tendon, joint, or nerve issues, but I am so impressed with DMSO cream as it took it almost away and I can flex and move my thumb now.  I have not been able to do this for going on 4 months, it hurt when I mopped or swept as I clean for a living.  I can&#x27;t say enough of how impressed I am with this product.  I can twirl my thumb in a circle and bend it with my other hand and I have not been able to do that for 4 months like I said.  Next I will be trying it on my jaw as I have TMJ issues and my neck where my C4&amp;C5 are slipped together and I get really bad pain and it goes into my jaw and causes headaches.  I also have fibromyalgia so I am looking forward to seeing if this will also help with some of the pain issues I have with that.</li>
            <li> I have already over a period of time ordered 6 jars of DMSO, 3 for me and 3 for my friend.  Both of us have bad shoulders and find that this takes the edge off the pain.  I do not want a shoulder replacement at my age and by using DMSO and a cortisone shot every 6 months and I am able to function.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. Great price and timely shipping.</li>
            <li> I really do like this cream.  A friend recommended it and it does work quite well.</li>
            <li> Smells bad did not help with pain.</li>
            <li> What I hate about this stuff is that every time we show someone how great it is, they wind up going home with our jar!  And I have to reorder.  And it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> Less stinging with this than with the gel.  Second order placed.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SERVICE AND PRODUCT. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS EXCELLENT FOR RELIEVING JOINT AND MUSCLE ACHES AND PAINS. IT REALLY HELPS WITH RELIEF FOR ARTHRITIS PAIN. I HAVE USED THIS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.THE ALOE VERA HELPS  THYE PRODUCT SMELL VERY NICE. IT DOES NOT BURN AND ITCH YOUR SKIN AS DOES THE GEL.  I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Still trying cream to see if it relieves symptoms of RA</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time.  This is great cream (make sure you read up on clean hands, clean skin and why) for reducing inflammation and pain.  My neck issues are chronic.  My husband rubs this in firmly and I can taste the DMSO within a minute.  And I always feel better soon after or when I wake up in the morning.  Great stuff.  No smell.</li>
            <li> It looks like it helps with pain of joint and nerve.  I did not use it much.  I plan to use it as when I need it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother&#x27;s arthritic knees. She swears that this product does miracles for her! She only puts it on every other day or so, and a little goes a long way. If my mother says it works then I believe in it; she says it works better than the expensive shots the dr. used to give her.</li>
            <li> Long time favorite! It doesn&#x27;t make you smelly like liquid DMSO and it is very soothing on the skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> Good for rapid healing</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and smells really nice. It has a very creamy texture and is easily applied.</li>
            <li> cool stuff  great shipper</li>
            <li> I suffer from RSD. This cream works well for the pain in my leg and foot. I apply and rub. I find myself carrying this with me every where I go. It is a great anti-inflammatory agent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and mix tiny amounts in with other ingredients to make my own moisturizer that works almost like magic. I think it might be too strong to use alone, but mixed with coconut lotion, Vit E lotion, Aloe Vera gel and lotion, etc, it makes a super skin healer and wrinkle remover.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would help with inflammation, but at least in my case I did not see or feel any difference.  I did give it a week.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soothing cream to calm shingles flare up.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will work for my facial pain/trigeminal neuralgia pain. The scent is ok, and I get the aftertaste in my mouth for several hours. I follow the directions---especially cleansing the area on my face before applying the cream and using disposable plastic gloves. Time will tell!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s potent. It alleviated my frozen shoulder pains somewhat when I slept, but it also caused headaches so I had to return it. This isn&#x27;t a knock against this product: I believe I just don&#x27;t get along with DMSO for me. just It may or may not do the same for you - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth trying out. It definitely smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my frozen shoulder, nothing really helped (I tried a LOT of stuff), until I received a cortisone shot which allowed me to finally get some decent sleep (on my back and other arm&#x27;s side). I&#x27;ll still need to get surgery though since my scar adhesions are so thick they won&#x27;t go away on their own.</li>
            <li> real;y did not have a rose scent not unpleasent but just did not like the scent</li>
            <li> This cream appears to be working as well or better than many of the prescription creams my wife needs for her psoriasis. And some of the prescription creams are outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for nerve and muscle pain.  Works quickly and is a nice cream, it&#x27;s NOT a hot menthal cream.  Works better than prescription meds for pain.</li>
            <li> good size jar,should last a long time. pleasant scent,cream goes on smoothly,not greasy and seems to help  my skin problems</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by someone who does alternative treatments for pain. She used this after the treatment. It works well and is odorless except for the mild Rose scent.</li>
            <li> Works like a great pain  reliever for topical discomfort such as sore muscles or arthritis.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This one is easier on the skin. Ive been using this everyday and its helping the joints and tendons.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it at night a few hours before bed so it drys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking this is a very good product. I am still in the experimental stages for the purposes that I am using it.</li>
            <li> Amusing product. It helps a lot with my pain in my knee</li>
            <li> I use this as a face cream - I used to use Oil of Olay until a fawn that I was feeding licked my face and the next day it was dead - we raise whitetail deer. I figured if it was that toxic I should not be using it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell keeps the skin smooth n soft almost out and time for more</li>
            <li> Not only is this cream good for pain due to inflammation but it is at its best for any type of burn including sunburn.  Used in conjunction with aloe it will relieve the pain almost instantly.  If put on sunburn promptly  it will lessen if not totally eliminate peeling.  I use this product with others because it has the ability to help absorbsion  of other medicines into the skin.  A word of caution when using this product,  make sure your hands are clean when applying this product as anything on them will be absorbed with the dmso into your skin.  I keep a jar of this in my medicine cabinet at all times and have been using it for years.  It is truly amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Bill Kailua Kona Hawaii</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me ! !</li>
            <li> LIKE THE SMELL, BUT DOESN&#x27;T SEEM AS STRONG AS THE GEL OR ROLLON.</li>
            <li> WORKS FOR JOINT AND MUSCULAR ACHES. SMELLS PLEASANT.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE WHO HAS ACHES AND PAINS.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the product or the seller. I bought something that didn&#x27;t do what I thought, based on extensive research, would do. I have a golf ball size lump on my elbow. Research told me I should use a product with DMSO in it. Obviously, if that will solve my problem, it will have to be more potent. This cream has Aloe Vera in it which I love but I now know I need pure DMSO in order to make an educated decision on whether DMSO works or not, in my situation that is:)</li>
            <li> Cream worked better than expected my wife loves it. I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Did everything it said You can actually feel it working ....it&#x27;s nice to know some of these companies actually know their products very satisfied</li>
            <li> It really helps my arthritic shoulder although the DSMO does not seem&lt;br /&gt;strong as I was expecting to cause a taste in my mouth and it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just assumed that I would taste it from things I had read.</li>
            <li> At night it goes on before bed.  Need to let the cream dry.  Maybe gel is better.  Relief is wonderful.  Sleeping is an option, now.</li>
            <li> have yet to use. Product arrived without damage.</li>
            <li> good product but no directions were included on how to use!!!</li>
            <li> Works as adrvertised.  Not a miracle drug but it does help.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would</li>
            <li> Works and feels nice. The smell is stong rose scent. It kind of powder rose smell that reminds me of cheap purfume. So no I do not like the smell.I use at night before bed till its gone then I will buy the aloe scent. That ones ok.</li>
            <li> What is this product doing on the market? It clearly states on the back of the label that it is intended for use as a solvent only and that it is unlawful to represent in any way that that this product is useful or safe to use for medicinal purposes. So why do you add aloe vera or rose scent to a solvent? The sellers are talking out of both sides of their mouth. It didn&#x27;t help my pain but I did notice a bad taste in my mouth and a slight amount of nausea. I am sending it back. I am giving it one star only because I have to in order to publish this review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a runner and had bursitis in my knee - I read that this stuff can be effective in relieving the swelling/pain.  Well it worked for this guy!  Will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This product is the best.  It recieved all rules of pain. The small is swept. It is not a strong but it eresembles a perm with flowers. Its not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this... it is helping the pain in my leg very much.. It was instant relief and the Rose scent is a plus</li>
            <li> The Aloe Vera with the Rose Scent does not burn me like the reg DMSO does. The price is right at Amazon,</li>
            <li> helped me good product</li>
            <li> No skin irritation and pleasant scent. Might not be as efficacious as the 100% but it works. word word word</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my husband who was having leg pains behind his knee. It has helped a lot with his pain. I think&lt;br /&gt;this product is very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years now - does the trick for me</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, it truly works miracles on aching shoulders!  I felt a noticeable difference the first time I used the DMSO cream.</li>
            <li> Great product. Completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> I used this consistently for over a month, three to four times a day. My forearm hurts a bit less than it did when I started using the cream. Whether the DMSO is responsible there&#x27;s no way to know. If so the effect is small and slow. There was no immediate lessening in pain. I also got an ergonomic keyboard, which may be the cause of the lower pain level, or it may have been the multiple daily massages that I applied to the sore areas when I rubbed in the DMSO cream.</li>
            <li> found the gel is stronger.</li>
            <li> The cream is wonderful</li>
            <li> Miraculous stuff... I have arthritis in my joints of my hands so in the morning it&#x27;s hard to get moving.  I heard this was the wd-40 for joints so I had to give it a shot.  Worked wonders- first morning after using cream the day before was much better.  The pain and stiffness was cut down by half!  And the morning after that- NO PAIN NO STIFFNESS!  Use twice a day and make sure to wash wherever you put it as it is a solvent and will dissolve anything already there and move it straight into your body.  That being said, you could combine it with a myriad of remedies like castor oil, food grade diluted hydrogen peroxide, etc.  awesome!!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  First of all a product that can penetrate a cell wall is amazing.  The healing potential is profound.  Secondly, the mixture of aloe and dmso along with the rose oil producing a very healthy nourishment for your cells along with a palatable aroma.</li>
            <li> This cream has a pleasant smell and this is a big plus for me because most scents I do not enjoy!  It also seems to be helping to relieve some of the pain in my joints.</li>
            <li> A fine product. I had been using a DMSO roll-on, but this seems to work better, especially on the arthritis in my neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well on my Achilles tendon, as a matter of fact better than my prescription cream. No bad after taste that people warned me about.</li>
            <li> This is a new product for me and I have only had it for about 5 days, but it sure has taken the edge off of my pain problem.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fragarance; rose being my favorite flower, so that has won me over first.  I noticed that it did not have any Menthol in it&lt;br /&gt;before I ordered it and I was not quite sure how that was going to affect the quality of the product. I am still evaluating this issue.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a product that a friend gave me and was pleased with it, so when I could not get it any more this seemed the logical way&lt;br /&gt;to approach the problem. Right now I feel that this product is better than F/S, so I am glad to have resolved this issue.&lt;br /&gt;I will also tell my friend about my experience because she may want to get some for her and her husbands use since F/S is not&lt;br /&gt;available any longer.&lt;br /&gt;Rose Man</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have used it before and is satisfied with the results. I wish for you to update me on any future improvement of the product.</li>
            <li> Hurt my back and when I have my wife rub this on my back, it takes the pain right away.  Smells great and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Getting mild arthritis in my fingers. DMSO relieves aching almost immediately!</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream DMSO. A bit strong on the rose. But it is nice.</li>
            <li> this product seems to help my arthritic hands a bunch, so i rub it into my hands nearly every night</li>
            <li> I liked the scent.  This made it different from other similar  creams</li>
            <li> My order came sooner than expected and I just love the rose scented DMSO, I use it for just about everything. I have used it for a toothache, I put it on the side of my jaw and was amazed at how quickly it cleared up. I have used it on bruises and muscle pain. It does seem to work better on soft tissue than on bone pain. I highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li> Could be too soon to tell but this seems to be helping eczema/psoriasis rash.  So far it seems to take away the itching a lot &amp; has no bad odor at all.  In fact, I love the light clean scent of this cream.</li>
            <li> The cream works great.  When I feel the burning feeling, I used the cream and it stops this feeling.  It becames a cooling and stops the itching. All this happens within seconds.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great service, products just as advertised!</li>
            <li> Ok, this stuff works, I uses in on my back neck shoulders.. Pain goes away..andy issue it is costly..please make this is a bigger economic size</li>
            <li> Helps with the aches and pains</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well for relieving my foot pain. Does not smell like roses, smells more like the old fashioned Noxema.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother in law. She loves it. No more pain. She is 82 years old and has knee pains. This has helped her a lot. I am ordering 3 more for other relatives.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works.  It&#x27;s 30% dmso,  and I think that the recommended strength of 70% probably works even better.  I started out with tiny amounts on my knuckles,  in case I had a skin reaction,  which I did not.  In fact,  this product made my skin nice and soft.  The rose scent is nice and strong enough to cover up any other icky smell that the dmso might have.  I had to smear a lot more on my knees before I could taste anything.  It&#x27;s kind of metallic tasting.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a good dmso  starter product, if you want to try it but are a little nervous about it.  The 30% strength takes the edge off the pain in my knuckles,  and when this is gone,  I&#x27;m going to try something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, would order again</li>
            <li> I used to use DMSO 35 years ago, when it was undiluted, did not smell good and caused a nasty taste in your mouth. But it worked right away for aches and pains.  The company can not even advertise their product as a pain reliever on the jar. It does work but not as well as the straight undiluted version.  With that said it does diminish sore muscle pain and I ordered a number of them to give to friends and relatives....and they say it works for them.&lt;br /&gt;So overall I can recommend it.....the price is right, you don&#x27;t have to use much of it; making a jar last three or four times as long as a Blue Emu or Australian Dream.</li>
            <li> I like to mix it with the aloe version which reduces the chemical smell of the aloe version and reduces the overpowering rose scent of this version.</li>
            <li> Bought this for when my back flares up.  At first, I didn&#x27;t think it worked, but then I used a little more of the product and boy did it seem to help a lot.  I&#x27;ll buy some more in the future when I run out.</li>
            <li> Good for the skin scare</li>
            <li> I was concerned by the label:  &amp;#34;avoid contact with eyes, skin, clothing&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;intended for use as a solvent only&amp;#34;. According to WebMD:  It&#x27;s important to note that DMSO is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when applied to the skin. There are reports that industrial-grade DMSO is being used for self-treatment of several disease conditions. Industrial-grade DMSO is not of the same quality as the DMSO that is used for drug research purposes since it may contain impurities. DMSO easily penetrates the skin and brings along impurities and other substances that may be hazardous to health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DMSO is LIKELY SAFE when used as a prescription medication. Don&#x27;t use products that are not prescribed by your health professional. There is concern that some non-prescription DMSO products might be “industrial grade”, which is not intended for human use. These products are POSSIBLY UNSAFE, as they can contain impurities that can cause health effects. To make matters worse, DMSO readily penetrates the skin, so it carries these impurities rapidly into the body.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Also, therapeutic dosages used are lower than this cream, which is 99% (it might be too high):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;For prevention of some side effects of cancer treatment: 77-90% DMSO is typically applied under medical supervision every 3-8 hours for 10-14 days.&lt;br /&gt;For shingles (herpes zoster): 5-40% idoxuridine in DMSO is within 48 hours after the appearance of a rash and applied every 4 hours for 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;For nerve pain: 50% DMSO solution has been used 4 times daily for up to 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;For osteoarthritis: 25% DMSO gel has been used 3 times a day, and 45.5% DMSO topical solution has been used 4 times a day.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell. Nice creamy texture</li>
            <li> Works great.  On a scale of 1 to 10, it is a 8 1/2.</li>
            <li> this stuff works better than anything I ever used, I got my life  back.  no  pain .  try it!</li>
            <li> It is not a cure for my arthritis but it does help to minimize the pain and improve movement.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother who has arthritis. She says her pain is gone.</li>
            <li> I REMEMBER MY FATHER USING DMSO ON HIS ARTHRITIC KNEES, AS A CHILD, NOW HE IS GONE AND I HAVE HIS ISSUE, SOWEVER THIS REALLY DIDN&#x27;T DO IT FOR ME, BUT GET YOUR HANDS ON SOME ABSORBINE JR  VETERNARIAN LINEMENT, COMES IN A SPRAY OR GEL, THAT STUFF IS THE BOMB, CAN BE PURCHASED AT AMAZON, A LITTLE CHEAPER AT TRACTOR SUPPLY!!!sorry amazon</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t live without this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Did not relieve pain at all in my knee.</li>
            <li> helps meds, to penetrate the skin. seems to help.</li>
            <li> Great product I was introduced to by a massage therapist. The consistantcy and pleasant aroma is quite wonderful, and it reserves joint stiffness. Such a great find.</li>
            <li> Met all expectations ,very good product for skin and joints ailments .Now it is essential for my home medicine cabinet</li>
            <li> Hopeful that this works.</li>
            <li> no  issues, seems to work as intended thx</li>
            <li> works and smells good</li>
            <li> really works it smells good , it really does help..</li>
            <li> This seems to be  a different product then i used years ago. It did nothing to ease the pain . Years ago I used dmso on bursitis in the left shoulder and it alleviated the pain within hours. This product did not work at all!!!</li>
            <li> Good product. It takes care of my iliotibial band pain without the dreaded DMSO smell &amp; acts quickly.</li>
            <li> Did not see any relief.</li>
            <li> This stuff is supposed to work on a lot of things including cold sores. It worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using DMSO for awhile now and do not know what I would do without it. My doctor has been telling me I need back surgery (bulging disk and spinal stenosis) for some time now. I put the DMSO on my lower back in the morning and I am able to survive the day.  It really does work fast.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is a nurse and has fibromyalgia. I give her a massage with this product 3 to 4 times a week and it keeps her going.</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend, exactly as described...</li>
            <li> use with caution. this stuff works</li>
            <li> Works great, helps my hands and elbows</li>
            <li> Works very well but you do smell like roses.</li>
            <li> Get a prescription. Much safer and pure.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use product for those that are not as familiar with essential oils.  As always, only apply to areas well cleaned as it pulls (and intensifies any thing on your skin) into your body.  Make sure to read and educate yourself before using any product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it was delivered to me on schedule.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and of course I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s ever used it but he just had to have it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, and have been using it for years for all kinds of pain.  I will keep on ordering it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading one of several books on peroxide therapy.  In reading the reviews, one customer stated that he used it for muscle and joint pain.  I had back surgery in 2012 and still suffer from time to time with muscle pain.  I put some of this on the spots that are aching and by the morning, the pain and the stiffness is gone.  Works even better with Bengay.</li>
            <li> rose scent not overpowering, that&#x27;s good. That is all I have to say, I use it occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it works on my TMJ.</li>
            <li> Most relief I have had.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect!</li>
            <li> Whoever gets the eventual cold sore will be very happy to have this in his cabinet. Works for sports injuries too.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and works well</li>
            <li> I think it is helping me since I started it, I feel so much better, If something else happen I&#x27;ll let you know. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great product!! All the benefits of DMSO with a lovely scent!!</li>
            <li> Like this but after reading am a little concerned because it is not pharmaceutical grade. Will make sure my next purchase is.</li>
            <li> Wow! Only two days of using this product and I am impressed!  I suffer from severe hip bursitis and piriformas syndrome and can no longer have injections. I was in agony when I stumbled upon DMSO on the internet and decided to give it a try. Within hours, the pain subsided. I was leery about the product after reading testimonials about the odor. The Rose Scented version is not bad at all. So far, no garlic taste in my mouth either. Great product!</li>
            <li> DMSO IS AN AGENT TO HELP TRANSFER  OTHER MEDICINE.  A sore or strained muscle for me needs a rub of 10% Menthol.  When applying that and then the DMSO over it, it works fast.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see the concentration of DMSO.  This is a lower concentration thank I expected- Only 70%. It should say that on the description of the product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Has a nice consistency and feels good on the skin. It absorbs quickly and is non greasy!</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I looked for this all over the place. Finally found it on Amazon. Nothing could help my mom with bell palsy pain. We tried the cream and it helped soooo much!!!! It did burn a little but then burning sensation faded. Great find!!</li>
            <li> I love this DMSO cream because it is a great product that I shopped the Internet for a great price.</li>
            <li> Both products were as expected.</li>
            <li> this is my second order of this stuff, it really helps and I do not have to take pills. I use it on my neck, knees, elbows, and shoulders.</li>
            <li> This arrived days before it was expected!</li>
            <li> I have terrible pain with Lyme disease, especially in my hands. This helps when nothing else does.</li>
            <li> Had something called &amp;#34;Haglunds Deformity&amp;#34; which has the same symptoms as ankle tendonitis.  Went to 2 foot and ankle ortho doctors and 1 podiatrist.  All said I either had to have surgery or live with the pain.  Had it for 10 months and tried everything.  Nothing worked.  Figured I had nothing to lose and tried the DMSO.  Had no effect for about 6 weeks and then my pain started to gradually subside.  Then it was gone.  Its been 4 months and it hasn&#x27;t returned.  Was it the DMSO?  I don&#x27;t know but I would certainly suggest  trying it if you have joint or muscle pain.  Just don&#x27;t expect instant results if you&#x27;re pain has been chronic (more than a short period of time).</li>
            <li> I wonder if there is any DMSO in this cream?  I have tried it several times for arthritic pain, and not only has it not helped, but I don&#x27;t get any of the funny, garlicy taste in the mouth that I have had from DMSO in the past</li>
            <li> It works for very difficult muscle and joint pain.  The Rose scent is pleasant - no chemical under smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much, I am quite happy with my item.  good to use, pleasantly scented.  I am happy that it was available to buy online.</li>
            <li> its not a miracle cure but does help</li>
            <li> The cream is excellent! Better than aspercream! Brings swelling down and  also pain level is greatly reduced. I would recommend it to everyone with any aches and pains. It is a staple in our medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I guess, as I haven&#x27;t used it. The scary warnings plastered all over kept me from applying it. I got this for my brother who now thinks I&#x27;m trying to kill him. He heard a lot about it in the 1950s, and we both thought having a container would be a good idea. Maybe it is, but I haven&#x27;t worked up the nerve to try it. The product, allegedly, has the misfortune of causing one to small like garlic, immediately and intensely. The promo for this product implies that this is somehow decreased in their concoction, but that is another reason I haven&#x27;t applied it. Maybe on a night when we have spaghetti and garlic bread?</li>
            <li> I got the stuff to help me with some skin problems and it seems to be a miracle potion. It fixed places on my face that were becoming bothersome.</li>
            <li> Works great as a soothing massage cream, or in combination with other topical over-the-counter pain relieving creams.  The scent is pleasant without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Very effective for my knee and hip arthritis. It worked for my wife also for her arthritic pain. Nice scent. Will use this long term. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Have experienced painful piriformis muscle pain in buttock area, tried physiotherapy, muscle relaxants&lt;br /&gt;massage therapy and over the counter pain meds with limited to no relief.  After watching the 1980&#x60;s&lt;br /&gt;60 Minute segment on DMSO, doing research and reading reviews both good and bad, decided to&lt;br /&gt;try the DMSO Cream with Aloe Vera Rose Scented rather than the straight liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Am pleased to report that the Cream worked well for me after 6 days of nightime use, would probably&lt;br /&gt;have seen sooner results had it been applied more frequently.  Am now able to go about&lt;br /&gt;exercising and stretching with more ease whereas before using the Cream, had limited flexibility&lt;br /&gt;and intense pain when trying to do the physio.  Only experienced the sulphur taste on 3&lt;br /&gt;occasions and it dissipated within 3-4 minutes, not offensive enough to discontinue the&lt;br /&gt;application.  Would highly recommend product and vendor, worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any effects, good or bad. It certainly did not help my tennis elbow.</li>
            <li> my favorite ointment for sore knees and hands, smells nice, and helps a lot</li>
            <li> This formulation of DMSO is my favorite so far. To me it smells more like Noxzema than roses, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing. The cream absorbs quickly, and I&#x27;ve experienced none of the itching that sometimes occurs with liquid formulas. And of course DMSO helps with just about anything that ails you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, my son-in-law likes it, my dog likes it, and the doctor I work with asked me to order a jar for him, too. Four thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I have chronic back pain at the end of the day and I was hoping that this cream would offer some relief but i&#x27;m sad to say no relief at all.</li>
            <li> CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT! This is a great product. It does not have the bad smell that some of the other DMSO products have. The 70% solution does an effective job without skin irritation. there is an instant and cumulative effect when using this product. I have recommended this brand to several friends who have also gotten good results.</li>
            <li> LOVED this cream!  I used it on burns or any other skin problem and it seems to sooth the area and heal whatever the issue is.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t really care for the rose scent and it does not work as well at the unsented gel my wife prefers it as she cannot stand the smell of regular DMSO.  I would rate 3 stars myself but because she likes it I give it 4.</li>
            <li> this product shipped fast which I appreciated. It smells good too. Faintly floral but not overwhelming. Very emollient and absorbent into the skin. It&#x27;s the only kind of dmso I buy.</li>
            <li> Well, I am sure this company has great intentions, but after reading up on DMSO, I discovered that it&#x27;s not a good idea to have other &#x27;carriers&#x27; like rose fragrance and aloe vera lotion combined with DMSO. It&#x27;s a natural solvent and carries everything else with it directly into the blood stream. So I am afraid to use this product. I put it on once, then read up on it. There are no other ingredients listed (that I could find) as to the nature of the rose fragrance or the aloe cream. Sorry. I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> DMSO Cream seems to ease some of my pain.  First time user.  This cream was recommended by someone with severe back problems.</li>
            <li> The best there is for pain</li>
            <li> Great product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works well so far!  I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast effect, easy to use</li>
            <li> Provides relief to sore muscles and it smells heavenly.  Even my mother liked the smell!!</li>
            <li> it help my rheumatoid Arthritis , and torn rotator cuffs and my sciatica .</li>
            <li> product has reduced dependence on nsaids by 90%  absolutely takes the edge off.  Oxfam is a vendor I will rely upon again</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to DMSO, but this compound seems to take the sting our of it.  My husband and I both have arthritis, and this works the best of anything we&#x27;ve tried.  And if you know anyone with arthritis, folks will try everything and anything.  Will order again soon!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Absorbine Jr and icy Hot are better.</li>
            <li> did not make any difference</li>
            <li> I thought this would smell better but after using it a few days, a bad chemical odor began to annoy me.  The rose smell got cloying too.  Did not seem to benefit from use either.</li>
            <li> love the stuff, on my second container. I have issues with my legs and get leg cramps, works great and especially at night.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things regarding this substance and I have high hopes of its effectiveness. I have not used it enough to give adequate feedback. The order went smoothly and received product at expected date. I will try to update review when I have more knowledge.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this stuff for all areas with muscle pain and joints, The label might scare you but it works and have no side effects. Thank you for making this stuff.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff helps the arthritis pain in my thumb quite a bit.  I just don&#x27;t care for the smell.  It&#x27;s not bad, and it works well enough that I continue to use it.  I have started putting it on before I start doing hair/make-up.  I rub it in very well and leave it on as I dress.  Then before I walk out the door I take a dry towel and wipe off any that hasn&#x27;t been absorbed.  If you are using it on your wrist or hands you need to do this anyway, as it is a bit tacky if you don&#x27;t wipe it off.  I will buy it again and just try a different scent.</li>
            <li> DMSO has been a lifesaver for severe pain in my hips due to bursitis.  I would recommend it to anyone for topical pain.</li>
            <li> This Dmso cream works great,Ive used it three times and it feels good.</li>
            <li> I used this when I have a flare up with IC...I mix with coconut oil and topical put on bladder area.  Seems to calm it down</li>
            <li> I bought the product as a gift.  The recipient said it works</li>
            <li> Best thing we have found for pain relief, we have reordered again, would recommend to anyone to try it!</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical to try DMSO and chose the one with rose scent. Pain pills don&#x27;t do the job this does. It is amazing. The relief is almost immediate and lasted at least 24 hours. I&#x27;m sold. Great product. And everyone likes the smell, had no garlic scent anywhere so love it.</li>
            <li> Helps control dry scaly skin makes it appear more youthful</li>
            <li> A relative recommended this DMSO cream.  Admittedly, I was skeptical, but I tried it on my recently injured knee, leg strain.  The next day, the pain was gone.  I&#x27;m happy to recommend this product to anyone seeking relief from pain.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping for this amazing product which I use for my arthritis pain. Throw away your stinky, burning pain creams. This product tops them all!</li>
            <li> Had results the first day I used it. Doctor had recommended surgery, this replaced the need for it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Used it for two months- not sure if did serve it purpose.</li>
            <li> I really like my DMSO! I put it on my back and shoulder and I get pain relief fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it for Shingles post herpetic pain. I bought it in about my 4th week of suffering that this demonic virus causes. It greatly helped with the pain and allowed me to be able to get to sleep and stay asleep for a while to get the rest I needed. My husband used it for a painful back and big toe and reported it worked well. I will purchase this again just to have on hand. It&#x27;s not the only thing I used for pain with Shingles, but added to it the miracle of colloidal silver and they both worked well to keep me sane until I could heal.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is essential for anyone who works out regularly and gets minor muscle strains and pain.  I could not live without this product as I use it at least 2-3 times a week.  I love to rub it into sore areas at night and sleep comfortably all night because of the relief of this ointment.  It is better than any sports cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Fast ship,good product</li>
            <li> pleasant smell and seems to be helping slowly with pain and stiffness in joints.  sleeping better at night!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Phenomenal results for my lower back pain. Really unbelievable. My pain was so intense that I had and MRI done and then a visit to the neurosurgeon. Diagnosis was that I have bulging discs, arthritis and some slight stenosis but not yet a candidate for surgery. The neurosurgeon suggested that I visit a Pain Management specialist. Instead, I used this 4% cream that I had purchased for my wife&#x27;s hand pain. I used the cream for seven days and the pain completely disappeared. I have been pain free for over a month !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has severe arthritis in both hands and this cream controls her pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two additional containers of this product for relatives.</li>
