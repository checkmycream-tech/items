            <li>this allows me to pack light on the makeup, and still take everything I could want : )  </li>
            <li>so glad I found it super cheap on amazon!</li>
            <li>It came very quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the eyeshadow, because besides being the typical excellent quality, stay-put, velvety</li>
            <li>The seller is amazing to work with, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It does not come with brushes, but for me, if brushes, an eyeliner and mascara are the only extras I&#x27;m packing, I&#x27;m doing good</li>
            <li>The bronzer is not too \\&quot;orange\\&quot; and the shadows are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Just love it easy to just take this than my entire make up bag</li>
            <li>The best little facial color palette that fits right into your purse for easy touch ups at work or for an evening out.</li>
            <li>Having the blushes and bronzer all in one cute little package will make it nice for travel.</li>
            <li>All the eyeshadows are super unique and blendable as are the two blushes that are long lasting and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow&#x27;s go on smooth and are very concentrated pigment.</li>
            <li>The colors are fresh and flirty for her..</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of makeup and variety of colors for me</li>
            <li>The mirror is also very large and does not get foggy.</li>
            <li>Quality eye shadow with long wear in a nice compact size I can travel with!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>, this kit has exactly what you need to do a brown/bronze look, a nude look, a pink/purple look, or a smoky eye.  </li>
            <li>the shadow is very pigmented and i can&#x27;t wait to try it soon!</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>I just haven&#x27;t really used these colors much.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and</li>
            <li>I am an older person in the range of 70.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>its in your new compact.  </li>
            <li>She never wears a lot of makeup, and now with her new job, she has been getting dolled up.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could find more kits in various other colors.</li>
            <li>rather it not even come with lip gloss though since it isn&#x27;t much, I don&#x27;t use it, and occasionally I accidentally get my blush brush in it.  </li>
            <li>I have to say the gold color is one that really surprised me.</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old.  </li>
            <li>I always end up taking more makeup than accessories on vacation because I want the look I want when I want to wear it, and it&#x27;s a different look everyday...</li>

            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The only thing I could say slightly negative is the lip gloss is pretty pointless, unless you are just feeling like wearing a clear slightly shimmery gloss.</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry in my bag wherever I go.</li>
            <li> I recommend this, and other too-faced products.</li>

            <li> It also should&#x27;ve came with a little teddy bear hair brush.</li>
            <li> It can get a little messy after application.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a little bit of everything convenient to go!</li>
            <li> Because it is so small</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was just my pallette but the bottom case doesn&#x27;t close so the way.</li>
            <li> It may be a small pallet</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not that tan</li>
            <li> I bought this set a few years ago at sephora for $49 but since then its been discontinued and difficult to find.</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> the highlighter/blush/bronzer are a cream base.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this and use it every day.  Just the right amount of makeup and variety of colors for me - I don&#x27;t use a lot of different colors.  I would rather it not even come with lip gloss though since it isn&#x27;t much, I don&#x27;t use it, and occasionally I accidentally get my blush brush in it.  I will buy another when mine runs low.  This has replaced all my other makeup!</li>
            <li> Love this palette even the lip gloss is good :) advise its q good buy</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. All the eyeshadows are super unique and blendable as are the two blushes that are long lasting and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Too Faced products to start with, but this is great.  I&#x27;m traveling a lot this summer and bought this to take on trips with me.  The blush &amp; bronzer are gorgeous colors.  I like the eyeshadow, because besides being the typical excellent quality, stay-put, velvety Too-Faced I know and love, this kit has exactly what you need to do a brown/bronze look, a nude look, a pink/purple look, or a smoky eye.  I always end up taking more makeup than accessories on vacation because I want the look I want when I want to wear it, and it&#x27;s a different look everyday... this allows me to pack light on the makeup, and still take everything I could want : )  It does not come with brushes, but for me, if brushes, an eyeliner and mascara are the only extras I&#x27;m packing, I&#x27;m doing good</li>
            <li> Wonderful colors great staying power. Small enough to carry in my bag wherever I go. Love the variety of  metallic shadows and the cheek colors.</li>
            <li> I purchased this around the holidays as a gift for my sister. It came in perfect condition, very fast shipping and my sister loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;Very beautiful colors and now I want to buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and nicely pigmented. Having the blushes and bronzer all in one cute little package will make it nice for travel. Maybe I won&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;do you need all that&amp;#34; from my husband when I pack.....not likely. Lol. Because it is so small I don&#x27;t reach for it for daily use but it is nice to have.  I love Too Faced products!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this. The colors are perfect and very pigmented. This is also perfect for traveling and throwing in your purse. The mirror is also very large and does not get foggy.</li>
            <li> I bought this set a few years ago at sephora for $49 but since then its been discontinued and difficult to find. Its My favorite go to make up set and im so glad I found it super cheap on amazon!</li>
            <li> The best little facial color palette that fits right into your purse for easy touch ups at work or for an evening out.</li>
            <li> This palette produces so many eye looks and has a great bronzer and blush. Got one for me and my mom took another one. The seller is amazing to work with, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use very many too faced products and this one fills the bill for a portable compact with all needed items for a day or night for a touch up. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> 4 stars only because you cant replace colors when you run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian girl from California. Honestly, I&#x27;m not that tan but it&#x27;s just not as pigmented as I thought especially the bronzer. Not sure if it was just my pallette but the bottom case doesn&#x27;t close so the way. It&#x27;s workable if you don&#x27;t mind not having it too pigmented but maybe I just need to learn how to love this a bit more.</li>
            <li> I love too-faced products. They are well-suited for any skin, I think. I am in my 40s, and this kit&#x27;s products are great on me. Perfect for travel, or on-the-go. After trying it, I got two extras, for gifts for my sister and BFF. I recommend this, and other too-faced products.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it.....but its only a travale size.</li>
            <li> Came fast. Nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> Best eye shadow combo I&#x27;ve found. Quality eye shadow with long wear in a nice compact size I can travel with!&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it came with an eye applicator.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Too Faced products, but this definitely was not made for my skin tone.  I have medium toned skin--I would recommend this pallet for someone with pale/lighter toned skin.</li>
            <li> Too Faced never disappoints. I was happy to see that there is a lot of product in this palette. The eyeshadow&#x27;s go on smooth and are very concentrated pigment. A little goes a long way! I have to say the gold color is one that really surprised me. I&#x27;m not a fan of gold, but this color looks amazing on. If you&#x27;re looking for a good palette to throw in your purse, this is the one to have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase! The bronzer is not too \\&quot;orange\\&quot; and the shadows are very pretty. It&#x27;s perfect for on the run touch-ups. If this product is still available when I run out, I would defenitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Very cute and creative idea and packaging. I like that it has a little bit of everything convenient to go! I love cute creative things like this! I just haven&#x27;t really used these colors much. I always find myself going for other makeup palettes. The shimmer and pigmentation could be better for the expensive makeup that it is. It also should&#x27;ve came with a little teddy bear hair brush. *^.^</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself.  I am 56 years old.  Put one in my daughters stocking, she is 20.  we both loved this product from Too Faced.  It&#x27;s compact, has the perfect colors.  She said the one day, &amp;#34;I wish I had some lip gloss&amp;#34;, I smiled and said, &amp;#34;You do&amp;#34;...its in your new compact.  &amp;#34;That&#x27;s Right!!&amp;#34;  We had a good laugh.  She never wears a lot of makeup, and now with her new job, she has been getting dolled up.  The colors are fresh and flirty for her..And my look is more sophisticated.  We both love this product.</li>
            <li> just got this in the mail today and when i opened it up i was so excited! the shadow is very pigmented and i can&#x27;t wait to try it soon! It may be a small pallet but it definitely packs a lot of product!</li>
            <li> excellent make-up thank-you excellent shipping  regards cathy</li>
            <li> Just love it easy to just take this than my entire make up bag</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great eyeshadow colors -- easy for any skin tone.  My only issue is the lipgloss.  There&#x27;s not enough of it and it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always worn Lancome products but decided to venture out. These shadows are perfect and last! I wish I could find more kits in various other colors.</li>
            <li> Thank you , its graet</li>
            <li> Love it! the shadows are great, so many different looks can be created from these gorgeous colors. The blush and bronzer are perfect for my fair complexion. The only thing I could say slightly negative is the lip gloss is pretty pointless, unless you are just feeling like wearing a clear slightly shimmery gloss. I wish it was more pigmented, other than that this palette is perfect to throw in your purse when you are on the go!</li>
            <li> I am an older person in the range of 70.  I love these colorss - they will go with anyone&#x27;s colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous and smooth as can be. I wear these daily, I may have to order a new one soon before I hit pan!</li>
            <li> greatest. compact. ever.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing! The colors are very pigmented and the highlighter/blush/bronzer are a cream base. It can get a little messy after application. The case stays shut in my bag which is huge! It came very quickly.</li>
