    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I knew I should trust Ellen to advertise a great product!  </li>
            <li>It makes my face look almost flawless.</li>
            <li>Great customer service!  </li>
            <li>This is the best make up I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is the great makeup!  </li>
            <li>After having used for a couple of days (learning the ins/outs of an unfamiliar product) I have been impressed with the coverage of the foundation, the creamy texture of the product, lightness of application and what seems to stay put after hours of wear.  </li>
            <li>You will be so impressed.  </li>
            <li>but this product feels wonderful!</li>
            <li>The thing I like the most is that it stays on all day!!!</li>
            <li>so they make a great combo.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing it felt!  </li>
            <li>I now have a drawer full of Covergirl that is a wonderful product but is unusable to me or anyone else in my home.</li>
            <li>The coverage is very good, and it easily goes on evenly with the cosmetic sponge that is included.</li>
            <li>My greatest challenge with purchasing foundations is getting the color just right.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>and I love the concealer!  </li>
            <li>And the fact that it has spf is ever better!  </li>
            <li>I love this foundation!</li>
            <li>I will be honest about how it works for me.  </li>
            <li>and I do not feel I need to use another color to get a nice look.</li>
            <li>Loved even more that it was free to try!      </li>
            <li>I am happy I got to try these products, Olay has such good skincare and Covergirl sells good makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good fit for my over 50 skin.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best foundation that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I top it off with a powder finish and get a nice, even complexion.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get to try out the line and loved that it contained Olay.</li>
            <li>It has a very light feel to it like not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and I love that it has spf 22 protection!</li>
            <li>It has a great feel and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I looked great then an hour after applying I had very shiny skin.</li>
            <li>I am 30, so my skin hasn&#x27;t started showing too many signs of aging yet.</li>
            <li>--I am 51 and need help these days--this is not a miracle worker but does cover the flaws, look smooth and natural and feels great!</li>
            <li>love this product and the way that it goes on.  </li>
            <li>You will love this - plus no breakouts (after just having a baby</li>
            <li>Product went on smoothly, but didn&#x27;t cover blemishes and fine lines as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I appreciate other reviews that noted which stores will allow a refund/exchange when the color doesn&#x27;t work, as its a way to feel more confident about going out on a limb to guess which product best works with my complexion.</li>
            <li>This is the best makeup I&#x27;ve tried in a very long time.</li>
            <li>It comes off very light but provides a smooth, even application.  </li>
            <li>But wow, it looks great -</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product as a Bzz agent and love it.  </li>
            <li>It is so soft and has great coverage.  </li>
            <li>I prefer foundation that comes in a bottle and is thinner for easy application.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product through a site called BZZZZZagent and they sent me this exact product, the concealer, the cover up and a blush--this makeup goes on SMOOTH, natural, light and truly helps your face look flawless</li>
            <li>but once it opened it was fine.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been looking for a good and reasonably priced makeup that goes on quick and provides even coverage.  </li>
            <li>and I received free samples of this product to evaluate.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product for free as a member of Buzz Agent.  </li>
            <li>the one I selected was too light.</li>
            <li>It is light and does not wipe off or sweat off.  </li>
            <li>I receive the product for free to test and in return I post my opinion and share my opinion with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth - moisturizers -</li>
            <li>I got this free from Bzzz Agent.  </li>
            <li>It is creamy and smooth -</li>
            <li>That is so important to me as a fair-skinned girl.</li>
            <li>I am a Bzz agent and got a free sample to try and give my opinion about.</li>
            <li>I have been using CG&#x27;s Advanced Radiance Foundation for years...</li>
            <li>I have since scoured Amazon and Ebay to buy up every container of Advanced Radiance</li>
            <li>goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>and as a result get to test products for free and then bzz(talk) about them  to others.  </li>
            <li>That is so rare with my skin!</li>
            <li>However, other than that, I liked the product very much and would look to purchase a more appropriate color for my skin.</li>
            <li>You can see mild flakes when I dont exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>As a Buzzagent I was lucky to be selected to try a this product at no cost.  </li>
            <li>The scent has grown up from the CoverGirl foundation pads I used to purchase in high school, which is good for those of us in the over-30 year old category trying to prevent the \\&quot;scent flashbacks\\&quot; that some products bring.</li>
            <li>I think I found a new favorite...</li>
            <li>After using it for the first two months I noticed I haven&#x27;t broke out once!  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t show fine lines on my skin and it really doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing any at all.  </li>
            <li>The Olay lotion that is swirled in really makes a huge difference, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this foundation and really like it.</li>
            <li>- I rarely have time to put on make up</li>
            <li>But this soft honey in the simply ageless is a great color for me</li>
            <li>I am not a makeup user, but quite enjoyed using this product and felt that the application looked quite natural.  </li>
            <li>so I need a foundation that I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time getting right.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty hesitant about even trying it quite frankly.  </li>
            <li>Mixed feelings since it DOES cover well, but admit that it&#x27;s not too much more than that.  </li>
            <li>First let me start out by saying that I am a Buzzagent but that I do NOT get paid.  </li>
            <li>But this one would be nice for people with dry or normal skin.</li>
            <li>5 second easy application with a sponge.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, the foundation comes in a wide variety of shades that are very rich looking and this product is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the mineral powder which still makes me break out but not as much.  </li>
            <li>This really helped.</li>
            <li>or I really would have been upset.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s light enough that I could even use it in the daytime.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a round sponge applicator, which is also really nice.  </li>
            <li>I will mostly use this for nights when I go out and want a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li>BUT it does NOT make them appear more with the use of this makeup as it has with other brands I have used.</li>
            <li>- provides super light coverage yet enough that you don&#x27;t need additional under eye concealer and is enough for \\&quot;evening\\&quot; make up as well.</li>
            <li>I got tired spending big bucks for department store make-up and was thrilled with this product that worked even better at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>The jar only lasts about two months, but immediately I noticed it went on feeling smooth and silky yet not heavy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product as it is affordable and high quality.</li>
            <li>I am a new bzz agent who was lucky enough to be sent a sample of this makeup.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite foundation that I ever tried and I will likely be a long time user.  </li>
            <li>I got the soft honey, which I was afraid might be too dark for my light skin, but it turned out to be the perfect shade!</li>
            <li>It feels really light on your skin, yet it covers extremely well.</li>
            <li>Simply Ageless is unfortunately, not the product for me.</li>
            <li>I surprised!  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily with the sponge provided or a generic one, and the coverage is consistent and firm.    </li>
            <li>The color match is right on and as long as I moisturize well before applying it</li>
            <li>I really dont think this will work on dry skin, even though this is for older women.  </li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and sheer.</li>
            <li>I received samples of the whole Simply Ageless line through [...].</li>
            <li>At lest I can go into the store and have it matched to me to ensure that I do not waste money.  </li>
            <li>and WOW was</li>
            <li>This foundation product, CoverGirl &amp; Olay Simple Ageless is a very easy-to-apply product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 and my skin is pretty dry.  </li>
            <li>This product is full coverage without feeling heavy or making my skin break out.</li>
            <li>I usually do not like the feel of foundation on my face (I have even tried more expensive brands like Mary Kay and MAC)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with red undertones, and this foundation doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and hides the red well.</li>
            <li>I am getting older and makeup and clothes are getting harder to buy with age.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is because out skin chemistry is the same or if it would help reduce break-outs for other women and teens, but I can&#x27;t say enough of the difference it has made for our skin and would say that it is not just for older women with wrinkles!</li>
            <li>The makeup itself is average, with decent coverage.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the color (220) Beige Natural, was a little too light for my skin</li>
            <li>I usually buy liquid makeup in 2 different colors and mix on my fingers to try and match my skin because they are usually to light or to dark.</li>

            <li> This foundation product, CoverGirl &amp; Olay Simple Ageless is a very easy-to-apply product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and my skin is pretty dry.  </li>
            <li> This product is full coverage without feeling heavy or making my skin break out.</li>
            <li> I usually do not like the feel of foundation on my face (I have even tried more expensive brands like Mary Kay and MAC)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with red undertones, and this foundation doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and hides the red well.</li>
            <li> I am getting older and makeup and clothes are getting harder to buy with age.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is because out skin chemistry is the same or if it would help reduce break-outs for other women and teens, but I can&#x27;t say enough of the difference it has made for our skin and would say that it is not just for older women with wrinkles!</li>
            <li> The makeup itself is average, with decent coverage.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the color (220) Beige Natural, was a little too light for my skin</li>
            <li> I usually buy liquid makeup in 2 different colors and mix on my fingers to try and match my skin because they are usually to light or to dark.</li>
            <li> It was really hard to open the first time</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had good luck with the Covergirl brand in the past, so I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> After using it for a week or two I have also noticed that my skin feels less dry than it normally does.</li>
            <li> The color that I was sent was to light and the one that I went back to the store to buy was also the wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is if I&#x27;m not thorough with my moisturizer the foundation creates a dry, flaky finish.</li>
            <li> I do not get paid, but I do get a sample of the product at no cost and then have to talk about it, positive or negative.    </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t wear foundation as it feels to heavy or dry on my skin.  </li>
            <li> a few months ago I gave her one of my almost empty jars to see if it would make a difference on her skin, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it, her acne went down to a complete minimum.  </li>
            <li> However, I do have trouble with occasional breakouts and oily skin.</li>
            <li> so I had to be quite careful not to overapply and make my skin \\&quot;ghostly\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter started breaking out pretty bad so</li>
            <li> Not only is it significantly more expensive than Advanced Radiance, but the look and texture is horrible!</li>
            <li> I first bought the wrong color and the store wouldn&#x27;t exchange it because I already used it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other ingredient they put in this make-up</li>
            <li> I have found opening the product &amp; compartment where the sponge is kept was difficult at first, but once learning the trick to opening its become a snap.    </li>
            <li> However the packaging is hard to open and the compacts do not contain a mirror.</li>
            <li> At this point, I&#x27;d say average.</li>
            <li> My only negative is the color I chose.</li>
            <li> The container is a little hard to open.</li>
            <li> I stopped wearing foundation a long time ago because I&#x27;ve never liked the look of it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I need a little darker shade.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like trying to get it out of the little pot.  </li>
            <li> I found the coverage just a little too heavy and the applicator sponge didn&#x27;t provide even coverage.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that the foundation does go on evenly and does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used foundation in years because it is so oily and heavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-20&#x27;s and prefer tinted moisturizer for my everyday look.  </li>
            <li> I look \\&quot; pale and mysterious\\&quot; with this on.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t care for the thick, heavy feel of it.  </li>
            <li> This is cheaper than my usual Clinique foundation, too.</li>
            <li> I was a die hard mineral makeup user till I tried this.   </li>
            <li> I am having a hard time with the applicator and smoothing</li>
            <li> It is common for cream foundations to end up making my face look oily.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> The foundation is thick, cake-like and doesn&#x27;t appear to have any additional benefits of any sort of moisturizer-like feature.  </li>
            <li> I was seriously blown away.  </li>
            <li> So I was so disappointed when I put this foundation on and it made the flakes look really big and made my skin look chalky.   </li>
            <li> Seriously, if you wear foundation or are thinking about it - get this!  </li>
            <li> Imagine my disappointment to learn that it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I hate the wrinkles under my eyes</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Jono BuzzAgent and I received free samples of this product to evaluate.  I&#x27;m a 50 something workerbee and I&#x27;ve been looking for a good and reasonably priced makeup that goes on quick and provides even coverage.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of time in the morning for my makeup routine so I need a foundation that I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time getting right.  Simply Ageless is unfortunately, not the product for me. I found the coverage just a little too heavy and the applicator sponge didn&#x27;t provide even coverage.  On the plus side, the foundation comes in a wide variety of shades that are very rich looking and this product is very reasonably priced.  It has a great feel and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I received all of the products in the Simply Ageless line because I am a bzz agent. I tried all 4 products. I have to say that the foundation does go on evenly and does not feel heavy. It did not streak. It is very lightweight and sheer. However the packaging is hard to open and the compacts do not contain a mirror. You do get a sponge to apply the foundation and blush. I looked great then an hour after applying I had very shiny skin. It is common for cream foundations to end up making my face look oily. But this one would be nice for people with dry or normal skin. I am happy I got to try these products, Olay has such good skincare and Covergirl sells good makeup so they make a great combo.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for free as a member of Buzz Agent.  I love it!  I stopped wearing foundation a long time ago because I&#x27;ve never liked the look of it on my skin.  I did use a mineral powder to even out my tone.  I was pretty hesitant about even trying it quite frankly.  But wow, it looks great - it doesn&#x27;t show fine lines on my skin and it really doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing any at all.  I knew I should trust Ellen to advertise a great product!  I definitely plan on purchasing it when my sample runs out.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Like others, I too am a BzzAgent. I do not get paid, but I do get a sample of the product at no cost and then have to talk about it, positive or negative.    I like the product overall. The scent has grown up from the CoverGirl foundation pads I used to purchase in high school, which is good for those of us in the over-30 year old category trying to prevent the \\&quot;scent flashbacks\\&quot; that some products bring. It goes on easily with the sponge provided or a generic one, and the coverage is consistent and firm.    With that said, the color didn&#x27;t work for me. I went with the names of my current foundations of that \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; shade and it didn&#x27;t work with this product - the one I selected was too light. My greatest challenge with purchasing foundations is getting the color just right. At $13.99 retail price, I wasn&#x27;t going to run to my local Target to try another one.     I appreciate other reviews that noted which stores will allow a refund/exchange when the color doesn&#x27;t work, as its a way to feel more confident about going out on a limb to guess which product best works with my complexion.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product as a Bzz agent and love it.  The coverage is very good, and it easily goes on evenly with the cosmetic sponge that is included. It&#x27;s a good fit for my over 50 skin.  This is my favorite foundation that I ever tried and I will likely be a long time user.  The container is a little hard to open.</li>
            <li> I received this product along with the concealer, blush and corrector via [...].  I was so excited to get to try out the line and loved that it contained Olay. Loved even more that it was free to try!      Big disappointment.  The foundation is thick, cake-like and doesn&#x27;t appear to have any additional benefits of any sort of moisturizer-like feature.  I can say that it covers well and I love the concealer!  Just don&#x27;t care for the thick, heavy feel of it.  Mixed feelings since it DOES cover well, but admit that it&#x27;s not too much more than that.  At this point, I&#x27;d say average.</li>
            <li> Product went on smoothly, but didn&#x27;t cover blemishes and fine lines as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup I&#x27;ve tried in a very long time. It feels really light on your skin, yet it covers extremely well. It makes my face look almost flawless. My only negative is the color I chose. I need a little darker shade. I look \\&quot; pale and mysterious\\&quot; with this on. It works well for concealer, however.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used foundation in years because it is so oily and heavy and I have a problem with breaking out.  I had been using the mineral powder which still makes me break out but not as much.  I hate the wrinkles under my eyes so I thought I would try this product but was worried it would increase my breaking out.  I&#x27;ve even tried pro-active which didn&#x27;t help me at all.  I first bought the wrong color and the store wouldn&#x27;t exchange it because I already used it (should have went to Walmart!) so I contacted Cover Girl and they sent me a coupon to get the correct color.  Great customer service!  The jar only lasts about two months, but immediately I noticed it went on feeling smooth and silky yet not heavy.  It felt like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any make-up at all.  It evened out my skin and on a scale of 1 to 10 I would say the ageless effect was about a 7 for around my eyes and a 9 everywhere else.  After using it for the first two months I noticed I haven&#x27;t broke out once!  I don&#x27;t know what other ingredient they put in this make-up but it stopped my acne.  I have been using it since Christmas 2009 and have not had any acne problems.  My 14 year old daughter started breaking out pretty bad so a few months ago I gave her one of my almost empty jars to see if it would make a difference on her skin, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it, her acne went down to a complete minimum.  She ran out about two weeks ago and started breaking out again.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because out skin chemistry is the same or if it would help reduce break-outs for other women and teens, but I can&#x27;t say enough of the difference it has made for our skin and would say that it is not just for older women with wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I received samples of the whole Simply Ageless line through [...]. I haven&#x27;t had good luck with the Covergirl brand in the past, so I was skeptical. I think of Covergirl as being a \\&quot;teenage\\&quot; makeup brand. I am 30, so my skin hasn&#x27;t started showing too many signs of aging yet. However, I do have trouble with occasional breakouts and oily skin. This product is full coverage without feeling heavy or making my skin break out. The thing I like the most is that it stays on all day!!! That is so rare with my skin! This is cheaper than my usual Clinique foundation, too. I think I found a new favorite...</li>
            <li> I tried this product through a site called BZZZZZagent and they sent me this exact product, the concealer, the cover up and a blush--this makeup goes on SMOOTH, natural, light and truly helps your face look flawless--I am 51 and need help these days--this is not a miracle worker but does cover the flaws, look smooth and natural and feels great!</li>
            <li> I have used this product on a test basis.   I am a bzz agent and test products often.  This is the best make up I have ever used.  I was a die hard mineral makeup user till I tried this.   Covered my under eye circles, and the corrector will help keep it that way.  It is light and does not wipe off or sweat off.  I recommend all the products in this group, the eye corrector, under eye concealer, blush, and the foundation.</li>
            <li> First let me start out by saying that I am a Buzzagent but that I do NOT get paid.  I receive the product for free to test and in return I post my opinion and share my opinion with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and the way that it goes on.  It is so soft and has great coverage.  It eliminates the need for moisturizer since it has it in it.  The only problem that I have with this product is that you cannot tell what color you need.  There is no way to try a color to ensure that you purchase the correct color.  The color that I was sent was to light and the one that I went back to the store to buy was also the wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think with the problems that I have had in trying to get my color matched up, I will stick to my MAC.  At lest I can go into the store and have it matched to me to ensure that I do not waste money.  I now have a drawer full of Covergirl that is a wonderful product but is unusable to me or anyone else in my home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and my skin is pretty dry.  You can see mild flakes when I dont exfoliate.  I exfoliated and put cream on my skin before I used this.  This really helped. So I was so disappointed when I put this foundation on and it made the flakes look really big and made my skin look chalky.   I really dont think this will work on dry skin, even though this is for older women.  The store, target, took it back or I really would have been upset.</li>
            <li> This is the great makeup!  I am a mother of 3 and just turned 40 - I rarely have time to put on make up - UNTIL NOW!  This make up takes 5 seconds to apply - no moisturizer is necessary.  It goes on smooth - moisturizers - has an SPF of 22 - provides super light coverage yet enough that you don&#x27;t need additional under eye concealer and is enough for \\&quot;evening\\&quot; make up as well. 5 second easy application with a sponge.  You will love this - plus no breakouts (after just having a baby I have been the zit queen - no problems with his make up).  Who knew Cover Girl could deliver like this?</li>
            <li> I was given samples as part of an advertising campaign.  The makeup itself is average, with decent coverage.  My problem is with the packaging.  I don&#x27;t like trying to get it out of the little pot.  I prefer foundation that comes in a bottle and is thinner for easy application.  It&#x27;s just not convenient for my lifestyle!</li>
            <li> As a Buzzagent I was lucky to be selected to try a this product at no cost.  After having used for a couple of days (learning the ins/outs of an unfamiliar product) I have been impressed with the coverage of the foundation, the creamy texture of the product, lightness of application and what seems to stay put after hours of wear.  I have found opening the product &amp; compartment where the sponge is kept was difficult at first, but once learning the trick to opening its become a snap.    This is definitely a product I will continue using.</li>
            <li> I am getting older and makeup and clothes are getting harder to buy with age. I have some age lines going on and haven&#x27;t found anything that can hide them.  Including this makeup. BUT it does NOT make them appear more with the use of this makeup as it has with other brands I have used. I am a new bzz agent who was lucky enough to be sent a sample of this makeup. I will be honest about how it works for me.  As I do not get paid as bzz agent just get to try samples of products then review them.  I usually buy liquid makeup in 2 different colors and mix on my fingers to try and match my skin because they are usually to light or to dark. But this soft honey in the simply ageless is a great color for me and I do not feel I need to use another color to get a nice look. It has a very light feel to it like not wearing makeup. I am having a hard time with the applicator and smoothing I think it is just me not being used to using an applicator. I will buy this again. And have recommended to friends. It was really hard to open the first time but once it opened it was fine.</li>
            <li> I got this free from Bzzz Agent.  I normally don&#x27;t wear foundation as it feels to heavy or dry on my skin.  I&#x27;m in my mid-20&#x27;s and prefer tinted moisturizer for my everyday look.  However, I gave this a try and WOW was I surprised!  It is SOOO SILKY!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing it felt!  It is creamy and smooth - no flakiness and no oiliness!  I was seriously blown away.  It comes with a round sponge applicator, which is also really nice.  I dot this over my face then blend it in.  It comes off very light but provides a smooth, even application.  The Olay lotion that is swirled in really makes a huge difference, in my opinion.  I will mostly use this for nights when I go out and want a more dramatic look.  But it&#x27;s light enough that I could even use it in the daytime.  Seriously, if you wear foundation or are thinking about it - get this!  You will be so impressed.  It is by far the best foundation that I have ever used.  And the fact that it has spf is ever better!  That is so important to me as a fair-skinned girl.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! I am a Bzz agent and got a free sample to try and give my opinion about. I got the soft honey, which I was afraid might be too dark for my light skin, but it turned out to be the perfect shade! I usually do not like the feel of foundation on my face (I have even tried more expensive brands like Mary Kay and MAC) but this product feels wonderful! It goes on smooth and I love that it has spf 22 protection! After using it for a week or two I have also noticed that my skin feels less dry than it normally does. I will continue to use this product as it is affordable and high quality.</li>
            <li> I have been using CG&#x27;s Advanced Radiance Foundation for years...I got tired spending big bucks for department store make-up and was thrilled with this product that worked even better at a fraction of the price. Imagine my disappointment to learn that it has been discontinued. So I tried Simply Ageless figuring it was an improved replacement. Not only is it significantly more expensive than Advanced Radiance, but the look and texture is horrible! It went on in streaks no matter how I applied it (sponge/fingertips). It felt like I was wearing grease-paint. I have since scoured Amazon and Ebay to buy up every container of Advanced Radiance I could find in my color.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this foundation and really like it. The color match is right on and as long as I moisturize well before applying it goes on smoothly. I have sensitive skin with red undertones, and this foundation doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and hides the red well. I top it off with a powder finish and get a nice, even complexion. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is if I&#x27;m not thorough with my moisturizer the foundation creates a dry, flaky finish.</li>
            <li> I am a bzzagent for [...] and as a result get to test products for free and then bzz(talk) about them  to others.  This foundation product, CoverGirl &amp; Olay Simple Ageless is a very easy-to-apply product.  I am not a makeup user, but quite enjoyed using this product and felt that the application looked quite natural.  It also seemed to stay on the skin and not get smudged off.  My only complaint is that the color (220) Beige Natural, was a little too light for my skin so I had to be quite careful not to overapply and make my skin \\&quot;ghostly\\&quot;.  However, other than that, I liked the product very much and would look to purchase a more appropriate color for my skin.</li>
