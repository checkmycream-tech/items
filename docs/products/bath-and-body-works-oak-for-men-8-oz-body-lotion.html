            <li>My husbands favorite scent</li>
            <li>great price for a nice lotion, does a great job at making your skin smell like the product, last all day long, you can still smell the scent on you after working out ect.</li>
            <li>Lightning Fast Ship, Super Deal, Thank You !!!  </li>
            <li>I was really bummed when B&amp;BW stopped carrying this lotion, but I am so happy I was able to get a few more bottles!</li>
            <li>, it potency is a GOOD thing because you only need two pea-sizes dots for the whole day, which means that this awesome manly-ass smelling lotion 8oz bottle will last me a loooooong time.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this lotion makes me feel and the &amp;#34;oak&amp;#34; scent is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Smells kinda like cologne honestly; gave it four stars cause its not really a scent I want for the summer.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t go down the drain with the water like most scents do.  </li>
            <li>It should be used to give you a nice accent scent that still is subtle and not as noticeable as splashing cologne</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty dang terrific.</li>
            <li>That said you shouldn&#x27;t use this in large amounts to moisturize dry skin, as your eyes (and everyone around you) will water up.</li>

            <li> My husband loves the scent although they don&#x27;t last all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fragrance that I like, and is subtle enough that someone would have to be very close to smell it.</li>
            <li> It is not inexpensive, but a little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the lotion because it doesn&#x27;t include cucumber melon or any other fruit coconut smell.  </li>
            <li> Uses it everyday and the fragrance stays with him all day</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that it smells like wood of any sort, but it does smell faintly of cologne.</li>

            <li> Ive owned Noir, Ocean, and white citrus lotions from Bath and Body Works and this one is the strongest smelling and longest lasting of them all. Smells kinda like cologne honestly; gave it four stars cause its not really a scent I want for the summer.</li>

            <li> My wife bought me the body wash and I like the smell and it doesn&#x27;t go down the drain with the water like most scents do.  I decided to try the lotion because it doesn&#x27;t include cucumber melon or any other fruit coconut smell.  It is a perfect compliment to the wash.  Girls hold onto me longer when I get hugs.  Just saying. ;)</li>
