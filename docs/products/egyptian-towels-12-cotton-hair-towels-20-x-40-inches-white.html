            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect perfect seams and didn&#x27;t get them.</li>
            <li>These are perfect hair towels.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for use as a hair towel.  </li>
            <li>After washing they softened up and are excellent for what I wanted them for.</li>
            <li>The towel&#x27;s are not the best quality</li>
            <li>Great towels for what I need for...</li>
            <li>This is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>Good for wrapping your hair, utility towels.</li>
            <li>The product description was very accurate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are merely OK.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t heavy weight which is good because between the weight and size/length of the towel, they wrap into a perfect turban.</li>
            <li>They are okay.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>but I thought they would be better than what they are.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perfect size for wrapping wet hair.</li>
            <li>These fit the bill.</li>
            <li>You really need to wash your hand after touching them.</li>
            <li>whole family liked them so much that I purchased a 2nd batch to be sure there were always some in the linen closet. .</li>
            <li>$10 worth of towels for $20, perhaps.</li>
            <li>They are more suited for drying your dog or card, not for human use.</li>
            <li>They are however, heavy enough to do a great job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know they did not cost that much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect clean, clear white and didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap as cheap can get, and paper thin.</li>
            <li>When I first bought these they left a pile of lint everywhere</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; durable, but a little thinner than expected.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>Not thick, not white, not especially absorbent, not neatly made.</li>
            <li>However, they dry my shoulder length hair adequately and are light enough that they do not feel heavy on the neck, when wrapped around the head, like other larger and/or heavier towels.</li>
            <li>I wanted a lightweight, absorbent medium-small (20\\&quot; x 40\\&quot;) towel that would wrap comfortably around my wet hair and not be too heavy.</li>

            <li> thing and not useful for anything.</li>
            <li> I washed them quite a few times with vinegar due to all the finishing stuff they put in them.</li>

            <li> Functional but not great quality, not towels that you want to show off.</li>
            <li> Use them for the gym, white fuzziness all over beard&lt;br /&gt;Going to return item, horrible quality</li>

    <ol>
            <li> At less than $1.60 for a towel of the size I wanted, my expectations weren&#x27;t high. I did not expect thick, plush terry cloth and didn&#x27;t get it. I didn&#x27;t expect perfect seams and didn&#x27;t get them. I didn&#x27;t expect clean, clear white and didn&#x27;t get it. In fact, the photo looks nothing like the towels I received. But I am not surprised, nor am I terribly disappointed. I wanted a lightweight, absorbent medium-small (20\\&quot; x 40\\&quot;) towel that would wrap comfortably around my wet hair and not be too heavy. This description fits what they are. So they work for me. They meet my needs. But I will keep looking just in case I can find something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are merely OK. Not thick, not white, not especially absorbent, not neatly made. Be forewarned.</li>
            <li> These are perfect hair towels. They aren&#x27;t heavy weight which is good because between the weight and size/length of the towel, they wrap into a perfect turban. They are however, heavy enough to do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;My whole family liked them so much that I purchased a 2nd batch to be sure there were always some in the linen closet. .</li>
            <li> Wow. This stuff is... wow. $10 worth of towels for $20, perhaps. They&#x27;re cheap as cheap can get, and paper thin. I accidentally snapped one and bits of the towel went flying everywhere, after just one snap.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for use as a hair towel.  After washing they softened up and are excellent for what I wanted them for.</li>
            <li> Ordered these towels by the description Ian&#x27;s picture.&lt;br /&gt;1. There is absolutely no way these our soft&lt;br /&gt;2. Look nothing like picture&lt;br /&gt;3. Washed once, twice , lint balls everywhere. Use them for the gym, white fuzziness all over beard&lt;br /&gt;Going to return item, horrible quality</li>
            <li> If you want lint balls, then these are the towels for you. When I first bought these they left a pile of lint everywhere I put them, so having twelve of them made it difficult to hide all of the fuzz. If you wear any black clothes at all then I would not keep these in the house with them.</li>
            <li> The quality of these towels is very poor. Some of the edges were fraying where they were sewed. They were dingy in color. They are more suited for drying your dog or card, not for human use.</li>
            <li> These towels are about useless. They are way&lt;br /&gt;too thing and not useful for anything. It was&lt;br /&gt;a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for wrapping wet hair. Stays wrapped too</li>
            <li> They are rough but I sort of expected that for the price. I washed them quite a few times with vinegar due to all the finishing stuff they put in them. They were actually sticky and you could feel the film on your hands. You really need to wash your hand after touching them. It&#x27;s a hair towel for me. They are okay.</li>
            <li> Rough as sandpaper. Good for wrapping your hair, utility towels.</li>
            <li> I wanted thin towels which size would be in between a bath and a hand towel for hair drying purposes. I don&#x27;t like thick plush towels. These fit the bill. However I got what I paid for: the quality is not great. There are here and there some colored threads mixed up with the white, and I can tell the seams are not strong and might not last very long...but then again I have plenty of replacements. The towels feel a little rough but I am not using any softener so a little softener might take care of that. Functional but not great quality, not towels that you want to show off.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; durable, but a little thinner than expected.  However, they dry my shoulder length hair adequately and are light enough that they do not feel heavy on the neck, when wrapped around the head, like other larger and/or heavier towels.</li>
            <li> Great towels for what I need for...I&#x27;m a groomer</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price. The product description was very accurate. I will be purchasing more. Thank you!</li>
            <li> When I washed and dried the towels they all shrunk!  I am very disappointed and will Never order towels&lt;br /&gt;Again from your site!!!  I know they did not cost that much but I thought they would be better than what they are.&lt;br /&gt;I guess you do truly get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy these ever again, very poor quality. Almost fell apart in the dryer the very first time washed and dried!!!</li>
            <li> The towel&#x27;s are not the best quality but It does the job.....I have to say that the towels are real white.. That&#x27;s a plus</li>
