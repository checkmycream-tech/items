            <li>and it arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Amazon was kind enough to remind me that I needed to buy more by simply showing me the product while I was surfing.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>

            <li>Ripoff, I was certain.  </li>
            <li>My friend loves this BVL much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its real.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Wait a spell, however, and you unexpectedly catch the fresh, alluring scent that is Bvlgari.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Complete strangers will literally come and smell me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft, not intoxicating fragrance.</li>
            <li>As I stated early in my comments about the body lotion that goes with this perfume, I can&#x27;t get enough of this smell and nether can the people that have come up to me and commented on it.</li>
            <li>I found that even hard to please people (not easy to find a fragrance they like) always liked it.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it seems to wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfume but the seller for one bad reason are selling just online and not is the real perfume.</li>

            <li> I believe this product is counterfeit. I have worn this perfume (purchased from a department store) and it stayed on almost all day. The bottle I purchased doesn&#x27;t even make it to 10 am when applied at 8 am.</li>
            <li> Very good price, the product is genuine and arrived on time. My girlfriend was happy with this gift. This fragrance is unique</li>
            <li> Great pricing for my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells SOOO amazing. I get compliments all the time so I bought one for a friend for Christmas. Was the bigger bottle I was expecting and it arrived quickly</li>
            <li> The smell is nice. My friend loves this BVL much. Light but marvelous. Recommend for a gift to your friends.</li>
            <li> Smelled great just not on me..gave to my mom</li>
            <li> This perfume is delicious yet light. I love that it stays on all day and I can still smell it on myself. The price for it is great compared to stores.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it, 100% legit too. I was a little iffy about this order after reading some previous posts but it arrived on time and untampered, scent lasts long doesn&#x27;t smell watered down.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it. I like it because it&#x27;s not overbearing, it&#x27;s a unique and elegant fragrance. I would recommend it and looking forward to purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so pleasantly fragrant. I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> It was nice, but was not as nice  as BLV, which is still my favorite. I do not think I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Great CHRISTMAS present.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its real. Then when I tried to get a return label, it says I can&#x27;t return perfume.</li>
            <li> Bulgari for men has always been a favorite of mine. I recently started wearing Bulgari II for women and am complimented on the perfume every time I spray it on by both women and men. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Mmmmmm, great pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Subtlety best describes this fragrance.  My wife applied it, I hardly noticed it.  Ripoff, I was certain.  Initially, it may seem like/(be) a knockoff and you have been duped (if it is, it&#x27;s a d..n good, inexpensive one).  Wait a spell, however, and you unexpectedly catch the fresh, alluring scent that is Bvlgari.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally skeptical, we will definitely buy fragrances &#x27;sold and shipped by Amazon&#x27;... what does one have to lose but possibly a few days reshipping.  Better than paying 25 - 40% more at Nordstrom (forget the parking, dodge-a-snob, etc.).  Am open to those with different experience and better alternatives.</li>
            <li> My review on this item wasnt very good. I was so unhappy to find that it was watered down and you could barely smell the perfume. It also smelled old. I had several people see what their thought was when the smelled the  perfume and they had the same reviews as myself.</li>
            <li> The first time that I purchased this product was amazing the Original.  But the second time was just alcohol, I had to drop in a trash can.  Very upset. This is one of my favorite perfume but the seller for one bad reason are selling just online and not is the real perfume. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this fragrance!  This smells SO good. My only complaint is that it seems to wear off quickly. It could just be me but, I was wondering if anyone else has had that problem.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It is nice to have a fragrance that is not like what everyone else is wearing. It has a unique soft smell. I have had lots of comments on this fragrance.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  Smells amazing.  My husband loves scent.  I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance other than secret deodorant body spray</li>
            <li> As I stated early in my comments about the body lotion that goes with this perfume, I can&#x27;t get enough of this smell and nether can the people that have come up to me and commented on it. Complete strangers will literally come and smell me</li>

            <li> I tried many brands and many fragrances and so far this is one of my favorite perfumes. I still had some left in the bottle but I ordered before I ran out since I like it so much. It&#x27;s a soft, not intoxicating fragrance. I found that even hard to please people (not easy to find a fragrance they like) always liked it. Makes a great gift.</li>
