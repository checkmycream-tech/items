    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great for the price!</li>
            <li>(~5 inches) match my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>so no one sees the very top of the bun!</li>
            <li>A drawback of this kind of wig is you can not comb it, so after a while it would be a bit  shaggy and would not look as beautiful as it is in the beginning.</li>
            <li>but hey that&#x27;s what you get when its a $6 hair piece is the very top you can tell where it is stitched.</li>
            <li>Great fit easy get up and go or when I am at my Sunday best at Church quick and fast!</li>
            <li>Considering the price (3.13 $) and free shipping, I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>the comb and drawstring this fits very securely.</li>
            <li>Lasted Long Looks real GREAT COLOR Nice size clips hurt a bit but</li>
            <li>cuteeeee cute cute cute cute &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I love this bun</li>
            <li>FASHION FOWARD, I FEEL SEXY</li>
            <li>and I could not use the item any more.</li>
            <li>and this makes me look like I have a full head of hair very easy to put not SHINee</li>
            <li>For someone like me who lost most of their hair due to thyroid issues these cheap buns are a life saver!!!</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to smooth out and will likely keep it nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super shiny</li>
            <li>Stays on great, but is really really dark brown and has a reddish tint to it.</li>
            <li>It matches my dark hair very well, not exact match but with a bun or pony tail you don&#x27;t want a perfect match.</li>
            <li>This was very disappointing.it looks absolutely nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li>it is cheap and falls apart the minute you open the package.</li>
            <li>i really like it.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely order a million, but I don&#x27;t know what color to order now.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, a nice round donut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of comments like, \\&quot;wow your hair grows so fast, you can put it in a bun already???\\&quot; or when I take it off I would get comments like, \\&quot;OMG, that wasn&#x27;t your hair?\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The color is so far off from what was said on the website.</li>
            <li>It looks natural to me and is not over-shiny, the color and the size</li>
            <li>First, this is not dark brown, it&#x27;s definitely got a red tone, to the point that it doesn&#x27;t match - or even blend, because sometimes with buns you can get away with a color difference - with my true dark brown</li>
            <li>I use the extra string to loosely wrap around the bun because the fringes tend to spread out too much.  </li>
            <li>Darker than what appeared in the picture, decent quality, but began to unwind after minimal use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually not long hair wrapped into a bun, but shorter hairs curled around into a bun shape, but I like that.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s actually not long hair wrapped into a bun, but shorter hairs curled around into a bun shape, but I like that.</li>
            <li> hardly im wearing one right now.</li>
            <li> it looks flat and the hair band inside cannot hold my hair</li>
            <li> The only down side is that when I take it off, my hair is bent in weird ways because of how I had to tie it to keep it down, but that&#x27;s because my hair is too short to wrap around nicely.</li>
            <li> The opening to put your hair is small so if you have thin or very little hair, it would be good</li>
            <li> complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I have very short hair, and am in the military.</li>
            <li> took way to long to arrive.</li>
            <li> I feel like coloring my hair dark red brown, I&#x27;m looking forward to using this.</li>
            <li> I tie my hair up in a place where shortest hairs won&#x27;t fall out, then wrap the short ponytail and tie it down before I put this on.  </li>
            <li> I am currently growing out my shoulder length hair (my least favorite hair length), so I bought this to cover up the ugly short ponytail.  </li>
            <li> not very shiny but wont work if the color doesn&#x27;t match.</li>
            <li> It did take FOREVER to come it, but I expected that...</li>
            <li> It came well before the expected time plus did not smell like other things I have ordered from china.</li>
            <li> This hair piece gave me an excuse to dye my hair a few shades lighter.  </li>
            <li> ( so it looks fake) and it&#x27;s not even a whole bun</li>
            <li> this product has a reddish tone to it, isn&#x27;t really dark brown at all.</li>
            <li> I think I need to find a way to tightly hook it.</li>
            <li> Please dont waste your money on it</li>
            <li> Messy appearance upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> The items does not fit well on the hair.</li>
            <li> the hair in the bun falls of so bad that the bun looks different than the time i purchased it nie textuer but no quality at all</li>
            <li> it looks a tad fake but</li>
            <li> but if you have thicker  or longer hair, it&#x27;s difficult to attach.</li>
            <li> This clip in bun is crap.</li>

            <li> This was very disappointing.it looks absolutely nothing like the picture. It&#x27;s super shiny ( so it looks fake) and it&#x27;s not even a whole bun its hair in a swirl that keeps unraveling. This bun is junk. Please dont waste your money on it</li>
            <li> bought two different colored hair donuts. the color on this was looks unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, a nice round donut.&lt;br /&gt;the hair falls apart doesn&#x27;t stay in the donut shape.&lt;br /&gt;a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m trying to get my money back!</li>

            <li> Great for the price! It matches my dark hair very well, not exact match but with a bun or pony tail you don&#x27;t want a perfect match. For someone like me who lost most of their hair due to thyroid issues these cheap buns are a life saver!!! It came well before the expected time plus did not smell like other things I have ordered from china. The only thing I did not like but hey that&#x27;s what you get when its a $6 hair piece is the very top you can tell where it is stitched. So where it like the girl in the picture so no one sees the very top of the bun!</li>
            <li> Lasted Long Looks real GREAT COLOR Nice size clips hurt a bit but cuteeeee cute cute cute cute &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> the hair in the bun falls of so bad that the bun looks different than the time i purchased it nie textuer but no quality at all</li>

            <li> Great fit easy get up and go or when I am at my Sunday best at Church quick and fast!</li>
            <li> Messy appearance upon arrival.  Does not maintain shape.</li>
            <li> This clip in bun is crap. I have very short hair, and am in the military. I am trying to grown my hair out, so I bought this so I could wear it up during work. it is cheap and falls apart the minute you open the package.</li>
            <li> took way to long to arrive. The color is so far off from what was said on the website. It may look like a bun when in fact the hair at the bottom is not attached so if you are going to be doing a lot of moving around or in the wind it will blow around. I guess you get what you pay for and if you try to return it you pay return or only get 30% back. would not recommend!!</li>
            <li> i really like it. it looks a tad fake but hardly im wearing one right now. i would buy it again</li>
            <li> FASHION FOWARD, I FEEL SEXY WEARING IT</li>
            <li> The opening to put your hair is small so if you have thin or very little hair, it would be good but if you have thicker  or longer hair, it&#x27;s difficult to attach.</li>
            <li> This product was what I was looking for. It arrived in the proper time, and it matched the hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your advertisement on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Stays on great, but is really really dark brown and has a reddish tint to it. It matched my hair I would absolutely order a million, but I don&#x27;t know what color to order now. It did take FOREVER to come it, but I expected that...</li>
            <li> First, this is not dark brown, it&#x27;s definitely got a red tone, to the point that it doesn&#x27;t match - or even blend, because sometimes with buns you can get away with a color difference - with my true dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the comb and drawstring this fits very securely. It&#x27;s actually not long hair wrapped into a bun, but shorter hairs curled around into a bun shape, but I like that. Makes it easy to smooth out and will likely keep it nice longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I feel like coloring my hair dark red brown, I&#x27;m looking forward to using this. Wish it had actually been the color I ordered.</li>
            <li> The items does not fit well on the hair. The string broke and I could not use the item any more.</li>
            <li> It looks natural to me and is not over-shiny, the color and the size (~5 inches) match my hair perfectly. Considering the price (3.13 $) and free shipping, I am very satisfied with my purchase. A drawback of this kind of wig is you can not comb it, so after a while it would be a bit  shaggy and would not look as beautiful as it is in the beginning. I ordered two, one for daily use and one for parties.</li>
            <li> it looks flat and the hair band inside cannot hold my hair well. I think I need to find a way to tightly hook it.</li>
