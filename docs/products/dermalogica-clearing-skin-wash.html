            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried many many products over the counter, through prescription and home remedies, but this one truly is great.</li>
            <li>I really love the way this makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a awesome product.</li>
            <li>This skin wash keeps my skin nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>I was looking far a great face wash for me, I tried everything</li>
            <li>As a gay man in his 30s, I&#x27;m no stranger to decades of skin-cleaning regimens.</li>
            <li>After experiencing some not so pleasant adult acne and trying a lot of drug store products, I turned to this in desperation.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth &amp; clean</li>
            <li>, I am so excited to find my face wash</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how clean my face feels.</li>
            <li>The only way is to buy it more at a more economical price.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh, and the makeup comes right off as well.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the price, I would think it would be stronger than the cheaper brands, but it&#x27;s actually weaker.</li>
            <li>I have heard that you shouldn&#x27;t trust certain products if not bought from original store ie</li>
            <li>I have purchased this cleanser from a dermatologist office but was very excited to find it considerable cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>* cleanser wasn&#x27;t right *</li>
            <li>The only thing was there was some gunk inside the pump, but that was really easy to clean out</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of trying something new when I ran out of my original Dermalogica.  </li>
            <li>I passed it along to my teenaged daughter, though, and she LOVES it - hasn&#x27;t been overly drying for her and has really cleared her face up!  </li>
            <li>At first, I broke out like a teenager all over again.</li>
            <li>but now I am able to use it daily.</li>
            <li>I did notice a funny smell when I first received the item, but overlooked it.</li>
            <li>love this stuff and use daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite acne wash for the body, effective without irritating.</li>
            <li>This is weaker than the over the counter clean n clear acne wash.</li>
            <li>Since buying the larger version, I have not had major breakouts, product smells good and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well.</li>
            <li>and it really cleaned</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, for my 30th birthday, I received a gift certificate for a Dermalogica facial.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>* help clear up some acne that was really bothering me.  </li>
            <li>I rarely break out when I use this on daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this product when recieving a facial.</li>
            <li>this product i first used at a salon getting a facial</li>
            <li>My face has never been more clear and I don&#x27;t find that this dries out my skin which is a major plus as I get very dry skin especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>It worked SO well that within 2 weeks my skin was completely clear.</li>
            <li>I had tried everything from proactiv to going to the dermatologist and getting prescription creams / oral medication and nothing could completely clear my skin.</li>
            <li>Product seems old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every face wash and skin product on the market (prescription / non-prescription) for acne.  </li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin, be cautious.  </li>
            <li>just bear in mind that not every product will be right for your skin and sometimes we have to go through a few different products before we find the one that is right for us.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>and this does a great job with out being harsh or irritating.  </li>
            <li>Helps clear up acne really well so long as you use it regularly.</li>
            <li>This face wash lasts me a long time because I only use a half a pump every time I wash my face, I find a whole pump to provide too much face wash.</li>
            <li>It is a big bottle, only use half a pump to wash my face, so my first bottle lasted over a year.</li>
            <li>I cannot use regular soaps or any other face wash for my very sensitive skin, so this face wash is a MUST in by bathroom at all times.</li>

            <li> I plan on ordering this product again but due to the large size of the bottle and the small amount that I need, it will be a long while......</li>
            <li> this size will last a very long time because you only need a small amount per use.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely caution 1st time users to only use a little bit not a full pump.</li>
            <li> I remember thinking how expensive it was, but that if it worked, it&#x27;d be worth it.</li>
            <li> I feel like other cleansers I have tried don&#x27;t get all my make-up off</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and since the last bottle I purchased on amazon, my skin is inflamed and broken out.</li>
            <li> Ever since then, over the past hrmph or hrmph years, I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t strayed and my skin has never looked brighter.</li>
            <li> I wonder if it&#x27;s being discontinued as I have been having a hard time finding it.</li>
            <li> ; dermalogica.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed as this is my first experience with amazon that the product was altered or is a fake!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> My skin is tough so this product is perfect!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product has not helped my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> Sadly this product just isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry Dermalogica for my wondering eye.  </li>
            <li> My face has broken out very badly because of it, and has stayed that way for a month now.</li>
            <li> I have oily and have had bad acne growing up.</li>
            <li> The product I used was overpriced and smelled horrible!  </li>

            <li> I wonder if it&#x27;s being discontinued as I have been having a hard time finding it. It&#x27;s my favorite acne wash for the body, effective without irritating.</li>
            <li> Product seems old. As if it was in a warehouse for a long time.. Have bought tis product from salons with no problems</li>
            <li> I would def purchase this product again. Great value. It&#x27;s so much more expensive at the spa I go to. It leaves your skin feeling clean. So far in conjunction with other ance prod&#x27;s (retin A) my acne is under control.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product when recieving a facial. Since buying the larger version, I have not had major breakouts, product smells good and leaves my skin feeling soft. I have oily and have had bad acne growing up. I&#x27;ve also tried many many products over the counter, through prescription and home remedies, but this one truly is great.</li>
            <li> This is weaker than the over the counter clean n clear acne wash. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the price, I would think it would be stronger than the cheaper brands, but it&#x27;s actually weaker.</li>
            <li> NUMBER FACE AND SKIN PRODUCT ON THE MARKET!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 TEN YEARS AND COUNTING MY FACE STILL ONLY WANT IS DERMALOGIC</li>
            <li> I cannot use regular soaps or any other face wash for my very sensitive skin, so this face wash is a MUST in by bathroom at all times. It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh, and the makeup comes right off as well. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with breakouts for years, and I finally came across this product one day in an Ulta store. I remember thinking how expensive it was, but that if it worked, it&#x27;d be worth it. It worked SO well that within 2 weeks my skin was completely clear. I had tried everything from proactiv to going to the dermatologist and getting prescription creams / oral medication and nothing could completely clear my skin. This is the only product that has worked for me. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This skin wash keeps my skin nice and clean.  I rarely break out when I use this on daily basis.  I use it in the morning and I use it in the evening and it does its job.  Great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product has not helped my skin at all.  My face has broken out very badly because of it, and has stayed that way for a month now. Sadly this product just isn&#x27;t for me.  I had such high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well. Helps clear up acne really well so long as you use it regularly. I actually got it faster than I was expecting. The only thing was there was some gunk inside the pump, but that was really easy to clean out so I&#x27;m not docking a star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every face wash and skin product on the market (prescription / non-prescription) for acne.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about six months and while I still get the occasional breakout, it has seemed to help reducing breakouts. It lathers well and smells good.</li>
            <li> *THIS* cleanser wasn&#x27;t right *for my skin* - it was just too drying.  But it *did* help clear up some acne that was really bothering me.  I passed it along to my teenaged daughter, though, and she LOVES it - hasn&#x27;t been overly drying for her and has really cleared her face up!  So I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because I believe it&#x27;s a great product - just bear in mind that not every product will be right for your skin and sometimes we have to go through a few different products before we find the one that is right for us.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this makes my face feel. At first, I broke out like a teenager all over again. I had to cut back to every other day usage for the first few weeks but now I am able to use it daily. I cannot believe how clean my face feels. My skin which tends to be oily is now balanced out. My pores have shrunk and there have been no further breakouts for me. I would definitely caution 1st time users to only use a little bit not a full pump. And when purchasing pay close attention to the OZ on your order. I believe they show a larger bottle but unless you click on that size you will order the smaller size....... I plan on ordering this product again but due to the large size of the bottle and the small amount that I need, it will be a long while......</li>
            <li> I have purchased this cleanser from a dermatologist office but was very excited to find it considerable cheaper on Amazon.  A bottle this size will last a very long time because you only need a small amount per use.  I feel like other cleansers I have tried don&#x27;t get all my make-up off and this does a great job with out being harsh or irritating.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> After experiencing some not so pleasant adult acne and trying a lot of drug store products, I turned to this in desperation. I love it! My face has never been more clear and I don&#x27;t find that this dries out my skin which is a major plus as I get very dry skin especially in the winter. This face wash lasts me a long time because I only use a half a pump every time I wash my face, I find a whole pump to provide too much face wash.</li>
            <li> I been using this for years and of cos i need it to be cheaper.  The only way is to buy it more at a more economical price.  That is why this 250ml size is great!</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of trying something new when I ran out of my original Dermalogica.  That was a mistake.  The product I used was overpriced and smelled horrible!  I&#x27;m sorry Dermalogica for my wondering eye.  I will never leave you again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE PRODUCTS ARE AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, be cautious.  My skin is tough so this product is perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wont be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I was looking far a great face wash for me, I tried everything but it left my face to oily or to dry, I used this product one time and my face felt like I just got a facial. My face feels so smooth &amp; clean, I am so excited to find my face wash and I will let everyone know. Thank you for making such a awesome product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and since the last bottle I purchased on amazon, my skin is inflamed and broken out. I did notice a funny smell when I first received the item, but overlooked it. I have heard that you shouldn&#x27;t trust certain products if not bought from original store ie; dermalogica.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed as this is my first experience with amazon that the product was altered or is a fake!&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> this product i first used at a salon getting a facial so i bought this and it really cleaned my skin.i wish i could get all the products.</li>
            <li> It was drying for my son&#x27;s acne skin.</li>
            <li> love this stuff and use daily. i will switch it up in the winter and use a cream cleanser as my skin is drier then</li>
            <li> As a gay man in his 30s, I&#x27;m no stranger to decades of skin-cleaning regimens. I&#x27;ve tried Clearisil, Olay, Proactiv, Nuetrogena, the list goes on. Lucky for me, for my 30th birthday, I received a gift certificate for a Dermalogica facial. It was life changing. Ever since then, over the past hrmph or hrmph years, I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t strayed and my skin has never looked brighter. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product, have bought it before. It is a big bottle, only use half a pump to wash my face, so my first bottle lasted over a year.</li>
