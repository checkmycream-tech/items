            <li>Cute and stamp perfectly</li>
            <li>i did love the weeds one but seemed to work best for me with a thinner polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - very happy with this product. :)</li>
            <li>It is okay but not the best.  </li>
            <li>She was more impressed with these as the etching was deeper then the ones she got with it</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase, and would recommend to others. :)</li>
            <li>It is a great product, just as good as the name brand.</li>
            <li>Most of the designs are great!</li>
            <li>Great etching and good pickup.</li>
            <li>A great buy and good value for my money.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I are VERY happy with these nail plates :).</li>
            <li>Quality is remarkable.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, a good selection of designs for a great price.</li>
            <li>The images look awesome and I am so excited to use these tonight after work!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried these with every kind of polish and paint I have, and I haven&#x27;t liked the result even when the stamp was perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use (for ideas, you can go to YouTube and type in Shany Nail Art and there are a bunch of videos) and the designs come out looking great!</li>
            <li>Great set with cute images!</li>
            <li>great deal on a great product will buy more.  </li>
            <li>currently I own another brands image plates and I&#x27;ve been looking for some more and these just seem perfect.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing considering the great quality of the nail art.</li>
            <li>This is a good way to save money on fancy designs.     </li>
            <li>I think the shany ones are good for a beginner</li>
            <li>The plates work just as good as my cheeky and bundle monster.</li>
            <li>oh and the shippping was good.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the results.  </li>
            <li>this is good quality    </li>
            <li>Not as good as Konad plates, but it works -</li>
            <li>These plates are not as good as KONAD brand.</li>
            <li>Im not to good at this yet</li>
            <li>These plates work as described and they&#x27;re a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>so I thought this would be a good assortment to get.  </li>
            <li>So I was thinking that i got a good deal</li>
            <li>She loved them and has used them quite a bit since Christmas.</li>
            <li>One had a scare but work good</li>
            <li>Recommend this product to anyone who has a wife that loves to keep her nails looking good.</li>
            <li>I recieved these on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I used these on my nails and loved the look.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>But once you get that hang of using them they work good</li>
            <li>nail designs is a good size and fits on all my nails( even my thumb)&lt;br /&gt;Great variety of designs</li>
            <li>I bought this product since it had good reviews.</li>
            <li>Really loved this item.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t do your nails that often it&#x27;s a good set to have on hand.</li>
            <li>The concept is good.</li>
            <li>You get 25 image plates for a really good price</li>
            <li>for 25 plates, I figured that even if I got 2 good plates, it would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some of the designs I will probably never use, but there are plenty to like in this pack, and at a good price (the Konad stamping plates by comparison cost an arm and a leg).</li>
            <li>These stamp well, design wise</li>
            <li>like i said though, some of them did work and turned out really good.</li>
            <li>Good for Amazon.</li>
            <li>I think Shany provided a good variety of designs, but all the nail polish comes off when I scrape</li>
            <li>The konad brand are a good choice, but there are cheaper alternatives that turned out really good.</li>
            <li>Not as good and Bundle Monster or Konad.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.  </li>
            <li>The designs are good however.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy these unless you&#x27;re already great with this kind of nail art.</li>
            <li>I loved the designs.</li>
            <li>But either way  just as good as KONAD.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Shany is just as good as Konad</li>
            <li>If you want to be able to create your own awesome nail art but aren&#x27;t quite up to the free hand standards you&#x27;d like to display on your hands, these are an awesome solution once you get the hang of how to use them!</li>
            <li>But on the plus side, the designs are gorgeous and you have plenty to choose from and will never run out of ways to use them.</li>
            <li>My girfriend bought this for her nails the designes are done good.</li>
            <li>good buy if your are in to the nails desgin thing.</li>
            <li>Some good images.</li>
            <li>good for some design.</li>
            <li>LOOKS LIKE A GOOD SET WITH EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN TO USE.  </li>
            <li>The plates are good quality.  </li>
            <li>; there&#x27;s a gorgeous variety of stencils.</li>
            <li>This was a good deal.</li>
            <li>The plates are a good quality.  </li>
            <li>The Bundle Monsters are really good.</li>
            <li>but I loved the idea.  </li>
            <li>I loved these plates.</li>
            <li>Thee are very fun and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>When I use the ORIGINAL KONDAD DISK IT WORKED, THE IMAGE CAME OUT PERFECT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that there are supposedly better brands of plates, but I don&#x27;t even feel the need to search for others, because Shany did a great job with these ones, and at an amazing price too!</li>
            <li>In fact I used one to supplement a full nail design and it turned out really awesome.</li>
            <li>gettin me my own selection :P  </li>
            <li>Now I do my own and they look amazing!</li>
            <li>All the stamp are cute and most of them come out perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Luckily these plates work perfectly!  </li>
            <li>Very fun way to do your own nails and make them look great!</li>
            <li>the nail designs are amazing and so very easy to apply!</li>
            <li>So pleased with my order, and the price was great.</li>
            <li>These polishes are great because you get so many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves them and it is real easy to do her nails now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they would be happy to help.</li>
            <li>Love it work great</li>
            <li>They are work wonderfully and are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>ok i&#x27;ll be happy with my purchase, so for now i&#x27;m on the fence.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>The designs on these plates are very cute.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I chose this brand.</li>
            <li>i wish there were more seasonal but great anyway also</li>
            <li>Very cute designs.  </li>
            <li>There is a lot of variety in this set, and once I figured out how to use these plates, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>Forget Konad, these are just as great, besides by paying about 4-5 or more for a Konad plate, you are just purchasing the name tag after all.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel like they have very cute designs.</li>
            <li>Designs are very cute lots of floral patterns</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m soo happy I picked this package :)</li>

            <li>these imagge plates are amazing</li>
            <li>The price I paid was amazing and being a Prime customer</li>
            <li>Oh and the designs are amazing.  </li>
            <li>and they all turned out amazing.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I am a newbie in Nail art but those plates are just amazing.</li>
            <li>These Plates Are AMAZING</li>
            <li>The price was amazing for the number of plates I received.</li>
            <li>; you made an amazing product.</li>
            <li>The image selection is amazing.</li>
            <li>The range of designs on these are amazing.  </li>
            <li>GOOD JOB SHANY:)</li>
            <li>The images come out nicely and I would have given them 5 stars</li>
            <li>But for the most part, I loved the images.    </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t liked it.</li>
            <li>But I do own the bundle monster set.</li>
            <li>I can do my own nails now.</li>
            <li>service was good and the price was ok.</li>
            <li>The palettes work flawlessly and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>No one can believe that I painted my own nails.  </li>
            <li>I picked this brand because it was the cheapest, but now I see that Konad and BM seem to have a lot more attractive and cute designs on their plates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say about three or four, so that was kind of a bummer.</li>
            <li>the scrapers will scratch the metal plates, but it does NOT affect your stamp design (for me, it is a good indicator of designs i&#x27;ve already used) :)</li>
            <li>Some designs are better than others, but if you&#x27;re looking to add some variety to your set, this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li>and I liked the designs offered with this SHANY set</li>
            <li>I liked it alot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having your own nail salon at home.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Shany because I liked the images.</li>
            <li>The images are really nice and even have some holiday images in there too.</li>
            <li>so you get a nice result for your nails.</li>
            <li>Mine are beginning to work really nice for me</li>
            <li>Lots of nice designs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Once they came in I was thrilled to try it.</li>
            <li>I love shany products and have had an over all good experience with them.</li>
            <li>I got these to start my nail art collection, and I must say I am loving them.</li>
            <li>Nice product and service.</li>
            <li>The handy scraper included is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>my daughter really liked it</li>
            <li>it is a nice product.</li>
            <li>its nice nedw</li>
            <li>so for most it just don&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li>I liked the package it came with.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for all the wonderful deals.</li>
            <li>Some of them are good and the designs are cute.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>Awesome designs great way to do your nails at a short period of time.</li>
            <li>There are so many designs and this product is great quality, at a great price. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li>These plates werent as good as i wanted them to be, most of the designs werent even showing up because the plates werent ingraved that well.</li>
            <li>Currently, I own Shany make up palette, Shany magnetic polish, Shany nail art pen and these stamp plates</li>
            <li>they print very well, and the transfer flawlessly.</li>
            <li>They Came So FAST Best Shippment</li>
            <li>but after I got that out of the way I really liked them.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to know that there was another item needed in order to use these plates</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned my own set of these for a while now, but I just bought these for my niece.  </li>
            <li>t doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what kind of nail polish I use, it just doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>It was well packaged and comes in its own box to keep them in.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints at all about that as I&#x27;ve had really good luck with these, and I&#x27;m glad I started out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be honest and cut to the chase.</li>
            <li>It takes practice and finding your own technique.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have a lot of time to play today, but did try one image, and it worked nicely.  </li>
            <li>these plates easy to use and give nice detail to someone that is wanting to look amazing in every detail!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE NAIL PLATES!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to use at all! &lt;3</li>
            <li>They are awesome for a quick nail job and they look so cool!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, great, fun product!</li>
            <li>I would love it if i could find some more that worked amazingly!</li>
            <li>They are high quality, and the image selection is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Once the plastic is peeled off, you&#x27;ll find a mirror finish plate underneath with high quality images that work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I waited to do my review because I didn&#x27;t have very good luck at first, and I didn&#x27;t know if it was my fault or the plates.</li>
            <li>cute designs, great packaging, easy to use (with the Konad stamper and scraper</li>
            <li>the designs are very cute :)</li>
            <li>they all beautiful and unique :) the Plates are amazing you got everything that you want n need for your nails design :) and the price is just great and worth it!</li>
            <li>The Shany plates work wonderfully and are able to produce clean, detailed stamps.</li>
            <li>there isnt anything super great here</li>
            <li>This came fast, and I was able to give as a gift on time, I consider this the best service.</li>
            <li>there great designs and so easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li>She found them very easy to use - and declared this the &amp;#34;Best</li>
            <li>Very easy.</li>
            <li>it is very easy and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are very easy to use and manage .</li>
            <li>/&gt;They just need to come out with a way of storing them so they don&#x27;t get scratched (which is very easy to do as with any shiny metal product).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it had so many designs that I had to love it!</li>
            <li>great price for the amount of plates, very fast Delivery!</li>
            <li>If you love doing nails you will definately love these!</li>
            <li>but it anyways, it was a pretty good price for 25 image plates!</li>
            <li>I love these plates and I&#x27;m sure you will too!</li>
            <li>Again these are very nice really good quality plates nice print easy to use easy clean up and amazing results....</li>
            <li>It adds just the right touch to look fab!!!</li>
            <li>The color never comes out right on my nails!!!</li>
            <li>I liked most of the images on the plates.</li>
            <li>So far, every image I&#x27;ve used has been great!  </li>
            <li>Plus, as a college student, this saves me money by being able to do my own nails for practically nothing.</li>
            <li>I have used image plates before and have had great success.</li>
            <li>So, if anyone would be so kind as to post an image their plate SH15, I would most appreciate it.</li>
            <li>Made of good material, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak from a professional view, but I can say they made my lil ladies happy!</li>
            <li>I have to be honest, I haven&#x27;t used many of the designs yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They offer so many choices to make really nice nails.</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to see how cheap it was!</li>
            <li>cuz just about any cheap nail polishes work just as good.</li>
            <li>i got really nice designs love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these plates are just okay, kind of blah images.</li>
            <li>Great fun.</li>
            <li>My grand daughters are thrilled.</li>
            <li>That would make it more effective.</li>
            <li>So many nice designs...</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first set of plates, hoping they&#x27;d fit the Konad stamping equipment and they were perfect.  </li>
            <li>this set comes with so many varieties and options and i absolutely think its amazing!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had MORE FUN doing my nails!!!</li>
            <li>you want with these easy to use nail art polish stamps!</li>
            <li>these are easy to maintain as well!</li>
            <li>These stamps are ao easy to use!</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>the price, I&#x27;m satisfied, because those stamps that work look very very cool!</li>
            <li>Images are fun and cute, great variety.</li>
            <li>There are so many designs to choose from and it&#x27;s very easy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, just be sure to use a thicker polish.  </li>
            <li>The item was shipped very fast and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li>I used them easily and the result is stunning!</li>
            <li>love them and work great with the right polish</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are more than enough design options here for an experienced user, and it&#x27;s a great set for a beginner.</li>
            <li>Otherwise pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>so beautiful high recommend!</li>
            <li>and it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I came home and found this deal (too good to be true???) -</li>
            <li>This is very cheap for these nail stamping plates.</li>
            <li>They are very cheap feeling; they are probably 70% thinner than the Konad plates or the plates that came in the Salon Express kit I bought.  </li>
            <li>Besides that the images are very clear and they stamp very good.</li>
            <li>The design when applied to nail is very light to having gaps in the design.</li>
            <li>as I said, KONAD plates are much better - the designs are cut deeper into the plates, they go onto the stamper beautifully and with the whole design</li>
            <li>It works perfect because I have small fingers and the images come out great.</li>
            <li>The protective plastic coating peeled off nicely and easily.</li>
            <li>a great buy and easy and fun to do.</li>
            <li>The images are wonderful, the shipping was super fast (I ordered it week before xmas and was expecting it to be here in Jan.)</li>
            <li>Once I found the little plastic cover and pulled it off they are beautiful and what kept them beautiful The Plastic Covering for shipping.</li>
            <li>They make a great design nail or a super fun set of nails!</li>
            <li>Got my item today, all there great little pack lots of designs no duplicates all fun designs just a great item and all for a great price</li>
            <li>and she is a huge fan of having kitty nails!  </li>
            <li>I need more time to use them.</li>
            <li>Amaizing I love it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li>I love the designs in there.</li>
            <li>love the detail of each one.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>btw did i say the designs are so cute :)</li>
            <li>AND IM NOT DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
            <li>If the backing was easier to remove, and some of the designs worked better</li>
            <li>\\&quot;ok</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re much better quality and designs than shany image plates</li>
            <li>This is so much more work than I want to do when I buy a plate.</li>
            <li>with most polishes and even acrylic paint.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they would for me.</li>
            <li>I love all of the designs and have also done my nails for 8th grade graduation.</li>
            <li>Havent used them yet, but love all the designs.</li>
            <li>but i personaly think they are better than konad</li>
            <li>they are more bolder and have cute desins</li>
            <li>Now onto the images: I love about 90% of the images.  </li>
            <li>so many of them appealed to me.  </li>
            <li>i love this nail art set.</li>
            <li>The point is to be creative with what you are given.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I would have much rather paid this price than almost $200.00 for as many plates from Konad.hese plates, and while some of the images are ones I will never use, and some don&#x27;t come out that great</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find a better deal for these disc&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I tried the plates with regular nail polish and they stamped great, got a good variety although I did get 1 duplicate plate.</li>
            <li>, you cannot beat the price &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>cause I have so many to choose from.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mostly use the Sally Hansen Insta Dri line.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more</li>
            <li>I LOVE that I can do nail designs without making an appointment at the salon.  </li>
            <li>I love them, it works with the holder and stamper</li>
            <li>I love the variety of Shany nail plates.</li>
            <li>I love the stamps alone or combined with others.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am now able to do my nails without the stress of a faulty plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took about three attempts before I was able to get the hang of how to work the stamp</li>
            <li>I got these plates as a gift for my birthday and in love with them.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for nail plates that have more images besides hearts and flowers.  </li>
            <li>When I was ordering I wasn&#x27;t sure if it came with a stamp or scraper...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re hopefully not:)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The Konad ones are thicker and noticeably more rigid.</li>
            <li>Also these plates fit nicely into the Konad plate holder, if you already have one.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>-OK</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure they have plenty of tutorials or on these reviews</li>
            <li>but im sure</li>
            <li>in time I&#x27;ll get better at it.</li>
            <li>I Love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try them on my summer pedi:)</li>
            <li>I love to do zebra and cheetah nails</li>
            <li>Love the variety of images for just about any occasion.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>

            <li>The images turned out MUCH better after I took time to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However most the &#x27;full-nail&#x27; designs won&#x27;t cover your thumb nail</li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t like this, but I was ok with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love using them</li>
            <li>The concept looked interesting, and the price was a steal compared to uying them elsewhere, so I bought them immediately.</li>

            <li>.. ships to Canada which was a bonus... :)</li>
            <li>I use the gelish nails and apply the stamps on before the top coat</li>
            <li>Love Them</li>
            <li>Yes, most of them do the job, but then there are others that just don&#x27;t show up at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love them, everyone complements my nails when i used these.  </li>
            <li>Well, thank you Shany for helping me save some time when I mostly need it.</li>
            <li>I love my stamps</li>
            <li>I opened the gift and just wasn&#x27;t really sure what to do with them.</li>
            <li>I like most of the plates</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>girls love this.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>most of the images didnt work.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times i read the instructions and even look up tutorials on youtube, this does not work.</li>
            <li>Love the plate holder.</li>
            <li>but I will not be buying any more shiny plates again.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s safe to hold.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love these image plates</li>
            <li>If you love your nails painted but can&#x27;t afford to get them done</li>
            <li>My favorite thing was the spider web and animal print designs.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>love love them.</li>
            <li>My grand daughters and I have play make-up days and they will do my nails and I will do theirs.</li>
            <li>Im sure over time, I will get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>These plates are fantastic!</li>
            <li>There are so many designs to choose from.</li>
            <li>They have so many designs on them</li>
            <li>My sisters and mom love the plates and are always asking me to do their nails now.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these plates.</li>
            <li>so glad you guys are offering to fix this.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I really love the design.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>She loves getting her nails done by mommy. :)</li>
            <li>but i wished it didnt have so many on all of them</li>
            <li>ok.....</li>
            <li>the blue plastic that is on them when you get them is a pain in the butt to remove, but once thats off they are awesome!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not giving up hope because the designs are really cute.</li>
            <li>Maybe someone else will have better luck.</li>
            <li>I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;All models works, it depends on the technique you use to apply</li>
            <li>but I was not even able to give it as a gift.  </li>
            <li>: use nail art polish or you won&#x27;t be able to see design regardless of color.</li>
            <li>It is perfect all different seasons!</li>
            <li>Just bought these and love them.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the case with most of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were okay.</li>
            <li>r so many to choose from</li>
            <li>but I love the packaging</li>
            <li>Will buy again :) or as a gift</li>
            <li>I love how elegant my nails look after using them.</li>
            <li>I would give this a try and you will love this product.</li>

            <li>so you know I&#x27;ve done many comparisons).</li>
            <li>The newer ones are better.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt I&#x27;ll order more if they come out with them.</li>

            <li>And, this product is SO cheap!</li>

            <li>I have to get used to applying top coat without smudging the intricate designs, but aside from that, I am becoming a pro at this</li>
            <li>I think on 1/24/12 so pretty good on the shipping imo.  </li>
            <li>with the konad plates you can almost always get a good transfer on your first attempt.</li>
            <li>I tried my first nail stamp and loved it.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of doing it, they turn out pretty good.</li>
            <li>The Halloween selection of images is pretty good on this set.  </li>
            <li>I find many of my school mates are very interested in obtaining their own.</li>
            <li>The large, full nail images were a breeze to use and were beautiful.</li>

            <li>Some came off easily but for the most part I had to struggle to get them off</li>
            <li>So far it works great, I&#x27;m waiting on my konad stamper to come, which i hope is tomorrow, but i used an eraser top to see if it would catch the image</li>
            <li>very faster to use and has nice picture for nails for all ages nice for womens and mens...</li>
            <li>The designs are nice and good for a 4 year old.  </li>
            <li>very nice gift to my wife, nice designs 25 of those plates, really good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging should be slightly better as by the time i received the parcel, the plates are out of the small paper pack.</li>
            <li>The designs come up very nice with normal nail polishes.  </li>
            <li>We have had so much fun with it - now I just have to buy more of them!</li>
            <li>The designs came out nice, as I desired on the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it arrived in one week, please note I live in the Caribbean, so that time frame was excellent!</li>
            <li>Now I just need to go get some more nail polishes to have some more fun with these!</li>
            <li>For this many plates and stamps, it is so affordable and such a good price!</li>
            <li>Very good overall, I would recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li>BUT it&#x27;s better than free handing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to pull it away from the edge of the disk and remove it smoothly in one piece.</li>
            <li>and well i just love using this product i love all these designs and am just thrilled to have this and thankful for Shany for getting these amazing plates and for a low price:)</li>
            <li>Each plate has 6-8 different designs and altogether you have more than a hundred beautiful designs.</li>
            <li>so I switched to an old store rewards card with great results.</li>
            <li>I received my shipment sooner than expected which is great!</li>
            <li>thats just one thing I love about SHANY and amazon great products at low prices :)</li>
            <li>Then I loaned them to my daughter who had fun with her nails and is going to order her own set.  </li>
            <li>than that it has some good images very thing</li>
            <li>it is so cool and so easy to do!</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how easy they are to use and how great my nails end up looking.</li>
            <li>a good nail Polish has to be very pigmented and u gotta be very quick at it</li>
            <li>The price was cheap compared to many other brands/sellers that I looked through and the quality is great!</li>
            <li>my 7yr old uses it the most!!  </li>
            <li>The brush is fine tipped which helps with getting a more precise line.</li>
            <li>and I look forward to creating more unique looks using these plates.    </li>
            <li>Full finger designs are a pain!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to experiment a lot more with these plates.  </li>
            <li>i was excited to get my plates today, and when i opened my pacage the top plate was scraped and the box looked like it had been opened by someone.</li>
            <li>But for the price, more than worth it!  </li>
            <li>so then I scraped the excess polish the other way and it stamped perfectly every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first stamping set and i&#x27;&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The designs transfer easily.</li>
            <li>The protective tape is easy to peel off as while.</li>
            <li>this set is so easy to use</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to count 2 as 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sounds easy?</li>
            <li>It is completely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I even had a preteen that could use them easily.  </li>
            <li>I got the set that has the easy to remove plastic but</li>
            <li>THESE ARE GREAT AND A BIG VARIETY PACK WHICH IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES THAT COME IN THE STAMP KIT</li>
            <li>They are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who would want easy salon style nail art at home.</li>
            <li>I love the images overall great product.</li>
            <li>They were easy to unwrap, sort, and</li>
            <li>- These plates do scratch easily</li>
            <li>plastic covering was easy to remove with the aid of tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These plates are easy to use.</li>
            <li>I purchased stickers but didn&#x27;t do any justice and would peel off easily.</li>
            <li>i am actually ordering more disc because i am so happy with this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and they stamp well.</li>
            <li>My str loves them and they r so easy to use.</li>

            <li>Most of the designs transfer cleanly to the nail.</li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It came very quickly .I</li>
            <li>&amp; once you get the hang of them they are easy.</li>
            <li>and it was so easy to make my nails look like a pro</li>
            <li>Once I did that,it so easy.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched YouTube videos and the individuals make it look so easy; however, it&#x27;s not as easy as it looks.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use</li>
            <li>really easily though</li>
            <li>The plates are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I received them very quickly.</li>
            <li>Cleans up is easy just use water in stead of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>I can easily see how one would slice their finger(s) using them</li>
            <li>so the polish dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>it was well and nice package, arrived in good time and is being used, requirement where and sometime the box is way to big</li>
            <li>The quality of the plates are nice and are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>and my wife liked very much</li>
            <li>While I was removing the plastic I used a fine diamond foot file to smooth the edges and make them safer and more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Even holding them gently feels risky.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a whole lot for a great price :)</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product and excited to use them more.</li>
            <li>even for me!haha i would recommend this to everyone its fun and easy and the designs are super cute!</li>
            <li>I used my metal scraper a bit to help remove the backing it worked fine.</li>
            <li>then just know it is only the plates, which are pretty awesome!</li>
            <li>The plates are fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;MOST of the plates work just fine.</li>
            <li>I had no problem even with a fine detail design.</li>
            <li>Purchased the set based on it being a damaged box, which was fine because I don&#x27;t care about the box I care about the contents, I received them on the date specified.</li>
            <li>3 of them will fit 27 plates easily and you can see what you have, instead of shuffling through.</li>
            <li>The product seems to be fine, I received it on-time.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The packaging it came in was just fine, no rips or tears in the plastic that it came</li>
            <li>I just ordered the Bundle Monsters 2012 and it seems like they have waaay more pretty images and better reviews.</li>
            <li>They said it would be totally fine, and I was like \\&quot;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>it comes out just fine.</li>
            <li>The ones I tried worked fine.</li>
            <li>There are so many designs to choose from, and they all are pretty cute designs as well!&lt;br /</li>

            <li>designs are super cute.</li>
            <li>You might take a little time to stamp perfectly, but is easy to learn.</li>
            <li>I love these and they are super cheap as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and so many fun designs, some are repeats though.</li>
            <li>Nice looking packagd well and super fun to use.</li>
            <li>I cant believe how easy it was to use Shany has made these amazing plates with really fast shipping..</li>
            <li>For thumbnails, many of the all-over designs have coordinating tip designs or single image designs that look great.  </li>
            <li>The plates are awesome and have tons of cool possibilities, I on the other hand teehee have no idea how to do it.</li>
            <li>These plates are super fun and are definitely worth getting!!!</li>
            <li>I recommend them to anyone who&#x27;s looking to buy for their first time! :)</li>
            <li>the designs are soo cute and pretty!</li>
            <li>Great price for 25 different stamp plates with 10 designs on each plate - tons of artistic nail design options!  </li>
            <li>I am not the most artistic person ever, but this set lets me have all those fun nail designs without breaking the bank to pay someone to do it!</li>
            <li>Luckily she didn&#x27;t go to church or school with colorful pot leaves all over her fingers!!  </li>
            <li>I was super excited by these designs!</li>
            <li>You have a huge selection of stamps to chose from, too.</li>
            <li>This means that some of the stamps I couldn&#x27;t even use at all, what a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was a great variety of images for various occasions.  </li>
            <li>THEY WORK GREAT WITH REGULAR STORE BOUGHT NAIL POLISH!!</li>
            <li>Love the small nail designs, not that impressed with the full nail.</li>
            <li>These were such a great price I could&#x27;t resist.  </li>
            <li>they are very prompt and courteous.  </li>
            <li>I got free two-day shipping.  </li>
            <li>These are a great alternative and are almost the same thing.</li>
            <li>Images transferred well and product is packaged securely.</li>
            <li>These plates have so many fun designs.  </li>
            <li>Oh and I was happy about the price because I did not want to spend around  $6 per plate like the well known name brand plates (especially being a newbie).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just unacceptable, regardless of how cheap the product is.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you peel the one you want before applying fresh polish.  </li>
            <li>I felt this set and my french manicure set were a great match.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must say that I own so much nail polish</li>
            <li>There are some for holidays, seasons, an elegant event or just for fun.</li>
            <li>They worked fantastic.</li>
            <li>Also remember to use a rolling motion and do not just slap the stamper onto the plate, roll the stamper onto the plate with a light hand just like you would apply it to your nail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hope continues to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why &#x27;reviews&#x27; are so important.</li>
            <li>will say that i&#x27;ll probably suck it up and pay the $7 for a few konad plates because i know how awesome they turn out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The problem is that the edges of each plate were never buffed smooth after they were punched out of the sheet of metal.  </li>
            <li>Now, I think I realize why the plates were so cheap - they were scratched.</li>
            <li>It was great to have this as an extra for a friend to use (I think it is about $5).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its not for experienced nail stampers as the designs are too simple.</li>
            <li>The designs fit my nails</li>
            <li>The hello kitty one stamps really light, so you can not see it.</li>
            <li>A million times cheaper then buying the plate from a Konad place for 30 bucks when here you can get everything from your home and cheap.</li>
            <li>These nail art image plates are loaded with FABULOUS designs...</li>
            <li>The cut out images are fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m much better on the up-keep on my nails since it has become so much fun</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tried with the French style plates and it worked as great as the name brand ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>They lost a star from me because I had to sand the edges smooth.  </li>
            <li>cheap</li>
            <li>This manicure set is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a set of Bundle Monster and a few Konad plates, and I have to say I am extraordinarily impressed with Shany!</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great value for your pocket.</li>
            <li>I just used regular nail art polish and it worked great.</li>
            <li>These plates really come in handy when doing nail art.</li>
            <li>this is so fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The nail polish laid out smooth and images transferred onto my Konad (cheapest thing about Konad?)</li>
            <li>and so they are not as detailed when used.  </li>
            <li>They have great designs and different types for all ages.</li>
            <li>My friends and family have more fun with these.</li>
            <li>Great plates just like the last set I ordered.</li>
            <li>but I was overall happy.</li>
            <li>But the designs that did work are really light.</li>
            <li>I placed my order yesterday, got the email that confirmed the shipping yesterday and they were in my mailbox by the time I got home from work today.</li>
            <li>easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>There are a ton of different symbols and designs to pick from and great for any age group.</li>
            <li>quietly was great.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a product you will regret going cheap on.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I use these for my nails, They are great on my arts and crafts too.</li>
            <li>It comes in a box where the plates fit snug inside and it has a magnetic closure.  </li>
            <li>Clean up easy.</li>
            <li>These image plates work great if you have the proper opacity of nail polishes</li>
            <li>I will simply free hand designs and forget this.</li>
            <li>these are the Shany plates available.</li>
            <li>They fit in about any nail plate holder, I have the Salon Express, and they fit on the holder, others claim that it fits on Konad&#x27;s holder as well&lt;br /</li>
            <li>&quot; time together, and stamping makes it even more fun.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of different patterns, and the quality of the stamps is great.</li>
            <li>But I would never pay more than $20 for these plates because anything more you might as well buy the real thing (In my opinion)</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This is good if you are just starting, still learning how to make cuter nails, and want more then just a color.</li>
            <li>The delivery was also fast (it only took a week) which I&#x27;m really happy about!</li>
            <li>, ordered them added one nail polish and used a yen knife to clean the excess polish and quickly stamped the pâté and then stamped my ail, couldn&#x27;t be more happier.</li>
            <li>it is everything i was hoping for , it is really a good buy , and when you do the 25 dollar total for free shipping its a steal&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li>and so I made sure I used the right polishes and stamped away.  </li>
            <li>and worth the price, they make it very easy to have pretty nails!</li>
            <li>This is because there are just so many plates, they were too heavy for the plastic wrap they were in (so, it could be looked at as a good thing!).  </li>
            <li>This is a great value for everything included, I have tried to buy stamps from other places and they cost way more than these.</li>
            <li>It really does!!!  </li>
            <li>Very fun, I bet kids would have a blast with this.</li>
            <li>This is a very useful, and inclusive set of plates.</li>
            <li>full nail stamps fit my nails just fine.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this item, so when I did it was a huge disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The full nail images and tips work just find and cover my nails just fine</li>
            <li>Over all decent quality, nice storage box and none of mine were damaged at all.</li>
            <li>I was using Konad polish and it seemed to dry before I was able to stamp a good image.  </li>
            <li>and I was delighted and surprised to receive them so quickly.</li>
            <li>Whereas for me the single images work perfect, but I can&#x27;t do the whole nail</li>
            <li>My final price ended up being 9.99 which is absolutely amazing for a 25 piece collection!  </li>
            <li>and once I learned to take off the blue covering, they worked amazingly well!</li>
            <li>I was SO excited when my order came, up until I opened the package.</li>
            <li>I just received my order of the 25 image plates, and so far I am very pleased-</li>
            <li>The clip art is so much fun!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found this product here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use them at first because I wasn&#x27;t confident with</li>
            <li>I bought these so that i would be able to stamp different designs on my nails, it was an awesome deal... when i recieved them they were opened, scratched up and the grooves arent deep enought to even stamp with.</li>
            <li>They work just as well as the Konad plates and are much more reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had too great of luck with it, but a few of my friends have used them before and had great turnouts and designs, so</li>
            <li>These are so much fun!</li>
            <li>There are hundreds of unique designs.</li>
            <li>but i was too excited about the amount of designs i was getting for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These nail plates are so much fun!  </li>
            <li>definitely recommend these to anyone wanting to add nice plates to their collection!</li>
            <li>Just love the plates they are Awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;very fast Delivery!  </li>
            <li>Love this so much!</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive my image plates and at the price for 25 of them, it was a steal.</li>

            <li>Original review:</li>
            <li>At first i was glad they cane</li>
            <li>The images are pretty cute, but there are about 10 plates that I would never ever use.  </li>
            <li>Its a great buy personally they stamp nicely and clearly</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product</li>
            <li>I am excited to use them tonight.</li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was excited to see all the additional designs offered by SHANY.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I am not the first one to say this.  </li>
            <li>My sister and I had a lot of fun playing with these nail plates!</li>
            <li>There is so many different designs and all of them is so cute !</li>
            <li>I love how it is a consistent look every time, whereas doing designs freehand</li>
            <li>then it does with my original kit....</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first after reading the reviews, but I am so glad I purchased them.  </li>
            <li>but I am already so excited to try it (waiting for my stamper to arrive).</li>
            <li>They are really into nails and design and this was great for different designs and a way for them to be creative</li>
            <li>I am not an expert nail stamper yet, but these have a lot of fun designs and give me a lot to choose from!</li>
            <li>Overall good quality and works fine with any nail polish.</li>
            <li>These plates work very well and are easy to use!</li>
            <li>these look like a fun and easy way to make my nails stand out an look unique.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fun.</li>
            <li>By the way I bought it from Amazon in March 2012 shipped with Eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping from SHANY Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>After buying so many nail polishes I wanted to get something that would help me create cute designs to complete my manicure.</li>
            <li>Nail Art Polish Stamp Manicure Image Plates set of 25pcs]]I found these so easy and fun to use.</li>
            <li>you can clean the nail polish off of.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I cut myself on the edges twice while removing it and had to clean blood off the plates.</li>
            <li>I know that most people who are looking for these plates would already know that, but it would be nice if there was something in the product description that states which tools you will need to actually use the plates.</li>
            <li>all of the grand kids had fun just playing with acylic paint and stamping just for the fun of it.</li>
            <li>Such a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Also some of the images work better with certain polishes than others but there is a tendency of encountering this with off brand plates and its one of those things I&#x27;ve just learned to deal with, like Konad Special Stamping Polish usually works best on troublesome plates.</li>
            <li>The plates work great... only if you have the right nail polish.</li>
            <li>We have used a lot of them, and the thing I like the most is that there is a variety of super tiny images, which is perfect for super tiny fingers.</li>
            <li>These plates are completely easy to use and look great, all you need is the right type of polish, the right color combinations, and a bit of creativity to mix and match the different designs.  </li>
            <li>High quality...not flimsy like some others out there and super fun!!!</li>
            <li>I find that this allows me to have some room for \\&quot;positioning error\\&quot;, whereas using the image the other way would require perfect positioning in order to cover the whole width of the nail.  </li>
            <li>All of the  images are useable for me, you don&#x27;t need special stamping polish.</li>
            <li>(Special Introductory Price)]] and not the scraper that is included with it to apply the designs to my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I couldn&#x27;t figure out that I would need special nail polish to use it.</li>
            <li>But they wouldn&#x27;t work with my special Konad nail polish.</li>
            <li>I bought the plates and the stamp/scraper set; i didnt buy the  special polishes</li>
            <li>I was right!</li>
            <li>+, I would be PISSED right now!</li>
            <li>But to my surprise they peeled right off!  </li>
            <li>My oldest daughter bought these with her Christmas money from Amazon and was super excited to get them.  </li>
            <li>They have a wide selection of designs and are a really great deal.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I use nail polish from Wet n Wild/Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear to stamp, and it works great.</li>
            <li>looks so cute on very polished and i adore them on my toes.  </li>
            <li>I would have much rather paid this price than almost $200.00 for as many plates from Konad.</li>
            <li>There are a handfull of images that I can&#x27;t see myself ever using, but there are still a lot of cool ones.</li>
            <li>just make sure you use a very saturated nail color of polish for it.</li>
            <li>But over all its cool, it just takes practice.  </li>
            <li>If you learn how to use them, it is fun and you will enjoy it every time you look at them.</li>
            <li>I have not try it yet, but the images are cool.</li>
            <li>Most work very well (depending on the thickness of the nailpolish.)</li>
            <li>(cool...</li>
            <li>cool--</li>
            <li>(now to try my luck at a full nail design!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once i unstuck them, I had the full count..</li>
            <li>On the whole I&#x27;m satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>The Konad one is thicker and the company took more time to make sure their edges are round and nice.  </li>
            <li>-  The full nail patterns do not cover all of your thumb...</li>
            <li>The etching just wasn&#x27;t good enough to hold the polish so that I could stamp the images.</li>
            <li>I bet if I used these they would be cool.</li>
            <li>for the most part I really really like the designs!&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many designs to choose from - which was the hardest part about the whole process.</li>
            <li>I got this because I thought it was SUCH a good deal.</li>
            <li>Some cool designs.</li>
            <li>Please read my full review before forming an opinion.  </li>
            <li>I am scratching an X across the designs that don&#x27;t work if one or two on a plate are good and on plates that are totally unusable, I&#x27;m tossing them in the trash.</li>
            <li>Told all my cousins and friends about this and promised them cool nail art.</li>
            <li>Most of these stamps work really well</li>
            <li>I reccieved this as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend who was just looking for some cool nail accessories for me.</li>
            <li>Until then, I won&#x27;t be making purchases from SHANY again as they cannot be trusted to provide that full set of items nor can they be trusted to rectify any errors/problems in your order.</li>
            <li>This product it overall good for the price.</li>
            <li>I was really expecting more</li>
            <li>Lots of cool designs.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a cool idea</li>
            <li>I have watched several videos on youtube showing the gorgeous designs that you can make with this.</li>
            <li>I did my nails with one of the full nail designs and couldn&#x27;t stop looking at my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so naturally I must own everything trending in nail art.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted to have some really cool nail art.</li>
            <li>Even my own 19 yr old daughter, said it look like it was a used item.  </li>
            <li>These are really cool.</li>
            <li>i love chris brown soooooo much</li>
            <li>had such good luck with walmart kit.</li>
            <li>larger full nail designs are good though, I did not have issues with those at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>They have a good selection of different designs and full nail designs.</li>
            <li>I love the plates there are several different designs with 25 plates, they are easy to use and a great price</li>
            <li>Great designs, I tested most of them upon delivery today, and had very few transfer issues.</li>
            <li>but I would love to buy the konad special Polish just to see I&#x27;m sure it be better but other</li>
            <li>if we didn&#x27;t like it no problem just use top coat before stamping clean and try again if you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to let you know Grandma, and her girl friends are all flaunting our newly designed nails too!</li>
            <li>I got this in the mail super fast and absolutely love the designs included on the plates</li>
            <li>I got the plates super fast and they are even better in person.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for something with unique designs and better stamping then red angel might be the ones to get :-)</li>
            <li>I mean $15.00 for 23-25 plates is an awesome deal.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>LOOKING PRETTY COOL!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to be able to make so many different designs on my nails.</li>
            <li>It takes some practice to get the full patterned images on the stamper, but other than that it gives my nails some great designs.</li>
            <li>i love the fact that you can use your regular polishes, unlike the konad plates where good transfers only mostly come from konad polishes.</li>
            <li>The images are smooth and well carved and the little box these plates came in is a really great storage for my plates too.</li>
            <li>The combination of credit card scraper and sally hanson extreme nail polish I got almost all of these discs to work great.</li>
            <li>the price for these seems like a great value as compared to other brands, and I know someone who has them and likes them, so I&#x27;d give them a thumbs up based on those factors.</li>
            <li>These seem to be a great deal at a FRACTION of the cost of the Konad (or any other brand) image plates.    </li>
            <li>But seriously, keep up the great work/amazing prices Shany!!!</li>
            <li>I love these plates so  many different designs to choose from, even the holidays.</li>
            <li>But you have to work quick transferring the image from the plate to the stamp, from the stamp to the nail.      </li>
            <li>There are so many that everyone who purchases these plates will find something to love, hearts, stars, french tips, holiday, flowers, animal print, you name it!</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li>and I can do so many different things with the many designs that I will use.</li>
            <li>and I can do so many different things with the many designs that I will use.</li>
            <li>I used there quick drying polish.</li>
            <li>(Quick drying polish tends to have a thicker consistency that is the next best thing to stamping polish brands that make specific polish like Konad.)</li>
            <li>The designs are also lightly etched onto the plates which I would guess would be harder to transfer a good stamp onto your nails.</li>
            <li>Luckily they were all accounted for except I ended up with a duplicate plate.  </li>
            <li>Once you scrap the polish off, you need to work quickly</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure will look awesome when I figure out what i&#x27;m doing wrong.  </li>
            <li>So if it could catch using an eraser top, im sure itll do wonders with an actual stamper.</li>
            <li>I am lucky that I chose a medium kit for $40</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I believe the price is great for this product, much cheaper than buying each plate individually.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, lots of selection, but some were scarred and had the foils torn so were unusable.  </li>
            <li>In the future I will probably order more if they make more designs.</li>
            <li>u quickly stamp the plate otherwise</li>
            <li>I like these nail plates and some of the designs are really cute, but I think this product is aimed more for younger girls.</li>
            <li>One more thing I forgot to mention, and also found out on trial and error, when you scrape the excess polish be sure to do it in different directions.</li>
            <li>My plates arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with how many different images there are.</li>
            <li>i love the idea and loved that this was cheaper than some that i&#x27;ve seen at the mall, but there was a few of the designs i wanted to do for a date and couldnt since the groves were&#x27;t</li>
            <li>What I found is to use a plastic card to scrap off the excess polish and you need to be quick about pressing it on to the stamper</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and arrived on the day projected.</li>
            <li>If it were deep enough, then it would be perfect, but they&#x27;re not.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Overall thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these over any others. :)</li>
            <li>pictures are exactly what the product was which is also a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I was very interested in trying to do nail stamping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not something I could do the very first time.</li>
            <li>She was very interested in it</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with all the different stamps!</li>
            <li>They were very pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner stamper and these are my very first set of stamps.  </li>
            <li>The normal stuff works better.</li>
            <li>This is hands down a great product.</li>
            <li>You can tell that the images are a little thinner than the 2012 Bundle Monster plates, but they still cover my full thumbnail, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Our granddaughters love to paint their nails, and we thought that this would take it to a new level.  </li>
            <li>so I can live with it :)</li>
            <li>If I knew for sure this had been improved with new batches I would be tempted to re-purchase</li>
            <li>After seeing these on here, I decided to purchase them and try some cute new things.</li>
            <li>Great value for your money and MUCH less than buying Konad.</li>
            <li>Beautiful stamps, and they came much quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and you really get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li>They stamp pretty good overall .</li>
            <li>i really like this manicure plates, they are so easy to use</li>
            <li>Ok so this was the first nail stamping plate set I&#x27;ve bought and was really hoping to get the leopard design on my nails.</li>
            <li>The manicure plates are easy to apply and they stay on really well.</li>
            <li>The transaction was easy, fast without issues.</li>
            <li>Once you have a grove going, they are fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The designs come out perfectly from the plates, sometimes you have to try more than once to get them correctly, but just make sure your plate and stamper are clean and try again, these happens even with the Konad ones.&lt;br /&gt;The full nail designs are a little smaller than the konads, I just use them horizontally since my nails are short and have no problem with the design not covering all my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>images are very clear to read and there are just so many choices and combinations to make and wear.</li>
            <li>Nail art is such a HUGE trend now and these plates are an easy and inexpensive way to get in on it!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll have enough to explore your creative side!</li>
            <li>as in pretty, or funky, or unique, or seasonal, etc)</li>
            <li>but all together I really do recomend these!!</li>
            <li>Yet my nail polish is actually titled Nail Art and most of the time the poilish dries up before it can even get on my finger!</li>
            <li>I will first off say that I have not yet tested all images (there are a lot!).  </li>
            <li>First class!</li>
            <li>These were my first plates i have bought!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the first thing that I can say!</li>
            <li>and you get a whole collection!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super simple to do, and my nails look amazing.</li>
            <li>These image plates are easy to use and have so many different patterns.</li>
            <li>Other then that they are pretty great.</li>
            <li>The images transfer so clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>-Designs come out crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>first, clean it with nail polish remover and then apply the polish to the plate.  </li>
            <li>We can spend a whole day making each other beautiful.</li>
            <li>stamp crisply and clean as I rolled over and transferred image onto nail with ease.  </li>
            <li>The designs are wonderful and the plates are metal so they will last for a very long time!</li>
            <li>They are good quality and have a large variety of different designs.  </li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t pleasant but seriously BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li>Some designs are a little cheap looking, but there are good ones too.</li>
            <li>These are great for nail manicurists, and very small and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind since they were so cheap, but it does say 25.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing deal and comes with a variety of different designs!</li>
            <li>I always do my own nails and have recently gotten into doing nail designs.</li>
            <li>These polishes would be fun to try out with nail stamping.</li>
            <li>These are 100% worth the money.</li>
            <li>Tons of fun designs.  </li>
            <li>I read through all of the reviews and while there are some valid points, these plates are still worth it.</li>
            <li>, it was still totally worth it to me.</li>
            <li>These plates will give me hours of fun</li>
            <li>, it was still totally worth it to me.</li>
            <li>These plates will give me hours of fun</li>
            <li>Even with 25 different discs there are no repeats which is nice.</li>
            <li>but while I&#x27;m learning these are fun to practice with.  </li>
            <li>This is a fun way to do your nails.</li>
            <li>I do believe this product is worth</li>
            <li>and it is so much fun to do.</li>
            <li>THESE ARE PRETTY COOL  </li>
            <li>These image plates make doing your nails fun.  </li>
            <li>The designs are so cute and the images are really clear -</li>
            <li>Great quality, covered with a thin plastic (make sure you peel it off so the plates work correctly) to protect them.</li>
            <li>It would be better if all image plate specs detailed the thickness of the plate in a universal measure.</li>
            <li>I often do my nails, and was looking for a fun way to decorate them while saving some time from hand painting each nail.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It takes practice to learn how to do the stamping but it is a fun learning process</li>
            <li>Another thing I would note is that the blue film is on BOTH sides of the plates when you receive them, I liked that precaution.</li>
            <li>The NAIL Art Polish Manicure Image Plates were so much FUN.</li>
            <li>FUN for every day of the week.</li>
            <li>These are definitely worth the $10 for all the images that do work.</li>
            <li>so far they are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>They are worth the price, which is quite affordable.</li>
            <li>lots of fun to use and to share with friends and family.</li>
            <li>I do think it would be nice if they put a backing on the plates, but for this price, it&#x27;s so not a big deal.  </li>
            <li>I got these in the mail on time all 25 in a nice box to keep them in, when I opened it up the plates appeared blue and scratched.</li>
            <li>Hours of fun - hours of nail art.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For nail stickers, I paint some clear polish on some plastic, stamp the design on top, and then peel off the polish to make a &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; that I can apply to my nail.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this yet, so I can&#x27;t say how well this works, but might be worth a shot if you are having difficulties.</li>
            <li>For this low price and to get a whole bundle of different designs, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>Lots of fun designs my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this product!im a complete klutz and definitely dont have the skill to do things like this to my nails on my own like some people</li>
            <li>The Shany plates are definitely etched a bit deeper, it&#x27;s not so much of a struggle to get the perfect stamp out of them AFTER you remove the blue plastic using tweezers</li>
            <li>but over all worth it....</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the price, compared to Konad plates for 6 dollars a piece.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money you pay for it.</li>
            <li>but when it arrived its really worth for the bucks i paid for it., thankyou</li>
            <li>It is a nice set for the low cost</li>
            <li>So much fun...</li>
            <li>and I liked a lot of the designs, but I do wish some of them were bigger.</li>
            <li>the images are so cute and they show up clear on your nails.</li>
            <li>lots of fun images to choose from</li>
            <li>My daughter has so much fun creating nail art with this set.</li>
            <li>, well no matter the language has pictures and explain how they are used, I followed the instructions and so far all models are ok</li>
            <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I having so much fun with these stamps.</li>
            <li>Fun Saturday afternoon.</li>
            <li>I love the plates, the images are super cute, but I just cannot nail down a technique.</li>
            <li>Cute have to learn how to do a better job but other than that</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is that, there are soo many designs to choose from and you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li>This just came in the mail today, and I am really excited to try it more extensively.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It was all me (and my fan and not using pure acetone to clean the plates).</li>
            <li>Fun, and clean and etched really well.</li>
            <li>The small images work fine, just as good as Konad images.</li>
            <li>I got this for my older sister who goes to beauty school, more specifically she wants she be a nail technician.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitent to get them because I thought for the price it was to good to be true but after watching a testing of them on youtube</li>
            <li>and these don&#x27;t seem very beginner friendly.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the original Kony.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to use every image thanks so much.. and shipping was super fast &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I also purchased the special nail polish to do the stamping but have found that any one of my 107 bottles of nail polish work just as good as the \\&quot;special\\&quot; nail polish so don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li>and I opened it right away.</li>
            <li>and I used it right away.</li>
            <li>but the centers came out right,.</li>
            <li>I tried to stamp some of the images right after removing the plastic but it did not turn out that well.</li>
            <li>and it peeled right</li>
            <li>A couple of them I couldn&#x27;t get to stamp right,</li>
            <li>And before people go right to this product being defective, they need to look into if its the nail polish they are using or a user error.</li>
            <li>While that is true enough, most are still usable, and like someone else had mentioned, there are some tips that go along with some of the designs.</li>
            <li>More individual designs (ex: butterfly, heart, flower...) than full nail designs (ex: abstract, zebra, swirls...)    </li>
            <li>I had to clean them all very well before use, which took a while.</li>
            <li>Several images for \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; designs and \\&quot;nail tattoo\\&quot; type of images and got inspired for more types of manicures (like holiday type manicures).  </li>
            <li>For 12 bucks this is a great deal even if I&#x27;m not able to use most of the full nail sized images since my nail beds are long and slender and the images do not cover my full nail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional when it comes to nails, I just do my own and have fun playing with them.</li>
            <li>I have fat fingers and large fingernails, and I had no trouble finding images to fit fine.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re especially great if your hand isn&#x27;t steady enough to draw free hand and if you&#x27;re not exactly artistically inclined!</li>
            <li>The blue cover paper was very easy to remove, I just used a tweezer to rip up an edge and peeled the rest off with my finger, it all came up with one grab.  </li>
            <li>Also they are very soft metal that scratches easily just from handling them</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a lot of cute designs in this set but the major issue with this set is,</li>
            <li>a very smart purchase</li>
            <li>And now, a year and a half later I continue using these image plates because they are just that great!!!  </li>
            <li>The smaller, detailed ones (like Hello Kitty) does not come easily onto the stamper.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>The cut out images are fine, and the scratches on the metal plates don&#x27;t effect the design when you paint your nails, but for a product in new condition to come with a bunch of scratches?</li>
            <li>They also give great inspiration, so, I recommend checking a few of them out after you buy this!</li>
            <li>I am extremely glad that I purchased these, and plan on buying more SHANY products in the near future.</li>
            <li>Awesome stamps and lots of fun, ony downside is that a few of the stamps are not as deep as the others and don&#x27;t come out as well, or are defective in some way.  </li>
            <li>This is my first foray into nail stamping, so I&#x27;m a complete amateur, but this is a really awesome packet of designs to work with!</li>
            <li>I been doing my own nails for a long time and the first time I can decorat them so easy and fast and with so much selection you just want to change it over n over agagin to see how everything going to look and trust me</li>
            <li>Blue film peeled off easily (used my nails!)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Edges were sharp, but I had metal sand paper handy, so I just filed the edges quickly as I took them out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i originally planned on ordering more after my next paycheck, but now i&#x27;m really paranoid about purchasing them.</li>
            <li>Nail stamping takes hours to do because it doesn&#x27;t always come out right the first time.</li>
            <li>However, once I pulled the super thin protective film off, they were perfect and brand new.  </li>
            <li>these plates super fast, about 3 days from placing my order.  </li>
            <li>whole nail designs don&#x27;t fit on my whole nail.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Even if some images don&#x27;t work its still a good value compared to the actual Konad plates, and offers a lot of designs.</li>
            <li>I was trying that I was not able to get a good full image.  </li>
            <li>Clear image and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.  </li>
            <li>I received them super fast</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the plates, which came super fast btw, I inspected each plate and it was well done compared to a couple unmentionable brands I came across at the retail store, to which I had saved my money on.  </li>
            <li>They are so professional looking and easy</li>
            <li>and they really are a lot of fun and just like the feather extension kit, it&#x27;s something fun for girls to do at a slumber party.</li>
            <li>I really use it more for my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li>(I was kind of excited and rushed through it a little), and (b) I just added some dots with a toothpick to balance it out, and liked the effect so much I may do it on purpose in the future.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy about buying these plates, because there&#x27;s so many at such a small price.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>SOME of the full finger designs also look very large others not so much, I haven&#x27;t tested these large looking ones yet on my nails</li>
            <li>Delivery time on these plates was very fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It only took a few trys on my toes to figure out the best way to use these, and was able to give myself a faux french manicure with the lace design in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>I have tried using different scrapers and a very light touch to no avail.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 2 because it was not at all what I was expecting to many single designs and not a lot of full finger stamps.</li>
            <li>and they still work just fine and come out clear.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t yet tried them all, but for example, the leopard print stamp worked beautifully - but many other designs don&#x27;t work, and until you know which do and don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re going to be spending a lot of time and wasted polish figuring it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope both me and my little girls will get good use out of this product</li>
            <li>she just loves all the designs that she can but on her nails with a little practice she&#x60;s as good as a pro</li>
            <li>The blue film, which is now on both sides, is super easy to remove, and I couldn&#x27;t cut myself on these if I tried.  </li>
            <li>The plates arrived quickly and the blue film was easy to peel off.</li>
            <li>I tried a full nail design on a Konad plate and it worked fine using the same Konad polish to make sure the polish was working properly.</li>
            <li>There are so different many designs in there.</li>
            <li>I am first time user of the Nail stamps.</li>
            <li>I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THESE PLATES!!</li>
            <li>i bought one for my sister and she just cant get enough of them :)</li>
            <li>&quot; OMG, really?!</li>
            <li>but most definitely do.</li>
            <li>Please be aware if you are buying them for children that there is a pot leaf on one of the plates.  </li>
            <li>I love all the different designs you get.</li>
            <li>I like to try my images on paper first to practice and see how images work and</li>
            <li>I really love it all kinds of different designs I can do.</li>
            <li>I ordered a konad plate and was overjoyed when the first image worked the first time.</li>
            <li>Some polishes work better than others,but no big deal.</li>
            <li>I will also eventuall purchase more SHANY products in the future.</li>
            <li>There are also a lot of Youtube video tutorials that will show you exactly how to use this product.  </li>
            <li>The nail stamp comes out clear and detailed on your nails.  </li>
            <li>Many types of designs for different occassions, seasons, holidays, ect.</li>
            <li>Take caution when you first remove the plastic covers and when in use.</li>
            <li>This kept them busy for a long time they loved it.  </li>
            <li>and this makes it so much easier to accomplish this!  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what we both wanted</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish I&#x27;d done was some more looking at the Konad and Bundle Monster plates before I ordered these.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of pretty florals and abstract patterns, but I will be saving my money for a set of bundle monster plates as well.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of stamps.</li>
            <li>First time I have used this product, and I didn&#x27;t read the directions first.</li>
            <li>At first you may not stamp like the customer pictures that are shown, but you just need to keep practicing.</li>
            <li>First let me say I am familier with stamping.  </li>
            <li>Nails can be such an artform and with these plates you are able to purchase a quality product that gives you so many choices of different styles.</li>
            <li>I would love it if I could use on larger hands.</li>
            <li>The way that the nail stamp comes out clear and detailed on my nails.</li>
            <li>And they have many types of designs for different occassions, seasons, holidays, ect.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing image plates</li>
            <li>Many designs are not cut properly and have flaws that ruin the image.</li>
            <li>- quality of the patterns and image are very comparable !  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using these plates and learning how to use them properly</li>
            <li>Peel the plastic off the plates first.  </li>
            <li>I picked up my first stamping plate from wal-mart because I wanted a preview before getting these.</li>
            <li>When I first ordered I was really hoping that cat and paw prints were in the bundle and they were!</li>
            <li>times the lines arent crisp and are smudged&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li>I love all the different designs on the plates I purchased.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I first discovered nail art stamping, I watched a bunch of YouTube videos to learn about it.  </li>
            <li>so* many others of the same thing ...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love the designs and you can use regular polish on the templates.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of these as gifts in the future!</li>
            <li>Well, the title sums it up pretty well.</li>
            <li>Personally I think that it should not have scratches, but it works and I love the designs&lt;3</li>
            <li>Every client is looking for something different and I want to be able to offer it to them.</li>
            <li>also was the first for me also.</li>
            <li>So just be aware that these may not work for you.  </li>
            <li>But you may rest assured that I will not be purchasing any more items from Shany in the future.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m not sure if the product really isn&#x27;t that great of quality</li>
            <li>I will definitely get some more plates from Shany</li>
            <li>My recommendation: each plate is equal or better than its competitor and unless you find another one at a cheaper price, go for it.</li>
            <li>but, I&#x27;m overall satisfied with the order.  </li>
            <li>The disks are pretty scratched up</li>
            <li>I could have used the extra cash to buy some more nail polish.</li>
            <li>used it for the first time today</li>
            <li>I love all the different designs.</li>
            <li>The pueen plates are a bit thicker and higher quality</li>
            <li>This was my first Shany Cosmetics brand purchase</li>
            <li>but this is something I would definitely love trying or even getting for my two younger nieces.</li>
            <li>, you have polish on the plate, scraper, holder and possibly any table top</li>
            <li>some of the designs are that same but not that many.</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t know which one to try first.</li>
            <li>The first time I never got them.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much work to do by myself!</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase more from this brand.</li>
            <li>I have pretty &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If you have really long nails (mine are short to medium), you might have some trouble LENGTH wise, but the width on these images are great.</li>
            <li>this was my first image plate purchase after I got my konad stamper.</li>
            <li>these work really well with the SHANY nail polishes!</li>
            <li>also this give more variety for the price but offer the same quaily of stamp as konad.  </li>
            <li>The nail designs were cute in various sized.</li>
            <li>At first, I was upset because I was trying to stamp</li>
            <li>I just need more different colors of polish. ^_^</li>
            <li>My daughter loves them so much!</li>
            <li>The designs themselves stamp pretty well.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving it two stars is that I love the anchor stamp.</li>
            <li>and they work really well!</li>
            <li>They work really well too!</li>
            <li>the discs come with so many different designs, you&#x27;re able to create a different look for every day of the week.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying nail stamping</li>
            <li>Great bargain because you get 25 plates with at least 5 or 6 designs on each plate, and of course it&#x27;s not a one-time use thing like nail art stickers.</li>
            <li>have tried with many different types of polish, can not get plates to work..</li>
            <li>just be aware that not all designs on the discs will work.</li>
            <li>they work very well!</li>
            <li>They are my first time buy for anything like this</li>
            <li>This is my first set</li>
            <li>These were my first stamping plates.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to get a clear, precise looking stamp.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have enough stampers!</li>
            <li>It will be my first time doing stamping</li>
            <li>There are so many options to choose from and different themes.</li>
            <li>As you may probably know konad can get Very pricy!</li>
            <li>but I plan on purchasing some more plates with different designs.  </li>
            <li>My first plate I used was scratched because I used the metal scraper that came with the stamper I bought.  </li>
            <li>Pretty inexpensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just tryed these plates and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, these are JUST the plates, not the whole kit!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pretty sure I can create it myself with different plates or household things.</li>
            <li>but i really need to know before i buy it!</li>
            <li>i love that plate itself is sturdy and indentations of the images are not to deep.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fun at the same time.</li>
            <li>It is fast and easy, but looks professional and intricate.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I ordered these plates, however, when I got them in the mail they were not the same plates that I had ordered, so I had to return them.  </li>
            <li>These work great, especially with the actual Konad double stamper (the stamper matters, I&#x27;ve tried two kinds and did many comparisons) and I highly recommend these plates to anyone into nail art, or just wanting to get</li>
            <li>i did get it fairly fast, but some of the stamps don&#x27;t work properly, i did work with it for hrs making sure it wasn&#x27;t just me, even went to forums reading different ways, and tips to make sure it will work if you are having problems.</li>
            <li>I love the large veriety of designs that each plate has to offer and all the different themes they cover.</li>
            <li>We were so excited to try them when they came, but the transfers were not ever complete.  </li>
            <li>but I finally got it and the first set came out really nice and professional looking.  </li>
            <li>Fortunatly I was able to go to Sally Beauty Supply and get a stamper that works just fine, but unfortunately for Shany, it is a different brand, so by having a better product description may encourage people to buy more of their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Price was great seriously $9.95 for 25 plates that if I would have bought them in a store would have cost me anywhere from $3-5 a piece or in my case here 5-6 Euro.      </li>
            <li>These plates were amazing compared to the really low and completely affordable advertised price of just about 12 bucks.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure we all get a bit different designs, but mine are very</li>
            <li>Most of the whole nail designs are plenty big to cover my nails.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I am not giving this a 1 star rating is that I can still use 18 of the plates fairly well, and I&#x27;m remaining hopeful that in the future SHANY will send me the replacement set for the mis-etched plates I did receive</li>
            <li>Some of these give you a good print but some of them are just not deep enough.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good selection in this set, although there are a few I can&#x27;t really see using, but you can zoom on the images and judge that part for yourself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only are these so handy to have, but they have saved me SO much money with not having to go get professional manicures all the time!</li>
            <li>And the edges seem to b smooth not sharp as stated in another review.</li>
            <li>They are very thin, as other reviews mentioned, but I was able to handle them safely, and the stamp prints look great.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only one set available on Amazon, the first set on their website is mostly dups of another brand I have, so I didn&#x27;t buy them, but I will buy the next batch of that brand as well (if they come out with them) based on the 26-50 they sell on Amazon.</li>
            <li>okay, i mean there are SOOO many options and</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at how many little designs were on each plate, there&#x27;s something for just about every holiday including: Halloween, Christmas, Valentine&#x27;s and many many more.&lt;br /&gt;While these are very cute and easy to use, I did have a slight problem with how thin the plates are.  </li>
            <li>Started doing my own gel manicures at home and wanted to be able to add a little extra something to my nails.</li>
            <li>I used nail polish from Five Below (funky fingers) and as long as the lighter color is on top</li>
            <li>I ordered the Stamp Manicure set with a few other items from Shany, and the shipping was wonderful..  </li>
            <li>I recieved these today, pretty fast shipping.</li>
            <li>most of the other ones i&#x27;ve tried have worked so its worth the money</li>
            <li>However, the designs that are supposed to fit your \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; DON&#x27;T FIT ,(well unless you have extremely small nail beds).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not as easy as it looks, but with practice and the right texture polish they turn out nice.</li>
            <li>The plates have a fine plastic cover on them that needs to be peeled off prior to the first use.  </li>
            <li>25 plates provide a wide variety of design options for my manicures and they are super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It came earlier then expected &amp; they look amazing on my nails!</li>
            <li>The blue film was easy to take off and the images are indented well.</li>
            <li>Image plates were easy to use and had a variety of images on them which could be easily mixed and matched.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise I found these to be very close to the first brand I had purchased.  </li>
            <li>that a lot of nail colors you buy from the drugstore doesn&#x27;t work too well because they are not thick enough; that might be the reason why some people didn&#x27;t find the awesomeness of these plates. :)</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase and would definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re into stamping.</li>
            <li>it is easily removed by your acetone, but it would be a definite plus if i didnt have to do that fro every plate.</li>
            <li>but I got these plates hoping they&#x27;d be easy and they totally are!</li>
            <li>They have lots of cute images and a few full nail designs.</li>
            <li>The generic pattern images are nice but as stated previously easy to mess up.  </li>
            <li>Is there a certain stamper I am supposed to use cause</li>
            <li>I like how there is a large variety of designs to choose from, too.</li>
            <li>I love nail art, but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to create with a brush, no matter how fine-tipped it is, and these plates make it SO much easier to get professional-looking nails in such a quick and easy manner!</li>
            <li>I would buy more in the future with new designs.</li>
            <li>With the right polish, details are crisp and clear.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these stamps to anyone - steady hand or not!</li>
            <li>If you want a clean cut image to be transferred on your nail, you are not going to get it unless you use nice thick polish and have a steady hand when transferring the image.</li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t come with the handy little bag though, but I have a case I keep all of my nail polish in anyway.</li>
            <li>nice little box to store all the plates.  </li>
            <li>This is awesome too for little girls, I take care of a little girl that luis to get her nails one but doesn&#x27;t sit still well since it dries fast</li>
            <li>There are so many different designs to choose from, I love these little plates.</li>
            <li>will however say, don&#x27;t let this single product keep you from trying some of the other Shany products, there are many others that I actually love.</li>
            <li>Had to wait for a few days, but packing was great and all image plates had something different.</li>
            <li>This is the tricky part; press the corner of the design gently onto your nail and, also gently, roll the stamper across the surface of the nail to deposit the whole design.</li>
            <li>and I HIGHLY recommend them!</li>
            <li>And the french tips, to me, are to light for me to just put on by themselves.</li>
            <li>It takes much longer than it should and after I do get it off</li>
            <li>this was even better than i expected.</li>
            <li>very comparable to konad plates, if not better!&lt;br /&gt;works</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>They seem like rejects or used products ready to be discarded.</li>
            <li>I really would supervise kids using these plates.  </li>
            <li>I paid way too much for the Shany products.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>The plates I got are not thin, I even tried to bend them and haven&#x27;t cut me at all, even when I was taking the plastic covering off of them.</li>
            <li>It was so much easier to do than what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>However, you nail stampers probably know that a thinner image plate really makes no difference in function.</li>
            <li>Unlike the konad designs (with room for no error), dont expect the whole image to cover/fit on your nails.</li>
            <li>Plus I order a whole bunch of nail art stuff..  </li>
            <li>and she was very disapointed with it.</li>
            <li>(I was working fast too).</li>
            <li>The shipping was incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li>I know it takes some practice, and i&#x27;ve not had THAT much time to spend with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>So once I received everything, I was ready to get going.</li>
            <li>you so much for saving my wallet money lol!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Treishapromua</li>
            <li>and they stamped very well.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I probably would stick to Konad plates after this or look more carefully at the product description before I purchase.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t matter how much polish I used.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone who wants to try it.</li>
            <li>We applied them on acrylic nails, stick on nails and real nails.</li>
            <li>No matter how much the scraper scratched the plates, the images were not damaged in any way.</li>
            <li>They work well with regular nail polish although it can come out on the light side.</li>
            <li>Really, the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice</li>
            <li>A real bargain.  </li>
            <li>and you wanted to cover the whole nail ...</li>
            <li>I really like these plates.</li>
            <li>I got them fast.</li>
            <li>I appreciated them being on</li>
            <li>they arrived very promptly</li>
            <li>THANKS again and will do business again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because I was really looking forward to using them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The edges are smooth and I even ran my thumb back and forth along the edge.</li>
            <li>much cheaper</li>
            <li>Not so much for Shany.</li>
            <li>Customer service matters, just as much as quality of items sold.</li>
            <li>much  </li>
            <li>I would highly recomment this product to to whoever likes to do their nails!</li>
            <li>I need some practice how to stamp my whole nail</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>I really like the stamping set that I received for a gift.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>i really like these</li>
            <li>It takes me about an hour to figure out what combination of nailpolish/image I&#x27;m going to use since there&#x27;s so much selection hahah.</li>
            <li>The thing is the konad plates cost to much and the bundle moster plates sometimes you have to work to pick up the image.</li>
            <li>really do like these a lot.</li>
            <li>When you order them it says SHANY but there really made by BUNDLE MONSTER.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>With this set, it really does seem like</li>
            <li>These plates were a cheaper alternative to getting the Konad real plates.</li>
            <li>i was very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a whole list online if you just google it that will tell you which nail polishes you can use.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t worry they don&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>I have not ordered them and are a bit hesitant about them because I am just beginning to really get into nails</li>
            <li>but if you have the plate holder you don&#x27;t need to worry to much about the edges.</li>
            <li>and they work very well.</li>
            <li>and they work really well.</li>
            <li>All the images stamp very well, and I had no duplicates in the box.  </li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat them for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loves painting her nails wild colors and these just added the fun she has.</li>
            <li>One plate had a dent in the edge and another had a scratch straight across a plate and through one of the designs.</li>
            <li>Listen I really do like the Konad stamp plates</li>
            <li>I really like the designs and they work well.  </li>
            <li>Some of the designs I got were really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cuz it dries fast</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use it for me.  </li>
            <li>but i tried almost very stamp</li>
            <li>They arrived in fast time.</li>
            <li>you soo much SHANY</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>My wife is into the whole art nail design and loves this gift i got her.</li>
            <li>and they stamp really well</li>
            <li>I like the variety of the designs for such a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>They seem to work really well.</li>
            <li>Stamps very well.</li>
            <li>Very disapointed..</li>
            <li>Appears much easier in the description</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old is very excited with all the different patterns I make on her nails.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t work like the others I own the design is very hard to get a clean picture.</li>
            <li>Be careful handling these plates they really are sharp but the designs are great.</li>
            <li>There are lots of large, full nail images, French manicure images (I turn them sideways and make new designs on my nails.), and small dainty images that I stamp in different colors all over my nails.</li>
            <li>Some of the images won&#x27;t transfer completely and evenly even with the right polish</li>
            <li>These work just as well as the plates that came with my original stamping kit at an absolute FRACTION of the cost, even at their regular price.  </li>
            <li>The plates came with a whole variety of different designs, all of which are unique</li>
            <li>I used cheap, thick white nail polish and globbed it onto the disc and scraped off the excess with an old gift card and used by Konad Stamper to roll the image onto my nail from the stamper and voila, amazing nails!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty much a professional already!</li>
            <li>Having not used any other brands of image plates before, I can&#x27;t comment on how well they work compared to others, but they seemed to do ok.</li>
            <li>also made sure to get a starter kit that came with the stamper, scraper, and some other plates and polish.</li>
            <li>These stamp disks are so razor sharp that my daughter and I were cut many times just handling them.</li>
            <li>it did not come with a stamp, which upset me because I paid more for this item than some other brands that did come with the stamp</li>
            <li>I wouldnt recommend I was so excited to order them and totally bummed out when we used them</li>
            <li>and we were excited about that only to find it was not included.</li>
            <li>I agree with most other reviews.  </li>
            <li>It was better then all the other deals.</li>
            <li>You do get variety and quantity, but part of me wishes I bought a couple of other plates instead to get better quality.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with one of the most helpful reviews, these things are SHARP.</li>
            <li>If you look at the image Amazon provides, you can see the same flower in the top row on the first and last plate.</li>
            <li>Just got them few days ago ,, the product has a high quality and lot of shapes variations with an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Their products are highly pigmented, reasonably priced and shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>Hard to maneuver the stamps around and get in right place very easy.</li>
            <li>As long as you use them with care, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>But the key is once u clean excess nail polish</li>
            <li>short of time, no problem,give this a chance and clean up is no-problem.</li>
            <li>- A lot of the smaller images are also a pain to clean.</li>
            <li>The disks were protected with a blue film so once removed they are clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>A set of 25 plates with many designs on each plate, you will be busy for a long time...</li>
            <li>SUPER SUPER careful if you have the older plates.</li>
            <li>They do take a little practice to get the hang of, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s easy, fun</li>
            <li>A little hard to use, I find it best to do the whole nail designs.</li>
            <li>The plates are extremely high quality and transfer very well.  </li>
            <li>When we started doing our nails then only I realized that I missed to order special nail paint.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you order the other bundle with more plates.</li>
            <li>Besides, I do not think i will be using half of these designs anyway, and in retrospect, I would have been better off getting something I really like than something I am content</li>
            <li>and it is easy enough that my 8 year old can do it with me.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see such a large bundle of the stamping plates for such a low price, especially after getting a starter set at Sally&#x27;s Beauty and only getting 5 plates its wonderful to have such variety now!</li>
            <li>Yes, the designs are amazing, but they run small.</li>
            <li>Plenty to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I uploaded an image for this product showing my first manicure using them, so you can see how clearly they stamp.  </li>
            <li>They work fantastically and there is such a wide variety of designs, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li>but my images came out crisp and clear.  </li>
            <li>The patterns are clear and crisp, all of them usable.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I was having was on the full nail design</li>
            <li>The Konad plates only have 4 of these full nail designs per plate, while these have 6.</li>
            <li>There are accent designs, French tip designs, full nail designs, etc.  </li>
            <li>I would probably send the stamp set back and want a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorites are definitely the all-over designs (the full rectangle of pattern shown in the bottom row of plates in the image).  </li>
            <li>The full nail design does not leave any room for error and only covered my ring finger and pinky.</li>
            <li>Some of the designs on the plates will not take well enough on the stamper to show up in full design.</li>
            <li>I recieved my plates very fast and since I was one of the first 50 customers to purchase my plates from Shany, I got them for a special LOW LOW price too.     </li>
            <li>I hope that this is limited to this plate and that the rest of the set works fine.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get the normal French tip image to work, even with the Konad special polish.  </li>
            <li>I will be able to use most of the plates but some may give me trouble due to the scratches.</li>
            <li>I read that if you slightly buff your stamper, it makes images connect better onto it.</li>
            <li>All the holiday ones are really cute and there are the typical butterflies and hearts I would use.</li>
            <li>while it does with the black, it seems most don&#x27;t work with ANY polish I buy, stamping polish or not.</li>
            <li>And some of the images that seemed okay were not deep enough to get an impression.  </li>
            <li>I expected these to be nice, but they are a lot nicer than I was actually expecting.</li>
            <li>Nail Art Polish Stamp Manicure Image Plates set of 25 pcs w/ Instruction, mainly because of the price.  </li>
            <li>The main problem I have with this product is that it has some scratches on the plates.</li>
            <li>made sure to try different speeds and different amount of polish on the stamp.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought it for the horror plate with the &amp;#34;scream&amp;#34; mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I examined the plates and noticed that most of the plates are not etched deep enough for you to get a stamp-able image.</li>
            <li>I had to only wait a grand total of two days from the time I ordered..</li>
            <li>While this kit comes with MANY designs, some of them are not stamped deep enough into the plate, so when you remove the excess polish, ALL of the polish scrapes away!</li>
            <li>So many different designs to chose from you will never wear the same design twice!!</li>
            <li>Love the variety of designs, the seasonal and holiday themes, the all over, french tip and individual images.</li>
            <li>But when i saw that these were 25 of them for such a cheap price, i was so surprised.</li>
            <li>I love doing my won designs, but some designs are just a bit too hard to do using a small brush, but these worked just perfectly and look like you spent alot to get your nails done professionally!</li>
            <li>I really think the designs are adorable, but they&#x27;re too small to really work with my tastes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for beginners and professionals alike.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need fancy packaging, especially for such a cheap product I really don&#x27;t care; it just seems very unprofessional from a company.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the konad plates, but they are a bit pricier.  </li>
            <li>Allows me to add artistry to my nails without paying a high price in a salon.</li>
            <li>probably was my fault though for having high expectations.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>- they&#x27;re much more clear and sharp in person.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my plates, but they are just okay, not great.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work, but the image worked a little better when I tried this brand called Essence-</li>
            <li>and they just gives your nails a little cute design it takes literally no time at all, and they are so affordable.</li>
            <li>so they all stay in a little box safely, and you won&#x27;t have to worry about finding a way to store them.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews said that they are sharp and they cut you easily</li>
            <li>Also, the protective plastic that comes on them is kind of hard to get off, but nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, after trying again with some old nail polish that I don&#x27;t use, because it became a little too thick, the plates worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Some of the larger designs are hard to transfer but it&#x27;s a good deal for so much variety</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have one bad thing to say about these plates, very happy and told everyone I know who as the kit like I do to order them.</li>
            <li>And I received them on the expected shipping date with free 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal for your money, but chances are you&#x27;re only going to like only a few of the designs.</li>
            <li>Normally I wouldn&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>And the plates that have the full designs (such as the stripes, stars, ect)dont completely cover my nails.</li>
            <li>I know this is about the product and not the seller, but this is the only one I&#x27;ve seen selling these plates, which aren&#x27;t exclusively Shany brand, apparently, so I thought a general review would be more helpful.</li>
            <li>Can use normal polish with it.</li>
            <li>So many designs, too few nails to paint...</li>
            <li>I own both Bundle Monster sets, lots of Konads, the set from MASH, Red Angel plates and various plates from european collections.  </li>
            <li>However, after getting on youtube and watching a few videos I was able to get to the hang of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More waste of money.</li>
            <li>was that I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be that sharp so as i peeled off the clear plastic, I was left with many cuts!</li>
            <li>i wouldnt normally wear-</li>
            <li>Let me tell you this, with this many designs, everyone will find a few dozens that they like.</li>
            <li>There are a few things for most of the holidays included.</li>
            <li>The designs are really random, and there isn&#x27;t a very many even worth having.</li>
            <li>Totally wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I have tried even the nail polish that goes with it instead of normal polish.</li>
            <li>I have had a lot of fun creating themes and just trying out different color combinations.  </li>
            <li>I have trouble with many of the images not stamping fully.</li>
            <li>I have numerous options and design choices for any season, event, or fun</li>
            <li>the bundle monster plates were quite a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>I used normal polish and it still worked.</li>
            <li>there are so many choices to choose from and there all unique and different it is so hard to choose from i highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>The images are crisp and clean and stamp as well as konad, however, I am surprised at how sharp the edges are even tho</li>
            <li>Other then that the rest were fine.</li>
            <li>Also, the blue film is easy to remove, but only remove it from the side with the imprints and store each plate separately once you have removed the film so they don&#x27;t get scratched</li>
            <li>I jumped right into this stamping, and never looked back.</li>
            <li>I use them with the widest part of the image going across my nail (from left to right).  </li>
            <li>runs with different polishes and techniques to get it right.</li>
            <li>So maybe next time I will try a different regular polish that doesnt dry as fast and see if that makes a difference, Im thinking some of these more intricate designs aren&#x27;t engraved as deeply as Konad brand like many were saying.</li>
            <li>The big images are fine but NOT the small detailed one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I do not think I would purchase this set again because although the bigger designs I like, it was just not worth it for so many unusable designs.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldve given 2 stars but the large designs I like a lot</li>
            <li>I had considered letting my six year old use these herself, but after nearly cutting my own finger, I decided to use them on my own, and using them on her only when she asks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>some of the design work perfectly fine and some of the design aren&#x27;t deep enough.</li>
            <li>I think the leopard spots and the zebra are my favorites - they leave a distinct pattern with deep enough indentations in the plate to be pretty precise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was originally trying to order airbrush stencils, but when I seen these I was curious on how this would work</li>
            <li>Shany Plates have such nice models that I want to keep them on my nails as long as possible so it will take me quite a while to eventually apply all those designs.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to get it right, but there are a lot of helpful tutorials on youtube, and I learnt to use it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still a new stamper</li>
            <li>I hope they come out with new designs soon.</li>
            <li>Im new nail stamping</li>
            <li>I am new to nail stamping and started with a Konad starter kit just a week or two ago.  </li>
            <li>I will keep trying and buying new Shany Products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new at stamping</li>
            <li>I have a new obsession for \\&quot;styling\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I would hold off on this purchase until they come out with a new design set, or make an official statement on this amazon.com listing about the plates being the updated versions.</li>
            <li>As a blogger I&#x27;m always trying to do new things with my nails.</li>
            <li>For beginner stampers, I recommend this set, plus Mash&#x27;s new set and Bundle Monster&#x27;s new set.</li>
            <li>all new</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a huge variety of images, some smaller, some larger, so there should be something for everyone.</li>
            <li>I just carefully held a plate, took my nail and scratched at the tippy top, and it peels off instantly.</li>
            <li>I may purchase it again if I like their designs but in the set I bought I only liked a few of them.</li>
            <li>The package arrived earlier than expected and each plate seems to be ok, no damages.</li>
            <li>So far I have tried several images all with success.</li>
            <li>I have used cheap, Wet N&#x27; Wild nail polishes from the drug store and they work well.</li>
            <li>but I wish there was more full nail designs then just random little designs :)</li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;m having is not knowing what one to use next ;)!!</li>
            <li>they are very clear.</li>
            <li>the stamps leaves the image very clear with all the details.</li>
            <li>Images come out very clear.</li>
            <li>The images are deep, they transfer cleanly, and the images are far enough away from each other for easy use.</li>
            <li>This product is good for the price, but the plates are very sharp and i am a bit disappointed that there aren&#x27;t that many full nail designs... can&#x27;t beat it for the price though.</li>
            <li>Bundle Monster and Shany plate are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>This is actually the first nail stamping system I have purchased</li>
            <li>since I got the order in a day early!</li>
            <li>Deep etching &amp; crisp detail.  </li>
            <li>Exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Overall: Very happy with this item, for the price you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li>The Konad and the Salon Express kits both had the same exact quality of image plates.  </li>
            <li>When I first got these, I painted over the blue seals.</li>
            <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend this product for someone looking to get exactly what they were promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>The designs are not similar to any other plates I have purchased and I just love all the designs.</li>
            <li>I soaked the plates briefly in hot water to loosen the plastic, then using an emory board to grab an edge of the blue plastic</li>
            <li>Without the hot water soak and emory board I would have shredded my fingers trying to remove that blue plastic.</li>
            <li>I got these and most don&#x27;t even work because they&#x27;re too small or something.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to use it now.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>So if you can get past that, then i guess you&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and the edges are not sharp unlike other brands.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying from this seller again and also plan to refer them to my friend here who has a shop and pays ridiculous prices for her supplies that are not as good quality as these.</li>
            <li>I tried with both Konad special polish and regular polish, I tried cleaning the plate, scraping at various angles, everything and nothing works.  </li>
            <li>My longest nails are about 3/4 inch long right now.  </li>
            <li>I usually only wear a clear coat on my hands, but this makes me want to have color on them!I will absolutely be ordering from Shany again!</li>
            <li>I received the Shany plates very quickly, and have tried quite a few of the designs.</li>
            <li>Even then the stamps were not deep enough for a full stamp, unless you put a lot of finger nail polish on the image you want, for it to work.</li>
            <li>Working quickly before it dries, drag the scraper across the design to remove the excess polish and let the excess wipe off on the paper towel.</li>
            <li>oh I&#x27;ll just be super careful...</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, because I was just using my own nail polish to do the stamping.</li>
            <li>The images are tiny and as for most of the designs, because of it I can&#x27;t even tell what I&#x27;ve stamped on my nail when I glance down.</li>
            <li>WOW is what I have to say so far!  </li>
            <li>;P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things that I wanted to point out for new stampers like myself: this process is fun, it is fast, it takes a little practice.</li>
            <li>They make polish specifically for stamping, but if you insist on using your own it can&#x27;t be brand new, thin, nail polish.</li>
            <li>I suggest using the white or black top coats with these.  </li>
            <li>and I tried the paw image on the plate with all the pets with Wet and Wild quick drying polish with the color</li>
            <li>Fast shipping got exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>would guess that these plates aren&#x27;t cut deep enough or very consistently.</li>
            <li>These are great stamps, I was a little hesitant buying these after all the negative comments.</li>
            <li>and i can choose from so many diffrent options it has to design my nails for such little price and its reusable unlike those stickers.</li>
            <li>hardly ever able to get an impression onto my nails</li>
            <li>so soon as i got it out of the box i was stamping, this kit has so many designs that i can hardly choose what one i want .</li>
            <li>I do not understand why people were complaining about the blue protector they have, they are easy to take off I mean its pretty basic not complicated at all.</li>
            <li>The plastic come off easy, and if I leave the back coating on the edges aren&#x27;t sharp at all.</li>
            <li>There are some very cool designs, however some are just to big for an average finger nail, and you have to use a think polish.</li>
            <li>designs aren&#x27;t clear, the plates are used and scratched up.\\</li>
            <li>&quot; I think everyone else has made it clear by now that you have to peel off the protective covering.</li>
            <li>Clearly this design is not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li>They make a clear image with no smudging or blurry lines.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for Christmas for my 13 year old sister-in-law along with a SHANY Stamping Nail Art Set and she loves them.  </li>
            <li>They have 18 buisness day&#x27;s and they can&#x27;t get here everyting must ship directly from China and be carried by foot.</li>
            <li>I read from another review that someone used an old credit card.</li>
            <li>I had no problem with the size of any of the stamps so far.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 10 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I scrape, and everytime I scrape, all of the nailpolish comes off completely.</li>
            <li>So far they work well</li>
            <li>It looks like the images that are supposed to cover the whole nail actually will cover it.</li>
            <li>Some of the finer more delicate designs don&#x27;t transfer well -</li>
            <li>I have done my nails a bunch of times as well as my 6 year old daughters</li>
            <li>but I just couldn&#x27;t make this thing work so far.</li>
            <li>and I know that images from the Konad plates transfer completely to your nail.</li>
            <li>COMPLETE SATISFACTION.</li>
            <li>I suggest it to any one who likes to do their nails, whether they are young or old.</li>
            <li>Until this is fixed.</li>
            <li>fast delivery came in a couple of days earlier.</li>
            <li>No smudging or blurry lines so far with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve played around with 5 or 6 of the plates mixing and matching</li>
            <li>I love love love this product , the only thing that I \\&quot; HATED \\&quot;!!</li>
            <li>use an old giftcard to scrape the excess polish off of  the plate</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking the french manicure designs.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like them, and I planned on using them frequently</li>
            <li>The nail art set definitely gives off a very glamorous look.</li>
            <li>Maybe the company fixed that problem.</li>
            <li>The image plates was in a small box that fix them perfectly, then it was put in a bigger box with nothing to protect the small box from moving around in the bigger box.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money</li>
            <li>Also, I keep my nails short &amp; the \\&quot;whole</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waited patiently for them to contact me and resolve this matter, but I suspect that I shall never get my complete order from them.  </li>
            <li>Had no trouble with it</li>
            <li>I got these for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the product.</li>
            <li>we were both pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>but its not for sensitive design.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 year old daughter and she is in heaven.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let any suicidal individuals near these.  </li>
            <li>Lots of kid design as well as adult.  </li>
            <li>My 12 year old loves this set and the ones given to her with it.  </li>
            <li>When i received the plates, they were scratched up like they were old or something.</li>
            <li>(I have a 3yr old).</li>
            <li>what an 8 and 3 year old like, differs quite a bit for a 30 something.</li>
            <li>I did find some tips on YouTube that used an old credit card</li>
            <li>In my opinion, SHANY went through the complaints customers had and fixed the products to suit.</li>
            <li>for me this this makes the actual stamping process to be much easier.</li>
            <li>The plates had many scratches &amp; a few DEEP gauges,where you could see the silver metal</li>
            <li>I was unable to get a good stamp onto my nail.  </li>
            <li>I bought the special nail polish and scrapper but every time I tried the nail polish either cam right off the plate or the stamper would only pick up a small portion of the nail polish.</li>
            <li>so I have to say Shany Cosmetics holds true to their motto or providing professional products at a extremely lower cost!</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s not your thing, that&#x27;s fine, but there are other usable designs on the same plate.</li>
            <li>Clean the plate design and stamper after each stamping, use Q-tips when you do this or you will mess up your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the type of person that gets bored easily with nail polish and likes to have cool designs on your nails</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw these because they have little bugs, a kite, a hummingbird, an anchor, the zodiac signs and the list</li>
            <li>Between my small fingernails, how easily someone could cut themselves trying to use the stamps, and how some of the stamps just don&#x27;t want to transfer over..</li>
            <li>This set has some cool designs on it, and for less than $15 you get 25 plates.</li>
            <li>I tried to clean them with a cotton pad but a lot of the nail polish remained and little fibers of cotton got stuck in the image.  </li>
            <li>but they work better for them over the single images because the single images are too big.</li>
            <li>But as long as you take your time and are careful, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>far as the actual plates go, after doing a little research and watching a youtube video, I found these plates to be really easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing new designs as they come out!</li>
            <li>more than half of the designs were not engraved deep enough for the design to imprint on the stamper.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and once I finally did, more than half of the plates had some type of residue left on them from the protective film.   </li>
            <li>You get a wide variety of designs from French to full nail to even some holiday designs.      </li>
            <li>My main problem with these and this seller is actually that when I received the plates, I opened the box and they just slid out.</li>
            <li>I finally tore off the blue seals and used them for the first time.</li>
            <li>The first day I got them, I painted all ten fingers different colors and stamped them all!!</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that for the designs meant to cover the entire nail - I wish these images were a bit larger as I happen to have larger hands than most and the image didn&#x27;t cover the entirety of my thumb or middle finger nails.</li>
            <li>No, the quality is not quite as high as the konad discs, but the value is second to none.  </li>
            <li>I have been using them with regular polish (OPI-which is highly pigmented) over my gel manicure</li>
            <li>I recommend you do a few at a time, do some you want to use right away and pick a few backups because some of the images don&#x27;t transfer easily.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had a big problem transferring images.. as long as you use the right polish.  </li>
            <li>I love the discs but one was cut slightly off center so part of a design from another disc is on it&#x27;s edge.</li>
            <li>I have tried out almost all of the plates by now and have only had problems with a few of the images not transferring easily.</li>
            <li>Might give them a try again later because many people really love them and maybe it was just my batch that was bad.  </li>
            <li>After cleaning them well - the small detailed images still did not come out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not normally one to use these nail plates, hoever I saw the different designs and decided to purchase for fun.</li>
            <li>Shany must have listened to the complaints, because the plates I received had tbe paper backings and the blue plastic was not hard to get off.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because I did not receive the Instructions, other then that I would highly recommend these Image plates to anyone interested in nail stamping.</li>
            <li>These are hard to use, so easy to smudge when your are transferring the image from the stamp to your nail.  </li>
            <li>My younger daughter cut herself on the edge of the plates trying to help - the edges are super sharp.  </li>
            <li>The smaller and more delicate designs are near impossible to transfer using the stamp, but the bigger and bolder designs show up beautifully.</li>
            <li>I have only stored them away in their new case.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit I was new when it came to using image plates, I would usually just try to use nail art to decorate my nails which was very time consuming, I just was not sure I was going to be able to get the results I wanted out of this set.</li>
            <li>i would say that these plates aren&#x27;t bad for the money but being able to compare the two there is a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>the polish will dry fast...</li>
            <li>Another plus to this product is that it can seriously save you a lot of money from not having to get designs done at a nail salon, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the nail salon, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option of doing it yourself.</li>
            <li>And the only reason I don&#x27;t like them is that the protective blue covering is a absolute pain in the butt to get off.</li>
            <li>Several different designs to choose from, very well made plates.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For some of the larger images, I have had trouble getting them to deposit smoothly across the nail, so I am going to try making some &amp;#34;nail stickers&amp;#34; with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to buy the specific scraper, however, since the scraper I had from a different set won&#x27;t work with these very well at all.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;whole nail\\&quot; images are perfect for me because I have smaller nail beds and they covered them completely (a little work for the thumb, but nothing too bad).  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s even a couple of images for each major holiday, which is a bonus because now I don&#x27;t need any holiday plates.  </li>
            <li>they are a little tricky at first, but with practice and watching youtube videos, I got the hang of it now!</li>
            <li>First of all they got here sooner than I expected!</li>
            <li>they are NOT sharp.</li>
            <li>the plates are not sharp at all.  </li>
            <li>They are okay if used with two low contrast colors, but the edge of the design suddenly stopping before the end of your nail is glaringly obvious with colors that are very different from each other.</li>
            <li>the images are not sharp when stamped,some of the images just don&#x27;t come out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The edges were not sharp.</li>
            <li>I get sharp, crisp images from them</li>
            <li>The major competitor has a cushion backing and thicker gauge disk</li>
            <li>No complaints with the others &amp; mine are not sharp either..</li>
            <li>nails (they&#x27;re not really small or anything), and the largest images can definitely go all the way across my nails.</li>
            <li>I would do a little more research on other stamping sets before buying these.</li>
            <li>, I feel like I will use a higher percentage of these designs than I would from the other kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only con is that the plates have no backing and can be a bit sharp when you need to peel off the blue wrapping front and back; still it is a minor inconvenience for some pretty cool plates.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell the difference between these plates and the ones that came with the salon express kit, if you use thin nail polish with any plates the image will be very light if it shows up at all.</li>
            <li>Very important, remember to remove the thin layer of plastic from over the plate before trying to stamp it.  </li>
            <li>Clean up is a little anoying only because by the time you put the polish on the plate, scrape it off and stamp it</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this item, so when I did it was a huge disappointment.   </li>
            <li>The edges are pretty sharp, and you might get cut on them if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>but i do know that the plates are very sharp though i have not cut myself they look very sharp so if you purchase this item be carefull... :)</li>
            <li>Got these as a little gift for myself to have fun with.</li>
            <li>The full nail designs are bigger than on some other plates but not for longer nails (but can be used for french manicure.</li>
            <li>I was a little bummed when they first arrived because I figured the plates with naturally come with the scraper and stamper.</li>
            <li>I saw a review here about the images being too small, but I do not think they are, they are the right size for the large patterns to cover the whole nail and for the little images to be used as accents.</li>
            <li>This was great my daughters wanted this so bad</li>
            <li>they scratch sooo easily that its ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I thought the plates would be clear instead of blue.</li>
            <li>But unless you have exceptionally long nails, you won&#x27;t have any trouble finding images to fit.</li>
            <li>All the images look clear and seem to be of the same quality as Konad.</li>
            <li>stamps come out solid and clear.</li>
            <li>Some are even small enough to fit on my 8 year olds nails</li>
            <li>Set each child up with stamper, scaper, paper towels, some acrylice paints, something to stamp to I use some colored paper, give each child 1 dry coton wipe and 1 wet to clean plate after each design was stamped, paint brushes or q-tips for appling paint, quirted some paint out some smaller pieces of paper.</li>
            <li>So I would recommend using an old gift/credit card instead of the metal plates, because it WILL scratch up your metal plates, overall, I would defiantly gt them!!</li>
            <li>My hands are smaller then my neighbor&#x27;s 8 year old son.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s no way that you can cut your hand on this plate unless you r really just sliding them on your hands really rough.</li>
            <li>I even used it on my 2-year old with Piggie Paint polish to put Hello Kitty on her big toe</li>
            <li>But I was a bit disappointed that so many of the smaller and cute designs I could not use.&lt;br /&gt;Seems these are made cheaper and not etched as deep so that the designs are not coming thru.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I do not think they would last with professional use.</li>
            <li>I received the package with the plates scattered all over the box with apparent scratches on each plate.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still waiting for my stamping polish, and so far have only used Sally Hansen.  </li>
            <li>:o</li>
            <li>The image plates also had \\&quot;french manicure\\&quot; tip images and with practice - can have a neat effect on an old manicure style standby.  </li>
            <li>so get a old gift card and use that to scrape of the extra nail polish</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift for a young teen, thinking she would show her friends</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter loves having her nails stamped with tiny hearts or flowers.</li>
            <li>There is a wide variety of designs and the impressions are cut deeply into the plate, so they are crisply outlined on your nails.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;ll just throw out that plate because it&#x27;s frustrating to have the design but not be able to use it.</li>
            <li>What I found out was I was using the wrong kind of polish.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re so expensive and these work really nice.  </li>
            <li>so your design with be smooth, you need thick polish.</li>
            <li>Just do not forget to take off the thin plastic on top of every plate.</li>
            <li>Another thing I&#x27;ve learned that that you really need to stamp as quickly as possible or the polish will dry and not stamp well.</li>
            <li>Not such a big deal for me, but again, no small children around here.  </li>
            <li>so small you can only use it on a pinky finger-not worth it people!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still excited to see what other ideas I can come up with from the other plates as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My big toe is the only nails that aren&#x27;t covered by the all-over designs completely, but I have no complaints really!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>at first I thought the problem was the nail polish, but I used the same polish on other plates i purchased before, and there was no problem; so I realized the problem was the plate.</li>
            <li>It came in a huge envelope for such a tiny little box!</li>
            <li>The french tip designs you need to scrape across the design, not down the design.</li>
            <li>plates were much smaller than I expected, though certainly not an issue with the product - they fit in the Konad Stamping Nail Art Image Plate Holder, so couldn&#x27;t be any bigger.  </li>
            <li>with these plates even the simplest designs (there really isn&#x27;t much to the anchor or kite) take multiple, frustrating attempts to get the full image on the stamper.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>I tried it with no base polish, and could barely see the design, so darker base coat works better.  </li>
            <li>The blue plastic wasn&#x27;t too difficult to remove, the stamps themselves work great, AND they aren&#x27;t as sharp as some people are saying!</li>
            <li>So much to choose from:)&lt;br /&gt;Lucky I read reviews before purchasing and was warned about the pesky coating the plates are wrapped it, like stated by others, be very careful.</li>
            <li>Only about 18 of the 25 were cut deeply enough for me to get a clear image off of, and so I emailed SHANY about getting replacement plates.</li>
            <li>I have ordered a wide range of different types of plates from different companies, and so far shany plates are my least favorite.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because I have wide nails, so the patterned images do not cover my whole nail.</li>
            <li>The only problems i have had so far are the french tip nail designs.</li>
            <li>The plates are thin and sharp, so be extra careful when handling them, especially when you first take off that dreaded plastic coating that has no desire to come off nicely.  </li>
            <li>I do have to agree that these plates are sharp, very VERY sharp and they have no backing on them which makes them even harder to handle safely.  </li>
            <li>most reviewers said the sides of the plates are sharp but if you know this going in they aren&#x27;t that hard to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I can at least say that the SHANY plates are slightly thinner, but also much flatter - the Red Angel set I just received is thicker metal, but a tad warped from the stamping process - they all do not sit flush with each other - SHANY plates, nice, snug &amp; flat!)</li>
            <li>They really aren&#x27;t that sharp, especially if you are using them as intended.</li>
            <li>As i said in my stamper review, these image plates are not meant for nails with much length, and it only works to have part of the design going in one direction and the other part going another with some designs.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of actual Konad, and they do seem to work extremely well, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much of difference between their quality and Shany or MASH or 2012 Bundle Monsters, except for the price.</li>
            <li>Not a long wait for them at all.</li>
            <li>I believe that if it was deep enough to use regular polish it would be bumpy, it wouldn&#x27;t look \\&quot;professionally done\\&quot;</li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to cut yourself on the edges, but I&#x27;m stupidly clumsy and have managed to remain cut free so far.  </li>
            <li>Its a fun novelty for a small price.</li>
            <li>I also have NOT had a problem with the edges being sharp at all, which was one of my main concerns.</li>
            <li>but if you press the rubber stamper really quick and hard</li>
            <li>Also, the plastic was super hard to peel off.</li>
            <li>Amazon offered to make it right by offering me a small refund.</li>
            <li>The plastic covers are a real pain to remove and I&#x27;ve seen in a previous review that someone got injured trying to remove them.</li>
            <li>i have pretty small hands and the anchor barely takes up a quarter of my nail.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>They are all big enough for my fingers, although some are clearly for faux nails because they are long.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Edited to add:  after I published this review, I was looking through some of theothers, and was surprised at how many people complained the images were too small.  </li>
            <li>I like the images - especially the full nail images - but they&#x27;re just TOO SMALL for my fingers!</li>
            <li>(Oh and on a side note, no special nail polish needed, any opaque nail polish works really well.)</li>
            <li>What I love about this particular set is it came with nail tips, whole nail, and little other designs or random pictures.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the full nail designs are narrow.</li>
            <li>i like to do designs on my nails and the nail salon always charges too much to do one little design on my nail.</li>
            <li>One of the other reviewers went commented about how she had tiny hands and how the whole nail designs were just too small to cover her whole finger nails.  </li>
            <li>Some of the design are hard to get on to the stamp but its fun to do with my nieces.  </li>
            <li>Takes a  little practice but he was able to do her nails after just a few tries.</li>

            <li> AND THESE GO GREAT WITH THE SHANY NAIL ART IMAGE PLATE HOLDER!</li>
            <li> That is a great deal!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I saw some bits here and there, but the scratches were manageable and didn&#x27;t affect the design at all which is really great!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great set!</li>
            <li> With the nail trends going on this year, and probably going into 2013, this is a great product to consider trying!</li>
            <li> Great value!!</li>
            <li> These are excellent image plates, comparable to my Konad plates.</li>
            <li> You have to find \\&quot;the perfect</li>
            <li> My wife was very happy when I got her these for a birthday gift.</li>
            <li> The variety of designs for the price was the greatest feature of the product.  </li>
            <li> This product is completely awesome!!</li>
            <li> Really impressed by the variety of designs and after watching video tutorials, got the hang of using stamp and image plates.</li>
            <li> and they go on perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t stick good or stay in place...waste of money!!</li>
            <li> These plates are awesome!</li>
            <li> Eg: all of the Sally Hansen polishes will stamp perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Excellent selection, but one of the plates in the box had damaged finish, even though it had the protecting plastic over it.</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING!!!</li>

            <li> /&gt;After a lot of trial and error, and a bit of research, I have to say they work perfectly!</li>
            <li> So, for those that have bought these and not found them to work perfectly, just keep practicing.</li>
            <li> plates themselves were in perfect condition when I got them.</li>

            <li> It is a great product, just as good as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Most of the designs are great!</li>
            <li> Great etching and good pickup.</li>
            <li> A great buy and good value for my money.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are VERY happy with these nail plates :).</li>
            <li> Quality is remarkable.</li>
            <li> All-in-all, a good selection of designs for a great price.</li>
            <li> The images look awesome and I am so excited to use these tonight after work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried these with every kind of polish and paint I have, and I haven&#x27;t liked the result even when the stamp was perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use (for ideas, you can go to YouTube and type in Shany Nail Art and there are a bunch of videos) and the designs come out looking great!</li>
            <li> Great set with cute images!</li>
            <li> great deal on a great product will buy more.  </li>
            <li> currently I own another brands image plates and I&#x27;ve been looking for some more and these just seem perfect.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing considering the great quality of the nail art.</li>
            <li> This is a good way to save money on fancy designs.     </li>
            <li> I think the shany ones are good for a beginner</li>
            <li> The plates work just as good as my cheeky and bundle monster.</li>
            <li> oh and the shippping was good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the results.  </li>
            <li> this is good quality    </li>
            <li> Not as good as Konad plates, but it works -</li>
            <li> These plates are not as good as KONAD brand.</li>
            <li> Im not to good at this yet</li>
            <li> These plates work as described and they&#x27;re a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> so I thought this would be a good assortment to get.  </li>
            <li> So I was thinking that i got a good deal</li>
            <li> She loved them and has used them quite a bit since Christmas.</li>
            <li> One had a scare but work good</li>
            <li> Recommend this product to anyone who has a wife that loves to keep her nails looking good.</li>
            <li> I recieved these on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> I used these on my nails and loved the look.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> But once you get that hang of using them they work good</li>
            <li> nail designs is a good size and fits on all my nails( even my thumb)&lt;br /&gt;Great variety of designs</li>
            <li> I bought this product since it had good reviews.</li>
            <li> Really loved this item.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t do your nails that often it&#x27;s a good set to have on hand.</li>
            <li> The concept is good.</li>
            <li> You get 25 image plates for a really good price</li>
            <li> for 25 plates, I figured that even if I got 2 good plates, it would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the designs I will probably never use, but there are plenty to like in this pack, and at a good price (the Konad stamping plates by comparison cost an arm and a leg).</li>
            <li> These stamp well, design wise</li>
            <li> like i said though, some of them did work and turned out really good.</li>
            <li> Good for Amazon.</li>
            <li> I think Shany provided a good variety of designs, but all the nail polish comes off when I scrape</li>
            <li> The konad brand are a good choice, but there are cheaper alternatives that turned out really good.</li>
            <li> Not as good and Bundle Monster or Konad.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  </li>
            <li> The designs are good however.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these unless you&#x27;re already great with this kind of nail art.</li>
            <li> I loved the designs.</li>
            <li> But either way  just as good as KONAD.</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> Shany is just as good as Konad</li>
            <li> If you want to be able to create your own awesome nail art but aren&#x27;t quite up to the free hand standards you&#x27;d like to display on your hands, these are an awesome solution once you get the hang of how to use them!</li>
            <li> But on the plus side, the designs are gorgeous and you have plenty to choose from and will never run out of ways to use them.</li>
            <li> My girfriend bought this for her nails the designes are done good.</li>
            <li> good buy if your are in to the nails desgin thing.</li>
            <li> Some good images.</li>
            <li> good for some design.</li>
            <li> LOOKS LIKE A GOOD SET WITH EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN TO USE.  </li>
            <li> The plates are good quality.  </li>
            <li> ; there&#x27;s a gorgeous variety of stencils.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal.</li>
            <li> The plates are a good quality.  </li>
            <li> The Bundle Monsters are really good.</li>
            <li> but I loved the idea.  </li>
            <li> I loved these plates.</li>
            <li> Thee are very fun and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> When I use the ORIGINAL KONDAD DISK IT WORKED, THE IMAGE CAME OUT PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that there are supposedly better brands of plates, but I don&#x27;t even feel the need to search for others, because Shany did a great job with these ones, and at an amazing price too!</li>
            <li> In fact I used one to supplement a full nail design and it turned out really awesome.</li>
            <li> gettin me my own selection :P  </li>
            <li> Now I do my own and they look amazing!</li>
            <li> All the stamp are cute and most of them come out perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Luckily these plates work perfectly!  </li>

            <li> the nail designs are amazing and so very easy to apply!</li>
            <li> So pleased with my order, and the price was great.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them and it is real easy to do her nails now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they would be happy to help.</li>
            <li> Love it work great</li>
            <li> They are work wonderfully and are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> ok i&#x27;ll be happy with my purchase, so for now i&#x27;m on the fence.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> The designs on these plates are very cute.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I chose this brand.</li>
            <li> i wish there were more seasonal but great anyway also</li>
            <li> Very cute designs.  </li>
            <li> There is a lot of variety in this set, and once I figured out how to use these plates, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Forget Konad, these are just as great, besides by paying about 4-5 or more for a Konad plate, you are just purchasing the name tag after all.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel like they have very cute designs.</li>
            <li> Designs are very cute lots of floral patterns</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m soo happy I picked this package :)</li>

            <li> After experimenting with a couple of the designs, I was able to do a full set of Valentine themed nails on my own nails with awesome results.</li>

            <li> These are very high quality images and if you follow the directions they work perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy,  Happy Customer</li>
            <li> these imagge plates are amazing</li>
            <li> The price I paid was amazing and being a Prime customer</li>
            <li> Oh and the designs are amazing.  </li>
            <li> and they all turned out amazing.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I am a newbie in Nail art but those plates are just amazing.</li>
            <li> These Plates Are AMAZING</li>
            <li> The price was amazing for the number of plates I received.</li>
            <li> ; you made an amazing product.</li>
            <li> The image selection is amazing.</li>
            <li> The range of designs on these are amazing.  </li>
            <li> GOOD JOB SHANY:)</li>
            <li> The images come out nicely and I would have given them 5 stars</li>
            <li> But for the most part, I loved the images.    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t liked it.</li>
            <li> But I do own the bundle monster set.</li>
            <li> I can do my own nails now.</li>
            <li> service was good and the price was ok.</li>
            <li> The palettes work flawlessly and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> No one can believe that I painted my own nails.  </li>
            <li> I picked this brand because it was the cheapest, but now I see that Konad and BM seem to have a lot more attractive and cute designs on their plates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say about three or four, so that was kind of a bummer.</li>
            <li> the scrapers will scratch the metal plates, but it does NOT affect your stamp design (for me, it is a good indicator of designs i&#x27;ve already used) :)</li>
            <li> Some designs are better than others, but if you&#x27;re looking to add some variety to your set, this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li> and I liked the designs offered with this SHANY set</li>
            <li> I liked it alot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having your own nail salon at home.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Shany because I liked the images.</li>
            <li> The images are really nice and even have some holiday images in there too.</li>
            <li> so you get a nice result for your nails.</li>
            <li> Mine are beginning to work really nice for me</li>
            <li> Lots of nice designs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Once they came in I was thrilled to try it.</li>
            <li> I love shany products and have had an over all good experience with them.</li>
            <li> I got these to start my nail art collection, and I must say I am loving them.</li>
            <li> Nice product and service.</li>
            <li> The handy scraper included is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> my daughter really liked it</li>
            <li> it is a nice product.</li>
            <li> its nice nedw</li>
            <li> so for most it just don&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li> I liked the package it came with.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for all the wonderful deals.</li>
            <li> Some of them are good and the designs are cute.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> Awesome designs great way to do your nails at a short period of time.</li>
            <li> There are so many designs and this product is great quality, at a great price. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> These plates werent as good as i wanted them to be, most of the designs werent even showing up because the plates werent ingraved that well.</li>
            <li> Currently, I own Shany make up palette, Shany magnetic polish, Shany nail art pen and these stamp plates</li>
            <li> they print very well, and the transfer flawlessly.</li>
            <li> They Came So FAST Best Shippment</li>
            <li> but after I got that out of the way I really liked them.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to know that there was another item needed in order to use these plates</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my own set of these for a while now, but I just bought these for my niece.  </li>
            <li> t doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what kind of nail polish I use, it just doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> It was well packaged and comes in its own box to keep them in.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints at all about that as I&#x27;ve had really good luck with these, and I&#x27;m glad I started out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest and cut to the chase.</li>
            <li> It takes practice and finding your own technique.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have a lot of time to play today, but did try one image, and it worked nicely.  </li>
            <li> these plates easy to use and give nice detail to someone that is wanting to look amazing in every detail!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE NAIL PLATES!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to use at all! &lt;3</li>
            <li> They are awesome for a quick nail job and they look so cool!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, great, fun product!</li>
            <li> I would love it if i could find some more that worked amazingly!</li>
            <li> They are high quality, and the image selection is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Once the plastic is peeled off, you&#x27;ll find a mirror finish plate underneath with high quality images that work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I waited to do my review because I didn&#x27;t have very good luck at first, and I didn&#x27;t know if it was my fault or the plates.</li>
            <li> cute designs, great packaging, easy to use (with the Konad stamper and scraper</li>
            <li> the designs are very cute :)</li>

            <li> it is very easy and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are very easy to use and manage .</li>
            <li> /&gt;They just need to come out with a way of storing them so they don&#x27;t get scratched (which is very easy to do as with any shiny metal product).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it had so many designs that I had to love it!</li>
            <li> great price for the amount of plates, very fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> If you love doing nails you will definately love these!</li>
            <li> but it anyways, it was a pretty good price for 25 image plates!</li>
            <li> I love these plates and I&#x27;m sure you will too!</li>
            <li> Again these are very nice really good quality plates nice print easy to use easy clean up and amazing results....</li>
            <li> It adds just the right touch to look fab!!!</li>
            <li> The color never comes out right on my nails!!!</li>
            <li> I liked most of the images on the plates.</li>
            <li> So far, every image I&#x27;ve used has been great!  </li>
            <li> Plus, as a college student, this saves me money by being able to do my own nails for practically nothing.</li>
            <li> I have used image plates before and have had great success.</li>
            <li> So, if anyone would be so kind as to post an image their plate SH15, I would most appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Made of good material, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak from a professional view, but I can say they made my lil ladies happy!</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I haven&#x27;t used many of the designs yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They offer so many choices to make really nice nails.</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled to see how cheap it was!</li>
            <li> cuz just about any cheap nail polishes work just as good.</li>
            <li> i got really nice designs love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these plates are just okay, kind of blah images.</li>
            <li> Great fun.</li>
            <li> My grand daughters are thrilled.</li>
            <li> That would make it more effective.</li>
            <li> So many nice designs...</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first set of plates, hoping they&#x27;d fit the Konad stamping equipment and they were perfect.  </li>
            <li> this set comes with so many varieties and options and i absolutely think its amazing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had MORE FUN doing my nails!!!</li>
            <li> you want with these easy to use nail art polish stamps!</li>
            <li> these are easy to maintain as well!</li>
            <li> These stamps are ao easy to use!</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> the price, I&#x27;m satisfied, because those stamps that work look very very cool!</li>
            <li> Images are fun and cute, great variety.</li>
            <li> There are so many designs to choose from and it&#x27;s very easy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, just be sure to use a thicker polish.  </li>
            <li> The item was shipped very fast and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> I used them easily and the result is stunning!</li>
            <li> love them and work great with the right polish</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are more than enough design options here for an experienced user, and it&#x27;s a great set for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Otherwise pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> so beautiful high recommend!</li>
            <li> and it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I came home and found this deal (too good to be true???) -</li>
            <li> This is very cheap for these nail stamping plates.</li>
            <li> They are very cheap feeling; they are probably 70% thinner than the Konad plates or the plates that came in the Salon Express kit I bought.  </li>
            <li> Besides that the images are very clear and they stamp very good.</li>
            <li> The design when applied to nail is very light to having gaps in the design.</li>
            <li> as I said, KONAD plates are much better - the designs are cut deeper into the plates, they go onto the stamper beautifully and with the whole design</li>
            <li> It works perfect because I have small fingers and the images come out great.</li>
            <li> The protective plastic coating peeled off nicely and easily.</li>
            <li> a great buy and easy and fun to do.</li>
            <li> The images are wonderful, the shipping was super fast (I ordered it week before xmas and was expecting it to be here in Jan.)</li>
            <li> Once I found the little plastic cover and pulled it off they are beautiful and what kept them beautiful The Plastic Covering for shipping.</li>
            <li> They make a great design nail or a super fun set of nails!</li>
            <li> Got my item today, all there great little pack lots of designs no duplicates all fun designs just a great item and all for a great price</li>
            <li> and she is a huge fan of having kitty nails!  </li>
            <li> I need more time to use them.</li>
            <li> Amaizing I love it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li> I love the designs in there.</li>
            <li> love the detail of each one.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> btw did i say the designs are so cute :)</li>
            <li> AND IM NOT DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
            <li> If the backing was easier to remove, and some of the designs worked better</li>
            <li> \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re much better quality and designs than shany image plates</li>
            <li> This is so much more work than I want to do when I buy a plate.</li>
            <li> with most polishes and even acrylic paint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they would for me.</li>
            <li> I love all of the designs and have also done my nails for 8th grade graduation.</li>
            <li> Havent used them yet, but love all the designs.</li>
            <li> but i personaly think they are better than konad</li>
            <li> they are more bolder and have cute desins</li>
            <li> Now onto the images: I love about 90% of the images.  </li>
            <li> so many of them appealed to me.  </li>
            <li> i love this nail art set.</li>
            <li> The point is to be creative with what you are given.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I would have much rather paid this price than almost $200.00 for as many plates from Konad.hese plates, and while some of the images are ones I will never use, and some don&#x27;t come out that great</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a better deal for these disc&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I tried the plates with regular nail polish and they stamped great, got a good variety although I did get 1 duplicate plate.</li>
            <li> , you cannot beat the price &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> cause I have so many to choose from.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mostly use the Sally Hansen Insta Dri line.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more</li>
            <li> I LOVE that I can do nail designs without making an appointment at the salon.  </li>
            <li> I love them, it works with the holder and stamper</li>
            <li> I love the variety of Shany nail plates.</li>
            <li> I love the stamps alone or combined with others.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I am now able to do my nails without the stress of a faulty plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took about three attempts before I was able to get the hang of how to work the stamp</li>
            <li> I got these plates as a gift for my birthday and in love with them.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for nail plates that have more images besides hearts and flowers.  </li>
            <li> When I was ordering I wasn&#x27;t sure if it came with a stamp or scraper...</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re hopefully not:)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The Konad ones are thicker and noticeably more rigid.</li>
            <li> Also these plates fit nicely into the Konad plate holder, if you already have one.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> -OK</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure they have plenty of tutorials or on these reviews</li>
            <li> but im sure</li>
            <li> in time I&#x27;ll get better at it.</li>

            <li> Love the variety of images for just about any occasion.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>

            <li> The images turned out MUCH better after I took time to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However most the &#x27;full-nail&#x27; designs won&#x27;t cover your thumb nail</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t like this, but I was ok with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love using them</li>

            <li> Love Them</li>
            <li> Yes, most of them do the job, but then there are others that just don&#x27;t show up at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love them, everyone complements my nails when i used these.  </li>
            <li> Well, thank you Shany for helping me save some time when I mostly need it.</li>
            <li> I love my stamps</li>
            <li> I opened the gift and just wasn&#x27;t really sure what to do with them.</li>

            <li> girls love this.</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> most of the images didnt work.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times i read the instructions and even look up tutorials on youtube, this does not work.</li>
            <li> Love the plate holder.</li>
            <li> but I will not be buying any more shiny plates again.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s safe to hold.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love these image plates</li>
            <li> If you love your nails painted but can&#x27;t afford to get them done</li>
            <li> My favorite thing was the spider web and animal print designs.</li>

            <li> love love them.</li>
            <li> My grand daughters and I have play make-up days and they will do my nails and I will do theirs.</li>
            <li> Im sure over time, I will get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> These plates are fantastic!</li>
            <li> There are so many designs to choose from.</li>
            <li> They have so many designs on them</li>
            <li> My sisters and mom love the plates and are always asking me to do their nails now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these plates.</li>
            <li> so glad you guys are offering to fix this.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I really love the design.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> She loves getting her nails done by mommy. :)</li>
            <li> but i wished it didnt have so many on all of them</li>
            <li> ok.....</li>
            <li> the blue plastic that is on them when you get them is a pain in the butt to remove, but once thats off they are awesome!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not giving up hope because the designs are really cute.</li>
            <li> Maybe someone else will have better luck.</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;All models works, it depends on the technique you use to apply</li>
            <li> but I was not even able to give it as a gift.  </li>
            <li> : use nail art polish or you won&#x27;t be able to see design regardless of color.</li>
            <li> It is perfect all different seasons!</li>
            <li> Just bought these and love them.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the case with most of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were okay.</li>
            <li> r so many to choose from</li>
            <li> but I love the packaging</li>
            <li> Will buy again :) or as a gift</li>
            <li> I love how elegant my nails look after using them.</li>
            <li> I would give this a try and you will love this product.</li>

            <li> I think on 1/24/12 so pretty good on the shipping imo.  </li>
            <li> with the konad plates you can almost always get a good transfer on your first attempt.</li>
            <li> I tried my first nail stamp and loved it.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of doing it, they turn out pretty good.</li>
            <li> The Halloween selection of images is pretty good on this set.  </li>
            <li> I find many of my school mates are very interested in obtaining their own.</li>
            <li> The large, full nail images were a breeze to use and were beautiful.</li>

            <li> Some came off easily but for the most part I had to struggle to get them off</li>
            <li> So far it works great, I&#x27;m waiting on my konad stamper to come, which i hope is tomorrow, but i used an eraser top to see if it would catch the image</li>
            <li> very faster to use and has nice picture for nails for all ages nice for womens and mens...</li>
            <li> The designs are nice and good for a 4 year old.  </li>
            <li> very nice gift to my wife, nice designs 25 of those plates, really good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging should be slightly better as by the time i received the parcel, the plates are out of the small paper pack.</li>
            <li> The designs come up very nice with normal nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> We have had so much fun with it - now I just have to buy more of them!</li>
            <li> The designs came out nice, as I desired on the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it arrived in one week, please note I live in the Caribbean, so that time frame was excellent!</li>
            <li> Now I just need to go get some more nail polishes to have some more fun with these!</li>
            <li> For this many plates and stamps, it is so affordable and such a good price!</li>
            <li> Very good overall, I would recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s better than free handing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to pull it away from the edge of the disk and remove it smoothly in one piece.</li>
            <li> and well i just love using this product i love all these designs and am just thrilled to have this and thankful for Shany for getting these amazing plates and for a low price:)</li>
            <li> Each plate has 6-8 different designs and altogether you have more than a hundred beautiful designs.</li>
            <li> so I switched to an old store rewards card with great results.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment sooner than expected which is great!</li>
            <li> thats just one thing I love about SHANY and amazon great products at low prices :)</li>
            <li> Then I loaned them to my daughter who had fun with her nails and is going to order her own set.  </li>
            <li> than that it has some good images very thing</li>
            <li> it is so cool and so easy to do!</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how easy they are to use and how great my nails end up looking.</li>
            <li> a good nail Polish has to be very pigmented and u gotta be very quick at it</li>
            <li> The price was cheap compared to many other brands/sellers that I looked through and the quality is great!</li>
            <li> my 7yr old uses it the most!!  </li>
            <li> The brush is fine tipped which helps with getting a more precise line.</li>
            <li> and I look forward to creating more unique looks using these plates.    </li>
            <li> Full finger designs are a pain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to experiment a lot more with these plates.  </li>
            <li> i was excited to get my plates today, and when i opened my pacage the top plate was scraped and the box looked like it had been opened by someone.</li>
            <li> But for the price, more than worth it!  </li>
            <li> so then I scraped the excess polish the other way and it stamped perfectly every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first stamping set and i&#x27;&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The designs transfer easily.</li>
            <li> The protective tape is easy to peel off as while.</li>
            <li> this set is so easy to use</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to count 2 as 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sounds easy?</li>
            <li> It is completely easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I even had a preteen that could use them easily.  </li>
            <li> I got the set that has the easy to remove plastic but</li>
            <li> THESE ARE GREAT AND A BIG VARIETY PACK WHICH IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES THAT COME IN THE STAMP KIT</li>
            <li> They are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who would want easy salon style nail art at home.</li>
            <li> I love the images overall great product.</li>
            <li> They were easy to unwrap, sort, and</li>
            <li> - These plates do scratch easily</li>
            <li> plastic covering was easy to remove with the aid of tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These plates are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased stickers but didn&#x27;t do any justice and would peel off easily.</li>
            <li> i am actually ordering more disc because i am so happy with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and they stamp well.</li>
            <li> My str loves them and they r so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not that easy to use.</li>

            <li> Most of the designs transfer cleanly to the nail.</li>

            <li> EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> And for people wondering about shipping - this shipped in 5 days to Toronto, Canada from the US, nice and fast :).</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly .I</li>
            <li> &amp; once you get the hang of them they are easy.</li>
            <li> and it was so easy to make my nails look like a pro</li>
            <li> Once I did that,it so easy.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched YouTube videos and the individuals make it look so easy; however, it&#x27;s not as easy as it looks.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use</li>
            <li> really easily though</li>
            <li> The plates are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I received them very quickly.</li>
            <li> Cleans up is easy just use water in stead of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I can easily see how one would slice their finger(s) using them</li>
            <li> so the polish dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> it was well and nice package, arrived in good time and is being used, requirement where and sometime the box is way to big</li>
            <li> The quality of the plates are nice and are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> and my wife liked very much</li>
            <li> While I was removing the plastic I used a fine diamond foot file to smooth the edges and make them safer and more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Even holding them gently feels risky.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a whole lot for a great price :)</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product and excited to use them more.</li>
            <li> even for me!haha i would recommend this to everyone its fun and easy and the designs are super cute!</li>
            <li> I used my metal scraper a bit to help remove the backing it worked fine.</li>
            <li> then just know it is only the plates, which are pretty awesome!</li>
            <li> The plates are fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MOST of the plates work just fine.</li>
            <li> I had no problem even with a fine detail design.</li>
            <li> Purchased the set based on it being a damaged box, which was fine because I don&#x27;t care about the box I care about the contents, I received them on the date specified.</li>
            <li> 3 of them will fit 27 plates easily and you can see what you have, instead of shuffling through.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be fine, I received it on-time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The packaging it came in was just fine, no rips or tears in the plastic that it came</li>
            <li> I just ordered the Bundle Monsters 2012 and it seems like they have waaay more pretty images and better reviews.</li>
            <li> They said it would be totally fine, and I was like \\&quot;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> it comes out just fine.</li>
            <li> The ones I tried worked fine.</li>
            <li> There are so many designs to choose from, and they all are pretty cute designs as well!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Designs are super cute.</li>
            <li> designs are super cute.</li>
            <li> You might take a little time to stamp perfectly, but is easy to learn.</li>
            <li> I love these and they are super cheap as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and so many fun designs, some are repeats though.</li>
            <li> Nice looking packagd well and super fun to use.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how easy it was to use Shany has made these amazing plates with really fast shipping..</li>
            <li> For thumbnails, many of the all-over designs have coordinating tip designs or single image designs that look great.  </li>
            <li> The plates are awesome and have tons of cool possibilities, I on the other hand teehee have no idea how to do it.</li>
            <li> These plates are super fun and are definitely worth getting!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend them to anyone who&#x27;s looking to buy for their first time! :)</li>
            <li> the designs are soo cute and pretty!</li>
            <li> Great price for 25 different stamp plates with 10 designs on each plate - tons of artistic nail design options!  </li>
            <li> I am not the most artistic person ever, but this set lets me have all those fun nail designs without breaking the bank to pay someone to do it!</li>
            <li> Luckily she didn&#x27;t go to church or school with colorful pot leaves all over her fingers!!  </li>
            <li> I was super excited by these designs!</li>
            <li> You have a huge selection of stamps to chose from, too.</li>
            <li> This means that some of the stamps I couldn&#x27;t even use at all, what a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a great variety of images for various occasions.  </li>
            <li> THEY WORK GREAT WITH REGULAR STORE BOUGHT NAIL POLISH!!</li>
            <li> Love the small nail designs, not that impressed with the full nail.</li>
            <li> These were such a great price I could&#x27;t resist.  </li>
            <li> they are very prompt and courteous.  </li>
            <li> I got free two-day shipping.  </li>
            <li> These are a great alternative and are almost the same thing.</li>
            <li> Images transferred well and product is packaged securely.</li>
            <li> These plates have so many fun designs.  </li>
            <li> Oh and I was happy about the price because I did not want to spend around  $6 per plate like the well known name brand plates (especially being a newbie).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just unacceptable, regardless of how cheap the product is.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you peel the one you want before applying fresh polish.  </li>
            <li> I felt this set and my french manicure set were a great match.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must say that I own so much nail polish</li>
            <li> There are some for holidays, seasons, an elegant event or just for fun.</li>
            <li> They worked fantastic.</li>
            <li> Also remember to use a rolling motion and do not just slap the stamper onto the plate, roll the stamper onto the plate with a light hand just like you would apply it to your nail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hope continues to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why &#x27;reviews&#x27; are so important.</li>
            <li> will say that i&#x27;ll probably suck it up and pay the $7 for a few konad plates because i know how awesome they turn out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem is that the edges of each plate were never buffed smooth after they were punched out of the sheet of metal.  </li>
            <li> Now, I think I realize why the plates were so cheap - they were scratched.</li>
            <li> It was great to have this as an extra for a friend to use (I think it is about $5).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not for experienced nail stampers as the designs are too simple.</li>
            <li> The designs fit my nails</li>
            <li> The hello kitty one stamps really light, so you can not see it.</li>
            <li> A million times cheaper then buying the plate from a Konad place for 30 bucks when here you can get everything from your home and cheap.</li>
            <li> These nail art image plates are loaded with FABULOUS designs...</li>
            <li> The cut out images are fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m much better on the up-keep on my nails since it has become so much fun</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried with the French style plates and it worked as great as the name brand ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> They lost a star from me because I had to sand the edges smooth.  </li>
            <li> cheap</li>
            <li> This manicure set is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a set of Bundle Monster and a few Konad plates, and I have to say I am extraordinarily impressed with Shany!</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great value for your pocket.</li>
            <li> I just used regular nail art polish and it worked great.</li>
            <li> These plates really come in handy when doing nail art.</li>
            <li> this is so fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The nail polish laid out smooth and images transferred onto my Konad (cheapest thing about Konad?)</li>
            <li> and so they are not as detailed when used.  </li>
            <li> They have great designs and different types for all ages.</li>
            <li> My friends and family have more fun with these.</li>
            <li> Great plates just like the last set I ordered.</li>
            <li> but I was overall happy.</li>
            <li> But the designs that did work are really light.</li>
            <li> I placed my order yesterday, got the email that confirmed the shipping yesterday and they were in my mailbox by the time I got home from work today.</li>
            <li> easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> There are a ton of different symbols and designs to pick from and great for any age group.</li>
            <li> quietly was great.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a product you will regret going cheap on.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I use these for my nails, They are great on my arts and crafts too.</li>
            <li> It comes in a box where the plates fit snug inside and it has a magnetic closure.  </li>
            <li> Clean up easy.</li>
            <li> These image plates work great if you have the proper opacity of nail polishes</li>
            <li> I will simply free hand designs and forget this.</li>
            <li> these are the Shany plates available.</li>
            <li> They fit in about any nail plate holder, I have the Salon Express, and they fit on the holder, others claim that it fits on Konad&#x27;s holder as well&lt;br /</li>
            <li> &quot; time together, and stamping makes it even more fun.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of different patterns, and the quality of the stamps is great.</li>
            <li> But I would never pay more than $20 for these plates because anything more you might as well buy the real thing (In my opinion)</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This is good if you are just starting, still learning how to make cuter nails, and want more then just a color.</li>
            <li> The delivery was also fast (it only took a week) which I&#x27;m really happy about!</li>
            <li> , ordered them added one nail polish and used a yen knife to clean the excess polish and quickly stamped the pâté and then stamped my ail, couldn&#x27;t be more happier.</li>
            <li> it is everything i was hoping for , it is really a good buy , and when you do the 25 dollar total for free shipping its a steal&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> and so I made sure I used the right polishes and stamped away.  </li>
            <li> and worth the price, they make it very easy to have pretty nails!</li>
            <li> This is because there are just so many plates, they were too heavy for the plastic wrap they were in (so, it could be looked at as a good thing!).  </li>
            <li> This is a great value for everything included, I have tried to buy stamps from other places and they cost way more than these.</li>
            <li> It really does!!!  </li>
            <li> Very fun, I bet kids would have a blast with this.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful, and inclusive set of plates.</li>
            <li> full nail stamps fit my nails just fine.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this item, so when I did it was a huge disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The full nail images and tips work just find and cover my nails just fine</li>
            <li> Over all decent quality, nice storage box and none of mine were damaged at all.</li>
            <li> I was using Konad polish and it seemed to dry before I was able to stamp a good image.  </li>
            <li> and I was delighted and surprised to receive them so quickly.</li>
            <li> Whereas for me the single images work perfect, but I can&#x27;t do the whole nail</li>
            <li> My final price ended up being 9.99 which is absolutely amazing for a 25 piece collection!  </li>
            <li> and once I learned to take off the blue covering, they worked amazingly well!</li>
            <li> I was SO excited when my order came, up until I opened the package.</li>
            <li> I just received my order of the 25 image plates, and so far I am very pleased-</li>
            <li> The clip art is so much fun!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this product here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use them at first because I wasn&#x27;t confident with</li>
            <li> I bought these so that i would be able to stamp different designs on my nails, it was an awesome deal... when i recieved them they were opened, scratched up and the grooves arent deep enought to even stamp with.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the Konad plates and are much more reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had too great of luck with it, but a few of my friends have used them before and had great turnouts and designs, so</li>
            <li> These are so much fun!</li>
            <li> There are hundreds of unique designs.</li>
            <li> but i was too excited about the amount of designs i was getting for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These nail plates are so much fun!  </li>
            <li> definitely recommend these to anyone wanting to add nice plates to their collection!</li>
            <li> Just love the plates they are Awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;very fast Delivery!  </li>
            <li> Love this so much!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive my image plates and at the price for 25 of them, it was a steal.</li>

            <li> Original review:</li>
            <li> At first i was glad they cane</li>
            <li> The images are pretty cute, but there are about 10 plates that I would never ever use.  </li>
            <li> Its a great buy personally they stamp nicely and clearly</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product</li>
            <li> I am excited to use them tonight.</li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was excited to see all the additional designs offered by SHANY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I am not the first one to say this.  </li>
            <li> My sister and I had a lot of fun playing with these nail plates!</li>
            <li> There is so many different designs and all of them is so cute !</li>
            <li> I love how it is a consistent look every time, whereas doing designs freehand</li>
            <li> then it does with my original kit....</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first after reading the reviews, but I am so glad I purchased them.  </li>
            <li> but I am already so excited to try it (waiting for my stamper to arrive).</li>
            <li> They are really into nails and design and this was great for different designs and a way for them to be creative</li>
            <li> I am not an expert nail stamper yet, but these have a lot of fun designs and give me a lot to choose from!</li>
            <li> Overall good quality and works fine with any nail polish.</li>
            <li> These plates work very well and are easy to use!</li>
            <li> these look like a fun and easy way to make my nails stand out an look unique.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fun.</li>
            <li> By the way I bought it from Amazon in March 2012 shipped with Eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping from SHANY Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> After buying so many nail polishes I wanted to get something that would help me create cute designs to complete my manicure.</li>
            <li> Nail Art Polish Stamp Manicure Image Plates set of 25pcs]]I found these so easy and fun to use.</li>
            <li> you can clean the nail polish off of.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I cut myself on the edges twice while removing it and had to clean blood off the plates.</li>
            <li> I know that most people who are looking for these plates would already know that, but it would be nice if there was something in the product description that states which tools you will need to actually use the plates.</li>
            <li> all of the grand kids had fun just playing with acylic paint and stamping just for the fun of it.</li>
            <li> Such a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Also some of the images work better with certain polishes than others but there is a tendency of encountering this with off brand plates and its one of those things I&#x27;ve just learned to deal with, like Konad Special Stamping Polish usually works best on troublesome plates.</li>
            <li> The plates work great... only if you have the right nail polish.</li>
            <li> We have used a lot of them, and the thing I like the most is that there is a variety of super tiny images, which is perfect for super tiny fingers.</li>
            <li> These plates are completely easy to use and look great, all you need is the right type of polish, the right color combinations, and a bit of creativity to mix and match the different designs.  </li>
            <li> High quality...not flimsy like some others out there and super fun!!!</li>
            <li> I find that this allows me to have some room for \\&quot;positioning error\\&quot;, whereas using the image the other way would require perfect positioning in order to cover the whole width of the nail.  </li>
            <li> All of the  images are useable for me, you don&#x27;t need special stamping polish.</li>
            <li> (Special Introductory Price)]] and not the scraper that is included with it to apply the designs to my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I couldn&#x27;t figure out that I would need special nail polish to use it.</li>
            <li> But they wouldn&#x27;t work with my special Konad nail polish.</li>
            <li> I bought the plates and the stamp/scraper set; i didnt buy the  special polishes</li>
            <li> I was right!</li>
            <li> +, I would be PISSED right now!</li>
            <li> But to my surprise they peeled right off!  </li>
            <li> My oldest daughter bought these with her Christmas money from Amazon and was super excited to get them.  </li>
            <li> They have a wide selection of designs and are a really great deal.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I use nail polish from Wet n Wild/Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear to stamp, and it works great.</li>
            <li> looks so cute on very polished and i adore them on my toes.  </li>
            <li> I would have much rather paid this price than almost $200.00 for as many plates from Konad.</li>
            <li> There are a handfull of images that I can&#x27;t see myself ever using, but there are still a lot of cool ones.</li>
            <li> just make sure you use a very saturated nail color of polish for it.</li>
            <li> But over all its cool, it just takes practice.  </li>
            <li> If you learn how to use them, it is fun and you will enjoy it every time you look at them.</li>
            <li> I have not try it yet, but the images are cool.</li>
            <li> Most work very well (depending on the thickness of the nailpolish.)</li>
            <li> (cool...</li>
            <li> cool--</li>
            <li> (now to try my luck at a full nail design!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once i unstuck them, I had the full count..</li>
            <li> On the whole I&#x27;m satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> The Konad one is thicker and the company took more time to make sure their edges are round and nice.  </li>
            <li> -  The full nail patterns do not cover all of your thumb...</li>
            <li> The etching just wasn&#x27;t good enough to hold the polish so that I could stamp the images.</li>
            <li> I bet if I used these they would be cool.</li>
            <li> for the most part I really really like the designs!&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many designs to choose from - which was the hardest part about the whole process.</li>
            <li> I got this because I thought it was SUCH a good deal.</li>
            <li> Some cool designs.</li>
            <li> Please read my full review before forming an opinion.  </li>
            <li> I am scratching an X across the designs that don&#x27;t work if one or two on a plate are good and on plates that are totally unusable, I&#x27;m tossing them in the trash.</li>
            <li> Told all my cousins and friends about this and promised them cool nail art.</li>
            <li> Most of these stamps work really well</li>
            <li> I reccieved this as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend who was just looking for some cool nail accessories for me.</li>
            <li> Until then, I won&#x27;t be making purchases from SHANY again as they cannot be trusted to provide that full set of items nor can they be trusted to rectify any errors/problems in your order.</li>
            <li> This product it overall good for the price.</li>
            <li> I was really expecting more</li>
            <li> Lots of cool designs.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a cool idea</li>
            <li> I have watched several videos on youtube showing the gorgeous designs that you can make with this.</li>
            <li> I did my nails with one of the full nail designs and couldn&#x27;t stop looking at my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so naturally I must own everything trending in nail art.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to have some really cool nail art.</li>
            <li> Even my own 19 yr old daughter, said it look like it was a used item.  </li>
            <li> These are really cool.</li>
            <li> i love chris brown soooooo much</li>
            <li> had such good luck with walmart kit.</li>
            <li> larger full nail designs are good though, I did not have issues with those at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> They have a good selection of different designs and full nail designs.</li>
            <li> I love the plates there are several different designs with 25 plates, they are easy to use and a great price</li>
            <li> Great designs, I tested most of them upon delivery today, and had very few transfer issues.</li>
            <li> but I would love to buy the konad special Polish just to see I&#x27;m sure it be better but other</li>
            <li> if we didn&#x27;t like it no problem just use top coat before stamping clean and try again if you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to let you know Grandma, and her girl friends are all flaunting our newly designed nails too!</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail super fast and absolutely love the designs included on the plates</li>
            <li> I got the plates super fast and they are even better in person.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for something with unique designs and better stamping then red angel might be the ones to get :-)</li>
            <li> I mean $15.00 for 23-25 plates is an awesome deal.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> LOOKING PRETTY COOL!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to be able to make so many different designs on my nails.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to get the full patterned images on the stamper, but other than that it gives my nails some great designs.</li>
            <li> i love the fact that you can use your regular polishes, unlike the konad plates where good transfers only mostly come from konad polishes.</li>
            <li> The images are smooth and well carved and the little box these plates came in is a really great storage for my plates too.</li>
            <li> The combination of credit card scraper and sally hanson extreme nail polish I got almost all of these discs to work great.</li>
            <li> the price for these seems like a great value as compared to other brands, and I know someone who has them and likes them, so I&#x27;d give them a thumbs up based on those factors.</li>
            <li> These seem to be a great deal at a FRACTION of the cost of the Konad (or any other brand) image plates.    </li>
            <li> But seriously, keep up the great work/amazing prices Shany!!!</li>
            <li> I love these plates so  many different designs to choose from, even the holidays.</li>
            <li> But you have to work quick transferring the image from the plate to the stamp, from the stamp to the nail.      </li>
            <li> There are so many that everyone who purchases these plates will find something to love, hearts, stars, french tips, holiday, flowers, animal print, you name it!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li> and I can do so many different things with the many designs that I will use.</li>
            <li> and I can do so many different things with the many designs that I will use.</li>
            <li> I used there quick drying polish.</li>
            <li> (Quick drying polish tends to have a thicker consistency that is the next best thing to stamping polish brands that make specific polish like Konad.)</li>
            <li> The designs are also lightly etched onto the plates which I would guess would be harder to transfer a good stamp onto your nails.</li>
            <li> Luckily they were all accounted for except I ended up with a duplicate plate.  </li>
            <li> Once you scrap the polish off, you need to work quickly</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m sure will look awesome when I figure out what i&#x27;m doing wrong.  </li>
            <li> So if it could catch using an eraser top, im sure itll do wonders with an actual stamper.</li>
            <li> I am lucky that I chose a medium kit for $40</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I believe the price is great for this product, much cheaper than buying each plate individually.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, lots of selection, but some were scarred and had the foils torn so were unusable.  </li>
            <li> In the future I will probably order more if they make more designs.</li>
            <li> u quickly stamp the plate otherwise</li>
            <li> I like these nail plates and some of the designs are really cute, but I think this product is aimed more for younger girls.</li>
            <li> One more thing I forgot to mention, and also found out on trial and error, when you scrape the excess polish be sure to do it in different directions.</li>
            <li> My plates arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with how many different images there are.</li>
            <li> i love the idea and loved that this was cheaper than some that i&#x27;ve seen at the mall, but there was a few of the designs i wanted to do for a date and couldnt since the groves were&#x27;t</li>
            <li> What I found is to use a plastic card to scrap off the excess polish and you need to be quick about pressing it on to the stamper</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and arrived on the day projected.</li>
            <li> If it were deep enough, then it would be perfect, but they&#x27;re not.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Overall thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these over any others. :)</li>
            <li> pictures are exactly what the product was which is also a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I was very interested in trying to do nail stamping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something I could do the very first time.</li>
            <li> She was very interested in it</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with all the different stamps!</li>
            <li> They were very pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner stamper and these are my very first set of stamps.  </li>
            <li> The normal stuff works better.</li>
            <li> This is hands down a great product.</li>
            <li> You can tell that the images are a little thinner than the 2012 Bundle Monster plates, but they still cover my full thumbnail, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Our granddaughters love to paint their nails, and we thought that this would take it to a new level.  </li>
            <li> so I can live with it :)</li>
            <li> If I knew for sure this had been improved with new batches I would be tempted to re-purchase</li>
            <li> After seeing these on here, I decided to purchase them and try some cute new things.</li>
            <li> Great value for your money and MUCH less than buying Konad.</li>
            <li> Beautiful stamps, and they came much quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and you really get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> They stamp pretty good overall .</li>
            <li> i really like this manicure plates, they are so easy to use</li>
            <li> Ok so this was the first nail stamping plate set I&#x27;ve bought and was really hoping to get the leopard design on my nails.</li>
            <li> The manicure plates are easy to apply and they stay on really well.</li>
            <li> The transaction was easy, fast without issues.</li>
            <li> Once you have a grove going, they are fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The designs come out perfectly from the plates, sometimes you have to try more than once to get them correctly, but just make sure your plate and stamper are clean and try again, these happens even with the Konad ones.&lt;br /&gt;The full nail designs are a little smaller than the konads, I just use them horizontally since my nails are short and have no problem with the design not covering all my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> images are very clear to read and there are just so many choices and combinations to make and wear.</li>
            <li> Nail art is such a HUGE trend now and these plates are an easy and inexpensive way to get in on it!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll have enough to explore your creative side!</li>
            <li> as in pretty, or funky, or unique, or seasonal, etc)</li>
            <li> but all together I really do recomend these!!</li>
            <li> Yet my nail polish is actually titled Nail Art and most of the time the poilish dries up before it can even get on my finger!</li>
            <li> I will first off say that I have not yet tested all images (there are a lot!).  </li>
            <li> First class!</li>
            <li> These were my first plates i have bought!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the first thing that I can say!</li>
            <li> and you get a whole collection!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super simple to do, and my nails look amazing.</li>
            <li> These image plates are easy to use and have so many different patterns.</li>
            <li> Other then that they are pretty great.</li>
            <li> The images transfer so clean and crisp.</li>
            <li> -Designs come out crisp and clean.</li>
            <li> first, clean it with nail polish remover and then apply the polish to the plate.  </li>
            <li> We can spend a whole day making each other beautiful.</li>
            <li> stamp crisply and clean as I rolled over and transferred image onto nail with ease.  </li>
            <li> The designs are wonderful and the plates are metal so they will last for a very long time!</li>
            <li> They are good quality and have a large variety of different designs.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t pleasant but seriously BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> Some designs are a little cheap looking, but there are good ones too.</li>
            <li> These are great for nail manicurists, and very small and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind since they were so cheap, but it does say 25.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal and comes with a variety of different designs!</li>
            <li> I always do my own nails and have recently gotten into doing nail designs.</li>
            <li> These polishes would be fun to try out with nail stamping.</li>
            <li> These are 100% worth the money.</li>
            <li> Tons of fun designs.  </li>
            <li> I read through all of the reviews and while there are some valid points, these plates are still worth it.</li>
            <li> , it was still totally worth it to me.</li>
            <li> These plates will give me hours of fun</li>
            <li> , it was still totally worth it to me.</li>
            <li> These plates will give me hours of fun</li>
            <li> Even with 25 different discs there are no repeats which is nice.</li>
            <li> but while I&#x27;m learning these are fun to practice with.  </li>
            <li> This is a fun way to do your nails.</li>
            <li> I do believe this product is worth</li>
            <li> and it is so much fun to do.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE PRETTY COOL  </li>
            <li> These image plates make doing your nails fun.  </li>
            <li> The designs are so cute and the images are really clear -</li>
            <li> Great quality, covered with a thin plastic (make sure you peel it off so the plates work correctly) to protect them.</li>
            <li> It would be better if all image plate specs detailed the thickness of the plate in a universal measure.</li>
            <li> I often do my nails, and was looking for a fun way to decorate them while saving some time from hand painting each nail.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It takes practice to learn how to do the stamping but it is a fun learning process</li>
            <li> Another thing I would note is that the blue film is on BOTH sides of the plates when you receive them, I liked that precaution.</li>
            <li> The NAIL Art Polish Manicure Image Plates were so much FUN.</li>
            <li> FUN for every day of the week.</li>
            <li> These are definitely worth the $10 for all the images that do work.</li>
            <li> so far they are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> They are worth the price, which is quite affordable.</li>
            <li> lots of fun to use and to share with friends and family.</li>
            <li> I do think it would be nice if they put a backing on the plates, but for this price, it&#x27;s so not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> I got these in the mail on time all 25 in a nice box to keep them in, when I opened it up the plates appeared blue and scratched.</li>
            <li> Hours of fun - hours of nail art.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For nail stickers, I paint some clear polish on some plastic, stamp the design on top, and then peel off the polish to make a &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; that I can apply to my nail.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this yet, so I can&#x27;t say how well this works, but might be worth a shot if you are having difficulties.</li>
            <li> For this low price and to get a whole bundle of different designs, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Lots of fun designs my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product!im a complete klutz and definitely dont have the skill to do things like this to my nails on my own like some people</li>
            <li> The Shany plates are definitely etched a bit deeper, it&#x27;s not so much of a struggle to get the perfect stamp out of them AFTER you remove the blue plastic using tweezers</li>
            <li> but over all worth it....</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for the price, compared to Konad plates for 6 dollars a piece.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money you pay for it.</li>
            <li> but when it arrived its really worth for the bucks i paid for it., thankyou</li>
            <li> It is a nice set for the low cost</li>
            <li> So much fun...</li>
            <li> and I liked a lot of the designs, but I do wish some of them were bigger.</li>
            <li> the images are so cute and they show up clear on your nails.</li>
            <li> lots of fun images to choose from</li>
            <li> My daughter has so much fun creating nail art with this set.</li>
            <li> , well no matter the language has pictures and explain how they are used, I followed the instructions and so far all models are ok</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I having so much fun with these stamps.</li>
            <li> Fun Saturday afternoon.</li>
            <li> I love the plates, the images are super cute, but I just cannot nail down a technique.</li>
            <li> Cute have to learn how to do a better job but other than that</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is that, there are soo many designs to choose from and you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> This just came in the mail today, and I am really excited to try it more extensively.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It was all me (and my fan and not using pure acetone to clean the plates).</li>
            <li> Fun, and clean and etched really well.</li>
            <li> The small images work fine, just as good as Konad images.</li>
            <li> I got this for my older sister who goes to beauty school, more specifically she wants she be a nail technician.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitent to get them because I thought for the price it was to good to be true but after watching a testing of them on youtube</li>
            <li> and these don&#x27;t seem very beginner friendly.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the original Kony.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to use every image thanks so much.. and shipping was super fast &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I also purchased the special nail polish to do the stamping but have found that any one of my 107 bottles of nail polish work just as good as the \\&quot;special\\&quot; nail polish so don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> and I opened it right away.</li>
            <li> and I used it right away.</li>
            <li> but the centers came out right,.</li>
            <li> I tried to stamp some of the images right after removing the plastic but it did not turn out that well.</li>
            <li> and it peeled right</li>
            <li> A couple of them I couldn&#x27;t get to stamp right,</li>
            <li> And before people go right to this product being defective, they need to look into if its the nail polish they are using or a user error.</li>
            <li> While that is true enough, most are still usable, and like someone else had mentioned, there are some tips that go along with some of the designs.</li>
            <li> More individual designs (ex: butterfly, heart, flower...) than full nail designs (ex: abstract, zebra, swirls...)    </li>
            <li> I had to clean them all very well before use, which took a while.</li>
            <li> Several images for \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; designs and \\&quot;nail tattoo\\&quot; type of images and got inspired for more types of manicures (like holiday type manicures).  </li>
            <li> For 12 bucks this is a great deal even if I&#x27;m not able to use most of the full nail sized images since my nail beds are long and slender and the images do not cover my full nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional when it comes to nails, I just do my own and have fun playing with them.</li>
            <li> I have fat fingers and large fingernails, and I had no trouble finding images to fit fine.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re especially great if your hand isn&#x27;t steady enough to draw free hand and if you&#x27;re not exactly artistically inclined!</li>
            <li> The blue cover paper was very easy to remove, I just used a tweezer to rip up an edge and peeled the rest off with my finger, it all came up with one grab.  </li>
            <li> Also they are very soft metal that scratches easily just from handling them</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a lot of cute designs in this set but the major issue with this set is,</li>
            <li> a very smart purchase</li>
            <li> And now, a year and a half later I continue using these image plates because they are just that great!!!  </li>
            <li> The smaller, detailed ones (like Hello Kitty) does not come easily onto the stamper.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> The cut out images are fine, and the scratches on the metal plates don&#x27;t effect the design when you paint your nails, but for a product in new condition to come with a bunch of scratches?</li>
            <li> They also give great inspiration, so, I recommend checking a few of them out after you buy this!</li>
            <li> I am extremely glad that I purchased these, and plan on buying more SHANY products in the near future.</li>
            <li> Awesome stamps and lots of fun, ony downside is that a few of the stamps are not as deep as the others and don&#x27;t come out as well, or are defective in some way.  </li>
            <li> This is my first foray into nail stamping, so I&#x27;m a complete amateur, but this is a really awesome packet of designs to work with!</li>
            <li> I been doing my own nails for a long time and the first time I can decorat them so easy and fast and with so much selection you just want to change it over n over agagin to see how everything going to look and trust me</li>
            <li> Blue film peeled off easily (used my nails!)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Edges were sharp, but I had metal sand paper handy, so I just filed the edges quickly as I took them out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i originally planned on ordering more after my next paycheck, but now i&#x27;m really paranoid about purchasing them.</li>
            <li> Nail stamping takes hours to do because it doesn&#x27;t always come out right the first time.</li>
            <li> However, once I pulled the super thin protective film off, they were perfect and brand new.  </li>
            <li> these plates super fast, about 3 days from placing my order.  </li>
            <li> whole nail designs don&#x27;t fit on my whole nail.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Even if some images don&#x27;t work its still a good value compared to the actual Konad plates, and offers a lot of designs.</li>
            <li> I was trying that I was not able to get a good full image.  </li>
            <li> Clear image and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast.  </li>
            <li> I received them super fast</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the plates, which came super fast btw, I inspected each plate and it was well done compared to a couple unmentionable brands I came across at the retail store, to which I had saved my money on.  </li>
            <li> They are so professional looking and easy</li>
            <li> and they really are a lot of fun and just like the feather extension kit, it&#x27;s something fun for girls to do at a slumber party.</li>
            <li> I really use it more for my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li> (I was kind of excited and rushed through it a little), and (b) I just added some dots with a toothpick to balance it out, and liked the effect so much I may do it on purpose in the future.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy about buying these plates, because there&#x27;s so many at such a small price.</li>
            <li> Other than that I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> SOME of the full finger designs also look very large others not so much, I haven&#x27;t tested these large looking ones yet on my nails</li>
            <li> Delivery time on these plates was very fast.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It only took a few trys on my toes to figure out the best way to use these, and was able to give myself a faux french manicure with the lace design in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> I have tried using different scrapers and a very light touch to no avail.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 2 because it was not at all what I was expecting to many single designs and not a lot of full finger stamps.</li>
            <li> and they still work just fine and come out clear.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t yet tried them all, but for example, the leopard print stamp worked beautifully - but many other designs don&#x27;t work, and until you know which do and don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re going to be spending a lot of time and wasted polish figuring it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope both me and my little girls will get good use out of this product</li>
            <li> she just loves all the designs that she can but on her nails with a little practice she&#x60;s as good as a pro</li>
            <li> The blue film, which is now on both sides, is super easy to remove, and I couldn&#x27;t cut myself on these if I tried.  </li>
            <li> The plates arrived quickly and the blue film was easy to peel off.</li>
            <li> I tried a full nail design on a Konad plate and it worked fine using the same Konad polish to make sure the polish was working properly.</li>
            <li> There are so different many designs in there.</li>
            <li> I am first time user of the Nail stamps.</li>
            <li> I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THESE PLATES!!</li>
            <li> i bought one for my sister and she just cant get enough of them :)</li>
            <li> &quot; OMG, really?!</li>
            <li> but most definitely do.</li>
            <li> Please be aware if you are buying them for children that there is a pot leaf on one of the plates.  </li>
            <li> I love all the different designs you get.</li>
            <li> I like to try my images on paper first to practice and see how images work and</li>
            <li> I really love it all kinds of different designs I can do.</li>
            <li> I ordered a konad plate and was overjoyed when the first image worked the first time.</li>
            <li> Some polishes work better than others,but no big deal.</li>
            <li> I will also eventuall purchase more SHANY products in the future.</li>
            <li> There are also a lot of Youtube video tutorials that will show you exactly how to use this product.  </li>
            <li> The nail stamp comes out clear and detailed on your nails.  </li>
            <li> Many types of designs for different occassions, seasons, holidays, ect.</li>
            <li> Take caution when you first remove the plastic covers and when in use.</li>
            <li> This kept them busy for a long time they loved it.  </li>
            <li> and this makes it so much easier to accomplish this!  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what we both wanted</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish I&#x27;d done was some more looking at the Konad and Bundle Monster plates before I ordered these.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of pretty florals and abstract patterns, but I will be saving my money for a set of bundle monster plates as well.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of stamps.</li>
            <li> First time I have used this product, and I didn&#x27;t read the directions first.</li>
            <li> At first you may not stamp like the customer pictures that are shown, but you just need to keep practicing.</li>
            <li> First let me say I am familier with stamping.  </li>
            <li> Nails can be such an artform and with these plates you are able to purchase a quality product that gives you so many choices of different styles.</li>
            <li> I would love it if I could use on larger hands.</li>
            <li> The way that the nail stamp comes out clear and detailed on my nails.</li>
            <li> And they have many types of designs for different occassions, seasons, holidays, ect.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing image plates</li>
            <li> Many designs are not cut properly and have flaws that ruin the image.</li>
            <li> - quality of the patterns and image are very comparable !  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using these plates and learning how to use them properly</li>
            <li> Peel the plastic off the plates first.  </li>
            <li> I picked up my first stamping plate from wal-mart because I wanted a preview before getting these.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered I was really hoping that cat and paw prints were in the bundle and they were!</li>
            <li> times the lines arent crisp and are smudged&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li> I love all the different designs on the plates I purchased.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> When I first discovered nail art stamping, I watched a bunch of YouTube videos to learn about it.  </li>
            <li> so* many others of the same thing ...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love the designs and you can use regular polish on the templates.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of these as gifts in the future!</li>
            <li> Well, the title sums it up pretty well.</li>
            <li> Personally I think that it should not have scratches, but it works and I love the designs&lt;3</li>
            <li> Every client is looking for something different and I want to be able to offer it to them.</li>
            <li> also was the first for me also.</li>
            <li> So just be aware that these may not work for you.  </li>
            <li> But you may rest assured that I will not be purchasing any more items from Shany in the future.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not sure if the product really isn&#x27;t that great of quality</li>
            <li> I will definitely get some more plates from Shany</li>
            <li> My recommendation: each plate is equal or better than its competitor and unless you find another one at a cheaper price, go for it.</li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;m overall satisfied with the order.  </li>
            <li> The disks are pretty scratched up</li>
            <li> I could have used the extra cash to buy some more nail polish.</li>
            <li> used it for the first time today</li>
            <li> I love all the different designs.</li>
            <li> The pueen plates are a bit thicker and higher quality</li>
            <li> This was my first Shany Cosmetics brand purchase</li>
            <li> but this is something I would definitely love trying or even getting for my two younger nieces.</li>
            <li> , you have polish on the plate, scraper, holder and possibly any table top</li>
            <li> some of the designs are that same but not that many.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t know which one to try first.</li>
            <li> The first time I never got them.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much work to do by myself!</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase more from this brand.</li>
            <li> I have pretty &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you have really long nails (mine are short to medium), you might have some trouble LENGTH wise, but the width on these images are great.</li>
            <li> this was my first image plate purchase after I got my konad stamper.</li>
            <li> these work really well with the SHANY nail polishes!</li>
            <li> also this give more variety for the price but offer the same quaily of stamp as konad.  </li>
            <li> The nail designs were cute in various sized.</li>
            <li> At first, I was upset because I was trying to stamp</li>
            <li> I just need more different colors of polish. ^_^</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them so much!</li>
            <li> The designs themselves stamp pretty well.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it two stars is that I love the anchor stamp.</li>
            <li> and they work really well!</li>
            <li> They work really well too!</li>
            <li> the discs come with so many different designs, you&#x27;re able to create a different look for every day of the week.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying nail stamping</li>
            <li> Great bargain because you get 25 plates with at least 5 or 6 designs on each plate, and of course it&#x27;s not a one-time use thing like nail art stickers.</li>
            <li> have tried with many different types of polish, can not get plates to work..</li>
            <li> just be aware that not all designs on the discs will work.</li>
            <li> they work very well!</li>
            <li> They are my first time buy for anything like this</li>
            <li> This is my first set</li>
            <li> These were my first stamping plates.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get a clear, precise looking stamp.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have enough stampers!</li>
            <li> It will be my first time doing stamping</li>
            <li> There are so many options to choose from and different themes.</li>
            <li> As you may probably know konad can get Very pricy!</li>
            <li> but I plan on purchasing some more plates with different designs.  </li>
            <li> My first plate I used was scratched because I used the metal scraper that came with the stamper I bought.  </li>
            <li> Pretty inexpensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just tryed these plates and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, these are JUST the plates, not the whole kit!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pretty sure I can create it myself with different plates or household things.</li>
            <li> but i really need to know before i buy it!</li>
            <li> i love that plate itself is sturdy and indentations of the images are not to deep.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fun at the same time.</li>
            <li> It is fast and easy, but looks professional and intricate.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I ordered these plates, however, when I got them in the mail they were not the same plates that I had ordered, so I had to return them.  </li>
            <li> These work great, especially with the actual Konad double stamper (the stamper matters, I&#x27;ve tried two kinds and did many comparisons) and I highly recommend these plates to anyone into nail art, or just wanting to get</li>
            <li> i did get it fairly fast, but some of the stamps don&#x27;t work properly, i did work with it for hrs making sure it wasn&#x27;t just me, even went to forums reading different ways, and tips to make sure it will work if you are having problems.</li>
            <li> I love the large veriety of designs that each plate has to offer and all the different themes they cover.</li>
            <li> We were so excited to try them when they came, but the transfers were not ever complete.  </li>
            <li> but I finally got it and the first set came out really nice and professional looking.  </li>
            <li> Fortunatly I was able to go to Sally Beauty Supply and get a stamper that works just fine, but unfortunately for Shany, it is a different brand, so by having a better product description may encourage people to buy more of their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Price was great seriously $9.95 for 25 plates that if I would have bought them in a store would have cost me anywhere from $3-5 a piece or in my case here 5-6 Euro.      </li>
            <li> These plates were amazing compared to the really low and completely affordable advertised price of just about 12 bucks.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure we all get a bit different designs, but mine are very</li>
            <li> Most of the whole nail designs are plenty big to cover my nails.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am not giving this a 1 star rating is that I can still use 18 of the plates fairly well, and I&#x27;m remaining hopeful that in the future SHANY will send me the replacement set for the mis-etched plates I did receive</li>
            <li> Some of these give you a good print but some of them are just not deep enough.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a good selection in this set, although there are a few I can&#x27;t really see using, but you can zoom on the images and judge that part for yourself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only are these so handy to have, but they have saved me SO much money with not having to go get professional manicures all the time!</li>
            <li> And the edges seem to b smooth not sharp as stated in another review.</li>
            <li> They are very thin, as other reviews mentioned, but I was able to handle them safely, and the stamp prints look great.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one set available on Amazon, the first set on their website is mostly dups of another brand I have, so I didn&#x27;t buy them, but I will buy the next batch of that brand as well (if they come out with them) based on the 26-50 they sell on Amazon.</li>
            <li> okay, i mean there are SOOO many options and</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at how many little designs were on each plate, there&#x27;s something for just about every holiday including: Halloween, Christmas, Valentine&#x27;s and many many more.&lt;br /&gt;While these are very cute and easy to use, I did have a slight problem with how thin the plates are.  </li>
            <li> Started doing my own gel manicures at home and wanted to be able to add a little extra something to my nails.</li>
            <li> I used nail polish from Five Below (funky fingers) and as long as the lighter color is on top</li>
            <li> I ordered the Stamp Manicure set with a few other items from Shany, and the shipping was wonderful..  </li>
            <li> I recieved these today, pretty fast shipping.</li>
            <li> most of the other ones i&#x27;ve tried have worked so its worth the money</li>
            <li> However, the designs that are supposed to fit your \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; DON&#x27;T FIT ,(well unless you have extremely small nail beds).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as easy as it looks, but with practice and the right texture polish they turn out nice.</li>
            <li> The plates have a fine plastic cover on them that needs to be peeled off prior to the first use.  </li>
            <li> 25 plates provide a wide variety of design options for my manicures and they are super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It came earlier then expected &amp; they look amazing on my nails!</li>
            <li> The blue film was easy to take off and the images are indented well.</li>
            <li> Image plates were easy to use and had a variety of images on them which could be easily mixed and matched.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise I found these to be very close to the first brand I had purchased.  </li>
            <li> that a lot of nail colors you buy from the drugstore doesn&#x27;t work too well because they are not thick enough; that might be the reason why some people didn&#x27;t find the awesomeness of these plates. :)</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase and would definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re into stamping.</li>
            <li> it is easily removed by your acetone, but it would be a definite plus if i didnt have to do that fro every plate.</li>
            <li> but I got these plates hoping they&#x27;d be easy and they totally are!</li>
            <li> They have lots of cute images and a few full nail designs.</li>
            <li> The generic pattern images are nice but as stated previously easy to mess up.  </li>
            <li> Is there a certain stamper I am supposed to use cause</li>
            <li> I like how there is a large variety of designs to choose from, too.</li>
            <li> I love nail art, but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to create with a brush, no matter how fine-tipped it is, and these plates make it SO much easier to get professional-looking nails in such a quick and easy manner!</li>
            <li> I would buy more in the future with new designs.</li>
            <li> With the right polish, details are crisp and clear.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these stamps to anyone - steady hand or not!</li>
            <li> If you want a clean cut image to be transferred on your nail, you are not going to get it unless you use nice thick polish and have a steady hand when transferring the image.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t come with the handy little bag though, but I have a case I keep all of my nail polish in anyway.</li>
            <li> nice little box to store all the plates.  </li>
            <li> This is awesome too for little girls, I take care of a little girl that luis to get her nails one but doesn&#x27;t sit still well since it dries fast</li>
            <li> There are so many different designs to choose from, I love these little plates.</li>
            <li> will however say, don&#x27;t let this single product keep you from trying some of the other Shany products, there are many others that I actually love.</li>
            <li> Had to wait for a few days, but packing was great and all image plates had something different.</li>
            <li> This is the tricky part; press the corner of the design gently onto your nail and, also gently, roll the stamper across the surface of the nail to deposit the whole design.</li>
            <li> and I HIGHLY recommend them!</li>
            <li> And the french tips, to me, are to light for me to just put on by themselves.</li>
            <li> It takes much longer than it should and after I do get it off</li>
            <li> this was even better than i expected.</li>
            <li> very comparable to konad plates, if not better!&lt;br /&gt;works</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> They seem like rejects or used products ready to be discarded.</li>
            <li> I really would supervise kids using these plates.  </li>
            <li> I paid way too much for the Shany products.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> The plates I got are not thin, I even tried to bend them and haven&#x27;t cut me at all, even when I was taking the plastic covering off of them.</li>
            <li> It was so much easier to do than what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> However, you nail stampers probably know that a thinner image plate really makes no difference in function.</li>
            <li> Unlike the konad designs (with room for no error), dont expect the whole image to cover/fit on your nails.</li>
            <li> Plus I order a whole bunch of nail art stuff..  </li>
            <li> and she was very disapointed with it.</li>
            <li> (I was working fast too).</li>
            <li> The shipping was incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li> I know it takes some practice, and i&#x27;ve not had THAT much time to spend with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> So once I received everything, I was ready to get going.</li>
            <li> you so much for saving my wallet money lol!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Treishapromua</li>
            <li> and they stamped very well.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I probably would stick to Konad plates after this or look more carefully at the product description before I purchase.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t matter how much polish I used.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone who wants to try it.</li>
            <li> We applied them on acrylic nails, stick on nails and real nails.</li>
            <li> No matter how much the scraper scratched the plates, the images were not damaged in any way.</li>
            <li> They work well with regular nail polish although it can come out on the light side.</li>
            <li> Really, the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice</li>
            <li> A real bargain.  </li>
            <li> and you wanted to cover the whole nail ...</li>
            <li> I really like these plates.</li>
            <li> I got them fast.</li>
            <li> I appreciated them being on</li>
            <li> they arrived very promptly</li>
            <li> THANKS again and will do business again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because I was really looking forward to using them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The edges are smooth and I even ran my thumb back and forth along the edge.</li>
            <li> much cheaper</li>
            <li> Not so much for Shany.</li>
            <li> Customer service matters, just as much as quality of items sold.</li>
            <li> much  </li>
            <li> I would highly recomment this product to to whoever likes to do their nails!</li>
            <li> I need some practice how to stamp my whole nail</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I really like the stamping set that I received for a gift.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> i really like these</li>
            <li> It takes me about an hour to figure out what combination of nailpolish/image I&#x27;m going to use since there&#x27;s so much selection hahah.</li>
            <li> The thing is the konad plates cost to much and the bundle moster plates sometimes you have to work to pick up the image.</li>
            <li> really do like these a lot.</li>
            <li> When you order them it says SHANY but there really made by BUNDLE MONSTER.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> With this set, it really does seem like</li>
            <li> These plates were a cheaper alternative to getting the Konad real plates.</li>
            <li> i was very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a whole list online if you just google it that will tell you which nail polishes you can use.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t worry they don&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> I have not ordered them and are a bit hesitant about them because I am just beginning to really get into nails</li>
            <li> but if you have the plate holder you don&#x27;t need to worry to much about the edges.</li>
            <li> and they work very well.</li>
            <li> and they work really well.</li>
            <li> All the images stamp very well, and I had no duplicates in the box.  </li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat them for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loves painting her nails wild colors and these just added the fun she has.</li>
            <li> One plate had a dent in the edge and another had a scratch straight across a plate and through one of the designs.</li>
            <li> Listen I really do like the Konad stamp plates</li>
            <li> I really like the designs and they work well.  </li>
            <li> Some of the designs I got were really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cuz it dries fast</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use it for me.  </li>
            <li> but i tried almost very stamp</li>
            <li> They arrived in fast time.</li>
            <li> you soo much SHANY</li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> My wife is into the whole art nail design and loves this gift i got her.</li>
            <li> and they stamp really well</li>
            <li> I like the variety of the designs for such a cheap price.  </li>
            <li> They seem to work really well.</li>
            <li> Stamps very well.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed..</li>
            <li> Appears much easier in the description</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old is very excited with all the different patterns I make on her nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work like the others I own the design is very hard to get a clean picture.</li>
            <li> Be careful handling these plates they really are sharp but the designs are great.</li>
            <li> There are lots of large, full nail images, French manicure images (I turn them sideways and make new designs on my nails.), and small dainty images that I stamp in different colors all over my nails.</li>
            <li> Some of the images won&#x27;t transfer completely and evenly even with the right polish</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the plates that came with my original stamping kit at an absolute FRACTION of the cost, even at their regular price.  </li>
            <li> The plates came with a whole variety of different designs, all of which are unique</li>
            <li> I used cheap, thick white nail polish and globbed it onto the disc and scraped off the excess with an old gift card and used by Konad Stamper to roll the image onto my nail from the stamper and voila, amazing nails!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty much a professional already!</li>
            <li> Having not used any other brands of image plates before, I can&#x27;t comment on how well they work compared to others, but they seemed to do ok.</li>
            <li> also made sure to get a starter kit that came with the stamper, scraper, and some other plates and polish.</li>
            <li> These stamp disks are so razor sharp that my daughter and I were cut many times just handling them.</li>
            <li> it did not come with a stamp, which upset me because I paid more for this item than some other brands that did come with the stamp</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend I was so excited to order them and totally bummed out when we used them</li>
            <li> and we were excited about that only to find it was not included.</li>
            <li> I agree with most other reviews.  </li>
            <li> It was better then all the other deals.</li>
            <li> You do get variety and quantity, but part of me wishes I bought a couple of other plates instead to get better quality.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with one of the most helpful reviews, these things are SHARP.</li>
            <li> If you look at the image Amazon provides, you can see the same flower in the top row on the first and last plate.</li>
            <li> Just got them few days ago ,, the product has a high quality and lot of shapes variations with an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Their products are highly pigmented, reasonably priced and shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> Hard to maneuver the stamps around and get in right place very easy.</li>
            <li> As long as you use them with care, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> But the key is once u clean excess nail polish</li>
            <li> short of time, no problem,give this a chance and clean up is no-problem.</li>
            <li> - A lot of the smaller images are also a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> The disks were protected with a blue film so once removed they are clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> A set of 25 plates with many designs on each plate, you will be busy for a long time...</li>
            <li> SUPER SUPER careful if you have the older plates.</li>
            <li> They do take a little practice to get the hang of, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s easy, fun</li>
            <li> A little hard to use, I find it best to do the whole nail designs.</li>
            <li> The plates are extremely high quality and transfer very well.  </li>
            <li> When we started doing our nails then only I realized that I missed to order special nail paint.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you order the other bundle with more plates.</li>
            <li> Besides, I do not think i will be using half of these designs anyway, and in retrospect, I would have been better off getting something I really like than something I am content</li>
            <li> and it is easy enough that my 8 year old can do it with me.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see such a large bundle of the stamping plates for such a low price, especially after getting a starter set at Sally&#x27;s Beauty and only getting 5 plates its wonderful to have such variety now!</li>
            <li> Yes, the designs are amazing, but they run small.</li>
            <li> Plenty to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I uploaded an image for this product showing my first manicure using them, so you can see how clearly they stamp.  </li>
            <li> They work fantastically and there is such a wide variety of designs, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> but my images came out crisp and clear.  </li>
            <li> The patterns are clear and crisp, all of them usable.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I was having was on the full nail design</li>
            <li> The Konad plates only have 4 of these full nail designs per plate, while these have 6.</li>
            <li> There are accent designs, French tip designs, full nail designs, etc.  </li>
            <li> I would probably send the stamp set back and want a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorites are definitely the all-over designs (the full rectangle of pattern shown in the bottom row of plates in the image).  </li>
            <li> The full nail design does not leave any room for error and only covered my ring finger and pinky.</li>
            <li> Some of the designs on the plates will not take well enough on the stamper to show up in full design.</li>
            <li> I recieved my plates very fast and since I was one of the first 50 customers to purchase my plates from Shany, I got them for a special LOW LOW price too.     </li>
            <li> I hope that this is limited to this plate and that the rest of the set works fine.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the normal French tip image to work, even with the Konad special polish.  </li>
            <li> I will be able to use most of the plates but some may give me trouble due to the scratches.</li>
            <li> I read that if you slightly buff your stamper, it makes images connect better onto it.</li>
            <li> All the holiday ones are really cute and there are the typical butterflies and hearts I would use.</li>
            <li> while it does with the black, it seems most don&#x27;t work with ANY polish I buy, stamping polish or not.</li>
            <li> And some of the images that seemed okay were not deep enough to get an impression.  </li>
            <li> I expected these to be nice, but they are a lot nicer than I was actually expecting.</li>
            <li> Nail Art Polish Stamp Manicure Image Plates set of 25 pcs w/ Instruction, mainly because of the price.  </li>
            <li> The main problem I have with this product is that it has some scratches on the plates.</li>
            <li> made sure to try different speeds and different amount of polish on the stamp.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought it for the horror plate with the &amp;#34;scream&amp;#34; mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I examined the plates and noticed that most of the plates are not etched deep enough for you to get a stamp-able image.</li>
            <li> I had to only wait a grand total of two days from the time I ordered..</li>
            <li> While this kit comes with MANY designs, some of them are not stamped deep enough into the plate, so when you remove the excess polish, ALL of the polish scrapes away!</li>
            <li> So many different designs to chose from you will never wear the same design twice!!</li>
            <li> Love the variety of designs, the seasonal and holiday themes, the all over, french tip and individual images.</li>
            <li> But when i saw that these were 25 of them for such a cheap price, i was so surprised.</li>
            <li> I love doing my won designs, but some designs are just a bit too hard to do using a small brush, but these worked just perfectly and look like you spent alot to get your nails done professionally!</li>
            <li> I really think the designs are adorable, but they&#x27;re too small to really work with my tastes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for beginners and professionals alike.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need fancy packaging, especially for such a cheap product I really don&#x27;t care; it just seems very unprofessional from a company.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend the konad plates, but they are a bit pricier.  </li>
            <li> Allows me to add artistry to my nails without paying a high price in a salon.</li>
            <li> probably was my fault though for having high expectations.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> - they&#x27;re much more clear and sharp in person.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my plates, but they are just okay, not great.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work, but the image worked a little better when I tried this brand called Essence-</li>
            <li> and they just gives your nails a little cute design it takes literally no time at all, and they are so affordable.</li>
            <li> so they all stay in a little box safely, and you won&#x27;t have to worry about finding a way to store them.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews said that they are sharp and they cut you easily</li>
            <li> Also, the protective plastic that comes on them is kind of hard to get off, but nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, after trying again with some old nail polish that I don&#x27;t use, because it became a little too thick, the plates worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Some of the larger designs are hard to transfer but it&#x27;s a good deal for so much variety</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have one bad thing to say about these plates, very happy and told everyone I know who as the kit like I do to order them.</li>
            <li> And I received them on the expected shipping date with free 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal for your money, but chances are you&#x27;re only going to like only a few of the designs.</li>
            <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> And the plates that have the full designs (such as the stripes, stars, ect)dont completely cover my nails.</li>
            <li> I know this is about the product and not the seller, but this is the only one I&#x27;ve seen selling these plates, which aren&#x27;t exclusively Shany brand, apparently, so I thought a general review would be more helpful.</li>
            <li> Can use normal polish with it.</li>
            <li> So many designs, too few nails to paint...</li>
            <li> I own both Bundle Monster sets, lots of Konads, the set from MASH, Red Angel plates and various plates from european collections.  </li>
            <li> However, after getting on youtube and watching a few videos I was able to get to the hang of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More waste of money.</li>
            <li> was that I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be that sharp so as i peeled off the clear plastic, I was left with many cuts!</li>
            <li> i wouldnt normally wear-</li>
            <li> Let me tell you this, with this many designs, everyone will find a few dozens that they like.</li>
            <li> There are a few things for most of the holidays included.</li>
            <li> The designs are really random, and there isn&#x27;t a very many even worth having.</li>
            <li> Totally wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried even the nail polish that goes with it instead of normal polish.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of fun creating themes and just trying out different color combinations.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble with many of the images not stamping fully.</li>
            <li> I have numerous options and design choices for any season, event, or fun</li>
            <li> the bundle monster plates were quite a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> I used normal polish and it still worked.</li>
            <li> there are so many choices to choose from and there all unique and different it is so hard to choose from i highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> The images are crisp and clean and stamp as well as konad, however, I am surprised at how sharp the edges are even tho</li>
            <li> Other then that the rest were fine.</li>
            <li> Also, the blue film is easy to remove, but only remove it from the side with the imprints and store each plate separately once you have removed the film so they don&#x27;t get scratched</li>
            <li> I jumped right into this stamping, and never looked back.</li>
            <li> I use them with the widest part of the image going across my nail (from left to right).  </li>
            <li> runs with different polishes and techniques to get it right.</li>
            <li> So maybe next time I will try a different regular polish that doesnt dry as fast and see if that makes a difference, Im thinking some of these more intricate designs aren&#x27;t engraved as deeply as Konad brand like many were saying.</li>
            <li> The big images are fine but NOT the small detailed one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I do not think I would purchase this set again because although the bigger designs I like, it was just not worth it for so many unusable designs.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldve given 2 stars but the large designs I like a lot</li>
            <li> I had considered letting my six year old use these herself, but after nearly cutting my own finger, I decided to use them on my own, and using them on her only when she asks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> some of the design work perfectly fine and some of the design aren&#x27;t deep enough.</li>
            <li> I think the leopard spots and the zebra are my favorites - they leave a distinct pattern with deep enough indentations in the plate to be pretty precise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was originally trying to order airbrush stencils, but when I seen these I was curious on how this would work</li>
            <li> Shany Plates have such nice models that I want to keep them on my nails as long as possible so it will take me quite a while to eventually apply all those designs.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get it right, but there are a lot of helpful tutorials on youtube, and I learnt to use it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a new stamper</li>
            <li> I hope they come out with new designs soon.</li>
            <li> Im new nail stamping</li>
            <li> I am new to nail stamping and started with a Konad starter kit just a week or two ago.  </li>
            <li> I will keep trying and buying new Shany Products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new at stamping</li>
            <li> I have a new obsession for \\&quot;styling\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I would hold off on this purchase until they come out with a new design set, or make an official statement on this amazon.com listing about the plates being the updated versions.</li>
            <li> As a blogger I&#x27;m always trying to do new things with my nails.</li>
            <li> For beginner stampers, I recommend this set, plus Mash&#x27;s new set and Bundle Monster&#x27;s new set.</li>
            <li> all new</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a huge variety of images, some smaller, some larger, so there should be something for everyone.</li>
            <li> I just carefully held a plate, took my nail and scratched at the tippy top, and it peels off instantly.</li>
            <li> I may purchase it again if I like their designs but in the set I bought I only liked a few of them.</li>
            <li> The package arrived earlier than expected and each plate seems to be ok, no damages.</li>
            <li> So far I have tried several images all with success.</li>
            <li> I have used cheap, Wet N&#x27; Wild nail polishes from the drug store and they work well.</li>
            <li> but I wish there was more full nail designs then just random little designs :)</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;m having is not knowing what one to use next ;)!!</li>
            <li> they are very clear.</li>
            <li> the stamps leaves the image very clear with all the details.</li>
            <li> Images come out very clear.</li>
            <li> The images are deep, they transfer cleanly, and the images are far enough away from each other for easy use.</li>
            <li> This product is good for the price, but the plates are very sharp and i am a bit disappointed that there aren&#x27;t that many full nail designs... can&#x27;t beat it for the price though.</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster and Shany plate are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> This is actually the first nail stamping system I have purchased</li>
            <li> since I got the order in a day early!</li>
            <li> Deep etching &amp; crisp detail.  </li>
            <li> Exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Overall: Very happy with this item, for the price you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> The Konad and the Salon Express kits both had the same exact quality of image plates.  </li>
            <li> When I first got these, I painted over the blue seals.</li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend this product for someone looking to get exactly what they were promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> The designs are not similar to any other plates I have purchased and I just love all the designs.</li>
            <li> I soaked the plates briefly in hot water to loosen the plastic, then using an emory board to grab an edge of the blue plastic</li>
            <li> Without the hot water soak and emory board I would have shredded my fingers trying to remove that blue plastic.</li>
            <li> I got these and most don&#x27;t even work because they&#x27;re too small or something.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to use it now.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> So if you can get past that, then i guess you&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and the edges are not sharp unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying from this seller again and also plan to refer them to my friend here who has a shop and pays ridiculous prices for her supplies that are not as good quality as these.</li>
            <li> I tried with both Konad special polish and regular polish, I tried cleaning the plate, scraping at various angles, everything and nothing works.  </li>
            <li> My longest nails are about 3/4 inch long right now.  </li>
            <li> I usually only wear a clear coat on my hands, but this makes me want to have color on them!I will absolutely be ordering from Shany again!</li>
            <li> I received the Shany plates very quickly, and have tried quite a few of the designs.</li>
            <li> Even then the stamps were not deep enough for a full stamp, unless you put a lot of finger nail polish on the image you want, for it to work.</li>
            <li> Working quickly before it dries, drag the scraper across the design to remove the excess polish and let the excess wipe off on the paper towel.</li>
            <li> oh I&#x27;ll just be super careful...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, because I was just using my own nail polish to do the stamping.</li>
            <li> The images are tiny and as for most of the designs, because of it I can&#x27;t even tell what I&#x27;ve stamped on my nail when I glance down.</li>
            <li> WOW is what I have to say so far!  </li>
            <li> ;P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things that I wanted to point out for new stampers like myself: this process is fun, it is fast, it takes a little practice.</li>
            <li> They make polish specifically for stamping, but if you insist on using your own it can&#x27;t be brand new, thin, nail polish.</li>
            <li> I suggest using the white or black top coats with these.  </li>
            <li> and I tried the paw image on the plate with all the pets with Wet and Wild quick drying polish with the color</li>
            <li> Fast shipping got exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> would guess that these plates aren&#x27;t cut deep enough or very consistently.</li>
            <li> These are great stamps, I was a little hesitant buying these after all the negative comments.</li>
            <li> and i can choose from so many diffrent options it has to design my nails for such little price and its reusable unlike those stickers.</li>
            <li> hardly ever able to get an impression onto my nails</li>
            <li> so soon as i got it out of the box i was stamping, this kit has so many designs that i can hardly choose what one i want .</li>
            <li> I do not understand why people were complaining about the blue protector they have, they are easy to take off I mean its pretty basic not complicated at all.</li>
            <li> The plastic come off easy, and if I leave the back coating on the edges aren&#x27;t sharp at all.</li>
            <li> There are some very cool designs, however some are just to big for an average finger nail, and you have to use a think polish.</li>
            <li> designs aren&#x27;t clear, the plates are used and scratched up.\\</li>
            <li> &quot; I think everyone else has made it clear by now that you have to peel off the protective covering.</li>
            <li> Clearly this design is not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> They make a clear image with no smudging or blurry lines.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for Christmas for my 13 year old sister-in-law along with a SHANY Stamping Nail Art Set and she loves them.  </li>
            <li> They have 18 buisness day&#x27;s and they can&#x27;t get here everyting must ship directly from China and be carried by foot.</li>
            <li> I read from another review that someone used an old credit card.</li>
            <li> I had no problem with the size of any of the stamps so far.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 10 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I scrape, and everytime I scrape, all of the nailpolish comes off completely.</li>
            <li> So far they work well</li>
            <li> It looks like the images that are supposed to cover the whole nail actually will cover it.</li>
            <li> Some of the finer more delicate designs don&#x27;t transfer well -</li>
            <li> I have done my nails a bunch of times as well as my 6 year old daughters</li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t make this thing work so far.</li>
            <li> and I know that images from the Konad plates transfer completely to your nail.</li>
            <li> COMPLETE SATISFACTION.</li>
            <li> I suggest it to any one who likes to do their nails, whether they are young or old.</li>
            <li> Until this is fixed.</li>
            <li> fast delivery came in a couple of days earlier.</li>
            <li> No smudging or blurry lines so far with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve played around with 5 or 6 of the plates mixing and matching</li>
            <li> I love love love this product , the only thing that I \\&quot; HATED \\&quot;!!</li>
            <li> use an old giftcard to scrape the excess polish off of  the plate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking the french manicure designs.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like them, and I planned on using them frequently</li>
            <li> The nail art set definitely gives off a very glamorous look.</li>
            <li> Maybe the company fixed that problem.</li>
            <li> The image plates was in a small box that fix them perfectly, then it was put in a bigger box with nothing to protect the small box from moving around in the bigger box.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Also, I keep my nails short &amp; the \\&quot;whole</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited patiently for them to contact me and resolve this matter, but I suspect that I shall never get my complete order from them.  </li>
            <li> Had no trouble with it</li>
            <li> I got these for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the product.</li>
            <li> we were both pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> but its not for sensitive design.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter and she is in heaven.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let any suicidal individuals near these.  </li>
            <li> Lots of kid design as well as adult.  </li>
            <li> My 12 year old loves this set and the ones given to her with it.  </li>
            <li> When i received the plates, they were scratched up like they were old or something.</li>
            <li> (I have a 3yr old).</li>
            <li> what an 8 and 3 year old like, differs quite a bit for a 30 something.</li>
            <li> I did find some tips on YouTube that used an old credit card</li>
            <li> In my opinion, SHANY went through the complaints customers had and fixed the products to suit.</li>
            <li> for me this this makes the actual stamping process to be much easier.</li>
            <li> The plates had many scratches &amp; a few DEEP gauges,where you could see the silver metal</li>
            <li> I was unable to get a good stamp onto my nail.  </li>
            <li> I bought the special nail polish and scrapper but every time I tried the nail polish either cam right off the plate or the stamper would only pick up a small portion of the nail polish.</li>
            <li> so I have to say Shany Cosmetics holds true to their motto or providing professional products at a extremely lower cost!</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s not your thing, that&#x27;s fine, but there are other usable designs on the same plate.</li>
            <li> Clean the plate design and stamper after each stamping, use Q-tips when you do this or you will mess up your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type of person that gets bored easily with nail polish and likes to have cool designs on your nails</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw these because they have little bugs, a kite, a hummingbird, an anchor, the zodiac signs and the list</li>
            <li> Between my small fingernails, how easily someone could cut themselves trying to use the stamps, and how some of the stamps just don&#x27;t want to transfer over..</li>
            <li> This set has some cool designs on it, and for less than $15 you get 25 plates.</li>
            <li> I tried to clean them with a cotton pad but a lot of the nail polish remained and little fibers of cotton got stuck in the image.  </li>
            <li> but they work better for them over the single images because the single images are too big.</li>
            <li> But as long as you take your time and are careful, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> far as the actual plates go, after doing a little research and watching a youtube video, I found these plates to be really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing new designs as they come out!</li>
            <li> more than half of the designs were not engraved deep enough for the design to imprint on the stamper.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and once I finally did, more than half of the plates had some type of residue left on them from the protective film.   </li>
            <li> You get a wide variety of designs from French to full nail to even some holiday designs.      </li>
            <li> My main problem with these and this seller is actually that when I received the plates, I opened the box and they just slid out.</li>
            <li> I finally tore off the blue seals and used them for the first time.</li>
            <li> The first day I got them, I painted all ten fingers different colors and stamped them all!!</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that for the designs meant to cover the entire nail - I wish these images were a bit larger as I happen to have larger hands than most and the image didn&#x27;t cover the entirety of my thumb or middle finger nails.</li>
            <li> No, the quality is not quite as high as the konad discs, but the value is second to none.  </li>
            <li> I have been using them with regular polish (OPI-which is highly pigmented) over my gel manicure</li>
            <li> I recommend you do a few at a time, do some you want to use right away and pick a few backups because some of the images don&#x27;t transfer easily.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had a big problem transferring images.. as long as you use the right polish.  </li>
            <li> I love the discs but one was cut slightly off center so part of a design from another disc is on it&#x27;s edge.</li>
            <li> I have tried out almost all of the plates by now and have only had problems with a few of the images not transferring easily.</li>
            <li> Might give them a try again later because many people really love them and maybe it was just my batch that was bad.  </li>
            <li> After cleaning them well - the small detailed images still did not come out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally one to use these nail plates, hoever I saw the different designs and decided to purchase for fun.</li>
            <li> Shany must have listened to the complaints, because the plates I received had tbe paper backings and the blue plastic was not hard to get off.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because I did not receive the Instructions, other then that I would highly recommend these Image plates to anyone interested in nail stamping.</li>
            <li> These are hard to use, so easy to smudge when your are transferring the image from the stamp to your nail.  </li>
            <li> My younger daughter cut herself on the edge of the plates trying to help - the edges are super sharp.  </li>
            <li> The smaller and more delicate designs are near impossible to transfer using the stamp, but the bigger and bolder designs show up beautifully.</li>
            <li> I have only stored them away in their new case.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I was new when it came to using image plates, I would usually just try to use nail art to decorate my nails which was very time consuming, I just was not sure I was going to be able to get the results I wanted out of this set.</li>
            <li> i would say that these plates aren&#x27;t bad for the money but being able to compare the two there is a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> the polish will dry fast...</li>
            <li> Another plus to this product is that it can seriously save you a lot of money from not having to get designs done at a nail salon, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the nail salon, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option of doing it yourself.</li>
            <li> And the only reason I don&#x27;t like them is that the protective blue covering is a absolute pain in the butt to get off.</li>
            <li> Several different designs to choose from, very well made plates.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For some of the larger images, I have had trouble getting them to deposit smoothly across the nail, so I am going to try making some &amp;#34;nail stickers&amp;#34; with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to buy the specific scraper, however, since the scraper I had from a different set won&#x27;t work with these very well at all.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;whole nail\\&quot; images are perfect for me because I have smaller nail beds and they covered them completely (a little work for the thumb, but nothing too bad).  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s even a couple of images for each major holiday, which is a bonus because now I don&#x27;t need any holiday plates.  </li>
            <li> they are a little tricky at first, but with practice and watching youtube videos, I got the hang of it now!</li>
            <li> First of all they got here sooner than I expected!</li>
            <li> they are NOT sharp.</li>
            <li> the plates are not sharp at all.  </li>
            <li> They are okay if used with two low contrast colors, but the edge of the design suddenly stopping before the end of your nail is glaringly obvious with colors that are very different from each other.</li>
            <li> the images are not sharp when stamped,some of the images just don&#x27;t come out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The edges were not sharp.</li>
            <li> I get sharp, crisp images from them</li>
            <li> The major competitor has a cushion backing and thicker gauge disk</li>
            <li> No complaints with the others &amp; mine are not sharp either..</li>
            <li> nails (they&#x27;re not really small or anything), and the largest images can definitely go all the way across my nails.</li>
            <li> I would do a little more research on other stamping sets before buying these.</li>
            <li> , I feel like I will use a higher percentage of these designs than I would from the other kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only con is that the plates have no backing and can be a bit sharp when you need to peel off the blue wrapping front and back; still it is a minor inconvenience for some pretty cool plates.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell the difference between these plates and the ones that came with the salon express kit, if you use thin nail polish with any plates the image will be very light if it shows up at all.</li>
            <li> Very important, remember to remove the thin layer of plastic from over the plate before trying to stamp it.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is a little anoying only because by the time you put the polish on the plate, scrape it off and stamp it</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this item, so when I did it was a huge disappointment.   </li>
            <li> The edges are pretty sharp, and you might get cut on them if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> but i do know that the plates are very sharp though i have not cut myself they look very sharp so if you purchase this item be carefull... :)</li>
            <li> Got these as a little gift for myself to have fun with.</li>
            <li> The full nail designs are bigger than on some other plates but not for longer nails (but can be used for french manicure.</li>
            <li> I was a little bummed when they first arrived because I figured the plates with naturally come with the scraper and stamper.</li>
            <li> I saw a review here about the images being too small, but I do not think they are, they are the right size for the large patterns to cover the whole nail and for the little images to be used as accents.</li>
            <li> This was great my daughters wanted this so bad</li>
            <li> they scratch sooo easily that its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I thought the plates would be clear instead of blue.</li>
            <li> But unless you have exceptionally long nails, you won&#x27;t have any trouble finding images to fit.</li>
            <li> All the images look clear and seem to be of the same quality as Konad.</li>
            <li> stamps come out solid and clear.</li>
            <li> Some are even small enough to fit on my 8 year olds nails</li>
            <li> Set each child up with stamper, scaper, paper towels, some acrylice paints, something to stamp to I use some colored paper, give each child 1 dry coton wipe and 1 wet to clean plate after each design was stamped, paint brushes or q-tips for appling paint, quirted some paint out some smaller pieces of paper.</li>
            <li> So I would recommend using an old gift/credit card instead of the metal plates, because it WILL scratch up your metal plates, overall, I would defiantly gt them!!</li>
            <li> My hands are smaller then my neighbor&#x27;s 8 year old son.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no way that you can cut your hand on this plate unless you r really just sliding them on your hands really rough.</li>
            <li> I even used it on my 2-year old with Piggie Paint polish to put Hello Kitty on her big toe</li>
            <li> But I was a bit disappointed that so many of the smaller and cute designs I could not use.&lt;br /&gt;Seems these are made cheaper and not etched as deep so that the designs are not coming thru.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I do not think they would last with professional use.</li>
            <li> I received the package with the plates scattered all over the box with apparent scratches on each plate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still waiting for my stamping polish, and so far have only used Sally Hansen.  </li>
            <li> :o</li>
            <li> The image plates also had \\&quot;french manicure\\&quot; tip images and with practice - can have a neat effect on an old manicure style standby.  </li>
            <li> so get a old gift card and use that to scrape of the extra nail polish</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for a young teen, thinking she would show her friends</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter loves having her nails stamped with tiny hearts or flowers.</li>
            <li> There is a wide variety of designs and the impressions are cut deeply into the plate, so they are crisply outlined on your nails.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ll just throw out that plate because it&#x27;s frustrating to have the design but not be able to use it.</li>
            <li> What I found out was I was using the wrong kind of polish.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re so expensive and these work really nice.  </li>
            <li> so your design with be smooth, you need thick polish.</li>
            <li> Just do not forget to take off the thin plastic on top of every plate.</li>
            <li> Another thing I&#x27;ve learned that that you really need to stamp as quickly as possible or the polish will dry and not stamp well.</li>
            <li> Not such a big deal for me, but again, no small children around here.  </li>
            <li> so small you can only use it on a pinky finger-not worth it people!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still excited to see what other ideas I can come up with from the other plates as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My big toe is the only nails that aren&#x27;t covered by the all-over designs completely, but I have no complaints really!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> at first I thought the problem was the nail polish, but I used the same polish on other plates i purchased before, and there was no problem; so I realized the problem was the plate.</li>
            <li> It came in a huge envelope for such a tiny little box!</li>
            <li> The french tip designs you need to scrape across the design, not down the design.</li>
            <li> plates were much smaller than I expected, though certainly not an issue with the product - they fit in the Konad Stamping Nail Art Image Plate Holder, so couldn&#x27;t be any bigger.  </li>
            <li> with these plates even the simplest designs (there really isn&#x27;t much to the anchor or kite) take multiple, frustrating attempts to get the full image on the stamper.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> I tried it with no base polish, and could barely see the design, so darker base coat works better.  </li>
            <li> The blue plastic wasn&#x27;t too difficult to remove, the stamps themselves work great, AND they aren&#x27;t as sharp as some people are saying!</li>
            <li> So much to choose from:)&lt;br /&gt;Lucky I read reviews before purchasing and was warned about the pesky coating the plates are wrapped it, like stated by others, be very careful.</li>
            <li> Only about 18 of the 25 were cut deeply enough for me to get a clear image off of, and so I emailed SHANY about getting replacement plates.</li>
            <li> I have ordered a wide range of different types of plates from different companies, and so far shany plates are my least favorite.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because I have wide nails, so the patterned images do not cover my whole nail.</li>
            <li> The only problems i have had so far are the french tip nail designs.</li>
            <li> The plates are thin and sharp, so be extra careful when handling them, especially when you first take off that dreaded plastic coating that has no desire to come off nicely.  </li>
            <li> I do have to agree that these plates are sharp, very VERY sharp and they have no backing on them which makes them even harder to handle safely.  </li>
            <li> most reviewers said the sides of the plates are sharp but if you know this going in they aren&#x27;t that hard to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I can at least say that the SHANY plates are slightly thinner, but also much flatter - the Red Angel set I just received is thicker metal, but a tad warped from the stamping process - they all do not sit flush with each other - SHANY plates, nice, snug &amp; flat!)</li>
            <li> They really aren&#x27;t that sharp, especially if you are using them as intended.</li>
            <li> As i said in my stamper review, these image plates are not meant for nails with much length, and it only works to have part of the design going in one direction and the other part going another with some designs.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of actual Konad, and they do seem to work extremely well, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much of difference between their quality and Shany or MASH or 2012 Bundle Monsters, except for the price.</li>
            <li> Not a long wait for them at all.</li>
            <li> I believe that if it was deep enough to use regular polish it would be bumpy, it wouldn&#x27;t look \\&quot;professionally done\\&quot;</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to cut yourself on the edges, but I&#x27;m stupidly clumsy and have managed to remain cut free so far.  </li>
            <li> Its a fun novelty for a small price.</li>
            <li> I also have NOT had a problem with the edges being sharp at all, which was one of my main concerns.</li>
            <li> but if you press the rubber stamper really quick and hard</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic was super hard to peel off.</li>
            <li> Amazon offered to make it right by offering me a small refund.</li>
            <li> The plastic covers are a real pain to remove and I&#x27;ve seen in a previous review that someone got injured trying to remove them.</li>
            <li> i have pretty small hands and the anchor barely takes up a quarter of my nail.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> They are all big enough for my fingers, although some are clearly for faux nails because they are long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited to add:  after I published this review, I was looking through some of theothers, and was surprised at how many people complained the images were too small.  </li>
            <li> I like the images - especially the full nail images - but they&#x27;re just TOO SMALL for my fingers!</li>
            <li> (Oh and on a side note, no special nail polish needed, any opaque nail polish works really well.)</li>
            <li> What I love about this particular set is it came with nail tips, whole nail, and little other designs or random pictures.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the full nail designs are narrow.</li>
            <li> i like to do designs on my nails and the nail salon always charges too much to do one little design on my nail.</li>
            <li> One of the other reviewers went commented about how she had tiny hands and how the whole nail designs were just too small to cover her whole finger nails.  </li>
            <li> Some of the design are hard to get on to the stamp but its fun to do with my nieces.  </li>
            <li> Takes a  little practice but he was able to do her nails after just a few tries.</li>
            <li> And the application comes off as clean and highly detailed which is very difficult to achieve with other plates.</li>
            <li> I can see how someone could think they were shorted in the order, as the plates ARE thin, sharp and do stick to each other at first, but I did have the full 25 pcs, and no duplicates.</li>
            <li> However, the large images are too small to cover your entire nail, except the pinky.</li>
            <li> The color runs over and certain designs are too small or too big.</li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t as clear as other plates.</li>
            <li> Also, I read that you can rough up the little stamper with an emery board first, then cleanse it with some polish remover and that helps too.</li>
            <li> The first few times I tried it, I only got a partial image.</li>
            <li> High quality heavy material made to last.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased  NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit (they are no longer available)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am awful at doing my own nails, and new to stamping, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare these with.</li>
            <li> plate has several designs as shown, some cover the whole nail and others are just small add on images.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First, the plastic that comes on them to protect during shipping is extremely difficult to remove and very time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I understand that sometimes big operations can go pear shaped and take much longer to fix small problems when it comes to a design error.</li>
            <li> and i was relieved after reading that a few people got duplicates of that particular design.</li>
            <li> I did find the protective stickers pretty annoying to remove, but with tweezers I was able to do it.</li>
            <li> only thing is that a couple of the individual designs showed up on another plate, so I actually have two of them, but it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, there are a few of the designes that dont seem to be etched deep enough or the etching is too thin of a line and the stamper wouldn&#x27;t be able to pick up the image all the time.</li>
            <li> Also, they have very thin designs with delicate lines that even if the image stamps, you have to deep clean it in between since it is now full of polish and won&#x27;t stamp twice.  </li>
            <li> help get that blue plastic off, I used the tip of my tweezers and scratched a tiny little bit near each edge</li>
            <li> On the other hand, though i have not tested out every single image as of yet, the images that i have tried stamp very clearly onto the nail (also depends on the nail polish you use).</li>
            <li> These plates are really thin and you will have to be careful handling these as they may cut you easily.</li>
            <li> But after a few more tries I found out that you have to press really hard</li>
            <li> the images that are supposed to cover the whole nail don&#x27;t even for small hands.</li>
            <li> Flowers, butterflies and nature; abstract, geometric; beach themed stuff, holidays; small, medium and whole nail designs.  </li>
            <li> but my biggest problem is that the images are much too small.</li>
            <li> The few extra plates are the reason I bought these over the Bundle Monster ones, and as far as I can tell, these are the same plates.</li>
            <li> (Please excuse my writing skills in English :</li>
            <li> I have regular sized hands and naturally long nails.  </li>
            <li> There are ways to double stamp to cover a long nail ...</li>
            <li> It was strached up and the designs are flat.</li>
            <li> did swipe card at an angle, and on a flat surface.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even received some form of acknowledgment that they&#x27;ve actually received, let a long read, my email.  </li>
            <li> in 3 minutes flat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a little hesitant when buying new plates because I&#x27;ve ended up getting a lot of crappy ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also read that the larger images are not large enough to cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the quality is the exact same for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> First time trying was slightly difficult, but it&#x27;s new to me...and after only redoing one mani...</li>
            <li> says that the blue plastic was hard to take off and the plates don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I recently heard about these other plates called red angel and I&#x27;m considering getting those only because I know a friend who has them</li>
            <li> also the edges are not sharp like other brands and there is a backing to them</li>
            <li> and I can live without the two missing plates.</li>
            <li> I guess the only way you might have an issue is if your nails were very *long</li>
            <li> I waited a very long time to write a review for these plates because I don&#x27;t like writing low star reviews for companies.</li>
            <li> these plates work really well with the konad stamper and scraper, my only complaint is that I sliced my finger taking the plastic lining off.</li>
            <li> I really hesitated on buying these because of the negative reviews but after receiving them, I have to say that i think those people did not remove the blue protective film or perhaps were not roughing up the stamper.  </li>
            <li> Very.fun and easy to use, a couple of mine came already scuffed and some random marks</li>
            <li> There are a wide variety of patterns so there is a lot of potential for different holidays and occasions.</li>
            <li> But They look good, and I&#x27;ve been able to stamp a few designs without making an awful mess of it.</li>
            <li> ordered this with a MASH double sided stamper/scraper and a SHANY single ended stamper/plate holder.</li>
            <li> All of the single sized smaller images work well (the ones I have</li>
            <li> These plates are sharp, both me and my sister (who barely handled them) got cut on them.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;stamps&#x27; aren&#x27;t deep enough into the plate to allow the polish to sink into the picture to be transferred - she only found a few images that actually worked.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint here is that some of the square whole-nail designs are not large enough to cover my whole thumb nail in one go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this black for stamping on other plates, on this particular image</li>
            <li> As far as the sharp edges, handle them carefully</li>
            <li> only downside is they are sharp enough to cut your fingers</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are deep enough, I have other plates that are deeper</li>
            <li> Sinful colors, sally hansen xtreme wear, other more expensive thicker polishes (OPI, essie) also work.</li>
            <li> I also was aware of the blue plastic film from hell and the fact it was very hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> The image plates are very thin, could get easily damaged...</li>
            <li> ordered it for my little sister 12 yr old divaaaaaa   </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to use them on myself and my young daughter who loves getting her little nails painted.</li>
            <li> As someone else pointed out, there is a plastic cover over the plate, removing the plastic covering reveals a shiny, slick, highly polished surface.</li>
            <li> The plates are made of a high quality metal and come protected in a small package.</li>
            <li> The edges had been filed down and were not sharp at all</li>
            <li> I thought we were just doing it wrong, but no matter who tried it, how much (or little) nail polish we used or even which brand/color we used, we couldn&#x27;t get a complete transfer (mostly the middle of the image would be missing).  </li>
            <li> give this product a \\&quot;meh\\&quot; because as some others reported, not all the designs are well cut - thus they do not stamp, or at least the whole design does not stamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a few images don&#x27;t work completely..</li>
            <li> It took me a couple tries and some experimenting with different nail polishes.</li>
            <li> The image isn&#x27;t deep cut into the plate like Konad plates or Bundle Monster image plates so after you swipe the excess polish then press the stamp a partial or no image transfers.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have got these a long time ago..</li>
            <li> Just handle them properly and carefully.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i don&#x27;t think this was a complete waste of money because i haven&#x27;t tried them all</li>
            <li> The plates have a wide variety of designs which can be used for different occasions!</li>
            <li> I went on a month long trip to India to attend a wedding.</li>
            <li> We expected to get 25 different plates as the product details.</li>
            <li> but the thing doesn&#x27;t work -waste of money and complete junk</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, I did receive two minimally damaged plates.</li>
            <li> I spent awhile trying to decide between different plates</li>
            <li> And they are far to heavy to be send by mail..</li>
            <li> I was just kind of disappointed about the backing and the front blue plastic.</li>
            <li> Also to note these plates where so thin and sharp they ripped the original packaging.  </li>
            <li> it totally transforms my nails from dull to a brand new \\&quot;nail shop new\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was 2 of the same disc arrived, but other than that, it is PERFECTION!</li>
            <li> I had not real high expectation for these as I am not a nail artist....</li>
            <li> After reading the negative reviews about how difficult it is to remove the blue film and how easy it is to cut yourself, I was worried about buying these; but I found one review that seemed to suggest that they had fixed the problem, so I figured I&#x27;d gamble.  </li>
            <li> they are still a little rough on the edges, but not sharp enough to cut....</li>
            <li> Having read reviews about the sharp edges, I fully expected to slice my finger open the second I got these.</li>
            <li> edges are too sharp to work with, and the images are too small for the whole</li>
            <li> The edges are sharp enough that without the blue film on the plates, I don&#x27;t want to stack the plates as I&#x27;m afraid the sharp edges of the plate on top will scratch the surface of the plate below.</li>
            <li> And they turn out very professional for an amateur like me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece in lieu of the more expensive konad plates (and because it qualified for Prime!)  </li>
            <li> A metal knife has sharp edges, you just handle it differently than you would a spoon.   </li>
            <li> A lot of them, just some of them a little bit short for big nails.</li>
            <li> And is a lot cheaper in the long run than getting manicurists to do the designs!</li>
            <li> You get a pack of 25 different plates which is a bargain considering other Konad plates can cost $4 for just one.</li>
            <li> It was a bit tedious to rip off all the seals but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> The other side is a shiny blue with the designs.</li>
            <li> No more spending money at the nail salon for a complete manicure!</li>
            <li> I would say is that the edges are a bit sharp but you can definitely avoid getting cut.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not THAT sharp, and the edges of the plates are actually a bit rounded</li>
            <li> The edges of the plates are really sharp, to the point where I actually cut myself on one.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are bigger than the image plate holder that I have, but other than that, they&#x27;re not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My friends are jealous of the different images I have that they didn&#x27;t get with other plates they obtained elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the edges of the plates themselves are very sharp and there seems to be no reason other than quick production...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Someone commented on the blue plastic film being hard to remove - my 5 year old daughter helped me take them off -</li>
            <li> I had a very long line across the horse &amp; number plate.</li>
            <li> I have very long nails and not trying to chip my polish got about 4 done in the time my sister got all the others done.</li>
            <li> and there are enough options that even if only a few turn out</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this stamping set, but I was disappointed to find that none of the images I&#x27;ve tried have been clear enough to even see.</li>
            <li> Besides, I don&#x27;t like every single design on the Konad plates I have, so</li>
            <li> Besides, I don&#x27;t like every single design on the Konad plates I have, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of every single one of them!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> , I can still use all of them as tip decor and the single designs (flower, skull, ect).  </li>
            <li> Have not had the chance to stamp every single image but the ones I did worked well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth getting two extra images when they don&#x27;t cover your nail.    </li>
            <li> The blue protective coverings  were harder to remove than on other sets I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> When I first recieved them I was a bit dissappointed because they looked scratched, then I realized there was a thin plastic cover on the plates which I removed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using any nail art plates, but I&#x27;m now addicted to them.</li>
            <li> I love the designs and they work just as well as that very expensive $6 per plate brand.  </li>
            <li> the plates have lots of wide images, but nothing exceptionally long.  </li>
            <li> The few that actually did, only picked up partially.   </li>
            <li> I love this nail art plates but Konad is very expensive</li>
            <li> The plastic wrapping was a little hard to get off at first</li>
            <li> I even will be keeping the plastic covers to place on them loosely</li>
            <li> They were just loose in the box.</li>
            <li> The only other equipment I have is a little stamper and thats enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Plates seem thicker than ones I&#x27;ve seen before, so it was easy to peel off the plastic and not have to worry about cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> (thhese shany designs only pick up about half of the design).</li>
            <li> -The plates are pretty thin compared to their Konad counterparts, be careful.</li>
            <li> I think the finer designs are harder b/c the polish will dry faster than you can scrape, stamp and transfer.</li>
            <li> The ones I have tried work and are big enough for my nails except for my thumb, but I do have small nails.</li>
            <li> what I do is that I only do half of my nail and make it seem intentional, at a diagonal or horizontal</li>
            <li> Saw a similar product in Florida on vacation, but they wanted around $50 for way less plates.</li>
            <li> one of the images is only half pressed in</li>
            <li> It was pretty difficult to get the blue protective coating off</li>
            <li> The only reason I took off a star it due to how sharp these things could be.</li>
            <li> Once I had the piece peeled enough to grab it with my fingers, I had to work around it slowly so it wouldn&#x27;t rip and become ten times more difficult to do!</li>
            <li> I am also curious if this problem is limited to my set or not.  </li>
            <li> Can be used on a single nail or on all nails!</li>
            <li> Also, handling the paper thin plates is cumbersome and tends to make you mess up your nails since they are super sharp on the edges.  </li>
            <li> Nothing with glitter, shimmer and certain metallics as well as thin polishes.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get off, but I would much rather that they put it on than not have it.</li>
            <li> I like to be a little different</li>
            <li> The designs are a little too generic.</li>
            <li> I had a problem when scraping off the excess polish too, the little plate wanted to bend in the middle and pop up.</li>
            <li> , some of them look a little big for my nails</li>
            <li> However, I was very disappointed to find that one of my favorite images, the squirrel, was not etched deep enough to transfer (and, yes, I did remove the blue plastic.)  </li>
            <li> The little delicate designs work so well, and they are very visible.</li>
            <li> This covering to me is near the bane of my existence, but I eventually worked hard and removed all the coverings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the nail stamping and have so much fun doing it and impressing my little neices.</li>
            <li> When I used Sally Hanson extreme nails \\&quot;black out\\&quot; and \\&quot;white out\\</li>
            <li> I did order black and white konad though to see the difference in my other nail polish.</li>
            <li> Some of the etchings are hard to pick up because they are not deep enough.</li>
            <li> I have seen individual plates from other companies for almost $10 for one plate!?!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to do stamping for quite a while, but couldn&#x27;t justify paying the price other companies were asking for just one single plate.  </li>
            <li> crazy that I paid 17.99 (plus free shipping)for them</li>
            <li> The plates themselves work AMAZING, just very sad how small they are.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest ignoring the negative review on this product which says the plates are scratched and the images are not deep enough to produce a stamped picture.  </li>
            <li> Which sucks, but I figured for such a cheap price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering these plates because of the more negative reviews</li>
            <li> so be careful when using them.</li>
            <li> Did not have any trouble removing the blue protective film as one review I read.</li>
            <li> That Includes the time it takes to go through military postal service</li>
            <li> I took the plastic off mine upon receiving them and still could only get a few of the images to work.</li>
            <li> In all I think its a waste of money to have something that only halfway works.</li>
            <li> They are fiddly, you have to work carefully till you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tries to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> I used to spent an hour or two</li>
            <li> The thing you have to remember though with any plate including konad, is that you need to rough up the stamper</li>
            <li> Be careful when removing these coverings.</li>
            <li> I have small nails &amp; it barely covers my nail from side to side.</li>
            <li> Missing a plate is a big let-down to me.</li>
            <li> I used regular everyday nail polish and followed the directions without over thinking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do need to be careful with them as a result.    </li>
            <li> Spent 3 hours trying to ge the Shany stamper and these plates to work.</li>
            <li> Peel it up from the edge carefully.  </li>
            <li> Carefully roll the stamper across the design to pick it up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so be careful.  </li>
            <li> the smiley face has a hole in one of the eyes, and the one with waving lines, looking one the center of it</li>
            <li> Theres a wide variety or images to choose from</li>
            <li> A few times the stamp hasn&#x27;t picked up the entire image, but I think its the polish problem.</li>
            <li> It gives you a wide variety to choose from.</li>
            <li> Might as well spend the few extra bucks!</li>
            <li> But for the amount of stamps, money well spent.</li>
            <li> but when it says 25 I expected that.</li>
            <li> do come backed, but still have rough edges that might snag a finger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very picky about the images as I like to have a lot of images.</li>
            <li> It came sooner than i expected.</li>
            <li> They are a little sharp but not too bad and you can always make your own backing for them.</li>
            <li> They are SUPER small, the plates are thin, and DON&#x27;T WORK.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use and hard to keep clean for the next finger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian (not to be racist) and have VERY small hands and my fingernails are generally short.</li>
            <li> My nails are about half an inch long but prob narrower than the average.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the kit you see on tv (not going to lost brand), and was looking just for the French tip disc (was missing from other kit) when I found this offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got very frustrated by the plastic coating on them, because it took me 45 minutes to remove all the protective plastic, and it was kind of messy because it tears apart in small pieces rather than one large piece.</li>
            <li> Apparently they had all been in a single small plastic sleeve and had cut through it, which was not adequate packaging at all.</li>
            <li> I only tried one of the intricate designs on it and it seemed to be ok for transfer, but the cleaning of the plate is difficult because it&#x27;s so thin that the design etching is very sharp and the cotton or</li>
            <li> The plates&#x27; diameters are not consistent and the edges on some are rough.</li>
            <li> These plates are a bit sharp around the edges, be careful when handling them.</li>
            <li> The edges are sharp so you might want to be a bit careful.</li>
            <li> Do be careful taking off the plastic as these are sharp metal plates.</li>
            <li> Although they do have sharp edges so be careful when taking off the plastic.  </li>
            <li> Edges are a tad sharp, but when used carefully, aren&#x27;t an issue.  </li>
            <li> I did have some problems with some of the less delicate designs (diagonal lines) because they were bigger and it was harder to get the polish off of it, compared to the smaller designs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am also a small girl, my fingers aren&#x27;t that big, which also means that my fingernails are not as wide as someone else&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> That being said, something like a small metal plate CAN definitely cut a finger, so I&#x27;d still be careful.</li>
            <li> I have used the cheapest to the high dollar polish and if it is thin the image won&#x27;t be dark/bright.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not entirely easy when you first get them because they are thin</li>
            <li> The nail plates I ordered arrived way sooner than I expected!</li>
            <li> I read reviews about the plates being sharp, I was kinda like</li>
            <li> The edges aren&#x27;t as sharp as some people made them seem.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;The plates are so sharp I cut myself.\\</li>
            <li> These plates are suppose to work with the other Shany products.  </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that compared to other brands, they are a light-weight plastic verses a heavier metal type plate.</li>
            <li> She tried different polishes, different rubber stamper tools, and different &#x27;scraping&#x27; techniques to get them to work and all failed.  </li>
            <li> The edges are sharp and thin...think razor.</li>
            <li> I noticed with other brands of nail plates</li>
            <li> Mine aren&#x27;t that sharp.</li>
            <li> Edges are a bit on the sharp side so handle with care.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other plates that were not as well defined so the stamp comes out splotchy</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews that said people got cut on them because the sides are so sharp, and I can see that happening.</li>
            <li> I did not experence any sharp edges with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using Shany polish as well as other brands and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> The discs are a bit sharp too so</li>
            <li> Endless combinations.</li>
            <li> If there was one thing I could change, it would to add backing to the image plates because of the SHARP EDGES!&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> My plates aren&#x27;t THAT sharp either.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve listened to other reviewers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh and just to discount the rumor that they are sharp</li>
            <li> like they have in front, which isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m use to with other brands.</li>
            <li> they are sharp</li>
            <li> Yes, the edges are sharp, but if you&#x27;re reading all these reviews, then you&#x27;ve been plenty warned as I was, and it&#x27;s not a</li>
            <li> they are sharp</li>
            <li> they are no longer sharp on the edges.</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers have stated, the edges are SHARP.  </li>
            <li> That should cover the sharp edges and prevent any slicing of fingers.  </li>
            <li> A couple other notes.  </li>
            <li> I hope this is not the case for other buyers.</li>
            <li> I keep seeing people having issues with the plastic cover and sharp edges, but I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> Other than that I have no complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> Place the plate on a paper towel or other surface</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t wait to order some of the other plate sets they have to offer.</li>
            <li> * A lot of the designs are doubled on other plates with within the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are sharp because of the ragged edges.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived promptly and before i expected it too!</li>
            <li> They can be sharp.</li>
            <li> Sometime the image comes out and other time it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I received this plates today and checked if there were scratches like what the other customers were saying.</li>
            <li> i bought a small stamping kit that only had three plates in it to try it out</li>
            <li> Plus, the edges are really sharp.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed as I do like many of the designs in this set.  </li>
            <li> These also go well with the other shany nail products.</li>
            <li> Other than that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> The edges of the plates feel somewhat sharp, but no complaints about the variety of images.</li>
            <li> have other brands of plates from Bundle Monster and Konad to compare ease of use to</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any duplicate plates like other people claim and the plastic came off without any problems.</li>
            <li> Went to walmart got small set for ten buck for kit.</li>
            <li> possiblities are endless not just for nails.</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I have is maybe they should include a small case to store it all in.</li>
            <li> &quot; this by putting a large label on the back and cutting around the edge of the plate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For some of the smaller images I had a little trouble getting them centered.  </li>
            <li> When you do use them be very careful.</li>
            <li> yet she has told me that they cant send me a replacement set because they are \\&quot;behind in getting new plates</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very long nails at all, nor do I have wide nails, and unfortunately the whole designs will not fit my nails.</li>
            <li> They feel like you can bend them easily which would be disastrous for trying to scrape off excess nail polish from them.  </li>
            <li> : there is a thin BLUE FILM on each plate that you need to peel off (on the front and back)....</li>
            <li> I had some trouble with a few but over all using different types of polish and arylic paint.  </li>
            <li> The edges are a little sharp, but if you be careful and use a plate holder</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without these little wonders!</li>
            <li> As other have mentioned, they don&#x27;t have the paper backing that the Konad plates have, so they are very sharp.</li>
            <li> the plates are very sharp around the edges, be careful it will easily cut you :(    </li>
            <li> Most of the images are to shallow and they dont even pick up on the wand lots of designs to choose from but of the 8 designs i tried only 3 worked:-(</li>
            <li> A couple of things I didn&#x27;t like are: The blue film cover is hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I read all about how hard it is so remove the blue scratch protectors from the plates</li>
            <li> The variety is hard to beat and I wish I had seen .deal earlier!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a hard time taking off the blue plastic on each plate</li>
            <li> The blue protective plastic on these plates is ridiculously hard to remove.</li>
            <li> The only beef I would have is that some of the designs are so close together that it is hard to scrape off the excess polish without getting it on another design and accidentally picking it up with the design you intended to get.  </li>
            <li> The blue plastic on these was a major pain to remove (I also bought the MASH set and they were not as difficult).  </li>
            <li> but they are a little sharp on the edges so be very careful when handling them.</li>
            <li> GOOD LUCK removing it without cutting yourself at least a few times!!!</li>
            <li> Completely not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have average size nails.</li>
            <li> I finally couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and opened these suckers up.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately now she always wants to borrow my stuff.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Average polish quality.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the protective film stuck to some of the plates in different places.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH AT ALL.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I received a couple of duplicates in the set.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with these plates.  </li>
            <li> This was the deepest, most bloody cut I&#x27;ve ever had in my life</li>
            <li> Once you have enough to get a grip on, peel it off the rest slowly.  </li>
            <li> the spider webs are missing chunks at the center of each web.</li>
            <li> i did try with thick and thin polishes, even some that were pretty average.</li>
            <li> I have to admit it took a few tries to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I would probably sand down the sides when I have time.    </li>
            <li> REMEMBER TO WIPE IT DOWN WITH ACETONE TO REMOVE THE GLUE FROM THE LINING.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think it brings down their value at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 25 pieces for such a small price!</li>
            <li> But there is only ONE FATAL, AND I MEAN FATAL, FLAW.</li>
            <li> But I mean unless you are totally throwing them around, using them on a stable table will cause you no harm.  </li>
            <li> Edges may be a little sharp but can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> and there, I mean all over scratches as if they were used or just simply not taken care of.</li>
            <li> They are SO sharp!</li>
            <li> They are so versatile, the possibilities are endless!</li>
            <li> (if you don&#x27;t know what I mean go on you tube and type in testing out french manicures with bundle monster</li>
            <li> Some of the edges were a little sharp</li>
            <li> though it requires a little practise and patience to use these things, I find these discs easier to use than the other kit.</li>
            <li> of caution, beware of the sharp edges!</li>
            <li> so be careful!!</li>
            <li> As for other reviewers who had the plates loose in package, mine came packed up tight in a small cardboard box.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews said the edges were very sharp, but they aren&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> some of the YouTube reviews people said the edges were very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Also, I agree with the other reviews that the plates are very sharp on the edges!</li>
            <li> Bottom line, they work just as well as the name brand plates, with much less investment.  </li>
            <li> $7 per plate vs. less than $2 per plate</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s because the nail polish dries too quickly not because of the stencils.</li>
            <li> I got these for less than $12.</li>
            <li> Not your typical protective plastic (like on the BM plates)</li>
            <li> It took me less than 10 mins to remove all the film from all of the plates.  </li>
            <li> Every time I scraped, half the polish would scrape out of images as well.</li>
            <li> I bought these to try since for the price of less than 2 Konad plates I got 25.</li>
            <li> , I have gotten a lot of complements with my half designs.</li>
            <li> The image didn&#x27;t turn out with konad black.</li>
            <li> Some of my Bundle Monster plates seem to be etched a bit too shallow to get a solid image out of them.</li>
            <li> They are etched so shallowly that you can&#x27;t get enough polish in them to pick up.</li>
            <li> With this stamp nail art set the possibilities are end less.</li>
            <li> Common sense will go a long way with this.  ;</li>
            <li> I waited too long to try using them so it is too late to return</li>
            <li> So basically, I spent 15 dollars just to have 25 small metal plates sitting in my drawer.   </li>
            <li> Then I became a little worried because they looked scratched and used.  </li>
            <li> After a little practice, I think we&#x27;ll have no problems at all with them.</li>
            <li> Variety of designs a little something for everyone.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;Active nail stamper here to tell you a little bit of my experience with this product!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The box was a little damaged but still usable.</li>
            <li> but with a little practice and skill you can patch up the side no problem.     </li>
            <li> let along my nail; what a time-consuming mess and waste.</li>
            <li> Not all of them, the ones that have a little raised I get is a flag- box like shape.</li>
            <li> Just stackakble in a little box.</li>
            <li> nothing a little polish remover can&#x27;t handle, but still just anoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy image plates, these are the ones that give you a little taste of everything.</li>
            <li> I was quite excited to receive my SHANY 2012 plate set, but greatly disappointed to find it lacking the SH02 plate.  </li>
            <li> little con</li>
            <li> , one is a little wider.</li>
            <li> It uses so little polish</li>
            <li> I use these on myself as well as my little nieces.</li>
            <li> The plates are as advertised and the design choices have a little something for everyone.  </li>
            <li> They are a little flimsy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only has this item not been taken off Amazon even after the PR lady was like \\&quot;yes, we had a bad shipment and are getting new plates</li>
            <li> You could cut yourself only if you tried VERY VERY hard.</li>
            <li> When I received them, I was a little wary because the package they were inside was ripped open and the plates were loose inside the box.  </li>
            <li> They certainly weren&#x27;t used or dirty.</li>
            <li> the images are not sharp when stamped, however the edges on each disc are sharp enough to cut your finger, the protectant film on each disc is SO difficult and annoying to remove, the images which should cover a whole nail (like the zebra)are</li>
            <li> I have read a few complaints about a brown substance, I had a little on one of my plates that peeled away with the plastic.</li>
            <li> Not original packaging, missing one plate, but the ones I got are quality. . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I learn the hard way when I accidentally shipped my package to the Wisconsin state mental hospital.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money out of all 25 plates</li>
            <li> After buying a few Konad plates I was hooked but didn&#x27;t want to spend all the money.</li>
            <li> got so addicted I even started a blog where you can find a picture of each one of the plates I received and a further review.</li>
            <li> Just killed it for me...  </li>
            <li> At least I know to be careful with them in that regard.</li>
            <li> One side is always missing just a bit of design.</li>
            <li> But I saw a few video reviews of the 2012 set one of which</li>
            <li> Plate S1107 with the numbers &amp; two horses is missing from the set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are some scratches on a few</li>
            <li> and I had to scrub a few of them with nail polish remover in order to get the glue out.  </li>
            <li> had been using mine for a few months before I cut myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use a few to test them out and</li>
            <li> Wasted polish</li>
            <li> The plates were then carefully dried.  </li>
            <li> The discs are heavily scratched &amp; marred.they seem used</li>
            <li> A few of the images work with my Konad polish and a few don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> so I believe it was a waste of money for my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a few Konad Plates, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat these.</li>
            <li> but the fact that some of them were messed up and and missing chunks is why i rated this a two.</li>
            <li> The discs are heavily scratched &amp; marred.</li>
            <li> I sent two e-mails to the distributor asking that they send me my missing plates</li>
            <li> I do still use a few of mine</li>
            <li> However, the problem is that two plates are alike, therefore the is one missing.</li>
            <li> I would like to know if I can get the missing plate.</li>
            <li> Also, there are a few repeats.</li>
            <li> but I was missing SH05 plate.</li>
            <li> Neither did I had any trouble in removing the cover.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> These are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s waste of money and your time.</li>
            <li> image plates might be uneven unless it was a problem with my scraper, but the nail polish didn&#x27;t budge sometimes when I scraped.</li>
            <li> I would have to go over it a few times.</li>
            <li> I somewhat had lil trouble taking the plastic of</li>
            <li> These do not work, don&#x27;t waste you time or money order something else.  </li>
            <li> The few that take well you can feel the indentations on the plate.</li>
            <li> I learned on these and one of the Bundle Monster (and a couple of Konad for comparison) sets a few months ago.</li>
            <li> The plate itself is VERY sharp!   </li>
            <li> At first it felt impossible, but after a few minutes I became a pro.  </li>
            <li> and I still got it in 1 Week or less!</li>
            <li> And for wayyyy less than I&#x27;d pay too!</li>
            <li> The etching is very shallow making it difficult to retain enough paint in the image to get a complete image.</li>
            <li> The images on quite a few of these plates are not engraved deep enough making it impossible to lift off the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used 1/2 bottle of acetone removing the mess!</li>
            <li> I actually feel sorry for my previous purchases when I paid approx.</li>
            <li> There is a method that I saw on a youtube video, where the girl just pushed down with her thumb, and I did that but still had a hard time.</li>
            <li> One of my plates was carved a little out of place, but that is the only thing I have found wrong with them.</li>
            <li> they were too shallow to hold any of the konad polish or any other polish i had.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time picking out which one I want to use half the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I read previous reviews about sharp edges and although they are thin they will not cut you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, the good the bad and the ugly...</li>
            <li> i just got these today and have only tried a few of the stamps, the kite, anchor and one of the random patterns.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t mean just a few little scratches here</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve cut that time in half, at least.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this and a nail stamp, the little girl I take care of loves when I do her nails and use these!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed since I love nail art.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with that because it was my favorite plate.</li>
            <li> The coating is a little hard to peel off, but this would in no way hinder my recomendation of this product.  </li>
            <li> To me, these look a little hard to use.</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers, the blue film is nearly impossible to get off, and these plates ARE extremely sharp, so the job is twice as hard.</li>
            <li> My major complaint is that I was missing a plate!!!!</li>
            <li> but with very little effort it comes off and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though we&#x27;ve all been adequately warned about the sides of the plates being sharp I got too comfy &amp; careless while I was cleaning one.&lt;br/&gt;I cut my finger so badly that I probably should have gotten stitches.</li>
            <li> As my title says at first I was furious about my order and set about to write a bad review and complaint.</li>
            <li> Bad for my OCD, but doesn&#x27;t really matter.)</li>
            <li> &quot; well I did get my first cut :-(</li>
            <li> I got all 25 plates with no duplicate plates (although a small handful of images are repeated).</li>
            <li> Ok so NO ONE LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!</li>
            <li> You just have to be quicker about it or fill in a spot or two with a small liner brush.</li>
            <li> Honestly a waste of money!</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t  know they were gonna be so small</li>
            <li> Not sure if it did,</li>
            <li> For any of the ones that state these plates are no good or not worth</li>
            <li> i hadn&#x27;t tried the konad plates in the past</li>
            <li> I wanted to leave a complaint on here saying well this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small these plates were when I ordered them.  </li>
            <li> did read some reviews on how the blue paper lining was difficult to remove - and it was.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it applies for all nail stamping plates</li>
            <li> (I have sorta small fingers)</li>
            <li> The plastic tends to stick to the plate and come off in small pieces.  </li>
            <li> I can never fully get the small designs to stamp.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you time thinking, just grab it !</li>
            <li> But I am not sure why I got it.</li>
            <li> It gets soooooooo messy!</li>
            <li> Not many, maybe 3-5.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I am obsessed with anything nail related.</li>
            <li> but I guess my nails r small</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was because of these or the stamper</li>
            <li> A few of the stamps are a bit dated for me, but I decided to purchase these plates as opposed to 2013 because of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> These seem to be selected at random though as I am missing a couple according to the numbers on the plates (except for the one missing, they were substituted with other plates.</li>
            <li> but if you have read other reviews then you&#x27;ll know these are sharp and very thin</li>
            <li> They come in a small package covered with a very thin blue film.</li>
            <li> but it is a very few.</li>
            <li> The reason: the plates are metal and very heavy.</li>
            <li> And looking at other brands, other brands&#x27; plates are thick and less dangerous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at nail art....</li>
            <li> But i say its b/c im not very good</li>
            <li> The sharp edges everyone complained about has been resolved, there is a thin cardboard backing now which eliminated that issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the negative reviewers were having issues with.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong or taking too long</li>
            <li> A few of the designs are weak on the nails, however for the price and the amount of designs</li>
            <li> Not sure if the etching is too shallow</li>
            <li> Yes it is hard to see it</li>
            <li> and they hardly come onto the stamper at all.</li>
            <li> Also, the protective film wasn&#x27;t as hard to remove as everyone says.</li>
            <li> your hard earned money on this and buy either cheeky&#x27;s or bundle</li>
            <li> one thing you do have to remember is that you do not need to scrape the polish off the plate terribly hard before applying your design.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda hard to see</li>
            <li> I suggest Shany makes their plates thicker or maybe dull up the edges.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time getting an image too no matter what end of my stamper I use.</li>
            <li> Metallic nail polishes are hard to work with.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to tell from the reviews here if that is the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but dont push to hard .</li>
            <li> Dont scrap to hard.</li>
            <li> If it is, it&#x27;s hard to see.</li>
            <li> They came together in a box and each plate has a plastic coating that wasn&#x27;t too hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because at least they work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have problems with the size or the thickness of the discs, as some people have complained.</li>
            <li> I do my nails at least once every two weeks</li>
            <li> Just be careful because if you are too careless you may cut yourself on the edge of the plates.  </li>
            <li> and it sucks.  </li>
            <li> There are literally thousands of options that you can achieve, and every day at least one person stops me and asks me where I got my nails done or how they were done.</li>
            <li> I only had one plate that i was unhappy with.</li>
            <li> I added a backing myself by cutting out scrap cardstock paper and taping it onto the back with 2-sided tape.  </li>
            <li> The scraper does not scrape off all the excess nail polish, and the stampers sucks as well.</li>
            <li> At least two disc also had some obscure brown substance stuck to it.</li>
            <li> I got one image that was partially overlapped with another image, and on another plates there was a random imprint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m late going into the trend</li>
            <li> I do not use a plate holder and have had no issues cutting myself, but the plates are definitely thinner than the Konads.</li>
            <li> I read this complaint on the reviews, but thought...</li>
            <li> I had no difficulty in using it, as some customers complained.</li>
            <li> It took me a whlie to figure out that there was plastic wrap that needed to be removed before use (duh.. )</li>
            <li> If you are a nail art fanatic, then I recommend you buy these.</li>
            <li> You have to use thick nail polish for the images; it does tell you that in the instructions.</li>
            <li> already however I would recommend using a really thick nail polish or purchase Konad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Messy, irritating, and non-functional.</li>
            <li> this works but is not amazing</li>
            <li> They are a little sharp, but I am not worried about cutting myself like others shared.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I have always done super boring things with my nails (if anything at all!).</li>
            <li> I thought I was the only one who has this problem but after reading other reviews, I don&#x27;t feel as stupid.</li>
            <li> The plates are very thin so need to be a bit careful</li>
            <li> I mean, have you tried counting them?</li>
            <li> I was worried it&#x27;s be a pain, but I&#x27;m already done with 5 of them in just the past minute!</li>
            <li> I knew from other comments the film had to be taken off, it was quite difficult for some of the plates</li>
            <li> You can see what I mean in the picture</li>
            <li> I mean, they are metal disks.  </li>
            <li> worst stamps every the images are useless if they don&#x27;t go on easy!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to purchase this set of plates after reading the negative reviews it previously received, however, I decided to go ahead</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wanna disappoint my 7 year old:(  </li>
            <li> the biggest problem i am having with the nail plates is the blue plastic on the plates are almost impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> After reading a few negative reviews I was skeptical, but I took the chance.  </li>
            <li> But are you serious?</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The metal design forms (molds) are too shallow.</li>
            <li> Some of the designs are to shallow to get the design</li>
            <li> MUCH less expensive than the Konad plates.  </li>
            <li> So i guess just too shallow.</li>
            <li> Also, the wells are quite shallow</li>
            <li> The wrapper is a little difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical but decided to go for it anyway.</li>
            <li> #blonde then getting frustrated</li>
            <li> I sat here for 15 minutes working on it and all I got done were two - got frustrated with the third one and gave up.</li>
            <li> They have a crazy wide selection of images.</li>
            <li> Its not that the product, or plates are no good, it could be your stamper or your technique.</li>
            <li> Sometimes its hard for me to choose one!</li>
            <li> I give it for 4 stars though because I had a double of one plate :(</li>
            <li> But since I paid only $18, Im not so disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> and I didnt look forward to removing the plastic film as I have had to remove difficult film in the past</li>
            <li> Additionally, I tried to use the french patterns (PLATE #SH06) and am unhappy to report that they don&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> I unfortunately don&#x27;t have small nail beds, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was also disappointed with how deep the plates were NOT...</li>
            <li> I usually do nail art and complicated designs on my nails</li>
            <li> and I have not one complaint!</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting up a couple fingers in the process as the plates are sharp!</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to use.</li>
            <li> also, the protective peel is very hard to take off and leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to purchase these plates based on the bad reviews on the previous set from this company and from the bad reveiws on this current set.  </li>
            <li> Even after purchasing these other items separately, these were impossible to use.</li>
            <li> they have the worse customer service.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the packaging was really annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gotten 2 co-workers addicted to them, and another is buying a set for her daughter.   </li>
            <li> So if you read some negative reviews, remember they may have done something wrong.  </li>
            <li> The plates are thin and I did cut myself</li>
            <li> this stuff is really thin and GLUED onto these plates.  </li>
            <li> and it is so thin you wouldn&#x27;t recognize it anyway.</li>
            <li> They are thin.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this buy.</li>
            <li> The plates have a thin sheet of plastic attached to each of them, that needs to be removed before using them.  </li>
            <li> However, each plate is protected by a thin plastic film and when i removed them, the plates were in pristine condition.   </li>
            <li> Sorry if that sounds confusing.  </li>
            <li> Alot of the designs are just too shallow!</li>
            <li> they are sharp along the edges, and i have a fear of them eventually cutting me!</li>
            <li> dont buy the bs from few bad reviews  </li>
            <li> they are not detailed and they stamp badly because they fill with nail polish and overflow.</li>
            <li> One is worthless without the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done trying to use these dumb things!</li>
            <li> (sections of polish will be missing). :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to think how sharp they were before!  </li>
            <li> I got some weird \\&quot;kawaii\\&quot; image plates - some images</li>
            <li> Also keep in mind when buying that there is a thin plastic sheeting on it that has to be taken off!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t however, like the price for Konad items it was too expensive for just trying something out.</li>
            <li> Also the blue plastic that is stuck to the front of the plates is horrible to get off.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these plates -</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a difficult time removing the protective covering.</li>
            <li> but konad is way to expensive at $7 per plate.</li>
            <li> not good!!!</li>
            <li> Too difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This product fails.</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical at furst cause of the quantity you get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to use, but I&#x27;m trying.</li>
            <li> Clean-up is tedious</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if i did this wrong</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with these plates AT ALL.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s one plate that has nothing but numbers on them, so completely useless in my opinion</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s another with symbols.. useless again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was just doing it wrong</li>
            <li> I was a bit sad to learn that the leopard and tribal print were not included in this packet though.</li>
            <li> Plate SH25 was made wrong so one image is cut off and unusable.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think you need expensive nail polish to use these image plates.</li>
            <li> Bit difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> ,I was a bit skeptical because I heard some bads reviews.</li>
            <li> The discs are very thin so they do need to be handled with care.  </li>
            <li> The material is very thin and designs does not look well embedded.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a Christmas present and they didn&#x27;t work what a horrible disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but annoying enough to mention.</li>
            <li> Crazy?</li>
            <li> worst of all, I can&#x27;t even tell what images I&#x27;m missing out on.</li>
            <li> The scratch part was disappointing</li>
            <li> These are dangerous.</li>
            <li> The disappointment I felt when noticing that I was lacking a plate is nothing compared to the amount I have at having been ignored.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still angry though &gt;:(</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t so mad when I got something else.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This makes it very difficult and in some cases impossible to pull the image up and place on finger nail.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s almost impossible getting it to stamp.  </li>
            <li> And indeed the plastic cover does make the plates look scratched up, and the plates are impossible to use without removing that cover.  </li>
            <li> Found out it was impossible to do so, so I returned them.</li>
            <li> Too bad they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Maybe some were bad.</li>
            <li> But the bad thing about these is that some of the plates look scratched</li>
            <li> It was messed up really bad when they sent it to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;really bad product</li>
            <li> i even been using a plastic card to take care because of people warning about the metal scraper being bad for them,</li>
            <li> and it wasnt too bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> To bad</li>
            <li> I Was Shocked</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed in the plates.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are worthless!  </li>
            <li> Not to post a grumpy review, but I am so disappointed with this set.</li>

            <li> Sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> SO* stupid for buying the Konad plates/nail polishes.</li>
            <li> The reason why I hate them is because practically every time I use these I end up slicing my fingers on them.  </li>
            <li> Piece of crap</li>
            <li> UGH... its annoying.</li>
            <li> The base color is your choice.</li>
            <li> These plates are crap.</li>
            <li> These things are crap.</li>
            <li> i thought that I brought a bogus stamp set or the plates were bad, but Once i watched a tutorial on you tube showing me how to hold the scraper, stamping became a breeze!</li>
            <li> the images cannot pick up by the stamp, really bad quality!</li>
            <li> I have benn very frustrated by them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>

            <li> Once you try to compeltely cover it, it looks terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible, terrible plates.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard from others that Shany is known for sending doubles of plates within their packages, and have terrible support.</li>
            <li> The quality on SOME of the image plates is horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible protective plastic  </li>
            <li> When I received them the protective layer was horrible to remove.</li>
            <li> No joke, I got a nasty cut from one of them as I was cleaning up!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I got these specifically for the star signs and those look terrible</li>
            <li> Hate these things!!!</li>

            <li> I purchased these for Christmas for my 13 year old sister-in-law along with a SHANY Stamping Nail Art Set and she loves them.  There was a great variety of images for various occasions.  She found them very easy to use - and declared this the &amp;#34;Best Christmas Present EVER&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love these plates so  many different designs to choose from, even the holidays. Can&#x27;t wait to try them all.</li>
            <li> The nail plates I ordered arrived way sooner than I expected! there are good designs on all the plates, and they work well!</li>
            <li> My new designs are great, I love all designs.  I need more time to use them. My friend bought this item too</li>
            <li> I was SO excited when my order came, up until I opened the package. They weren&#x27;t even the Shany brand !! I got some weird \\&quot;kawaii\\&quot; image plates - some images I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever use. Can&#x27;t return it because there was no receipt in the packaging. I gave it 2 stars because at least they work. I&#x27;m still angry though &gt;:(</li>
            <li> Amaizing I love it it&#x27;s so cute. I love the designs in there. There are so different many designs in there.</li>
            <li> These are terrific nail plates!! There are a ton of great designs to pick through.&lt;br /&gt;Each plate has several designs as shown, some cover the whole nail and others are just small add on images.&lt;br /&gt;I use this with the SHANY stamp set, and have had no problems transferring designs from the plate to stamp and then nail.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use. love the detail of each one.  looks so cute on very polished and i adore them on my toes.  great deal on a great product will buy more.  :)  btw did i say the designs are so cute :)</li>
            <li> I am first time user of the Nail stamps. I recieved my plates very fast and since I was one of the first 50 customers to purchase my plates from Shany, I got them for a special LOW LOW price too.     I am very happy with this product. The designs are just like the designs displayed in the picture.     Since I am a beginner, I have been playing around with them. The designs transfer easily. But you have to work quick transferring the image from the plate to the stamp, from the stamp to the nail.      This is a good way to save money on fancy designs.     Enjoy,  Happy Customer</li>
            <li> I purchased these nail plates at their recent sale price and could not be happier with the product.  When I first recieved them I was a bit dissappointed because they looked scratched, then I realized there was a thin plastic cover on the plates which I removed.  Once the plastic was off it revealed a shiny mirror surface and all of the wonderful designs.  There are so many that everyone who purchases these plates will find something to love, hearts, stars, french tips, holiday, flowers, animal print, you name it! These work just as well as the plates that came with my original stamping kit at an absolute FRACTION of the cost, even at their regular price.  They work great and I HIGHLY recommend them!</li>
            <li> As a nail stamping newbie, this was a good buy! I give it for 4 stars though because I had a double of one plate :( Also keep in mind when buying that there is a thin plastic sheeting on it that has to be taken off! And if they looked scratched it is because of the plastic not the plate itself.</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster and Shany plate are exactly the same. All this none sense about scratches on the plate-YOU MUST REMOVE THE PLASTIC COVERING- I dont know why Shany has increased their price for these plates they were cheaper than Bundle Monster...I bought them from Both COMPANIES so when I say they are the same THEY ARE THE SAME. For future buyer of these cheaper version of Konad-I would never buy anything from Bundle Monster they have the worse customer service. But I would never pay more than $20 for these plates because anything more you might as well buy the real thing (In my opinion)</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE NAIL PLATES!! I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THESE PLATES!! ONE THEY ARE AFFORDABLE, TWO THEY WORK JUST AS GOOD AS KONAD, AND THREE YOU HAVE SOOO MANY DESIGNS TO CHOOSE FROM!!! I HAD A BALL PLAYING WITH THESE!! AND IM NOT DISAPPOINTED!! THEY WORK GREAT WITH REGULAR STORE BOUGHT NAIL POLISH!! GOOD JOB SHANY:)</li>
            <li> So I order my daughters Christmas gift on November 29 and Amzon has it in stock but hasen&#x27;t shipped it and now they&#x27;er telling me it won&#x27;t be here untill after Christmas becouse I don&#x27;t want to pay for expedited shipping. They have 18 buisness day&#x27;s and they can&#x27;t get here everyting must ship directly from China and be carried by foot.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money out of all 25 plates maybe I get one or two designs, not plates but actual designs. They are not edged in enough for the polish to pick up the design. DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
            <li> After seeing an add for Konad nail art I was very interested in trying to do nail stamping. I didn&#x27;t however, like the price for Konad items it was too expensive for just trying something out. I searched for an alternitive and decided on the Shany set. It took me several days to practice with different polishes and stamp scrapers etc. When I used Sally Hanson extreme nails \\&quot;black out\\&quot; and \\&quot;white out\\&quot; polishes I found they worked great. I bought a stamper and scraper but the scraper was metal. I didn&#x27;t like that at all cause it scratched the disc. I read from another review that someone used an old credit card. This worked like a charm. The combination of credit card scraper and sally hanson extreme nail polish I got almost all of these discs to work great. However, there are a few of the designes that dont seem to be etched deep enough or the etching is too thin of a line and the stamper wouldn&#x27;t be able to pick up the image all the time. I had no problem with the size of any of the stamps so far. I also cut myself trying to get the backing off once but havn&#x27;t had a problem with them since. I used my metal scraper a bit to help remove the backing it worked fine. If the backing was easier to remove, and some of the designs worked better I would have givin this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I got these for Christmas and I&#x27;ve always wanted image plates to decorate my nails. I think these are descent from using them, I&#x27;ve used sally girl nail polish for the stamping and it works amazing! I did order black and white konad though to see the difference in my other nail polish. I read reviews about the plates being sharp, I was kinda like \\&quot;ok I won&#x27;t cut myself because I&#x27;m not clumsy\\&quot; well I did get my first cut :-( it wasn&#x27;t pleasant but seriously BE CAREFUL! I gave this a 4 because there are some duplicates and some plates that aren&#x27;t deep enough so it&#x27;s almost impossible getting it to stamp.  I recently heard about these other plates called red angel and I&#x27;m considering getting those only because I know a friend who has them and they&#x27;re much better quality and designs than shany image plates and I believe they&#x27;re $11.99 plus $3.99 shipping. I think the shany ones are good for a beginner but if you&#x27;re looking for something with unique designs and better stamping then red angel might be the ones to get :-)</li>
            <li> some of the design work perfectly fine and some of the design aren&#x27;t deep enough. the biggest problem i am having with the nail plates is the blue plastic on the plates are almost impossible to remove. the plastic is like super-glued to the plates, otherwise you can not bet the price</li>
            <li> I liked most of the images on the plates. A couple of things I didn&#x27;t like are: The blue film cover is hard to get off. And the french tips, to me, are to light for me to just put on by themselves. It&#x27;s like putting on one coat of polish, no way to deepen the color. Other then that they are pretty great. I didn&#x27;t have problems with the size or the thickness of the discs, as some people have complained. Can&#x27;t wait to try them on family and friends.</li>
            <li> Opened this product to find several plates were deeply scratched, some were not centered so the images were halfway or all off the plate. And some of the images that seemed okay were not deep enough to get an impression.  These plates should be inspected before packaging takes place.  I&#x27;m very disappointed, I was so looking forward to using these plates soon.  Might give them a try again later because many people really love them and maybe it was just my batch that was bad.  Wish me luck.</li>
            <li> After reading a few negative reviews I was skeptical, but I took the chance.  The blue cover paper was very easy to remove, I just used a tweezer to rip up an edge and peeled the rest off with my finger, it all came up with one grab.  The edges aren&#x27;t as sharp as some people made them seem. I&#x27;m the biggest clutz ever and I haven&#x27;t cut myself on them.  There are so many different designs to choose from, I love these little plates. So pleased with my order, and the price was great.</li>
            <li> This is one of three set of plates that I have. There is no backing on these plates so be careful when using them. Also the blue plastic that is stuck to the front of the plates is horrible to get off. After you finally get it off there is sticky streaky residue that is on the plate. I used nail polish remover to get it off. I didn&#x27;t receive any duplicate plates. The plates work just as good as my cheeky and bundle monster. I was just kind of disappointed about the backing and the front blue plastic.</li>
            <li> I have ordered a wide range of different types of plates from different companies, and so far shany plates are my least favorite. And the only reason I don&#x27;t like them is that the protective blue covering is a absolute pain in the butt to get off. It takes much longer than it should and after I do get it off I&#x27;m left with a glue-y residue on my plates that I had to use goo-gone to remove it. This is so much more work than I want to do when I buy a plate.</li>
            <li> The selection you get with these is just amazing! 25 pieces for such a small price! I would spend hundreds trying to duplicate these plates individually!</li>
            <li> this was even better than i expected. very comparable to konad plates, if not better!&lt;br /&gt;works with most polishes and even acrylic paint. great price for a great product quality</li>
            <li> A great set to get. Love the small nail designs, not that impressed with the full nail. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is actually the first nail stamping system I have purchased but I am HOOKED! The images transfer so clean and crisp. I got all 25 plates with no duplicate plates (although a small handful of images are repeated). I read all about how hard it is so remove the blue scratch protectors from the plates but I had NO issue with this and didn&#x27;t cut myself either. I would highly recommend this product for beginners and professionals alike.</li>
            <li> The nail art polishes are great for the do it yourself nail junkie. I always do my own nails and have recently gotten into doing nail designs. These polishes are great because you get so many colors to choose from. The brush is fine tipped which helps with getting a more precise line. These polishes would be fun to try out with nail stamping.</li>
            <li> These were such a great price I could&#x27;t resist.  They have lots of cute images and a few full nail designs. I was a little hesitent to get them because I thought for the price it was to good to be true but after watching a testing of them on youtube I figured if they work well for those people I&#x27;m sure they would for me. The images come out nicely and I would have given them 5 stars but they don&#x27;t have a backing on them.  As long as you use them with care, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I just received my order of the 25 image plates, and so far I am very pleased- since I got the order in a day early! they are very prompt and courteous.  I just wish the tiny box of all the plates would have been in smaller packaging! It came in a huge envelope for such a tiny little box!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a GREAT price compaired to Konad plates for $5 per plate. I love all of the designs and have also done my nails for 8th grade graduation. It looks like i went and got my nails done for a TON of money, they look great!!! I will be purchasing more from them!!</li>
            <li> Got my plates today.Havent used them yet, but love all the designs.Did not have any trouble removing the blue protective film as one review I read.Cant wait to do my nails,I have always used Konad but am gonna give these a try.Hope to achieve the same results.The only reason I didnt give 5 stars,is havent used them yet!!</li>
            <li> Ok so NO ONE LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!! These are 100% worth the money. I didn&#x27;t cut myself and the plates are very good at picking up the images. I love these and they are super cheap as well. I recommend these plates to anyone even beginners. The clip art is so much fun! You can feel the ideas ticking through your head while looking at each and every image. The protective tape is easy to peel off as while. I hope this helped for you lovely lacqueristas!! happy stamping</li>
            <li> these imagge plates are amazing and i kmow some people think they are almost konad quality but i personaly think they are better than konad they are more bolder and have cute desins oh and the shippping was good.</li>
            <li> I love these!  They are high quality, and the image selection is awesome.  There&#x27;s even a couple of images for each major holiday, which is a bonus because now I don&#x27;t need any holiday plates.  I would suggest ignoring the negative review on this product which says the plates are scratched and the images are not deep enough to produce a stamped picture.  The plates have a fine plastic cover on them that needs to be peeled off prior to the first use.  And indeed the plastic cover does make the plates look scratched up, and the plates are impossible to use without removing that cover.  Once the plastic is peeled off, you&#x27;ll find a mirror finish plate underneath with high quality images that work wonderfully.  Bottom line, they work just as well as the name brand plates, with much less investment.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I agree about ignoring the 1 star rating someone gave.  They didn&#x27;t remove the protective plastic cover on the plates.  These plates are great quality.  Deep etching &amp; crisp detail.  And the price is amazing!  Shipping was quick.  Tons of fun designs.  The all-over designs are smaller than Konad&#x27;s all-over designs, but they&#x27;re big enough to cover all my nails, except my thumbs.  For thumbnails, many of the all-over designs have coordinating tip designs or single image designs that look great.  These are going to be SO much fun to use!!</li>
            <li> The product came out in scratches and on one disk, there was something brown stuck on it. They seem like rejects or used products ready to be discarded. Completely not worth it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this product here on Amazon.  The price I paid was amazing and being a Prime customer I got free two-day shipping.  My final price ended up being 9.99 which is absolutely amazing for a 25 piece collection!  These are the same plates as Bundle Monster (the plates even say \\&quot;BM\\&quot; on them...) but for an incredibly better price!    When I received them, I was a little wary because the package they were inside was ripped open and the plates were loose inside the box.  This is because there are just so many plates, they were too heavy for the plastic wrap they were in (so, it could be looked at as a good thing!).  I dealt with it and took them out to investigate further.  Then I became a little worried because they looked scratched and used.  However, once I pulled the super thin protective film off, they were perfect and brand new.  The edges had been filed down and were not sharp at all (I noticed some people saying they were getting cut by the edges; this was not the case at all for me.)    Now onto the images: I love about 90% of the images.  I like to be a little different so many of them appealed to me.  Images like the anchor, the peacock, leaves, flowers, and feather were great.  The \\&quot;whole nail\\&quot; images are perfect for me because I have smaller nail beds and they covered them completely (a little work for the thumb, but nothing too bad).  There were, however, some images I would NEVER use, such as the biker flames and the pot leaf.  Why would I ever want a pot leaf on my nails?!  But for the most part, I loved the images.    I tried them the night I received them.  I already had a scraper and a stamper from a nail stamp set I bought at ULTA (by essence) and so I made sure I used the right polishes and stamped away.  I absolutely loved the results.  So far, every image I&#x27;ve used has been great!  I&#x27;ve gotten countless number of compliments on my nails and I look forward to creating more unique looks using these plates.    Ultimately, I give it 4/5 stars and would definitely recommend this to people.</li>
            <li> i love this nail art set. its the best ive ever bought. i like to do designs on my nails and the nail salon always charges too much to do one little design on my nail. this set is so easy to use and i can choose from so many diffrent options it has to design my nails for such little price and its reusable unlike those stickers. it makes a grat gift bc i bought one for my sister and she just cant get enough of them :)</li>
            <li> Love this product! The images are wonderful, the shipping was super fast (I ordered it week before xmas and was expecting it to be here in Jan.) That Includes the time it takes to go through military postal service and I still got it in 1 Week or less! Amazing! The Price was great seriously $9.95 for 25 plates that if I would have bought them in a store would have cost me anywhere from $3-5 a piece or in my case here 5-6 Euro.      As my title says at first I was furious about my order and set about to write a bad review and complaint. While waiting for the &#x27;review your product&#x27; to load on my computer I started playing with my &#x27;horribly scratched used looking plates with no indention&#x27;s for the designs&#x27;. Once I found the little plastic cover and pulled it off they are beautiful and what kept them beautiful The Plastic Covering for shipping. Yes it is hard to see it but with very little effort it comes off and the plates are beautiful mirror like and great quality.    I even will be keeping the plastic covers to place on them loosely so I don&#x27;t scratch them myself.      I will definitely be buying from this seller again and also plan to refer them to my friend here who has a shop and pays ridiculous prices for her supplies that are not as good quality as these.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;vd these plates super fast, about 3 days from placing my order.  Am very happy with the plates.  The images are crisp and clean and stamp as well as konad, however, I am surprised at how sharp the edges are even tho I think I read they were filed now before being shipped.  I&#x27;d hate to think how sharp they were before!  I really would supervise kids using these plates.  I also rec&#x27;vd the pot leaf image.  Interesting that they would include an image of an illegal substance?  Not such a big deal for me, but again, no small children around here.  All in all, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I read through all of the reviews and while there are some valid points, these plates are still worth it. I mean $15.00 for 23-25 plates is an awesome deal.&lt;br /&gt;Some complaints were:&lt;br /&gt;1. \\&quot;The whole nail designs don&#x27;t fit on my whole nail.\\&quot; While that is true enough, most are still usable, and like someone else had mentioned, there are some tips that go along with some of the designs. There were a lot of complaints about the image of the marijuana leaf (BM07), if it&#x27;s not your thing, that&#x27;s fine, but there are other usable designs on the same plate. In fact I used one to supplement a full nail design and it turned out really awesome. The point is to be creative with what you are given.&lt;br /&gt;2. \\&quot;The plates are so sharp I cut myself.\\&quot; OMG, really?! The plates are sharper than the Konad ones, yes, but what do you expect for such a deal? $7 per plate vs. less than $2 per plate, um yeah they aren&#x27;t gonna be the same quality. Besides, I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet and I have stamped every design. The only way you&#x27;re gonna cut yourself with these plates is if your skin is thinner than rice paper.&lt;br /&gt;3. \\&quot;The designs aren&#x27;t clear, the plates are used and scratched up.\\&quot; I think everyone else has made it clear by now that you have to peel off the protective covering. It is a little hard to get off, but I would much rather that they put it on than not have it. And, I didn&#x27;t try it, but I would imagine the images wouldn&#x27;t come out well at all if you left the cover on.&lt;br /&gt;4. \\&quot;I got a duplicate, or didn&#x27;t get all 25 plates.\\&quot; So what!? I got 25 plates, but yes one was a duplicate so I just gave it to my friend, no biggie. I still got 24 different plates wayyyy cheaper than I could have gotten them with Konad. Granted, it&#x27;s advertised to get 25 different ones, but I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that big of a deal. I mean, have you tried counting them? It&#x27;s not entirely easy when you first get them because they are thin and it&#x27;s easy to count 2 as 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I am really happy I bought these plates, and while some of the images are ones I will never use, and some don&#x27;t come out that great, it was still totally worth it to me. These plates will give me hours of fun and I can do so many different things with the many designs that I will use. Besides, I don&#x27;t like every single design on the Konad plates I have, so I would have much rather paid this price than almost $200.00 for as many plates from Konad.hese plates, and while some of the images are ones I will never use, and some don&#x27;t come out that great, it was still totally worth it to me. These plates will give me hours of fun and I can do so many different things with the many designs that I will use. Besides, I don&#x27;t like every single design on the Konad plates I have, so I would have much rather paid this price than almost $200.00 for as many plates from Konad.</li>
            <li> After buying a few Konad plates I was hooked but didn&#x27;t want to spend all the money. These are a great alternative and are almost the same thing. I noticed a few images don&#x27;t work completely.. but most definitely do. There are a handfull of images that I can&#x27;t see myself ever using, but there are still a lot of cool ones.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the one poster. I took the plastic off mine upon receiving them and still could only get a few of the images to work. I tried alot of the images and some would work, some wouldn&#x27;t. In all I think its a waste of money to have something that only halfway works.</li>
            <li> These are very high quality images and if you follow the directions they work perfectly.  They are fiddly, you have to work carefully till you get the hang of it but as with anything else practice makes perfect..  They work just as well as the more expensive plates but the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I do my nails at least once every two weeks and this is an awesome deal!!! Each disc is wrapped in a plastic coating (remove before using) You won&#x27;t find a better deal for these disc&#x27;s. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> These plates are suppose to work with the other Shany products.  I used&lt;br /&gt;Shany nail polish and regular nail polish.  I used Shany stamper.  The plates are either not cut deep enough to show the image on stamper or the stamper just doesn&#x27;t work.  I paid way too much for the Shany products. Thought it was what was on tv info commercial. Don&#x27;t think it is as info commercial you get stamper and plates for $10.00.  It cost me close to $100 with plates, stamper and their nail polish set.  I&#x27;m returning this and stamper.</li>
            <li> This was my first nail art stamping purchase and I&#x27;m extremely happy with it! I tried the plates with regular nail polish and they stamped great, got a good variety although I did get 1 duplicate plate. There is a plastic over the plates you need to remove before using. Another thing I&#x27;ve learned that that you really need to stamp as quickly as possible or the polish will dry and not stamp well. It&#x27;s a learning process! I&#x27;d definitely recommend these though, you cannot beat the price &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 10 year old daughter.  Please be aware if you are buying them for children that there is a pot leaf on one of the plates.  I scratched it out with a knife but it took me several days to even notice it.  Luckily she didn&#x27;t go to church or school with colorful pot leaves all over her fingers!!  That aside, these compare to konad plates.  It takes some practice to get going but the same can be said of any plates.</li>
            <li> I bought this plates because I was just getting started on the nail stamping system and I didn&#x27;t want to spend lots of money on the Konad&#x27;s plates to find out I didn&#x27;t liked it. I love it, it&#x27;s addicting. I practically only use these plates for my designs cause I have so many to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;They work perfectly even with regular nail polish (I don&#x27;t own any Konad special nail polish)&lt;br /&gt;The designs come out perfectly from the plates, sometimes you have to try more than once to get them correctly, but just make sure your plate and stamper are clean and try again, these happens even with the Konad ones.&lt;br /&gt;The full nail designs are a little smaller than the konads, I just use them horizontally since my nails are short and have no problem with the design not covering all my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got so addicted I even started a blog where you can find a picture of each one of the plates I received and a further review.[...]</li>
            <li> Now, I have not bought these. But I do own the bundle monster set. I was looking at the images on the plates in the picture offered. They are the same as the Bundle Monster plates. Exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and i was like its either win or lost   ordered it for my little sister 12 yr old divaaaaaa   Whom doesnt let me use any even though i bought it for her :?/  so im back here gettin me my own selection :P  dont buy the bs from few bad reviews  this is good quality    im impressed  nice</li>
            <li> I bought these because I suck at nail art. I got both sets. I&#x27;m not an artsy type person but who doesn&#x27;t like nail art every now and then? They do take practice. It&#x27;s not something I could do the very first time. It took me a couple tries and some experimenting with different nail polishes. I mostly use the Sally Hansen Insta Dri line. Just be patient. You&#x27;ll get it!</li>
            <li> Not as good as Konad plates, but it works - just make sure you use a very saturated nail color of polish for it.</li>
            <li> I love all the different designs you get. Even with 25 different discs there are no repeats which is nice. Mine didn&#x27;t come with the handy little bag though, but I have a case I keep all of my nail polish in anyway.</li>
            <li> I have several image plates from this collection that won&#x27;t transfer. The image isn&#x27;t deep cut into the plate like Konad plates or Bundle Monster image plates so after you swipe the excess polish then press the stamp a partial or no image transfers.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed in the plates.  Some worked well, but others didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s like they weren&#x27;t etched deep enough or something.  It&#x27;s definitely not as easy as it looks, but with practice and the right texture polish they turn out nice.</li>
            <li> I got this set today and decided to play around with it. I got very frustrated by the plastic coating on them, because it took me 45 minutes to remove all the protective plastic, and it was kind of messy because it tears apart in small pieces rather than one large piece. I recommend you do a few at a time, do some you want to use right away and pick a few backups because some of the images don&#x27;t transfer easily. Also some of the images work better with certain polishes than others but there is a tendency of encountering this with off brand plates and its one of those things I&#x27;ve just learned to deal with, like Konad Special Stamping Polish usually works best on troublesome plates. For example I was just playing around and I tried the paw image on the plate with all the pets with Wet and Wild quick drying polish with the color Ebony Hates Chris I like this black for stamping on other plates, on this particular image it doesn&#x27;t work, but the image worked a little better when I tried this brand called Essence- I used there quick drying polish. (Quick drying polish tends to have a thicker consistency that is the next best thing to stamping polish brands that make specific polish like Konad.) I like to try my images on paper first to practice and see how images work and what polish works best/what polish to avoid. Even if some images don&#x27;t work its still a good value compared to the actual Konad plates, and offers a lot of designs. SOME of the full finger designs also look very large others not so much, I haven&#x27;t tested these large looking ones yet on my nails but they look like they may be bigger than Konad, which is always a plus! Full finger designs are a pain!</li>
            <li> love them!!! But one of the stencils wont work. But I have so many I still love them!!!! Easy to use and so many fun designs, some are repeats though. Fast shipping got exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> These are one of the best nail platesto own. Love them. Nice looking packagd well and super fun to use. Will be buying more</li>
            <li> These plates are not as good as KONAD brand. The prints are not cutinto the glass deep enough. I use the KONAD nail polish, scrapper, and stamp applier and they hardly come onto the stamper at all. I would not buy these again - as I said, KONAD plates are much better - the designs are cut deeper into the plates, they go onto the stamper beautifully and with the whole design (thhese shany designs only pick up about half of the design). Maybe I could try with SHANY nail polish and stamp applier but my guess is they still wont work as well.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these plates - I LOVE that I can do nail designs without making an appointment at the salon.  And for wayyyy less than I&#x27;d pay too!</li>
            <li> I really love it all kinds of different designs I can do. went to the nail shop and they did not know what the Fleur de lis sign was but now that I have this kit I can do my own nails now. THANKS</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the salon express kit I have that you see on tv. I love them, it works with the holder and stamper I already have from that kit. The plates I got are not thin, I even tried to bend them and haven&#x27;t cut me at all, even when I was taking the plastic covering off of them. The full nail images and tips work just find and cover my nails just fine I have average size nails. I don&#x27;t have one bad thing to say about these plates, very happy and told everyone I know who as the kit like I do to order them. You can&#x27;t tell the difference between these plates and the ones that came with the salon express kit, if you use thin nail polish with any plates the image will be very light if it shows up at all. You have to use thick nail polish for the images; it does tell you that in the instructions. I have used the cheapest to the high dollar polish and if it is thin the image won&#x27;t be dark/bright. Wonderful produt and very happy:)</li>
            <li> I received this product and eventhough it was in an unopened package, all the plates were scratched and looked like they had been used! Also, I noticed that compared to other brands, they are a light-weight plastic verses a heavier metal type plate. The designs are also lightly etched onto the plates which I would guess would be harder to transfer a good stamp onto your nails. I would not order these is all I&#x27;m sayin...</li>
            <li> very nice gift to my wife, nice designs 25 of those plates, really good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging should be slightly better as by the time i received the parcel, the plates are out of the small paper pack. try and improve the packaging.</li>
            <li> I got these as a gift recently along with the Shany nail dryer. I didn&#x27;t use them at first because I wasn&#x27;t confident with how well I do nails. I finally couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and opened these suckers up. It was so much easier to do than what I thought it would be. I went to my mom&#x27;s house to show her and she didn&#x27;t believe I did my nails myself! So I brought all of my nail stuff over to do hers. Unfortunately now she always wants to borrow my stuff.</li>
            <li> I love these Shany plates! They are easy to use and you really get a lot for your money. Having read reviews about the sharp edges, I fully expected to slice my finger open the second I got these. They really aren&#x27;t that sharp, especially if you are using them as intended. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the packaging was really annoying. The plates come with blue plastic over them and you have to peel it off. Sounds easy? Nope. I had to get my tweezers out to start the peeling process. Once I had the piece peeled enough to grab it with my fingers, I had to work around it slowly so it wouldn&#x27;t rip and become ten times more difficult to do! It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but annoying enough to mention.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece in lieu of the more expensive konad plates (and because it qualified for Prime!)  We were so excited to try them when they came, but the transfers were not ever complete.  It was like the designs weren&#x27;t cut deep enough.  I thought we were just doing it wrong, but no matter who tried it, how much (or little) nail polish we used or even which brand/color we used, we couldn&#x27;t get a complete transfer (mostly the middle of the image would be missing).  I ordered a konad plate and was overjoyed when the first image worked the first time. We have had so much fun with it - now I just have to buy more of them!</li>
            <li> The SHANY nail art polish stamp is great. I didn&#x27;t have a difficult time removing the protective covering. I never cut myself on them as others have. I love the variety of Shany nail plates. Easy to use and fun. I love the stamps alone or combined with others. Some polishes work better than others,but no big deal. I didn&#x27;t have any residue left by the protective covers as some folks did. It did not come with the instructions,but after reading reviews I got the gist of what to do. I love this product. I go to cosmotology school and I have been spreading the word about them. I find many of my school mates are very interested in obtaining their own. I will definatly keep spreading the word. I will also eventuall purchase more SHANY products in the future.</li>
            <li> I was so happy about buying these plates, because there&#x27;s so many at such a small price. But are you serious? They are SUPER small, the plates are thin, and DON&#x27;T WORK. They don&#x27;t transfer at all. I scrape, and everytime I scrape, all of the nailpolish comes off completely. This is ridiculous. I&#x27;m never buying from them again.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter bought these with her Christmas money from Amazon and was super excited to get them.  Unfortunately, they are worthless!  First, the plastic that comes on them to protect during shipping is extremely difficult to remove and very time consuming.  My younger daughter cut herself on the edge of the plates trying to help - the edges are super sharp.  After all the work to remove the plastic, she couldn&#x27;t wait to use them - except they don&#x27;t work.  The &#x27;stamps&#x27; aren&#x27;t deep enough into the plate to allow the polish to sink into the picture to be transferred - she only found a few images that actually worked.  She tried different polishes, different rubber stamper tools, and different &#x27;scraping&#x27; techniques to get them to work and all failed.  These definately need to go back.  The &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; set she has all worked perfectly, she just wanted more plates to go with it.  Too bad they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The images on the plates are not sketched in deep enough.  This makes it very difficult and in some cases impossible to pull the image up and place on finger nail.  I had to purchase another set from another seller and I am now able to do my nails without the stress of a faulty plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service was good and the price was ok.</li>
            <li> Great set with cute images! Images transferred well and product is packaged securely. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just got a manicure at a salon and let me tell you, this nail set is so much better of a bargain! The palettes work flawlessly and are easy to clean. Plus, as a college student, this saves me money by being able to do my own nails for practically nothing. The variety is hard to beat and I wish I had seen .deal earlier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t purchased these, but I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and the price for these seems like a great value as compared to other brands, and I know someone who has them and likes them, so I&#x27;d give them a thumbs up based on those factors.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered these after watching a konad thing on youtube. They came in the mail, and I could NOT get them to work! #blonde then getting frustrated I went to find a tutorial online, and figured out you had to peel the blue layer off xD. So I would recommend using an old gift/credit card instead of the metal plates, because it WILL scratch up your metal plates, overall, I would defiantly gt them!!</li>
            <li> These plates work great! I have no used all of the patterns but I have used the Cheetah and some of the floral designs on my nails, my sisters, and my friends.  I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without these little wonders! They make a great design nail or a super fun set of nails! It is completely easy to use.  It took about three attempts before I was able to get the hang of how to work the stamp so I am getting all of the design on the stamp and then all of it on my actual nail and not sticking to the stamp but I&#x27;m pretty much a professional already! No one can believe that I painted my own nails.  I keep getting asked if I am wearing nail stickers. I also purchased the special nail polish to do the stamping but have found that any one of my 107 bottles of nail polish work just as good as the \\&quot;special\\&quot; nail polish so don&#x27;t waste your money.  I would recommend these stamps to anyone - steady hand or not! There are also a lot of Youtube video tutorials that will show you exactly how to use this product.  They also give great inspiration, so, I recommend checking a few of them out after you buy this!</li>
            <li> I got these plates as a gift for my birthday and in love with them. I have been wanting to start stamping for a while but konad is way to expensive at $7 per plate. It took me a couple of tries to get the hang of it but after that they work awesome .</li>
            <li> These plates have so many fun designs.  I have been looking for nail plates that have more images besides hearts and flowers.  I was so excited when I saw these because they have little bugs, a kite, a hummingbird, an anchor, the zodiac signs and the list goes on.  I&#x27;m still a new stamper so I&#x27;m learning technique but while I&#x27;m learning these are fun to practice with.  Oh and I was happy about the price because I did not want to spend around  $6 per plate like the well known name brand plates (especially being a newbie).</li>
            <li> There are so many patterns and designs to choose from! Get ANY look you want with these easy to use nail art polish stamps!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and once I learned to take off the blue covering, they worked amazingly well! My daughter loves them and it is real easy to do her nails now. It doesn&#x27;t work sometimes but I think it&#x27;s because the nail polish dries too quickly not because of the stencils. After a little practice, I think we&#x27;ll have no problems at all with them.</li>
            <li> these plates work really well with the konad stamper and scraper, my only complaint is that I sliced my finger taking the plastic lining off. Also my set didn&#x27;t come with directions. When I was ordering I wasn&#x27;t sure if it came with a stamp or scraper... it doesn&#x27;t so if anyone is like me (which for your sake you&#x27;re hopefully not:) then just know it is only the plates, which are pretty awesome!</li>
            <li> I love these! It was a great price too! Cant&#x27;t find cheaper anywhere else and they work great. Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought these so that i would be able to stamp different designs on my nails, it was an awesome deal... when i recieved them they were opened, scratched up and the grooves arent deep enought to even stamp with.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife to add to her Konad nail art collection of stamp plates. The ones that she had been considering were much more expensive and for the cost, came with 2 or 3 plates only. Upon receiving them, I compared them to the \\&quot;orignal\\&quot; Konad ones she has and these are thinner. The Konad ones are thicker and noticeably more rigid. However, you nail stampers probably know that a thinner image plate really makes no difference in function. So aside from being thinner, these work just the same. The Shany plates work wonderfully and are able to produce clean, detailed stamps. To me, that&#x27;s a great deal already.    For my wife though, it was a STEAL for what I paid and she got 25 plates. With each plate containing 6-7 images, she had an additional 150+ images to work with. The variety of images is a good mix of holiday, pop culture images, and just great looking designs that seem to appeal to everyone.    At this price, I dont see why anyone who owns a nail stamping kit wouldnt buy one. These seem to be a great deal at a FRACTION of the cost of the Konad (or any other brand) image plates.    I&#x27;m not sure what the negative reviewers were having issues with. As someone else pointed out, there is a plastic cover over the plate, removing the plastic covering reveals a shiny, slick, highly polished surface.</li>
            <li> not good!!! the images are not sharp when stamped, however the edges on each disc are sharp enough to cut your finger, the protectant film on each disc is SO difficult and annoying to remove, the images which should cover a whole nail (like the zebra)are so small you can only use it on a pinky finger-not worth it people!</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with these plates.  I love them because they do their job perfectly.  The nail stamp comes out clear and detailed on your nails.  Also these plates fit nicely into the Konad plate holder, if you already have one.  I must admit I was a bit worried about that. Oh and the designs are amazing.  You get a wide variety of designs from French to full nail to even some holiday designs.      The reason why I hate them is because practically every time I use these I end up slicing my fingers on them.  The plates are thin and sharp, so be extra careful when handling them, especially when you first take off that dreaded plastic coating that has no desire to come off nicely.  Patience is needed here!      Also to note these plates where so thin and sharp they ripped the original packaging.  So when they arrived they were scattered throughout the box.  Luckily they were all accounted for except I ended up with a duplicate plate.  Normally I wouldn&#x27;t mind but this is plate #BM07 the one with the weed leaf.  Clearly this design is not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for Konad ever since my friend purchased them a year ago. I finally bought them from the online site and BOY did they COST ALOT. The plates are almost $7 each! Crazy? Overall, it&#x27;s a great product! But there is only ONE FATAL, AND I MEAN FATAL, FLAW. Just keep in mind, SIZE MATTERS.     Pros:  -Awesome variety. Many types of designs for different occassions, seasons, holidays, ect. Whatever you need.   -Great price! Can&#x27;t beat this anywhere else. (Trust me I looked).  -Designs come out crisp and clean. Haven&#x27;t had an issue with the images yet. Awesome quality for the price.  -I frikkin love it!    Cons:  -OK HERE IS THE FATAL FLAW. I&#x27;m asian (not to be racist) and have VERY small hands and my fingernails are generally short. My hands are smaller then my neighbor&#x27;s 8 year old son.  TINY. And the plates that have the full designs (such as the stripes, stars, ect)dont completely cover my nails. Unlike the konad designs (with room for no error), dont expect the whole image to cover/fit on your nails. Once you try to compeltely cover it, it looks terrible. Just killed it for me...  -Once again with my hands, TINY. French tips are diffacult to use. Pretty small size. It&#x27;s workable for me but...I expect others to struggle.   -The plates are pretty thin compared to their Konad counterparts, be careful. I actually cut myself once. The edges are sharp and thin...think razor. Take caution when you first remove the plastic covers and when in use. ESPECIALLY around children.</li>
            <li> These do work but if you have read other reviews then you&#x27;ll know these are sharp and very thin which is practically the only problem. When you do use them be very careful. If you don&#x27;t know how to use them then go to youtube i&#x27;m sure they have plenty of tutorials or on these reviews (I&#x27;m still figuring it out myself). So far they work well but again different nail polishes have different effects like with any item.</li>
            <li> Im not to good at this yet but im sure in time I&#x27;ll get better at it. Some of the design are hard to get on to the stamp but its fun to do with my nieces.  Plus I order a whole bunch of nail art stuff..  But over all its cool, it just takes practice.  One thing I think that the company needs to fix is, to make the design print deeper so it doesnt scrap off. Designs are super cute.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these nail plates yet, they&#x27;re a christmas gift for my sister. It looks like the images that are supposed to cover the whole nail actually will cover it. I noticed with other brands of nail plates the images that are supposed to cover the whole nail don&#x27;t even for small hands.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Shany nail plates in October. They are very good quality. They make a clear image with no smudging or blurry lines. The variety of images is great too. There are lots of large, full nail images, French manicure images (I turn them sideways and make new designs on my nails.), and small dainty images that I stamp in different colors all over my nails. This is a fun way to do your nails. I never go to a nail salon. People comment on my nails every time we go out.  Shany, please work on a second set. I would buy it in a flash.  Everybody, don&#x27;t forget to remove the blue sticker that protects each plate, and stamp away.</li>
            <li> Great value for your money and MUCH less than buying Konad. I have had no problem at all with my plates. I work in retail so I encounter hundreds of people every day. I get so many compliments on my nails! The Halloween plate with the scream face got me tons of compliments. Some of the finer more delicate designs don&#x27;t transfer well - but you know what? I have some Konad plates that don&#x27;t transfer well either. I think the finer designs are harder b/c the polish will dry faster than you can scrape, stamp and transfer. You just have to be quicker about it or fill in a spot or two with a small liner brush. Not a big deal.   If these were Konad plates you&#x27;d be paying $175 for the set of $25. I got these for less than $12. No complaints for me. I&#x27;ve even gotten 2 co-workers addicted to them, and another is buying a set for her daughter.   As far as the sharp edges, handle them carefully that&#x27;s all. Mine aren&#x27;t that sharp. Maybe some were bad. It&#x27;s like anything else in life. A metal knife has sharp edges, you just handle it differently than you would a spoon.   If anyone had duplicates or messed up patterns I would email the seller. I&#x27;m sure they would be happy to help. I&#x27;ve purchased from them twice and have purchase multiple Bundle Monster plates too. I for one, love my set! I hope they come out with new designs soon.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Very beautiful image. If you learn how to use them, it is fun and you will enjoy it every time you look at them. I Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for everything included, I have tried to buy stamps from other places and they cost way more than these. I love Shany Products!</li>
            <li> The plates are fine. They are a little sharp but not too bad and you can always make your own backing for them. The ones I have tried work and are big enough for my nails except for my thumb, but I do have small nails. Also, the protective film wasn&#x27;t as hard to remove as everyone says. It took me about five minutes without tweezers or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I only received 24 plates. I don&#x27;t really mind since they were so cheap, but it does say 25. The few extra plates are the reason I bought these over the Bundle Monster ones, and as far as I can tell, these are the same plates. These seem to be selected at random though as I am missing a couple according to the numbers on the plates (except for the one missing, they were substituted with other plates. Bad for my OCD, but doesn&#x27;t really matter.) My main problem with these and this seller is actually that when I received the plates, I opened the box and they just slid out. They were just loose in the box. Apparently they had all been in a single small plastic sleeve and had cut through it, which was not adequate packaging at all. I don&#x27;t need fancy packaging, especially for such a cheap product I really don&#x27;t care; it just seems very unprofessional from a company. I am not a seller, but if I were, I would never send anything out like that. It&#x27;s just unacceptable, regardless of how cheap the product is. I know this is about the product and not the seller, but this is the only one I&#x27;ve seen selling these plates, which aren&#x27;t exclusively Shany brand, apparently, so I thought a general review would be more helpful.</li>
            <li> Shany Stamping Nail Art Set (Nail Art Image Plate Holder, Scraper, Stamper) (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;The applier and metal patterns are junk! Won&#x27;t work! Save yourself headache and don&#x27;t buy! The metal design forms (molds) are too shallow. The dabber won&#x27;t grab the nail polish. I&#x27;d just like my money back!</li>
            <li> The designs are adorable and easy to use.  I even had a preteen that could use them easily.  Can&#x27;t wait to try them on my summer pedi:)</li>
            <li> This was great my daughters wanted this so bad and I finally got it for them.  This kept them busy for a long time they loved it.  would buy again for them.</li>
            <li> Magnific desings. A lot of them, just some of them a little bit short for big nails. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have not try it yet, but the images are cool. Some designs are a little cheap looking, but there are good ones too. The wrapper is a little difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> Not to post a grumpy review, but I am so disappointed with this set. The images are tiny and as for most of the designs, because of it I can&#x27;t even tell what I&#x27;ve stamped on my nail when I glance down. The plastic covers are a real pain to remove and I&#x27;ve seen in a previous review that someone got injured trying to remove them. I really think the designs are adorable, but they&#x27;re too small to really work with my tastes.</li>
            <li> WOW is what I have to say so far!  I love to do zebra and cheetah nails and this makes it so much easier to accomplish this!  I used to spent an hour or two drawing out each zebra stripe individually and i&#x27;ve cut that time in half, at least.  The plates come protected and well packaged and are made of quality material.  Just be careful because if you are too careless you may cut yourself on the edge of the plates.  I definitely reccommend this product to any nail junkies, whether they be newbies or professionals!</li>
            <li> I love these plates! There are so many designs to choose from and it&#x27;s very easy. A lot of reviews said the edges were very sharp, but they aren&#x27;t at all. Also, the protective plastic that comes on them is kind of hard to get off, but nothing to complain about. One of my plates was carved a little out of place, but that is the only thing I have found wrong with them. They work just as well as the Konad plates and are much more reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Received my plates before schedule.  Love the variety of images for just about any occasion.  Stamped fantastically.  My only con is that the plates have no backing and can be a bit sharp when you need to peel off the blue wrapping front and back; still it is a minor inconvenience for some pretty cool plates.</li>
            <li> When ordering the plates I read some tutorial&#x27;s on how the stamping works along with watchings ome videos. I have the konad nail polish along with the stamp. I have try numerous of times and the polish will not show up on the stamp. Honestly a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my daughter for her birthday and she was very disapointed with it. When she put the stamper on the plate to get the image the image wouldnt come off the plate! She even used the konad nail polish.It just didnt work. She only got 21 plates instead of 25 which was another problem.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this product.  I was a little skeptical but decided to go for it anyway. And I&#x27;m glad I did.  These discs work perfectly.  No, the quality is not quite as high as the konad discs, but the value is second to none.  They are a little sharp, but I am not worried about cutting myself like others shared.  The coating is a little hard to peel off, but this would in no way hinder my recomendation of this product.  Just make sure you peel the one you want before applying fresh polish.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Got them out the box and tried to peel the blue plastic that protects them from getting scratched. Found out it was impossible to do so, so I returned them.</li>
            <li> My daughter was overwhelmed with joy when she received these as a gift. I was impressed with the quantity and price. It was exactly what we both wanted and she is enjoying them to the fullest.</li>
            <li> These plates work as described and they&#x27;re a good value for the price. Remove the blue film included in the packaging to reveal the etching. They are very thin, as other reviews mentioned, but I was able to handle them safely, and the stamp prints look great.</li>
            <li> I received my package yesterday. Not a long wait for them at all. But I received two of plate SH11 and did not have plate SH17. They stamp pretty good overall . I&#x27;ll see if I get the plate SH17 from customer service and post another comment when received.</li>
            <li> Im new nail stamping so I thought this would be a good assortment to get.  I got all 25 plates and all were different.  The protective coating was no biggie to get off once you get an edge lifted.  Edges are a bit on the sharp side so handle with care.  The only problem I was having was on the full nail design I was trying that I was not able to get a good full image.  I was using Konad polish and it seemed to dry before I was able to stamp a good image.  (I was working fast too). I tried a bigger flower pattern and it seemed to work okay.  I tried a full nail design on a Konad plate and it worked fine using the same Konad polish to make sure the polish was working properly. So maybe next time I will try a different regular polish that doesnt dry as fast and see if that makes a difference, Im thinking some of these more intricate designs aren&#x27;t engraved as deeply as Konad brand like many were saying.</li>
            <li> I really hesitated on buying these because of the negative reviews but after receiving them, I have to say that i think those people did not remove the blue protective film or perhaps were not roughing up the stamper.  Once the film is removed these plates are beautiful, shiny and no scratches.  they work just the same as my konad plates.  This is a great amount of plates for a really good price.  They are etched plenty deep enough.  The thing you have to remember though with any plate including konad, is that you need to rough up the stamper first, clean it with nail polish remover and then apply the polish to the plate.  Once you scrap the polish off, you need to work quickly but these are absolutely beautiful when used correctly.  I have done my nails a bunch of times as well as my 6 year old daughters and I have had perfect results every time.  I love he variety in these plates.  So if you read some negative reviews, remember they may have done something wrong.  I also highly recommend the konad plates, but they are a bit pricier.  So if you are looking for a good deal, these plates are perfect.</li>
            <li> I just received these plates today and tried them out. Having not used any other brands of image plates before, I can&#x27;t comment on how well they work compared to others, but they seemed to do ok. The only thing I wish I&#x27;d done was some more looking at the Konad and Bundle Monster plates before I ordered these. I picked this brand because it was the cheapest, but now I see that Konad and BM seem to have a lot more attractive and cute designs on their plates. Also, this brand did give me some duplicate designs,  I&#x27;d say about three or four, so that was kind of a bummer. There are plenty of pretty florals and abstract patterns, but I will be saving my money for a set of bundle monster plates as well.</li>
            <li> The shipping was incredibly fast.  Everything was as ordered and the plates are awesome.  My daughter and I can&#x27;t wait to try them all out!</li>
            <li> I got them really fast and they all look great. good variety of designs as well! I&#x27;ve seen other plates that were not as well defined so the stamp comes out splotchy but these are not like that. they are very clear.</li>
            <li> this polish works wonders. it totally transforms my nails from dull to a brand new \\&quot;nail shop new\\&quot;. every girl need these polishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been practicing and practicing and I can&#x27;t get this to work. I&#x27;ve been watching YouTube videos and it looks like it works but not for me. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong or taking too long but I just couldn&#x27;t make this thing work so far.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Mine came used and does not even work. Piece of crap</li>
            <li> Everything about this product was amazing! It came earlier then expected &amp; they look amazing on my nails! cutests designs ever!</li>
            <li> I expected these to be nice, but they are a lot nicer than I was actually expecting. The images are all so cute and I can&#x27;t wait to use them on myself and my young daughter who loves getting her little nails painted. I read some of the other reviews that said people got cut on them because the sides are so sharp, and I can see that happening. At least I know to be careful with them in that regard. But, I am very happy with the quality and definitely will be purchasing from this company again.</li>
            <li> I received the Shany plates very quickly, and have tried quite a few of the designs. Most work very well (depending on the thickness of the nailpolish.) A few of the designs are weak on the nails, however for the price and the amount of designs I do believe this product is worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the creative side of nails :)</li>
            <li> This is my first set of stamps. So far so good. Hopefully I&#x27;ll get better at stamping as I go.</li>
            <li> Create your own beautiful, intricate designs in minutes with this easy to use kit. With zodiac signs, holiday designs &amp; animal prints you&#x27;ll have enough to explore your creative side! Can be used on a single nail or on all nails! For the fashion forward Diva! And is a lot cheaper in the long run than getting manicurists to do the designs! For always in style nails.</li>
            <li> I just received this package today and I opened it right away. I didn&#x27;t have a hard time taking off the blue plastic on each plate and I didn&#x27;t get any duplicate of any plate either. I have yet to try it though, I&#x27;m just waiting for my scraper and stamper to get here :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product for you and someone. the nail designs are amazing and so very easy to apply!</li>
            <li> So I was thinking that i got a good deal and it was too good to be true. I was right! Yes you get all 25 pieaces that do not even work. It didn&#x27;t even get the print on my nail what so ever. When I use the ORIGINAL KONDAD DISK IT WORKED, THE IMAGE CAME OUT PERFECT. I wish that I would have never purchase this product.</li>
            <li> These plates are awesome! I stamped out every design to see what it would look like and they all turned out amazing. The plates are thin and I did cut myself but it was like a paper cut so no big deal. For the price these are truly awesome.</li>
            <li> The Amazon order has reached me, the product equal to that show you the page. arrived on time and scheduled time, they worry about customer satisfaction.   Overall my recommended purchase is 100% satisfactory[[ASIN:B004DK0UDA SHANY Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit \\&quot;25pcs\\&quot;]]</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter. She loved them and has used them quite a bit since Christmas. Now all of her friends want them and I have directed them to you. Thank you!</li>
            <li> First time I have used this product, and I didn&#x27;t read the directions first. So I also did not relise there was a plastic coating on the metal disks. Once that was gone I had a blast with this. Can use normal polish with it. Have used it on several people. It makes nail art a breeze. I am very happy with it. I did not experence any sharp edges with it and it is easy enough that my 8 year old can do it with me. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> These plates are awesome! The price is outstanding and the variety is unique! I wish I knew how to use them correctly.  So far, I haven&#x27;t had too great of luck with it, but a few of my friends have used them before and had great turnouts and designs, so I know it&#x27;s user error.  The plates came with a whole variety of different designs, all of which are unique and i&#x27;m sure will look awesome when I figure out what i&#x27;m doing wrong.  I know it takes some practice, and i&#x27;ve not had THAT much time to spend with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this with a MASH double sided stamper/scraper and a SHANY single ended stamper/plate holder. I&#x27;m excited to experiment a lot more with these plates.  If you&#x27;re the type of person that gets bored easily with nail polish and likes to have cool designs on your nails (cool...as in pretty, or funky, or unique, or seasonal, etc) then these are definitely something you want to invest in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HINT: there is a thin BLUE FILM on each plate that you need to peel off (on the front and back)....the scrapers will scratch the metal plates, but it does NOT affect your stamp design (for me, it is a good indicator of designs i&#x27;ve already used) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has tips or tricks, please feel free to let me know (lilredshortie52@gmail.com) or reply on here, because I&#x27;m not great at applying this (YET) but i&#x27;ll be a pro soon enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you can&#x27;t beat the price, or the designs you get-- i&#x27;m sure we all get a bit different designs, but mine are very cool-- i&#x27;d like to get the entire line of plates and never wear the same design twice.  Awesome price for an awesome product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks yall</li>
            <li> I love this. it has a variety of images. the stamps leaves the image very clear with all the details. fast shipping. Thanks,</li>
            <li> These are so much fun! So many designs, too few nails to paint... I wish I had more friends, I would do their nails too. A set of 25 plates with many designs on each plate, you will be busy for a long time... I got these as a gift that I asked for from my fiance. ;P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things that I wanted to point out for new stampers like myself: this process is fun, it is fast, it takes a little practice. At first you may not stamp like the customer pictures that are shown, but you just need to keep practicing. You will find your groove after some practice. I have to get used to applying top coat without smudging the intricate designs, but aside from that, I am becoming a pro at this and it is so much fun to do. Clean the plate design and stamper after each stamping, use Q-tips when you do this or you will mess up your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also made sure to get a starter kit that came with the stamper, scraper, and some other plates and polish. (I decided the Konad french manicure set was the one for me.) So once I received everything, I was ready to get going. I felt this set and my french manicure set were a great match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to point out is that the plates each come with a protective blue covering. This covering to me is near the bane of my existence, but I eventually worked hard and removed all the coverings. I ended up cutting up a couple fingers in the process as the plates are sharp! Be careful when removing these coverings. There is a method that I saw on a youtube video, where the girl just pushed down with her thumb, and I did that but still had a hard time. Just watch those edges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, that is about it, I love these things!</li>
            <li> PROS: Variety of designs a little something for everyone. Even includes holiday designs which I love.    More individual designs (ex: butterfly, heart, flower...) than full nail designs (ex: abstract, zebra, swirls...)    (^^^ might be a con for some, but I prefer individual designs)  CONS: Only con I have is the plates are very sharp around the edges, be careful it will easily cut you :(    (^^^ this is the on;y reason it recived 4 stars)  Overall: Very happy with this item, for the price you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> Love it work great came in on time enjoying. One had a scare but work good</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Konad stamper. You get a pack of 25 different plates which is a bargain considering other Konad plates can cost $4 for just one. Some designs are better than others, but if you&#x27;re looking to add some variety to your set, this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li> Try these before you spend money on Konad![[ASIN:B004DK0UDA SHANY Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit \\&quot;25pcs\\&quot;]]</li>
            <li> I bought mine from Bundle Monster &amp; this is the one popping up under the purchase. Hmmm.... crazy that I paid 17.99 (plus free shipping)for them and they are now $40+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOST of the plates work just fine. Some of the designs are to shallow to get the design (sections of polish will be missing). :( Which sucks, but I figured for such a cheap price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Other than that, the full nail designs are narrow. I have small nails &amp; it barely covers my nail from side to side. One side is always missing just a bit of design. UGH... its annoying. But overall they are ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO WARNING... if I had bought them for $40+, I would be PISSED right now! But since I paid only $18, Im not so disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and satisfied with the plates work well.</li>
            <li> The images on the plates look great... if only i could USE them!! The blue protective plastic on these plates is ridiculously hard to remove. I sat here for 15 minutes working on it and all I got done were two - got frustrated with the third one and gave up. At this rate it will take me hours! Not your typical protective plastic (like on the BM plates) this stuff is really thin and GLUED onto these plates.  GOOD LUCK removing it without cutting yourself at least a few times!!! I won&#x27;t be ordering anymore Shany plates if I see reviews like this on future sets.</li>
            <li> These are the neatest nail plates I have seen...You get so many nail designs to choose from..I wish I would have got these a long time ago..I would have saved myself alot of money getting designs at my salon..Now I can...I cant believe how easy it was to use Shany has made these amazing plates with really fast shipping..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for saving my wallet money lol!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Treishapromua</li>
            <li> THESE ARE PRETTY COOL  I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY NIECE AND SHE LOVE THE WAY THE DESIGNS LOOK ON HER NAILS.I ALSO PUT THEM ON MY NAILS AND THEY TURNED OUT LOOKING PRETTY COOL!</li>
            <li> These things don&#x27;t work no matter what I try. Not sure if the etching is too shallow but the stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up enough to show up at all and it is so thin you wouldn&#x27;t recognize it anyway. I&#x27;ve tried using Shany polish as well as other brands and nothing has worked. The discs are a bit sharp too so don&#x27;t let kids play with them. I&#x27;ve cut myself sorting through them.</li>
            <li> I like these stamping plates. I bought them for my daughter for Christmas, but I think I have used them more! they are a little tricky at first, but with practice and watching youtube videos, I got the hang of it now! I would buy more in the future with new designs.</li>
            <li> First let me say I am familier with stamping.  I own both Bundle Monster sets, lots of Konads, the set from MASH, Red Angel plates and various plates from european collections.  I was reluctant to purchase these plates based on the bad reviews on the previous set from this company and from the bad reveiws on this current set.  But I saw a few video reviews of the 2012 set one of which had test stamps from the plates and they stamped very well.  I also was aware of the blue plastic film from hell and the fact it was very hard to remove.  I decided to purchase a set anyway because of the video that showed the designes stamping well.  I purchased on 1/19/12 they shipped on 1/20/12 and i recieved them I think on 1/24/12 so pretty good on the shipping imo.  I took them out and I didnt look forward to removing the plastic film as I have had to remove difficult film in the past and it sucks.  But to my surprise they peeled right off!  It took me less than 10 mins to remove all the film from all of the plates.  So I figured great I got the set that has the easy to remove plastic but watch them not stamp.  Each stamp I tested worked perfectly.  I had no issues with any of the plates and I tested an image from each.  I can only think they must have listened to the reviews and changed the plastic.  I am happy with the images and can recommend these plates.</li>
            <li> All of the  images are useable for me, you don&#x27;t need special stamping polish. Normal nail polish works great. The first few times I tried it, I only got a partial image. But after a few more tries I found out that you have to press really hard and it will eventually work. There are a couple of repeated images, and a lot of the designs are of flowers. The edges are pretty sharp, and you might get cut on them if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> A great addition to any nail polish aficionado&#x27;s collection. Endless combinations. Works very well. Now, which color will I enhance today.</li>
            <li> Recommend this product to anyone who has a wife that loves to keep her nails looking good. My wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally one to use these nail plates, hoever I saw the different designs and decided to purchase for fun. I&#x27;ve never had MORE FUN doing my nails!!! The best part is you get that \\&quot;airbrushed look\\&quot; without paying the salon prices! These plates are definitely sturdy and meant to last.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE GREAT AND A BIG VARIETY PACK WHICH IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES THAT COME IN THE STAMP KIT AS SEEN ON TV.  NOW CAN DO MORE DESIGNS AND CANNOT WAIT TO TRY OUT SOME OF THEM. THANKS</li>
            <li> They came by mail. They were all scratched up like they were used. I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to use them, maybe i can after them be scratch up... idk.</li>
            <li> I recieved these on time and in good condition.  I love these.  I might not pay to have my nails done again.  These image plates make doing your nails fun.  They are easy to use.  I suggest using the white or black top coats with these.  The base color is your choice.I used these on my nails and loved the look. Then I loaned them to my daughter who had fun with her nails and is going to order her own set.  If your like fancy nails in a do it your self package order these.  LINDA W</li>
            <li> I have received 24 out of 25 plates.  Plate S1107 with the numbers &amp; two horses is missing from the set. All the rest arrived in a timely fashion</li>
            <li> Nails can be such an artform and with these plates you are able to purchase a quality product that gives you so many choices of different styles.

            <li> This is very cheap for these nail stamping plates. There are hundreds of unique designs. These are great for nail manicurists, and very small and easy to travel with. I highly recommend these over any others. :)</li>
            <li> This product is an okay product but could be better. It works perfect because I have small fingers and the images come out great. I would love it if I could use on larger hands. Don&#x27;t take my word for it because it might work excelent for you.</li>
            <li> The Shany Image plates are very nice. If there was one thing I could change, it would to add backing to the image plates because of the SHARP EDGES!&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to view the image plates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I got mine in the mail just minutes ago. I immediately started peeling off the blue stickers. I was worried it&#x27;s be a pain, but I&#x27;m already done with 5 of them in just the past minute! I just carefully held a plate, took my nail and scratched at the tippy top, and it peels off instantly. No problem. :) I got all my plates. I got a duplicate, but I&#x27;ll just give it to my sister-in-law so she can practice. I can&#x27;t wait to get started! My plates aren&#x27;t THAT sharp either. I can see how you can cut yourself. Just handle them properly and carefully. They are thin. I gave 4 stars because I have not yet used them. But oh trust me, I&#x27;m doing nails TONIGHT!</li>
            <li> i was excited to get my plates today, and when i opened my pacage the top plate was scraped and the box looked like it had been opened by someone. i tried to think positivly as i further opened the package to get the rest of the plates out. almost all of them were scratched. still remaining optomistic, i tried them out! they were too shallow to hold any of the konad polish or any other polish i had. overall i was extremly dissapointed with these plates.</li>
            <li> Before i purchased this product i read some of the reviews i was kinda worry about it but i gave it a try an i just love this product. The way that the nail stamp comes out clear and detailed on my nails. And they have many types of designs for different occassions, seasons, holidays, ect. Plus its Great price for them! like 25 stamping plates for $10.15 it&#x27;s an awesome price can&#x27;t beat this anywhere else. Haven&#x27;t had any issue with the images yet. But I defenatly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing image plates and I love them! The blue film was easy to take off and the images are indented well. The price was cheap compared to many other brands/sellers that I looked through and the quality is great! I recommend them to anyone who&#x27;s looking to buy for their first time! :)</li>
            <li> Terrible, terrible plates. Many designs are not cut properly and have flaws that ruin the image. I cannot stamp crisp/clear designs with any of the images that I have used. I would recommend that you AVOID THESE PLATES. I&#x27;ve stamped my nails repeatedly with Konad plates- I know what stamping polish works well and I know that images from the Konad plates transfer completely to your nail. These plates are crap.</li>
            <li> I must say that I own so much nail polish but this is amazing!!!!!!!!!! This makes my nails stand out above everyones! It litteraly looks like I went to the salon! I always get complimented! It adds just the right touch to look fab!!! It&#x27;s so much fun to have a lil&#x27; party and makeup and nails!! It&#x27;s not hard to use at all! &lt;3</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve listened to other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;The edges are too sharp to work with, and the images are too small for the whole nail.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money on this, I didn&#x27;t care to toss all out in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;Save your hard earned money on this and buy either cheeky&#x27;s or bundle monsters.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me because I spend hundreds of dollors on plates oby Konad, BM, Cheeky&#x27;s and this.</li>
            <li> First of all they got here sooner than I expected! Second the designs are perfect! They have a crazy wide selection of images. There are some for holidays, seasons, an elegant event or just for fun. They are work wonderfully and are worth every penny. COMPLETE SATISFACTION. Oh and just to discount the rumor that they are sharp they are NOT sharp. You could cut yourself only if you tried VERY VERY hard.</li>
            <li> The designs are so cute and the images are really clear - which mena sthey show you well! these are easy to maintain as well!</li>
            <li> Had to wait for a few days, but packing was great and all image plates had something different. And I didn&#x27;t  know they were gonna be so small, it&#x27;s great you can store them any where.... Love It</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I discovered these, it&#x27;s like they had me in mind when they invented them. I love nail art, but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to create with a brush, no matter how fine-tipped it is, and these plates make it SO much easier to get professional-looking nails in such a quick and easy manner!</li>
            <li> I like using the plates but I might have to purchase the Konad nail polish. Regular polish is not doing it for me. I was temped to send them back because I could not not get the image to transfer to my Salon Express Stamper. However, after getting on youtube and watching a few videos I was able to get to the hang of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the images and have painted my nails a dozen times already however I would recommend using a really thick nail polish or purchase Konad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Stamping!!</li>
            <li> These plates work very well and are easy to use! I saw a review here about the images being too small, but I do not think they are, they are the right size for the large patterns to cover the whole nail and for the little images to be used as accents. Great quality, covered with a thin plastic (make sure you peel it off so the plates work correctly) to protect them. Definitely a great tool to have! Now I just need to go get some more nail polishes to have some more fun with these!</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;Active nail stamper here to tell you a little bit of my experience with this product!&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this product a 4 star rating was because the plates don&#x27;t have a paper backing. It is just the blue plastic like they have in front, which isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m use to with other brands. The only problem with this would be the possible chance of injury. On the other hand, though i have not tested out every single image as of yet, the images that i have tried stamp very clearly onto the nail (also depends on the nail polish you use). I would recommend this to anyone who would want easy salon style nail art at home. Also what I liked about this product was the price!</li>
            <li> I am new to nail stamping and started with a Konad starter kit just a week or two ago.  I found the Salon Express kit in my local CVS so I bought that too, just to get some more image plates.  The Konad and the Salon Express kits both had the same exact quality of image plates.  I had read a bunch of reviews about how a plate is a plate... and I liked the designs offered with this SHANY set so I bought it. Having received the SHANY plates, I must tell everyone that NOT ALL PLATES ARE CREATED EQUAL!  They are very cheap feeling; they are probably 70% thinner than the Konad plates or the plates that came in the Salon Express kit I bought.  They feel like you can bend them easily which would be disastrous for trying to scrape off excess nail polish from them.  I only tried one of the intricate designs on it and it seemed to be ok for transfer, but the cleaning of the plate is difficult because it&#x27;s so thin that the design etching is very sharp and the cotton or whatever you wipe it with, catches on the design.  Also, handling the paper thin plates is cumbersome and tends to make you mess up your nails since they are super sharp on the edges.  It would be better if all image plate specs detailed the thickness of the plate in a universal measure. Not sure if it did, but I have learned from this experience.  I probably would stick to Konad plates after this or look more carefully at the product description before I purchase.  ** Additionally, I tried to use the french patterns (PLATE #SH06) and am unhappy to report that they don&#x27;t work at all! The pattern is not cut in deep enough which results in the nail polish being scraped out of the pattern when you scrape off the excess.  I tried with both Konad special polish and regular polish, I tried cleaning the plate, scraping at various angles, everything and nothing works.  I wonder if I can get a refund or I&#x27;ll just throw out that plate because it&#x27;s frustrating to have the design but not be able to use it.</li>
            <li> Ok, now I have the stamper in, and have gave these a test run! I must say, they work great! I had no problem even with a fine detail design. (now to try my luck at a full nail design!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping, bonus! As for other reviewers who had the plates loose in package, mine came packed up tight in a small cardboard box. I can see how someone could think they were shorted in the order, as the plates ARE thin, sharp and do stick to each other at first, but I did have the full 25 pcs, and no duplicates. Once i unstuck them, I had the full count..&lt;br /&gt;(Now that I have received another brand of these as well, I can at least say that the SHANY plates are slightly thinner, but also much flatter - the Red Angel set I just received is thicker metal, but a tad warped from the stamping process - they all do not sit flush with each other - SHANY plates, nice, snug &amp; flat!)</li>
            <li> My sister bought this for me for Christmas after seeing it on my wish list. I often do my nails, and was looking for a fun way to decorate them while saving some time from hand painting each nail. I jumped right into this stamping, and never looked back. It&#x27;s super simple to do, and my nails look amazing. There are literally thousands of options that you can achieve, and every day at least one person stops me and asks me where I got my nails done or how they were done. I love being able to tell them they can do it themselves so easily as I did. My niece, who is four, is able to use this as well, so it&#x27;s really easy to use. I suggest it to any one who likes to do their nails, whether they are young or old. It is fast and easy, but looks professional and intricate. Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have used image plates before and have had great success. I thought these plates were a great value for the money. My stamper would NOT pick up images at all. Didn&#x27;t matter how much polish I used. I don&#x27;t think images are carved deep enough. Every time I scraped, half the polish would scrape out of images as well. Not worth it. I am returning and buying the pricer konad ones that I know work.</li>
            <li> I love it because it has so many options, you can never not find anything that you are looking for so that&#x27;s really good. A lot of reviews said that they are sharp and they cut you easily they are sharp but it&#x27;s no way that you can cut your hand on this plate unless you r really just sliding them on your hands really rough. But the bad thing about these is that some of the plates look scratched and I didn&#x27;t like that but all together I really do recomend these!!</li>
            <li> This product is good for the price, but the plates are very sharp and i am a bit disappointed that there aren&#x27;t that many full nail designs... can&#x27;t beat it for the price though.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item with excitement only to be so dissapointed. These stamp disks are so razor sharp that my daughter and I were cut many times just handling them. Had to put tape around them just to use them. Even then the stamps were not deep enough for a full stamp, unless you put a lot of finger nail polish on the image you want, for it to work.</li>
            <li> When I first got these, I painted over the blue seals. I thought they didn&#x27;t work and checked the reviews for them. I finally tore off the blue seals and used them for the first time. They worked fantastic. It was a bit tedious to rip off all the seals but it was worth it! I recommend this product for anyone who wants to try it.</li>
            <li> I love these. I only had one plate that i was unhappy with. I had a very long line across the horse &amp; number plate. Other then that the rest were fine. I can&#x27;t stop playing with my nails :-D</li>
            <li> These plates are great when you want to spice up your manicure!  They are good quality and have a large variety of different designs.  It takes practice to learn how to do the stamping but it is a fun learning process and I very much enjoyed the trial and error.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the images on these plates. Fun, and clean and etched really well. A couple of plates where scratched underneath the film and one plate looked like the etching solution splattered all over it- neither of these things have effected their use. My major complaint is that I was missing a plate!!!! SH15- worst of all, I can&#x27;t even tell what images I&#x27;m missing out on. So, if anyone would be so kind as to post an image their plate SH15, I would most appreciate it. Another thing I would note is that the blue film is on BOTH sides of the plates when you receive them, I liked that precaution. I wish I could give these plate 5 stars, the images are beautiful and are sized for grown-up fingernails, but I just can&#x27;t. Missing a plate is a big let-down to me.</li>
            <li> Great plates! I do not understand why people were complaining about the blue protector they have, they are easy to take off I mean its pretty basic not complicated at all. I love the images overall great product.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time Prime service is awsome. great quality. I will keep trying and buying new Shany Products. Products are very easy to use and work perfectly for nail art.</li>
            <li> I just received these plates this afternoon.  I had no problem peeling off the blue film and the plates are not sharp at all.  It took me all of 3 minutes to put a design on my nails which did not smudge, and came out perfect.  I used regular everyday nail polish and followed the directions without over thinking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing you do have to remember is that you do not need to scrape the polish off the plate terribly hard before applying your design.  These plates also work with the Salon Express stamper, so there is no need to fret which stamper will work.  Also remember to use a rolling motion and do not just slap the stamper onto the plate, roll the stamper onto the plate with a light hand just like you would apply it to your nail.&lt;br /&gt;My next endeavor is to purchase the XXL plates, so I can do my friends nails!!!</li>
            <li> Nail art is such a HUGE trend now and these plates are an easy and inexpensive way to get in on it! They&#x27;re especially great if your hand isn&#x27;t steady enough to draw free hand and if you&#x27;re not exactly artistically inclined!</li>
            <li> My daughters and I love to explore the world of nail and makeup products. We always have a great time together while sharing new products. We can spend a whole day making each other beautiful. The NAIL Art Polish Manicure Image Plates were so much FUN. They worked perfectly, instructions were included. We applied them on acrylic nails, stick on nails and real nails. Had no problem with any of them. We applied them and finished off with a top coat to make the Pop. FUN for every day of the week.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because a friend of mine used it on me. I liked it alot so I decided to buy it for my sister who is a nail tech. She was very interested in it hope continues to enjoy it. The box was a little damaged but still usable.</li>
            <li> Great but why does it look so used up. Mine has scratches all over it. I thought the plates would be clear instead of blue. It&#x27;s kinda hard to see</li>
            <li> I just received these today and am really impressed. They were easy to unwrap, sort, and what not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, however, did not receive the instructions with them. Good thing I already know how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some scratches on a few but they don&#x27;t seem to interfere with the designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I would change is the sizes. For us with bigger and wider nails, these are really tiny. Just keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to use these you NEED the stamper and scrapper. Don&#x27;t forget.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was new when it came to using image plates, I would usually just try to use nail art to decorate my nails which was very time consuming, I just was not sure I was going to be able to get the results I wanted out of this set. But to my surprise the instructions help out alot. There were so many designs to work with I had plenty of practice.  I also got plenty of compliments on how great my nails looked. You should also pair it with Shany all in one stamper or scrapper and image plate holder, that is a must have. I brought one for my best friend on her birthday and she loves it. A great buy for all nail art designers so much to work with and it will last you awhile.</li>
            <li> Awesome tools to use for many nail designs.  Clear image and easy to use. There are many designs from which to choose from.  It&#x27;s like having your own nail salon at home.</li>
            <li> I bought these to try since for the price of less than 2 Konad plates I got 25. On the whole I&#x27;m satisfied with them. As other have mentioned, they don&#x27;t have the paper backing that the Konad plates have, so they are very sharp. You do need to be careful with them as a result.    The small images work fine, just as good as Konad images. However, the large images are too small to cover your entire nail, except the pinky. They are okay if used with two low contrast colors, but the edge of the design suddenly stopping before the end of your nail is glaringly obvious with colors that are very different from each other. The Konad plates only have 4 of these full nail designs per plate, while these have 6. It&#x27;s not worth getting two extra images when they don&#x27;t cover your nail.    These are definitely worth the $10 for all the images that do work.</li>
            <li> Comparison to Konad  -  The images are all different, none of them will overlap if you already have Konad plates.   I&#x27;ve looked at them and compared all 25 plates to the ones on the Konad site.   - quality of the patterns and image are very comparable !  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll notice a difference  - The plate itself is VERY sharp!   I would probably sand down the sides when I have time.    But I mean unless you are totally throwing them around, using them on a stable table will cause you no harm.  The Konad one is thicker and the company took more time to make sure their edges are round and nice.  - These plates do scratch easily so when I put them away I just wrap them in some napkins.  No biggie.  -  The full nail patterns do not cover all of your thumb...but with a little practice and skill you can patch up the side no problem.     That being said for 14 bucks for 25 plates ...comes about to be about $1.66 a plate!  Vs.  Konad is $6.99+shipping!    [...]  Grab them before everyone else figures it out!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have pictures on my nails!  I used cheap, thick white nail polish and globbed it onto the disc and scraped off the excess with an old gift card and used by Konad Stamper to roll the image onto my nail from the stamper and voila, amazing nails!  I even used it on my 2-year old with Piggie Paint polish to put Hello Kitty on her big toe and she is a huge fan of having kitty nails!  So great!  Also, the blue film is easy to remove, but only remove it from the side with the imprints and store each plate separately once you have removed the film so they don&#x27;t get scratched and then you can use them perfectly forever!</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to use. I never could get the design on my nails.</li>
            <li> These nail stamp discs are awesome and come with many designs.....what I didn&#x27;t like was that mine were scratched and used. it did not come with a stamp, which upset me because I paid more for this item than some other brands that did come with the stamp but it had so many designs that I had to love it!</li>
            <li> Yes, the edges are sharp, but if you&#x27;re reading all these reviews, then you&#x27;ve been plenty warned as I was, and it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic covering was easy to remove with the aid of tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product a \\&quot;meh\\&quot; because as some others reported, not all the designs are well cut - thus they do not stamp, or at least the whole design does not stamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet tried them all, but for example, the leopard print stamp worked beautifully - but many other designs don&#x27;t work, and until you know which do and don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re going to be spending a lot of time and wasted polish figuring it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I&#x27;m satisfied, because those stamps that work look very very cool! However, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend this product for someone looking to get exactly what they were promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;m not using the Konad polish. I used Sally Hansen&#x27;s Xtreme polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> These plates are easy to use. I&#x27;m so excited to be able to make so many different designs on my nails. I&#x27;m not very good at nail art....so this makes me look like an expert!!!</li>
            <li> There are some very cool designs, however some are just to big for an average finger nail, and you have to use a think polish. But once you get that hang of using them they work good</li>
            <li> I love this set of nail art plates! It&#x27;s my first time using any nail art plates, but I&#x27;m now addicted to them. I&#x27;ve heard that there are supposedly better brands of plates, but I don&#x27;t even feel the need to search for others, because Shany did a great job with these ones, and at an amazing price too! I love them, and will continue to use them &amp; recommend them to others looking to try easy nail art. My friends and family are amazed by how easy it is to have such beautiful nails too! :)</li>
            <li> I just got my plates. Many of them has a lot of scratches but i guess is ok, i have nooo idea how to use it i was hoping that it came with an instruction cause here says it does but i didnt get mine, i also bought the stamper so PLEASE can someone reply me how to use it i would be greatful Thank you (Please excuse my writing skills in English :p)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: nevermind i just found a Video on youtube :D</li>
            <li> I have Konad and bundle monster plates which are awesome.  I decided to try Shany because I liked the images. However, some of the images just don&#x27;t come out. The big images are fine but NOT the small detailed one.  The glue on the protective plastic also stayed stuck on the plates and I had to scrub a few of them with nail polish remover in order to get the glue out.  After cleaning them well - the small detailed images still did not come out.  That&#x27;s why &#x27;reviews&#x27; are so important. I would NOT recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received the package for these plates.  The designs are not similar to any other plates I have purchased and I just love all the designs. I can pick up the designs with the stamp and everything but the plate itself... Well, I&#x27;ve cut myself a couple of times already. I thought I was the only one who has this problem but after reading other reviews, I don&#x27;t feel as stupid. And looking at other brands, other brands&#x27; plates are thick and less dangerous. I was going to give a couple of the Shany&#x27;s plate to my niece but after getting cuts with these plates, I will not be giving them to her or recommending her or anyone to buy it.  Until this is fixed. I suggest Shany makes their plates thicker or maybe dull up the edges. Oh, these cuts weren&#x27;t like paper cuts. The cut were actually deep.</li>
            <li> the plates were not engraved deep so alot of the images did not work. I wouldnt recommend I was so excited to order them and totally bummed out when we used them and my daughter cut herself with them they are sharp</li>
            <li> I really love my Shany 2012 Nail Art Polish Stamo Manicure Image Plates! I was a little bummed when they first arrived because I figured the plates with naturally come with the scraper and stamper. But I called up a friend and I have been using hers and with some practice and online tutorials (and peeling of the blue colored plastic) I am beginning to finally master the art of nail stamping! I really love how many plates came in this package. I have seen individual plates from other companies for almost $10 for one plate!?! The images are really nice and even have some holiday images in there too. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using these plates and learning how to use them properly so you get a nice result for your nails. For any of the ones that state these plates are no good or not worth the money need to take in to consideration that Nail art stamping is an art and takes time to learn. Its not that the product, or plates are no good, it could be your stamper or your technique. Mine are beginning to work really nice for me so I have to say Shany Cosmetics holds true to their motto or providing professional products at a extremely lower cost! Thank you!</li>
            <li> i really like this manicure plates, they are so easy to use and you don&#x27;t have to buy the konad one. This is just perfect and cheaper too.</li>
            <li> fast delivery came in a couple of days earlier. I been doing my own nails for a long time and the first time I can decorat them so easy and fast and with so much selection you just want to change it over n over agagin to see how everything going to look and trust me they all beautiful and unique :) the Plates are amazing you got everything that you want n need for your nails design :) and the price is just great and worth it!</li>
            <li> i just got these today and have only tried a few of the stamps, the kite, anchor and one of the random patterns.&lt;br /&gt;like most reviewers said the sides of the plates are sharp but if you know this going in they aren&#x27;t that hard to handle.&lt;br /&gt;if i hadn&#x27;t tried the konad plates in the past i would say that these plates aren&#x27;t bad for the money but being able to compare the two there is a HUGE difference. with the konad plates you can almost always get a good transfer on your first attempt. with these plates even the simplest designs (there really isn&#x27;t much to the anchor or kite) take multiple, frustrating attempts to get the full image on the stamper.&lt;br /&gt;i would guess that these plates aren&#x27;t cut deep enough or very consistently. the designs are tiny too. i have pretty small hands and the anchor barely takes up a quarter of my nail.&lt;br /&gt;i also have to say that the designs aren&#x27;t that up to date. (there are a lot of 90&#x27;s tattoo flash inspired tribal flowers.)&lt;br /&gt;i suppose that had i been paying better attention to the photos i would have noticed this but i was too excited about the amount of designs i was getting for the price.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t think this was a complete waste of money because i haven&#x27;t tried them all and there are enough options that even if only a few turn out ok i&#x27;ll be happy with my purchase, so for now i&#x27;m on the fence.&lt;br /&gt;i will say that i&#x27;ll probably suck it up and pay the $7 for a few konad plates because i know how awesome they turn out.&lt;br /&gt;also, i didn&#x27;t get a plate with the pot leaf and i was relieved after reading that a few people got duplicates of that particular design. (maybe they realized it&#x27;s tacky and stopped making it?)&lt;br /&gt;basically, prepare to not be amazed. your nails probably aren&#x27;t going to be anything to brag about BUT it&#x27;s better than free handing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE****&lt;br /&gt;Though we&#x27;ve all been adequately warned about the sides of the plates being sharp I got too comfy &amp; careless while I was cleaning one.&lt;br/&gt;I cut my finger so badly that I probably should have gotten stitches. This was the deepest, most bloody cut I&#x27;ve ever had in my life and it scared the S**T out of me.&lt;br /&gt;I read one review that said they&#x27;ve changed the plates and they are no longer sharp on the edges. I hope that&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;Be SUPER SUPER careful if you have the older plates. (I got mine in April 12)&lt;br /&gt;I had been using mine for a few months before I cut myself.</li>
            <li> I got these plates today in the mail, very fast shipping, and they are just great!! I love the large veriety of designs that each plate has to offer and all the different themes they cover. There is a plate and a design for everything! They have the cutest images and my favorite stars! Great deal for your money to! :D!</li>
            <li> Image plates were easy to use and had a variety of images on them which could be easily mixed and matched. The prints varied in size and could be used for both manicures and pedicures alike. No matter how much the scraper scratched the plates, the images were not damaged in any way. Cleaning of the plates with nail polish remover couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li> Spent 3 hours trying to ge the Shany stamper and these plates to work. Took off the blue covering; used the stamping polish-could never get the stencil to transfer onto the stamper let along my nail; what a time-consuming mess and waste. I was very disappointed since I love nail art.</li>
            <li> Great, it was a gift, and  it  was  a hit.</li>
            <li> The designs on these plates are very cute.  However, I only received 24 plates; eleven of those were duplicates.  The plates&#x27; diameters are not consistent and the edges on some are rough.</li>
            <li> After reading the negative reviews about how difficult it is to remove the blue film and how easy it is to cut yourself, I was worried about buying these; but I found one review that seemed to suggest that they had fixed the problem, so I figured I&#x27;d gamble.  Well it definitely paid off.  The blue film, which is now on both sides, is super easy to remove, and I couldn&#x27;t cut myself on these if I tried.  All the stamp are cute and most of them come out perfectly.  One caveat...I can&#x27;t get the normal French tip image to work, even with the Konad special polish.  C&#x27;est la vie, the one French tip made of dots is way cuter.</li>
            <li> These nail plates are so much fun!  Don&#x27;t have to go to the salon to get salon quality nail art.  There are so many images to choose from for any occasion. I have the hardest time figuring out which one to use because there are so many super cute designs!  Very easy to use, just be sure to use a thicker polish.  Shipping was super fast.  Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I love these!  Several different designs to choose from, very well made plates. Plates seem thicker than ones I&#x27;ve seen before, so it was easy to peel off the plastic and not have to worry about cutting myself.  I&#x27;ve use a few to test them out and so far they are fantastic!  No smudging or blurry lines so far with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend these to anyone wanting to add nice plates to their collection! They are worth the price, which is quite affordable. : )  I can&#x27;t wait to try out all the designs!!</li>
            <li> The plates are wonderful, I haven&#x27;t had a problem at all. They have a wide selection of designs and are a really great deal.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that a couple of the individual designs showed up on another plate, so I actually have two of them, but it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want nail plates? Buy these!!</li>
            <li> I love the plates there are several different designs with 25 plates, they are easy to use and a great price</li>
            <li> Peel the plastic off the plates first.  Lesson learned.  After that, I had no issue stamping away!</li>
            <li> arrived on time and in great condition. lots of fun to use and to share with friends and family. we have nail parties and have a blast.</li>
            <li> More waste of money. Too difficult to use. Wasted polish and I bought the correct stamping polish. Used 1/2 bottle of acetone removing the mess! Furious.</li>
            <li> what a deal!! great price for the amount of plates, very fast Delivery! Just love the plates they are Awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;very fast Delivery!  love it !!  got 3 for friends for christmas</li>
            <li> These are great stamps, I was a little hesitant buying these after all the negative comments. They come in a small package covered with a very thin blue film. I knew from other comments the film had to be taken off, it was quite difficult for some of the plates but after the film was removed the plates were shiny and looked great. They work well with regular nail polish although it can come out on the light side.</li>
            <li> this is the first set of plates that i bought and they are in perfect condition i didn&#x27;t get any repeats which i&#x27;m very happy about..the designs are very cute :):):)</li>
            <li> They work great and what an amazing price for so many plates. Edges may be a little sharp but can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> I picked up my first stamping plate from wal-mart because I wanted a preview before getting these. I was really disappointed with the one I got from walmart. The etching just wasn&#x27;t good enough to hold the polish so that I could stamp the images. I was starting to get worried that these would be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so relieved that they work so great. One of the draws was that there was a lot of different designs. So far I&#x27;ve played around with 5 or 6 of the plates mixing and matching and I&#x27;m extremely pleased! I&#x27;m still excited to see what other ideas I can come up with from the other plates as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pictures are exactly what the product was which is also a huge plus. When I first ordered I was really hoping that cat and paw prints were in the bundle and they were! I love this and I&#x27;ll be ordering more as well as suggesting this product to friends!</li>
            <li> I received my plates almost a week earlier than the delivery date. When I received them they were in great shape and work perfectly. I&#x27;m very glad I chose this brand.</li>
            <li> I received all 25 plates,sh01 to sh25. And I received them on the expected shipping date with free 2 day shipping. Keep in mind that I have used regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Full nail designs is a good size and fits on all my nails( even my thumb)&lt;br /&gt;Great variety of designs&lt;br /&gt;Now is a backing&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Some times the lines arent crisp and are smudged&lt;br /&gt;Full nail designs seemed cramped and don&#x27;t always turn out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it is worth the money and a good product? I am only giving it three stars because of the smudged lines, but I will try with stamping nail polish</li>
            <li> I love all the different designs on the plates I purchased.  25 plates provide a wide variety of design options for my manicures and they are super easy to use.  Love this so much!</li>
            <li> Purchased the set based on it being a damaged box, which was fine because I don&#x27;t care about the box I care about the contents, I received them on the date specified. I dont know why people complain about getting cut and so forth, I peeled all the blue off the tops only, i left the back cover on so it doesnt get scratched when ontop of one another. So far it works great, I&#x27;m waiting on my konad stamper to come, which i hope is tomorrow, but i used an eraser top to see if it would catch the image and it did. So if it could catch using an eraser top, im sure itll do wonders with an actual stamper. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Cute and stamp perfectly</li>
            <li> I purchased these plates over a year ago after I learned about Konad Nail Art. I figured these plates would be my  \\&quot; beginner \\&quot; plates to help me master Konad at a \\&quot;NOT SO KONAD\\&quot; price. And now, a year and a half later I continue using these image plates because they are just that great!!!  However, the designs that are supposed to fit your \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; DON&#x27;T FIT ,(well unless you have extremely small nail beds).&lt;br /&gt;  I unfortunately don&#x27;t have small nail beds, so what I do is that I only do half of my nail and make it seem intentional, at a diagonal or horizontal, I have gotten a lot of complements with my half designs. :)&lt;br /&gt;  I love love love this product , the only thing that I \\&quot; HATED \\&quot;!! was that I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be that sharp so as i peeled off the clear plastic, I was left with many cuts!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase!  I love the designs and they work just as well as that very expensive $6 per plate brand.  I do think it would be nice if they put a backing on the plates, but for this price, it&#x27;s so not a big deal.  I added a backing myself by cutting out scrap cardstock paper and taping it onto the back with 2-sided tape.  There is a tutorial on YouTube if you want to search for it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work like the others I own the design is very hard to get a clean picture. This is not the sellers fault by any means.</li>
            <li> Delivery time on these plates was very fast.  They were well packaged and arrived in excellent condition.  I do have to agree that these plates are sharp, very VERY sharp and they have no backing on them which makes them even harder to handle safely.  The blue protective coverings  were harder to remove than on other sets I&#x27;ve purchased.  Here is what I did.  I soaked the plates briefly in hot water to loosen the plastic, then using an emory board to grab an edge of the blue plastic I was able to pull it away from the edge of the disk and remove it smoothly in one piece. The plates were then carefully dried.  Without the hot water soak and emory board I would have shredded my fingers trying to remove that blue plastic. Be careful handling these plates they really are sharp but the designs are great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product since it had good reviews. It had a 4.5 stars rating at the time of purchase. Boy, are these reviews misleading. I tried them out when I got them and they DO NOT WORK. Either I do not know how to use these properly or they stink. The scraper does not scrape off all the excess nail polish, and the stampers sucks as well. I am so disappointed in this item. Save your money and spend it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Really loved this item. It came with alot of plates to choose from and they were all in great condition. Great seller!</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased  NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit (they are no longer available)&lt;br /&gt;They are the same idea...&lt;br /&gt;You can use regular nail polish to get the design.&lt;br /&gt;I use an old giftcard to scrape the excess polish off of  the plate and I use the [[ASIN:B005V2LLXC MASH Double Sided Nail Plate Art Stamp and Scraper (Special Introductory Price)]] and not the scraper that is included with it to apply the designs to my nails.&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of cute designs in this set but the major issue with this set is, more than half of the designs were not engraved deep enough for the design to imprint on the stamper.&lt;br /&gt;The larger full nail designs are good though, I did not have issues with those at all. They are bigger so the design fully fits my thumb nail, which is awesome! But I was a bit disappointed that so many of the smaller and cute designs I could not use.&lt;br /&gt;Seems these are made cheaper and not etched as deep so that the designs are not coming thru.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried pratically all the designs - even ones i wouldnt normally wear- but they are not etched on the plate deep enough for the design to actually show up.&lt;br /&gt;I do not think I would purchase this set again because although the bigger designs I like, it was just not worth it for so many unusable designs.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldve given 2 stars but the large designs I like a lot so I gave it 3/5</li>
            <li> I ordered these before reading the reviews.  After reading the reviews I was worried about the quality of these plates.  I tried them out, and I&#x27;m quite pleased with them.  1) Yes, getting the protective blue film off is not the easiest thing in the world, but with patience it does come off.  Don&#x27;t just tear at it.  Peel it up from the edge carefully.  Once you have enough to get a grip on, peel it off the rest slowly.  It will come off.  2) One of the other reviewers went commented about how she had tiny hands and how the whole nail designs were just too small to cover her whole finger nails.  I have regular sized hands and naturally long nails.  Most of the whole nail designs are plenty big to cover my nails.  Only some of them are too short to cover end to end on my nails.  My longest nails are about 3/4 inch long right now.  3) As some other reviewers have stated, the edges are SHARP.  After comparing the SHANY plates to my Konad plates, it isn&#x27;t because the SHANY plates are any thinner.  The problem is that the edges of each plate were never buffed smooth after they were punched out of the sheet of metal.  I think I&#x27;m going to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; this by putting a large label on the back and cutting around the edge of the plate.  That should cover the sharp edges and prevent any slicing of fingers.  A couple other notes.  I think these are a great value for the money.  Lots of nice designs.  I&#x27;m really liking the french manicure designs.  MUCH less expensive than the Konad plates.  The edges are sharp enough that without the blue film on the plates, I don&#x27;t want to stack the plates as I&#x27;m afraid the sharp edges of the plate on top will scratch the surface of the plate below.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive my image plates and at the price for 25 of them, it was a steal. Now, I think I realize why the plates were so cheap - they were scratched. And I don&#x27;t mean just a few little scratches here and there, I mean all over scratches as if they were used or just simply not taken care of. I will be able to use most of the plates but some may give me trouble due to the scratches. I hope this is not the case for other buyers.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Made of good material, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. This i recommend.</li>
            <li> When I first discovered nail art stamping, I watched a bunch of YouTube videos to learn about it.  Konad is the &#x27;big brand&#x27; but they were too pricey for me.  After reading a lot of reviews I decided to give these a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of something I saw on a YouTube review, I did get the Konad stamper and scraper (it was only $4.50 here at Amazon) to use with the plates.  I recommend that combination.  Everything worked great and I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a huge variety of images, some smaller, some larger, so there should be something for everyone. Flowers, butterflies and nature; abstract, geometric; beach themed stuff, holidays; small, medium and whole nail designs.  Plenty to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I uploaded an image for this product showing my first manicure using them, so you can see how clearly they stamp.  Really, the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice - they&#x27;re much more clear and sharp in person.  (edit - when I uploaded my image I didn&#x27;t realize there were *so* many others of the same thing ... but it&#x27;s there anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some of the smaller images I had a little trouble getting them centered.  But, (a) I suspect that&#x27;ll get easier with practice (I was kind of excited and rushed through it a little), and (b) I just added some dots with a toothpick to balance it out, and liked the effect so much I may do it on purpose in the future.  You can see what I mean in the picture I uploaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Wet-n-Wild 99 cent nail polish to stamp with, so no need to buy the pricey specialty stuff, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some of the YouTube reviews people said the edges were very sharp.  I didn&#x27;t experience this problem.  Another reviewer here said they have corrected that issue, and perhaps that&#x27;s it.  I mean, they are metal disks.  Common sense will go a long way with this.  ;o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled.  A real bargain.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add:  after I published this review, I was looking through some of theothers, and was surprised at how many people complained the images were too small.  I have fat fingers and large fingernails, and I had no trouble finding images to fit fine.  I guess the only way you might have an issue is if your nails were very *long* and you wanted to cover the whole nail ... the plates have lots of wide images, but nothing exceptionally long.  There are ways to double stamp to cover a long nail ... I&#x27;m sure it would take lots of practice, but I&#x27;ve seen it done (on YouTube).  But unless you have exceptionally long nails, you won&#x27;t have any trouble finding images to fit.</li>
            <li> I bet if I used these they would be cool.</li>
            <li> I really like these plates. There are so many designs to choose from.  There are accent designs, French tip designs, full nail designs, etc.  The only beef I would have is that some of the designs are so close together that it is hard to scrape off the excess polish without getting it on another design and accidentally picking it up with the design you intended to get.  Very important, remember to remove the thin layer of plastic from over the plate before trying to stamp it.  I&#x27;m just saying, some people don&#x27;t know to do that!!!</li>
            <li> PASE DOS HORAS TRATANDO DE USAR ESTE ARTICULO Y SOLO ME FUNCIONARON LOS SEIS PLATOS QUE TRAJO EL SALON EXPRESS, USE VARIOS Y CUANDO NO PEGABA EL DISEÑO A MITAD ERA QUE SENCILLAMENTE NO PEGABA NADA...NO SIRVE DE HECHO NI MEDIA ESTRELLA LE DARIA...</li>
            <li> I just got the Image Plates, and I am extremely pleased with the product and the service.  I was supposed to get them next week and to my surprise I got them today!</li>
            <li> I got the plates. One side is a mirror. The other side is a shiny blue with the designs. It was strached up and the designs are flat. Not all of them, the ones that have a little raised I get is a flag- box like shape. I will not even send this back. Why. It was messed up really bad when they sent it to me. Never would I get my monies back. To they would just repackage and send to someone else. This product fails. By the way I bought it from Amazon in March 2012 shipped with Eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping from SHANY Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> After buying so many nail polishes I wanted to get something that would help me create cute designs to complete my manicure. I purchased stickers but didn&#x27;t do any justice and would peel off easily. So I decided to give this a try. I purchased these plates including the Shany Stamping Nail Art set which is separate. Once they came in I was thrilled to try it. The plates have a wide variety of designs which can be used for different occasions! So awesome! No more spending money at the nail salon for a complete manicure! Kudos Shany Cosmetics!</li>
            <li> I am awful at doing my own nails, and new to stamping, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare these with. But They look good, and I&#x27;ve been able to stamp a few designs without making an awful mess of it. I think I need more practice, any problems I have had using these plates is all me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good deal over all, at this price I don&#x27;t mind if I am not so good at using them, it was worth it just to try them. Even if you don&#x27;t do your nails that often it&#x27;s a good set to have on hand. Very fun, I bet kids would have a blast with this.</li>
            <li> Hard to maneuver the stamps around and get in right place very easy. Average polish quality. The concept is good.</li>
            <li> these look like a fun and easy way to make my nails stand out an look unique. I love shany products and have had an over all good experience with them. I would definitively love to try this product!</li>
            <li> I have been looking at these for a while now and they look beautiful. I have not purchased these but have keap coming back to look at the designs and have been thinking of purchasing these. currently I own another brands image plates and I&#x27;ve been looking for some more and these just seem perfect. You get 25 image plates for a really good price and I think thats what keeps me coming back to this and thinking about purchasing.</li>
            <li> Saw a similar product in Florida on vacation, but they wanted around $50 for way less plates. I got this in the mail super fast and absolutely love the designs included on the plates, there&#x27;s a ton of them! I wish they would have actually included the directions though because if I hadn&#x27;t already seen someone else do these on my nails I would have been totally lost.</li>
            <li> I have been doing manicures for years by myself using products from the grocery store, and I must say that these are the best stamps I have ever used.  They definately look like they were made by a pro at a salon at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister as a gift and she loved it! I also tried it and it is a very good product! Very fun!</li>
            <li> i am in love with these. i am actually ordering more disc because i am so happy with this. they are like pokemon gotta get em all</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this item, so when I did it was a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;All the metal discs were scattered throughout the box. The discs are heavily scratched &amp; marred.they seem used products!!!!!!!!and the images are not sharp when stamped,some of the images just don&#x27;t come out.&lt;br /&gt;really bad product</li>
            <li> I am a newbie to nail stamping and was looking for some image plates to try, after doing some research I decided to buy the SHANY 2012 Nail Art Polish Stamp Manicure Image Plates set of 25 pcs w/ Instruction, mainly because of the price.  I am extremely glad that I purchased these, and plan on buying more SHANY products in the near future. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because I did not receive the Instructions, other then that I would highly recommend these Image plates to anyone interested in nail stamping.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Shany stamping plates to give the nail art trend a try. I received them super fast and I like that they came in a box to protect them. A few of the images work with my Konad polish and a few don&#x27;t. Overall for the price I paid it&#x27;s not bad. I wish they came with a better selection instead of flowers and holiday themed stamps.</li>
            <li> I got these to start my nail art collection, and I must say I am loving them. I got them fast. I believe that they are just as good as Konad, but a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Absoluetly love this product, I would tell anyone about it. It&#x27;s so easy to use and at first I wasn&#x27;t to sure about it but I tried it and I will be always having my nails on point!</li>
            <li> Okay... I was one of those who got suckered into buying a Konad Nail Stamping kit at the mall. I am lucky that I chose a medium kit for $40+ that came with only 3 Konad plates. I came home and found this deal (too good to be true???) - but since it only costs 11.99 ( price of 1 Konad plate is $6.99!) for 25 plates, I figured that even if I got 2 good plates, it would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived within 3 days and I used it right away. I used the Konad polishes and the images are great. The smaller, detailed ones (like Hello Kitty) does not come easily onto the stamper. I read that if you slightly buff your stamper, it makes images connect better onto it. The large, full nail images were a breeze to use and were beautiful. I actually experimented between my 3 Konad plates &amp; the Shany ones and I could not tell the difference in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edges were sharp, but I had metal sand paper handy, so I just filed the edges quickly as I took them out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage Tip: use a baseball card sleeve! 3 of them will fit 27 plates easily and you can see what you have, instead of shuffling through. Also, buy the Shany stamper/scraper/plate holder set. It was great to have this as an extra for a friend to use (I think it is about $5).&lt;br /&gt;Someone commented on the blue plastic film being hard to remove - my 5 year old daughter helped me take them off - I appreciated them being on so the plates weren&#x27;t scratched up. Overall, this package is a STEAL! I cannot wait for the 2013 designs! I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I have ordered from Shany before and have always been pleased with the product. Fast shipping! I love the variety of designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t receive any duplicates numbers SH 1-25.</li>
            <li> The designs are a little too generic. Zodiacs, Christmas trees, letters etc. Its not for experienced nail stampers as the designs are too simple.</li>
            <li> Just got these today and used them immediately!  I love the designs and you can use regular polish on the templates. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of comments about taking the film off of the plates, and I found it easiest to take my finger and just slide up on the edge. I did not get cut. The edges were not sharp. It gave me a starting point to pull from and ended up taking me about twenty minutes to remove them all. Very happy</li>
            <li> Some of the patterns work great and some are not engraved well, I have learned to test the stamp before applying it to nails because some wont work one side of them always seems to not pick up. Our box had a photo of a disc that had a stamp that looked like Hello Kitty and we were excited about that only to find it was not included. Also they are very soft metal that scratches easily just from handling them so I do not think they would last with professional use.</li>
            <li> I love the 2012 nail art polish stamp manicure image plates. They are easy to use and they stamp well.</li>
            <li> The designs fit my nails but I wish there was more full nail designs then just random little designs :)</li>
            <li> I was excited when i got this and well i just love using this product i love all these designs and am just thrilled to have this and thankful for Shany for getting these amazing plates and for a low price:)</li>
            <li> Just got them few days ago ,, the product has a high quality and lot of shapes variations with an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product &amp; Of course i would recommend this for a friend!!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004DK0UDA SHANY 2012 Nail Art Polish Stamp Manicure Image Plates set of 25pcs]]I found these so easy and fun to use. they arrived very promptly and I had to try them out</li>
            <li> I keep seeing people having issues with the plastic cover and sharp edges, but I have had no problems. The plastic come off easy, and if I leave the back coating on the edges aren&#x27;t sharp at all. The images look awesome and I am so excited to use these tonight after work!</li>
            <li> For 12 bucks this is a great deal even if I&#x27;m not able to use most of the full nail sized images since my nail beds are long and slender and the images do not cover my full nail. All of the single sized smaller images work well (the ones I have tried- lol). The hello kitty one stamps really light, so you can not see it.</li>
            <li> i love this product so much! there great designs and so easy to use and clean! great for anyone who likes to do nails!</li>
            <li> If you love decorating your nails, this is a must.  Its simple to use and you can use any type of nail polishes with the stamp kit..Its a great way to change your designs without going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Product was like image. Package protected the product from damage so it arrived perfect. I love the images and am very excited to use them. So simple to use. THANKS again and will do business again</li>
            <li> I had not real high expectation for these as I am not a nail artist....I bought these to use for my daughter&#x27;s birthday \\&quot;lil girls nite in\\&quot; sleepover!  We played with these all night and we had a blast!!!  I can&#x27;t speak from a professional view, but I can say they made my lil ladies happy!</li>
            <li> I am not the most artistic person ever, but this set lets me have all those fun nail designs without breaking the bank to pay someone to do it!</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical at furst cause of the quantity you get. Didnt think they would work. But they are awsome. My str loves them and they r so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Ok so this was the first nail stamping plate set I&#x27;ve bought and was really hoping to get the leopard design on my nails. I watched a product review on YouTube by soguesswhat11 {LOVE HER CHANNEL}...anywho plate sh25 was missing when I got my set which from the video was the one plate I REALLY wanted. I got two of plate sh23, which I&#x27;ll probably give away. Other than that I have no complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> For this many plates and stamps, it is so affordable and such a good price! You have a huge selection of stamps to chose from, too.</li>
            <li> I got these in the mail on time all 25 in a nice box to keep them in, when I opened it up the plates appeared blue and scratched. The scratch part was disappointing but I thought whatever I just need the design so I used my Konad stamping materials and none of the stamp came on. I wanted to leave a complaint on here saying well this was a waste of money. Before doing so I looked at one of the comments and saw someone say you have to rip off the blue cover! That&#x27;s it lol I thought I was screwd :). So, this is a perfect investment I would say. A million times cheaper then buying the plate from a Konad place for 30 bucks when here you can get everything from your home and cheap. Recommended, and if having troubles keep at it. :)</li>
            <li> Hours of fun - hours of nail art.&lt;br /&gt;So many designs!&lt;br /&gt;My girls (all three of them) LOVE them!&lt;br /&gt;A lot of great choices to suit any style.</li>
            <li> they work well, but not the best designs imo</li>
            <li> Doesnt work for me. hardly ever able to get an impression onto my nails</li>
            <li> Cute have to learn how to do a better job but other than that its ok I love the designs and the packaging was great</li>
            <li> These nail art image plates are loaded with FABULOUS designs...zodiac, floral, holiday, geometric, you name it!  I will be purchasing more of these as gifts in the future!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this buy. You get what you pay for and for this money you can get something much better at the dollar store!!</li>
            <li> I was so happy when these arrived; cute designs, great packaging, easy to use (with the Konad stamper and scraper I also bought, based on the reviews). Some of the designs I will probably never use, but there are plenty to like in this pack, and at a good price (the Konad stamping plates by comparison cost an arm and a leg). My only complaint here is that some of the square whole-nail designs are not large enough to cover my whole thumb nail in one go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use these stamping plates:&lt;br /&gt;1. Have a stamper and scraper ready.&lt;br /&gt;2. Remove the blue film on the stamping plate.&lt;br /&gt;3. Place the plate on a paper towel or other surface you can clean the nail polish off of.&lt;br /&gt;4. Paint the design you want with the desired nail polish color.&lt;br /&gt;5. Working quickly before it dries, drag the scraper across the design to remove the excess polish and let the excess wipe off on the paper towel. The remaining image should be crisp.&lt;br /&gt;6. Carefully roll the stamper across the design to pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;7. This is the tricky part; press the corner of the design gently onto your nail and, also gently, roll the stamper across the surface of the nail to deposit the whole design. This part may take some practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some of the larger images, I have had trouble getting them to deposit smoothly across the nail, so I am going to try making some &amp;#34;nail stickers&amp;#34; with them. For nail stickers, I paint some clear polish on some plastic, stamp the design on top, and then peel off the polish to make a &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; that I can apply to my nail. I haven&#x27;t tried this yet, so I can&#x27;t say how well this works, but might be worth a shot if you are having difficulties. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I ordered these plates, however, when I got them in the mail they were not the same plates that I had ordered, so I had to return them.  I&#x27;m too scared to try to purchase them again.  It&#x27;s a shame, because I was really looking forward to using them.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Good job!!!! Nice product and service. I highly recommend it! My wife love it.</li>
            <li> They arrived today.  I have only stored them away in their new case.  The plates look great, no scratches.  However they are thin and the edges are not so smooth so be careful.  Other than that, I cannot wait to use them.  The handy scraper included is a nice touch.  I have not noticed any repeat plates.  If I do, they will just be a gift to someone.  I will update if using the plates present a problem.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a great variety of designs on these plates!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of every single one of them!&lt;br /&gt;But for the most part I really really like the designs!&lt;br /&gt;They were protected with the blue plastic things so there were no scratches on your plates!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> These are great and work so well. A great assortment of designs and themes to choose from. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Our granddaughters love to paint their nails, and we thought that this would take it to a new level.  They love the designs.</li>
            <li> A lot of options. nice little box to store all the plates.  must have for people that use nail stamplers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small these plates were when I ordered them.  I was very disappointed, I can still use all of them as tip decor and the single designs (flower, skull, ect).  The plates themselves work AMAZING, just very sad how small they are.  Great size for my daughter&#x27;s hands though! lol</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a cousin, she loves it. Gives her a lot of options to play with her fingernails... The image plates are very thin, could get easily damaged...</li>
            <li> This was an excellent value for the price, there are so many designs to choose from!  Very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> Not that easy to use. I don&#x27;t think I received the desired results.</li>
            <li> Allows me to add artistry to my nails without paying a high price in a salon. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Well, the title sums it up pretty well. The product itself is great. The cut out images are fantastic. The main problem I have with this product is that it has some scratches on the plates. The cut out images are fine, and the scratches on the metal plates don&#x27;t effect the design when you paint your nails, but for a product in new condition to come with a bunch of scratches? Personally I think that it should not have scratches, but it works and I love the designs&lt;3 so I can live with it :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to do fancy designs on my girls nails.  It worked well enough to use over and over.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to leave an updated review. I was skeptical about ordering these plates because of the more negative reviews but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot because of the price. I AM SO HAPPY I DID! The plates are amazing! I&#x27;m assuming Shany has addressed a lot of the issues because I have not had a problem removing the blue plastic covering. I also have NOT had a problem with the edges being sharp at all, which was one of my main concerns. The edges are smooth and I even ran my thumb back and forth along the edge. NO cuts. There is also a protective blue backing that helps. All the images look clear and seem to be of the same quality as Konad. I would encourage anyone who is on the fence about ordering to give these plates a shot. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use with the konad nail system. I used nail polish from Five Below (funky fingers) and as long as the lighter color is on top it shows up great!</li>
            <li> Totally unsure how to use this product. When I ordered it, I was under the impression it coild be used with Salon Express Nail Kit. However I have ordered and have not yet to receive Salin Express. I don&#x27;t believe this will work with Salon Express so I believe it was a waste of money for my purchase. Unsure how to return, don&#x27;t have packagage.</li>
            <li> you get a big assortment of designs here! much cheaper then konad plates.  also the edges are not sharp like other brands and there is a backing to them so they are not just a plate of metal!!  stamps come out solid and clear. i can&#x27;t wait to order some of the other plate sets they have to offer.</li>
            <li> Love these plates! My daughter and I have been using them for yrs! Most of the designs transfer cleanly to the nail. I have a few Konad Plates, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat these.</li>
            <li> Great my wife loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally inexpensive for the value you obtain for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very smart purchase, I hope we can do business in future</li>
            <li> These stamp well, design wise there isnt anything super great here but the plates themselves are made well and do stamp well enough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to use, but I&#x27;m trying.</li>
            <li> Happy to have options when it comes to nails! Every client is looking for something different and I want to be able to offer it to them. Love this and the options it gives me!</li>
            <li> These things are crap. They don&#x27;t come with a stamper so you have to buy one. I purchased Salon Express from my local store and I was happy. But, come to find out they do only work together on some plates! I have a really hard time getting an image too no matter what end of my stamper I use. Then on to of that, it says works great with nail art polish on the stamper box. Yet my nail polish is actually titled Nail Art and most of the time the poilish dries up before it can even get on my finger! Im happy with the designs yet upset that I can&#x27;t use them all.</li>
            <li> it has a ton of designs! my daughter really liked it i hope she uses all of these designs&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried stamping my nails.  These Plates are great.  So many designs to choose from - which was the hardest part about the whole process.</li>
            <li> i did get it fairly fast, but some of the stamps don&#x27;t work properly, i did work with it for hrs making sure it wasn&#x27;t just me, even went to forums reading different ways, and tips to make sure it will work if you are having problems. i havent tried out all of them yet, but have tryed out several. the spider webs are missing chunks at the center of each web. which didnt even realized till after trying to stamp it. and seen everything but the centers came out right,. the smiley face has a hole in one of the eyes, and the one with waving lines, looking one the center of it i couldn&#x27;t get no matter how many times i tried. i did love the weeds one but seemed to work best for me with a thinner polish. they scratch sooo easily that its ridiculous. i even been using a plastic card to take care because of people warning about the metal scraper being bad for them, yeah, they still scratch. i originally planned on ordering more after my next paycheck, but now i&#x27;m really paranoid about purchasing them. in case you guys think it was me too.. i did end up buffering the stamp. i did try with thick and thin polishes, even some that were pretty average. did swipe card at an angle, and on a flat surface. made sure to try different speeds and different amount of polish on the stamp. like i said though, some of them did work and turned out really good. but the fact that some of them were messed up and and missing chunks is why i rated this a two. probably was my fault though for having high expectations. WAS really excited to get this product. also was the first for me also.</li>
            <li> These designs are really tiny.  The all-over designs don&#x27;t come close to covering my nail.  There are others that are jumbo size, and some blogs have scale drawings of all the brands of nail stamps.  So just be aware that these may not work for you.  I bought this set for one design, so I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise I found these to be very close to the first brand I had purchased.  It was an excellent price for the large assortment of designs. I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> it is a nice product. i just need time to do it. Sometimes some of the design dont work or maybe the polish i am using should be different.. anyway it&#x27;s ok for me.</li>
            <li> I received the nail art and they were not in a plastic packaging as seen in the pictures. They came in the box but when you open it, there was a circle cut out where all 25 nail stamping plates were. Very nice packaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read some reviews on how the blue paper lining was difficult to remove - and it was. Not sure if it applies for all nail stamping plates but it took a while. One plate had pieces of the blue lining stuck on it. I tried to stamp some of the images right after removing the plastic but it did not turn out that well. REMEMBER TO WIPE IT DOWN WITH ACETONE TO REMOVE THE GLUE FROM THE LINING. The images turned out MUCH better after I took time to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a Konad stamper and scraper and it turned out great! Very easy. However, I noticed that the scraper I used scratched up the plates a bit. But that is not the plates fault. It does not affect the images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried all the images but the ones I did try - they turned out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - very happy with this product. :)</li>
            <li> Does not come with stamp or scraper. Even after purchasing these other items separately, these were impossible to use. Messy, irritating, and non-functional.</li>
            <li> I received the product today and I was so disappointed about it. It said including 25pc,but I only received 24pc. What&#x27;s worse,Cellophane packaging inside box was ripped open. All the metal discs were scattered throughout the box. The discs are heavily scratched &amp; marred. They seem used products!!! At least two disc also had some obscure brown substance stuck to it. I must return this damaged and defective product.</li>
            <li> I ordered these plates on December 20 and received them a couple of days later and I was delighted and surprised to receive them so quickly. The plates were in great condition. I have read a few complaints about a brown substance, I had a little on one of my plates that peeled away with the plastic. A bit of residue from the manufacturing process, I figure. No biggie. They certainly weren&#x27;t used or dirty. These plates are a bit sharp around the edges, be careful when handling them. While I was removing the plastic I used a fine diamond foot file to smooth the edges and make them safer and more comfortable to use. These plates work great. I get sharp, crisp images from them and I am happy with them.    I am not, however, happy with the distributor, Shany. The set of plates I received was short two plates. I sent two e-mails to the distributor asking that they send me my missing plates and they have refused to even acknowledge my e-mails. Amazon offered to make it right by offering me a small refund. Good for Amazon. Not so much for Shany. I am keeping the plates because I like them and I can live without the two missing plates. But you may rest assured that I will not be purchasing any more items from Shany in the future. Customer service matters, just as much as quality of items sold. One is worthless without the other.</li>
            <li> I got this because I thought it was SUCH a good deal. Now I&#x27;m not sure if the product really isn&#x27;t that great of quality OR I just don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing with the stamper but I&#x27;m not that impressed :-/</li>
            <li> So much fun to use!  Great purchase that comes with a box to keep discs.  Remember to purchase a stamper also.</li>
            <li> its nice nedw and im like it its so grate looking and im happy with it som much  thats whats imcan say</li>
            <li> This is good if you are just starting, still learning how to make cuter nails, and want more then just a color. However most the &#x27;full-nail&#x27; designs won&#x27;t cover your thumb nail and you can&#x27;t do the same thing on all your nails because your nails are not the same size but the print is (of couse) so for most it just don&#x27;t look good. I do still use a few of mine but it is a very few.</li>
            <li> The plates arrived quickly and the blue film was easy to peel off. It takes some practice to get the full patterned images on the stamper, but other than that it gives my nails some great designs. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because I have wide nails, so the patterned images do not cover my whole nail.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with all the different stamps! I would highly recomment this product to to whoever likes to do their nails!</li>
            <li> I think Shany provided a good variety of designs, but all the nail polish comes off when I scrape so I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I haven&#x27;t used many of the designs yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the good the bad and the ugly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A lot of the designs are doubled on other plates with within the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* There were a lot of scratches and discolorations to the plates which doesn&#x27;t seem like it effected stamping much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Patterns aren&#x27;t deeply etched in the metal so they aren&#x27;t as clear as other plates. (I purchased these with a set of MASH plates, and I like the MASH quality better)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I don&#x27;t have very long nails at all, nor do I have wide nails, and unfortunately the whole designs will not fit my nails. I have issues getting them on my nieces much smaller nail beds as well but they work better for them over the single images because the single images are too big. Whereas for me the single images work perfect, but I can&#x27;t do the whole nail designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Some cool designs. I mainly bought it for the horror plate with the &amp;#34;scream&amp;#34; mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I liked the package it came with. Just stackakble in a little box. Some people don&#x27;t like this, but I was ok with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard from others that Shany is known for sending doubles of plates within their packages, and have terrible support.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price on this product.  I love using them and I&#x27;m much better on the up-keep on my nails since it has become so much fun just designing looks and playing with colors.  I will definitely get some more plates from Shany</li>
            <li> I never knew something like these existed until my friend told me about the deal for these on Amazon. The concept looked interesting, and the price was a steal compared to uying them elsewhere, so I bought them immediately. Boy, am I happy? It takes a little practice to get it right, but there are a lot of helpful tutorials on youtube, and I learnt to use it pretty fast. My 6 year old is very excited with all the different patterns I make on her nails. And they turn out very professional for an amateur like me. The plates have a thin sheet of plastic attached to each of them, that needs to be removed before using them.  Please note that these plates do not work with all nailpolishes. The konad brand are a good choice, but there are cheaper alternatives that turned out really good. All you have to do is google for them. Also note that in order to use these, we need to buy a stamper and scraper set, which I also got for a very good deal at Amazon.   Thanks Amazon for all the wonderful deals. I love you!</li>
            <li> Please read my full review before forming an opinion.  I received the package with the plates scattered all over the box with apparent scratches on each plate.  The reason: the plates are metal and very heavy. The plates came out of their packing during shipping. However, each plate is protected by a thin plastic film and when i removed them, the plates were in pristine condition.   Now about the plates: You get 25 plates for the price of one. Each plate has 6-8 different designs and altogether you have more than a hundred beautiful designs. There are full-nail patterns, designs for the tip of the nail, flowers, fruits, etc. Let me tell you this, with this many designs, everyone will find a few dozens that they like. The designs come up very nice with normal nail polishes.  My recommendation: each plate is equal or better than its competitor and unless you find another one at a cheaper price, go for it. this is definitely the best value of its price!</li>
            <li> These are great! I used to pay the same price for 2 plates, and now I got 25 of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried with the French style plates and it worked as great as the name brand ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that a lot of nail colors you buy from the drugstore doesn&#x27;t work too well because they are not thick enough; that might be the reason why some people didn&#x27;t find the awesomeness of these plates. :)</li>
            <li> For this low price and to get a whole bundle of different designs, it&#x27;s awesome! I was sooo excited when I got this. I tried my first nail stamp and loved it. I need some practice how to stamp my whole nail but I&#x27;m happy that I have it now! The edges are sharp so you might want to be a bit careful.</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter-in-law for Christmas. They offer so many choices to make really nice nails. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are hard to use, so easy to smudge when your are transferring the image from the stamp to your nail.  The generic pattern images are nice but as stated previously easy to mess up.  The character images and the animal images are a bit generic.  I wanted to like them, and I planned on using them frequently but it&#x27;s just too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Has a lot of designs but they are not useable.  I have tried several of them and the designs are not deep enough to hold nail polish to get the design to the nail.</li>
            <li> I really like the stamping set that I received for a gift. It has so many choices to chose from and I can choose the one that goes with my mood.</li>
            <li> Where to begin. I did a very short search on the product and was expecting to get the bundle monster set 1 image plates with 4 extra image plates. As it turns out I got Shany image plates. The quality on SOME of the image plates is horrible. I got one image that was partially overlapped with another image, and on another plates there was a random imprint. The stamping quality is okay. Not as good and Bundle Monster or Konad. Now the pros: I ordered my package on a Saturday Night and got here on a Wednesday. Took around a day to ship and process. Theres a wide variety or images to choose from so I wasn&#x27;t so mad when I got something else. Overall I would recommend this but only to someone who&#x27;s trying to save money and is NOT a beginner.</li>
            <li> PROS:  Cute designs  Fast shipping  Inexpensive  CONS:  Horrible protective plastic  Most of the cute designs are not stamp-able  I threw away a lot of plates  I cut myself on the edges twice (no protective backing at all)  I was super excited by these designs! When I received them the protective layer was horrible to remove. I cut myself on the edges twice while removing it and had to clean blood off the plates. These are dangerous. I also ruined 3 nails to remove all the plastic from the plates. Then I started trying some of the designs.   :sigh: The cat was the cutest for me. The image didn&#x27;t turn out with konad black. Or white. Or a regular polish. I examined the plates and noticed that most of the plates are not etched deep enough for you to get a stamp-able image. Also, they have very thin designs with delicate lines that even if the image stamps, you have to deep clean it in between since it is now full of polish and won&#x27;t stamp twice.  I&#x27;ve tested most of them. Around 50-60% of the images are not usable. Some of them are good and the designs are cute. You can get cheaper knockoffs that work so my advice is to go with another brand. I am scratching an X across the designs that don&#x27;t work if one or two on a plate are good and on plates that are totally unusable, I&#x27;m tossing them in the trash. Literally throwing money away. :( It&#x27;s a shame too. I was so very excited.</li>
            <li> Ordered a pair for my girlfriend and she couldnt love it more. The item was shipped very fast and arrived in great condition. definetly would buy from buyer again!!</li>
            <li> just like it was described and shown in pictures. Lots of fun designs my daughter loves it. She has done all her friends nails and they want some now. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I agree with most other reviews.  Good for the price.  These are sharp because of the ragged edges.  They lost a star from me because I had to sand the edges smooth.  The major competitor has a cushion backing and thicker gauge disk but, I&#x27;m overall satisfied with the order.  Happy stamping!</li>
            <li> It is okay but not the best.  The color runs over and certain designs are too small or too big.</li>
            <li> Just got these for my daughter didn&#x27;t know I needed the rest of the items that I did ordered tonight! The disks are pretty scratched up so I am hoping they work don&#x27;t wanna disappoint my 7 year old:(  will keep you posted when I get the scraper and stamp!</li>
            <li> Got these for my wife for her birthday as she loves the stamper thing. She was more impressed with these as the etching was deeper then the ones she got with it so it worked better. Plus you get so many for dirt cheap you can&#x27;t pass this up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look no further, just buy this product!!</li>
            <li> I love these. I love the variety of designs. They stamp well with regular polish. I would totally recommend these!!</li>
            <li> Very good and everything!!!(^-^)</li>
            <li> i really like these i wish there were more seasonal but great anyway also wouldnt hirt for them to be on a thicker metal just so they dont bend but work great very happy with them would buy them again</li>
            <li> I love this set of plates. Great designs, I tested most of them upon delivery today, and had very few transfer issues. A dot here, leaf there, nothing too noticeable. For the price, and the amount of plates and designs you get, this is an awesome set of plates. I do agree with other reviewers, the blue film is nearly impossible to get off, and these plates ARE extremely sharp, so the job is twice as hard. But as long as you take your time and are careful, you should be fine. I am very happy with my purchase, and would recommend to others. :)</li>
            <li> This manicure set is fabulous. There is a look for everyone and every occasion. The manicure plates are easy to apply and they stay on really well. I was able to change up my nail look without it costing me an arm and a leg. The price is amazing considering the great quality of the nail art. The nail art set definitely gives off a very glamorous look. It is a must have, especially with spring rapidly approaching!</li>
            <li> I had never used any nail art stuff. Ordered these image plates after reading the reviews. However, I couldn&#x27;t figure out that I would need special nail polish to use it. I went on a month long trip to India to attend a wedding. Told all my cousins and friends about this and promised them cool nail art. When we started doing our nails then only I realized that I missed to order special nail paint. So couldn&#x27;t use it on my trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order nail polish now so that can use it in the future. The designs are good however.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the salon express nail art stamper from TV and these to go with it for more variety. They work fantastically and there is such a wide variety of designs, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> Plate SH08 is messed up :( one of the images is only half pressed in so it is unusable. Very disappointed with that because it was my favorite plate. Love all the others though. No complaints with the others &amp; mine are not sharp either..</li>
            <li> Im a nail girl. I love having wild designs and this product allows me to have beautiful, stylish nails. I couldn&#x27;t imagine my life without it lol</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product!im a complete klutz and definitely dont have the skill to do things like this to my nails on my own like some people so when i heard about these stamps i just had to try and it was so easy...even for me!haha i would recommend this to everyone its fun and easy and the designs are super cute!</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE AND THESE GO GREAT WITH THE SHANY NAIL ART IMAGE PLATE HOLDER! I AM A SHANY LOVER FOR LIFE!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this set after seeing a demonstration for Konad at the mall and they were charging $5 a plate! This set has some cool designs on it, and for less than $15 you get 25 plates. That is a great deal! I am a beginner to nail stamping, but I can&#x27;t wait to make all sorts of designs! I usually only wear a clear coat on my hands, but this makes me want to have color on them!I will absolutely be ordering from Shany again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a set of Bundle Monster and a few Konad plates, and I have to say I am extraordinarily impressed with Shany! I was expecting to have some problems with the plates, since there are so many intricate designs I figured they&#x27;d be a bit difficult to get a solid stamp from them, which tends to be a problem with my Bundle Monster plates... but I was wrong! They work even better than my 2012 Bundle Monster plates! Some of my Bundle Monster plates seem to be etched a bit too shallow to get a solid image out of them. The Shany plates are definitely etched a bit deeper, it&#x27;s not so much of a struggle to get the perfect stamp out of them AFTER you remove the blue plastic using tweezers (OBVIOUSLY). People are so impressed with how flawless my nails look, it&#x27;s so satisfying to say that I did them myself. You can tell that the images are a little thinner than the 2012 Bundle Monster plates, but they still cover my full thumbnail, so I&#x27;m happy. I feel *SO* stupid for buying the Konad plates/nail polishes. Seriously, the quality is the exact same for a fraction of the price. I could have used the extra cash to buy some more nail polish. I use nail polish from Wet n Wild/Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear to stamp, and it works great. The only problem? It takes me about an hour to figure out what combination of nailpolish/image I&#x27;m going to use since there&#x27;s so much selection hahah. But seriously, keep up the great work/amazing prices Shany!!! Hope a 2013 set is being made. And for people wondering about shipping - this shipped in 5 days to Toronto, Canada from the US, nice and fast :). Definitely recommend. 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Very cute designs.  Some are even small enough to fit on my 8 year olds nails (she&#x27;s thrilled)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help get that blue plastic off, I used the tip of my tweezers and scratched a tiny little bit near each edge and it peeled right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still waiting for my stamping polish, and so far have only used Sally Hansen.  A few times the stamp hasn&#x27;t picked up the entire image, but I think its the polish problem.</li>
            <li> it works great its easy to use..... i bought for my daughter now im using it its great product. you will never run out of any ideas for ur nails.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it&#x27;ll do. Clean-up is tedious but oh well!</li>
            <li> Lovely designs to choose from. Easy to use. Makes my nails distinctive and unique.</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and when I use these plates my nails come out great. I love that I can do my nails all kinds of ways and it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of my time. I don&#x27;t have to worry about messing up and starting over.</li>
            <li> there are so many choices to choose from and there all unique and different it is so hard to choose from i highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I got these plates ahile ago but i didnt have my stamper that i orded yet so i coulnd&#x27;t use them and i was aiting forever but they finally came. I read some of the revies that others said about these plates and everyone says that the blue plastic was hard to take off and the plates don&#x27;t work very well. I have to say i didn&#x27;t have any problems with taking off the blue plastic, but i couldn&#x27;t get the image from the plate well. But i say its b/c im not very good yet so i think i could do better with practice. but i do know that the plates are very sharp though i have not cut myself they look very sharp so if you purchase this item be carefull... :)</li>
            <li> I just received my Shany nail stamp set and I am thrilled. It came very quickly .I used it for the first time today and i Love it!</li>
            <li> I use it every week to do my nails! It is wonderful. I love all the different designs. Sometimes its hard for me to choose one!</li>
            <li> This product arrived promptly and before i expected it too! The only problem I had was 2 of the same disc arrived, but other than that, it is PERFECTION! Would order this product again!</li>
            <li> I saw this Item being sold in tha mall at 3x this price. So i came online and found this product and I was thrilled to see how cheap it was! LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> Got my item today, all there great little pack lots of designs no duplicates all fun designs just a great item and all for a great price.. ships to Canada which was a bonus... :)</li>
            <li> The pueen plates are a bit thicker and higher quality but  these work just fine and have great designs.  Don&#x27;t cut yourself on the edges of these!  They can be sharp.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be fine, I received it on-time. The transaction was easy, fast without issues. However, the problem is that two plates are alike, therefore the is one missing. We expected to get 25 different plates as the product details. I would like to know if I can get the missing plate.</li>
            <li> The image plates will take time to get use to it. Sometime the image comes out and other time it won&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t got any cut from this product like some reviews stated. Maybe the company fixed that problem. IDK. When I got the product, the image plates, it was every where. The image plates was in a small box that fix them perfectly, then it was put in a bigger box with nothing to protect the small box from moving around in the bigger box.</li>
            <li> I received this plates today and checked if there were scratches like what the other customers were saying. I saw some bits here and there, but the scratches were manageable and didn&#x27;t affect the design at all which is really great! The delivery was also fast (it only took a week) which I&#x27;m really happy about! Overall, this is a great value for your pocket. I give this product a rating of 4 stars.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of variety in this set, and once I figured out how to use these plates, I was very pleased. I did have to experiment and resort to YouTube tutorials, but once you understand the process it is very easy and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more than enough design options here for an experienced user, and it&#x27;s a great set for a beginner. Five stars!</li>
            <li> I love these things! I have changed inages several times. Once you get the hang of doing it, they turn out pretty good.</li>
            <li> The quality of the plates are nice and are very reasonably priced. This was my first Shany Cosmetics brand purchase and I know I will be making for purchases with them in the future!</li>
            <li> Most of these stamps work really well &amp; once you get the hang of them they are easy. Very fun way to do your own nails and make them look great! I use the gelish nails and apply the stamps on before the top coat so my nails last for 2 weeks! Love Them</li>
            <li> This is a great set. It gives you a wide variety to choose from. There are a few things for most of the holidays included. With the right polish, details are crisp and clear.</li>
            <li> I have the Konad and the bundle monster plates and i like them.The thing is the konad plates cost to much and the bundle moster plates sometimes you have to work to pick up the image.With the shany plates i love the price and the images comes out on the first try.The one thing that i don&#x27;t like is the shape edges.</li>
            <li> I like the images - especially the full nail images - but they&#x27;re just TOO SMALL for my fingers! I don&#x27;t have big hands and it would only cover my smaller nails and only if they&#x27;re cut short. I am disappointed in that. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great set!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my friend.  She loves the designs and flexability on the patterns.&lt;br /&gt;Note: does not come with a stamper or scraper.</li>
            <li> This is too cute! With the nail trends going on this year, and probably going into 2013, this is a great product to consider trying! I&#x27;m late going into the trend but this is something I would definitely love trying or even getting for my two younger nieces.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Stamp Manicure set with a few other items from Shany, and the shipping was wonderful..  I had to only wait a grand total of two days from the time I ordered..&lt;br /&gt;The packaging it came in was just fine, no rips or tears in the plastic that it came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at how many little designs were on each plate, there&#x27;s something for just about every holiday including: Halloween, Christmas, Valentine&#x27;s and many many more.&lt;br /&gt;While these are very cute and easy to use, I did have a slight problem with how thin the plates are.  I had considered letting my six year old use these herself, but after nearly cutting my own finger, I decided to use them on my own, and using them on her only when she asks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also disappointed with how deep the plates were NOT... Yes, most of them do the job, but then there are others that just don&#x27;t show up at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also a small girl, my fingers aren&#x27;t that big, which also means that my fingernails are not as wide as someone else&#x27;s.  This means that some of the stamps I couldn&#x27;t even use at all, what a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it&#x27;s all said and done, I&#x27;m only going to give this product a two stars rating.. Between my small fingernails, how easily someone could cut themselves trying to use the stamps, and how some of the stamps just don&#x27;t want to transfer over..&lt;br /&gt;If these things are all worked on I would happily recommend them to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it weren&#x27;t for some of the designs being usable to myself and on my oldest daughter I would probably send the stamp set back and want a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will however say, don&#x27;t let this single product keep you from trying some of the other Shany products, there are many others that I actually love.</li>
            <li> If you love doing nails you will definately love these! The plates are extremely high quality and transfer very well.  I love them, everyone complements my nails when i used these.  There are also so many pretty designs you can do. Great value!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful stamps, and they came much quicker than expected. I&#x27;m going to have to buy the specific scraper, however, since the scraper I had from a different set won&#x27;t work with these very well at all. I do love the images, and can&#x27;t wait to use the whole set of them!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if i did this wrong but the thing doesn&#x27;t work -waste of money and complete junk do not waste your money</li>
            <li> The Nail Art Polish Stamp Manicure makes my life easier now that I have everything I need, plenty of designs and models to apply to my nails. I usually do nail art and complicated designs on my nails but when I am in a hurry and I can&#x27;t spend all that time doing my nails I use the stamping method. I believe the price is great for this product, much cheaper than buying each plate individually. I actually feel sorry for my previous purchases when I paid approx. 3 dollars for only one plate. Shany Plates have such nice models that I want to keep them on my nails as long as possible so it will take me quite a while to eventually apply all those designs. Well, thank you Shany for helping me save some time when I mostly need it.</li>
            <li> These are excellent image plates, comparable to my Konad plates. I have tried out almost all of the plates by now and have only had problems with a few of the images not transferring easily. I do not use a plate holder and have had no issues cutting myself, but the plates are definitely thinner than the Konads. Definitely worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> While this kit comes with MANY designs, some of them are not stamped deep enough into the plate, so when you remove the excess polish, ALL of the polish scrapes away! This is the only kit I&#x27;ve bought, so I don&#x27;t know if all of them come this way, but mine came with a plastic coating that had to be peeled off. When I peeled the coating off, residue was left from whatever is used to keep it attached. I had to clean them all very well before use, which took a while. Also, there are a few repeats.</li>
            <li> Very.fun and easy to use, a couple of mine came already scuffed and some random marks on.them but over all worth it.... only downside is they are sharp enough to cut your fingers</li>
            <li> Can u please explain how does it work? i tried but makes no sense :( I took that plastic cover from each and then dont know what to do :( Is there any place to see instructions for use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Realllyyy goood product....love it........Awesome designs great way to do your nails at a short period of time. Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Update 10/1/12 So many choices! I have a hard time picking out which one I want to use half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like these a lot. I no longer have to go to the salon to get my nails done, I can do them at home now and am saving the money for a vacation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only are these so handy to have, but they have saved me SO much money with not having to go get professional manicures all the time! Now I do my own and they look amazing!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, lots of selection, but some were scarred and had the foils torn so were unusable.  Most were great however and made for a good selection to divide among my grand daughters.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  None of the plates works &amp; the Shany company does not respond to costumers.  DO NOT BUY THESE.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first set of plates, hoping they&#x27;d fit the Konad stamping equipment and they were perfect.  My favorites are definitely the all-over designs (the full rectangle of pattern shown in the bottom row of plates in the image).  I think the leopard spots and the zebra are my favorites - they leave a distinct pattern with deep enough indentations in the plate to be pretty precise.&lt;br /&gt;The plates were much smaller than I expected, though certainly not an issue with the product - they fit in the Konad Stamping Nail Art Image Plate Holder, so couldn&#x27;t be any bigger.  That&#x27;s more of a Konad comment than for the plates specifically!  My big toe is the only nails that aren&#x27;t covered by the all-over designs completely, but I have no complaints really!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love my stamps but I was missing SH05 plate. Other than that I am very satisfied. I intend to email Shany to see if I can get that plate delivered.</li>
            <li> I reccieved this as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend who was just looking for some cool nail accessories for me. I opened the gift and just wasn&#x27;t really sure what to do with them. There is nothing in the box or the description on amazon that says that you need the additional stamper and scraping tools. I know that most people who are looking for these plates would already know that, but it would be nice if there was something in the product description that states which tools you will need to actually use the plates. Fortunatly I was able to go to Sally Beauty Supply and get a stamper that works just fine, but unfortunately for Shany, it is a different brand, so by having a better product description may encourage people to buy more of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual plates go, after doing a little research and watching a youtube video, I found these plates to be really easy to use. I just used regular nail art polish and it worked great. Clean up is a little anoying only because by the time you put the polish on the plate, scrape it off and stamp it, you have polish on the plate, scraper, holder and possibly any table top you are using- nothing a little polish remover can&#x27;t handle, but still just anoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only took a few trys on my toes to figure out the best way to use these, and was able to give myself a faux french manicure with the lace design in a matter of minutes. Once you have a grove going, they are fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> i bought a small stamping kit that only had three plates in it to try it out and it was so easy to make my nails look like a pro did them. so i found thi deal and got it. so soon as i got it out of the box i was stamping, this kit has so many designs that i can hardly choose what one i want . some of the designs are that same but not that many. a great buy and easy and fun to do.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of the designs, although some are meh for me.  But for the price, more than worth it!  The plates are very thin so need to be a bit careful but the etching is even - so far so good!</li>
            <li> First time trying was slightly difficult, but it&#x27;s new to me...and after only redoing one mani...I&#x27;m a pro!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay Me!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these unless you&#x27;re already great with this kind of nail art. I&#x27;ve tried these with every kind of polish and paint I have, and I haven&#x27;t liked the result even when the stamp was perfect. Plus, the edges are really sharp. No joke, I got a nasty cut from one of them as I was cleaning up!</li>
            <li> They were very pretty. I loved the designs. But they wouldn&#x27;t work with my special Konad nail polish. The design just would not go on the stamper all the way just bits of it here &amp; there. I had a problem when scraping off the excess polish too, the little plate wanted to bend in the middle and pop up. Any one know of a polish that works well with these? Til then I have a great paper weight now.  :o(</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with these plates AT ALL. They are SO sharp! I read this complaint on the reviews, but thought... oh I&#x27;ll just be super careful... well I was.. and still sliced my finger. The designs are really random, and there isn&#x27;t a very many even worth having. Would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> I recieved these today, pretty fast shipping. I like most of the plates, some of them look a little big for my nails (I have sorta small fingers) A lot of them are designs I would never use, some look kinda ghetto. All the holiday ones are really cute and there are the typical butterflies and hearts I would use. These plates are really thin and you will have to be careful handling these as they may cut you easily. It was pretty difficult to get the blue protective coating off but after awhile I got the hang of it and it wasnt too bad. In the future I will probably order more if they make more designs. Definitely worth it for the price, compared to Konad plates for 6 dollars a piece.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It was better then all the other deals. When you order them it says SHANY but there really made by BUNDLE MONSTER. But either way  just as good as KONAD. I bought the plates and the stamp/scraper set; i didnt buy the  special polishes cuz just about any cheap nail polishes work just as good. I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  After further testing, 12/25 plates are not etched deep enough to transfer.  I am really disappointed as I do like many of the designs in this set.  I have also noticed that the plates that are defective in my set don&#x27;t seem to be defective in everyone&#x27;s sets.  I have read through all of the reviews and this seems to be the reason for such differing opinions. I am now trying to decide whether to simply return or try exchanging (and risk getting another defective set).    Original review: I will first off say that I have not yet tested all images (there are a lot!).  However, I was very disappointed to find that one of my favorite images, the squirrel, was not etched deep enough to transfer (and, yes, I did remove the blue plastic.)  I hope that this is limited to this plate and that the rest of the set works fine.  I am also curious if this problem is limited to my set or not.  Also, I keep my nails short &amp; the \\&quot;whole nail\\&quot; designs work well for me.  I use them with the widest part of the image going across my nail (from left to right).  I find that this allows me to have some room for \\&quot;positioning error\\&quot;, whereas using the image the other way would require perfect positioning in order to cover the whole width of the nail.  Sorry if that sounds confusing.  The blue plastic on these was a major pain to remove (I also bought the MASH set and they were not as difficult).  The plastic tends to stick to the plate and come off in small pieces.  You have to find \\&quot;the perfect spot\\&quot; to start taking it off, then work around the plate surface.</li>
            <li> These plates really come in handy when doing nail art. All different designs that give a number of choices to choose from.</li>
            <li> My wife was very happy when I got her these for a birthday gift. She didn&#x27;t know which one to try first.</li>
            <li> I was originally trying to order airbrush stencils, but when I seen these I was curious on how this would work, ordered them added one nail polish and used a yen knife to clean the excess polish and quickly stamped the pâté and then stamped my ail, couldn&#x27;t be more happier. But the key is once u clean excess nail polish u quickly stamp the plate otherwise the polish will dry fast... I tried it with no base polish, and could barely see the design, so darker base coat works better.  This is awesome too for little girls, I take care of a little girl that luis to get her nails one but doesn&#x27;t sit still well since it dries fast it works great....  Good luck o all, hope this helped.</li>
            <li> A little hard to use, I find it best to do the whole nail designs. I can never fully get the small designs to stamp.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, just as good as the name brand. They are HIGHLY recommended. The plates are made of a high quality metal and come protected in a small package.</li>
            <li> I got these and most don&#x27;t even work because they&#x27;re too small or something. I bought the stamp to go with these and the plate holder doesn&#x27;t work either. I thought it would work with regular nail polish and while it does with the black, it seems most don&#x27;t work with ANY polish I buy, stamping polish or not. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The smaller and more delicate designs are near impossible to transfer using the stamp, but the bigger and bolder designs show up beautifully.</li>
            <li> The variety of designs for the price was the greatest feature of the product.  The discs are very thin so they do need to be handled with care.  I&#x27;m still new at stamping but my images came out crisp and clear.  My one complaint is that the protective film stuck to some of the plates in different places.  I&#x27;ll try to use nail polish remover to get it off but I&#x27;m hesitant to try anything else since I don&#x27;t want to effect the designs on the plates.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on them whenever I use the patterns. What I love about this particular set is it came with nail tips, whole nail, and little other designs or random pictures. There&#x27;s some for every occasion. If you&#x27;re going to buy image plates, these are the ones that give you a little taste of everything. I&#x27;ve had them for about six months and I reuse designs over and over and they still work just fine and come out clear.</li>
            <li> girls love this. this is so fantastic.  short of time, no problem,give this a chance and clean up is no-problem.</li>
            <li> You do get 25 discs but there are multiple stencils on each plate.  Well worth the money you pay for it.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product. Don&#x27;t waste you time thinking, just grab it ! I had no difficulty in using it, as some customers complained. The designs came out nice, as I desired on the very first time I used it. Neither did I had any trouble in removing the cover. The designs are great too. I love this one.</li>
            <li> most of the images didnt work. and some plate were even copys of others deff dont buy off brand. :(</li>
            <li> At first it felt impossible, but after a few minutes I became a pro.  The stamps are the perfect size, some seem a bit large though.</li>
            <li> These plates were amazing compared to the really low and completely affordable advertised price of just about 12 bucks.  Forget Konad, these are just as great, besides by paying about 4-5 or more for a Konad plate, you are just purchasing the name tag after all.  Upon receiving the plates, which came super fast btw, I inspected each plate and it was well done compared to a couple unmentionable brands I came across at the retail store, to which I had saved my money on.  You can never go wrong with Amazon :) Anyways, the variety of the plates were as pictured, and got no doubles of any plate, not that I was expecting it.  The nail polish laid out smooth and images transferred onto my Konad (cheapest thing about Konad?) stamp crisply and clean as I rolled over and transferred image onto nail with ease.  These plates are completely easy to use and look great, all you need is the right type of polish, the right color combinations, and a bit of creativity to mix and match the different designs.  With this set, it really does seem like the sky is the limit!</li>
            <li> I was quite excited to receive my SHANY 2012 plate set, but greatly disappointed to find it lacking the SH02 plate.  I immediately contacted the SHANY customer service via the email address they provided on their website.  Its been over a month now and I haven&#x27;t even received some form of acknowledgment that they&#x27;ve actually received, let a long read, my email.  The disappointment I felt when noticing that I was lacking a plate is nothing compared to the amount I have at having been ignored.  I&#x27;ve waited patiently for them to contact me and resolve this matter, but I suspect that I shall never get my complete order from them.  Hopefully, this review will attract their notice where my email did not.  Until then, I won&#x27;t be making purchases from SHANY again as they cannot be trusted to provide that full set of items nor can they be trusted to rectify any errors/problems in your order.</li>
            <li> this is a nail design lovers dream. There are so many designs and this product is great quality, at a great price. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> i got really nice designs love it.. had some confusion before order but when it arrived its really worth for the bucks i paid for it., thankyou</li>
            <li> This product it overall good for the price. I was really expecting more but it&#x27;s okay. I may purchase it again if I like their designs but in the set I bought I only liked a few of them.</li>
            <li> This product is completely awesome!! So many different designs to chose from you will never wear the same design twice!! High quality...not flimsy like some others out there and super fun!!!</li>
            <li> This was the second time I ordered Shany 2012 Nail art Polish Stamp Manicure Image Plates set of 25pcs.  The first time I never got them.&lt;br /&gt;But I am so happy with this set.  I can&#x27;t wait to try them all.</li>
            <li> I got the plates super fast and they are even better in person. The first day I got them, I painted all ten fingers different colors and stamped them all!! Love it!</li>
            <li> But I am not sure why I got it. It&#x27;s too much work to do by myself! I&#x27;d rather not apply it. It gets soooooooo messy!</li>
            <li> Had no trouble with it my 7yr old uses it the most!!  Would recommend this product to potential buyers. Shany is just as good as Konad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are deep enough, I have other plates that are deeper and the impression comes out a lot clearer, these are just ok!</li>
            <li> What can I say, everything that you could ever want to stamp away at are on these nail plates. I got these for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas and she LOVES it!!! Her friends thinks she is all the rage with her groovy nails. I would definitely purchase more from this brand. It came in a beautiful box with protective film over each plate. First class!</li>
            <li> Really impressed by the variety of designs and after watching video tutorials, got the hang of using stamp and image plates. Several images for \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; designs and \\&quot;nail tattoo\\&quot; type of images and got inspired for more types of manicures (like holiday type manicures).  The image plates also had \\&quot;french manicure\\&quot; tip images and with practice - can have a neat effect on an old manicure style standby.  The plates were \\&quot;clean\\&quot; - didn&#x27;t have any issues with scratches - and as a tip - I already prepared to store the plates in a cd binder anyway to avoid that issue in future.  My only criticism is that for the designs meant to cover the entire nail - I wish these images were a bit larger as I happen to have larger hands than most and the image didn&#x27;t cover the entirety of my thumb or middle finger nails.</li>
            <li> These plates were a cheaper alternative to getting the Konad real plates. Quality is very good (:&lt;br /&gt;One little con I would say is that the edges are a bit sharp but you can definitely avoid getting cut.</li>
            <li> I just received these plates today and have tried using images from every one of them.  NONE of the images are deep enough to hold the nail polish when you scrape the excess off the plate.  I will be returning them.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Great variety of art. I am enjoying them!</li>
            <li> This does not work. No matter how many times i read the instructions and even look up tutorials on youtube, this does not work. Save your money. I wish i would of.</li>
            <li> Got these as a little gift for myself to have fun with. Started doing my own gel manicures at home and wanted to be able to add a little extra something to my nails. Love the variety of designs, the seasonal and holiday themes, the all over, french tip and individual images. After experimenting with a couple of the designs, I was able to do a full set of Valentine themed nails on my own nails with awesome results. I have been using them with regular polish (OPI-which is highly pigmented) over my gel manicure and they go on perfectly every time. Had two damaged plates that Amazon replaced with an overnight shipment. Great value for the number of designs you get, large variety of images and easy to use. Do be careful taking off the plastic as these are sharp metal plates. I also got the plate holder, scraper and stamp set. Love the plate holder. The scraper scratched my plates so I switched to an old store rewards card with great results.</li>
            <li> I have tried these with several nail polishes and they DO NOT WORK,  I regret this purchase. I waited too long to try using them so it is too late to return</li>
            <li> I have fiddled with these a few times, but not like the real thing...they don&#x27;t stick good or stay in place...waste of money!!</li>
            <li> If you want to be able to create your own awesome nail art but aren&#x27;t quite up to the free hand standards you&#x27;d like to display on your hands, these are an awesome solution once you get the hang of how to use them!</li>
            <li> it was well and nice package, arrived in good time and is being used, requirement where and sometime the box is way to big</li>
            <li> Some of the etchings are hard to pick up because they are not deep enough. It is a nice set for the low cost but I will not be buying any more shiny plates again.</li>
            <li> I had read that these plates will cut you. They&#x27;re not THAT sharp, and the edges of the plates are actually a bit rounded so it&#x27;s safe to hold. That being said, something like a small metal plate CAN definitely cut a finger, so I&#x27;d still be careful. I&#x27;ve also read that the larger images are not large enough to cover the entire nail. I have pretty &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; nails (they&#x27;re not really small or anything), and the largest images can definitely go all the way across my nails. No problem. If you have really long nails (mine are short to medium), you might have some trouble LENGTH wise, but the width on these images are great. The images are smooth and well carved and the little box these plates came in is a really great storage for my plates too. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase and would definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re into stamping.</li>
            <li> These plates werent as good as i wanted them to be, most of the designs werent even showing up because the plates werent ingraved that well. At first i was glad they cane but when i started using it i was very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome stamps and lots of fun, ony downside is that a few of the stamps are not as deep as the others and don&#x27;t come out as well, or are defective in some way.  Not many, maybe 3-5.  Just looks like they weren&#x27;t etched as well as the others and so they are not as detailed when used.  I don&#x27;t find this a really big deal but is the only reason that I have given it 4 stars instead of 5.  Otherwise, great, fun product!</li>
            <li> These plates are awesome! Lots of cool designs. I can&#x27;t believe I now just heard of Shany! Their products are highly pigmented, reasonably priced and shipping is fast. Currently, I own Shany make up palette, Shany magnetic polish, Shany nail art pen and these stamp plates and I have not one complaint!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this stamping set, but I was disappointed to find that none of the images I&#x27;ve tried have been clear enough to even see. I would do a little more research on other stamping sets before buying these.</li>
            <li> My husband bought these for me for Christmas. I have a new obsession for \\&quot;styling\\&quot; my nails and these are a great tool. They are so versatile, the possibilities are endless! They are awesome for a quick nail job and they look so cool! I did need to do some trial and error runs with different polishes and techniques to get it right. Once I did that,it so easy. Love playing with these designs! Can&#x27;t wait for more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner stamper and these are my very first set of stamps.  The images are pretty cute, but there are about 10 plates that I would never ever use.  There&#x27;s one plate that has nothing but numbers on them, so completely useless in my opinion and there&#x27;s another with symbols.. useless again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a big problem transferring images.. as long as you use the right polish.  There&#x27;s a whole list online if you just google it that will tell you which nail polishes you can use.  Eg: all of the Sally Hansen polishes will stamp perfectly.  Some of the images won&#x27;t transfer completely and evenly even with the right polish so it must be the stamps that are faulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full nail stamps fit my nails just fine.  My nails are about half an inch long but prob narrower than the average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these plates are just okay, kind of blah images. I just ordered the Bundle Monsters 2012 and it seems like they have waaay more pretty images and better reviews.</li>
            <li> Excellent selection, but one of the plates in the box had damaged finish, even though it had the protecting plastic over it. Looked like the shiny metal peeled and you can see the blue layer underneath.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to use it now. Otherwise pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> this was my first image plate purchase after I got my konad stamper. Its a great buy personally they stamp nicely and clearly and i have no problem with anything. i absolutely love these image plates</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this item, so when I did it was a huge disappointment.   Pros  There are none.  Cons  - The edges of the plates are really sharp, to the point where I actually cut myself on one.    - Each plate comes with a protective film that is a pain to get off. Some came off easily but for the most part I had to struggle to get them off and once I finally did, more than half of the plates had some type of residue left on them from the protective film.   - It just doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t know if I was just doing it wrong but a lot of the images just weren&#x27;t transferring to the stamp, let alone to my nail. I tried everything and the images just weren&#x27;t getting picked up. The few that actually did, only picked up partially.   - A lot of the smaller images are also a pain to clean. I tried to clean them with a cotton pad but a lot of the nail polish remained and little fibers of cotton got stuck in the image.  So basically, I spent 15 dollars just to have 25 small metal plates sitting in my drawer.   Totally wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> So much fun... there are stamps for any day of the year including most holidays! I was a bit sad to learn that the leopard and tribal print were not included in this packet though. I highly recommend that you order the other bundle with more plates. Might as well spend the few extra bucks!</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING!!! Whoever came up with these things, I LOVE YOU!!! They are so professional looking and easy (once you get the hang of it!). The designs are so pretty and look great on your nails! My friends saw them this morning and loved them!!! The only problem when I got them was that they came with no instructions so I had to search it online. But that wasn&#x27;t a problem and it won&#x27;t affect my rating! these work really well with the SHANY nail polishes! The one and only thing you MUST get in order to use these would be the SHANY scraper and stamp!!! If you don&#x27;t get those you&#x27;re out of luck! But don&#x27;t worry they don&#x27;t cost much. the one thing with that is the scraper scratches up the plates so get a old gift card and use that to scrape of the extra nail polish (if you don&#x27;t know what I mean go on you tube and type in testing out french manicures with bundle monster, you&#x27;ll see how it works and the girl gives great ideas and tips!). If you love your nails painted but can&#x27;t afford to get them done BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is great! I will recommend this to my friends! And I&#x27;m sure you will to!</li>
            <li> I like these nail plates and some of the designs are really cute, but I think this product is aimed more for younger girls. I thought it was a cool idea and they really are a lot of fun and just like the feather extension kit, it&#x27;s something fun for girls to do at a slumber party. Another plus to this product is that it can seriously save you a lot of money from not having to get designs done at a nail salon, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the nail salon, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option of doing it yourself. I was looking through the set and I liked a lot of the designs, but I do wish some of them were bigger. My favorite thing was the spider web and animal print designs. I also liked the fact that it has a good variety of themes too. This has something for everyone and that&#x27;s always a good thing!</li>
            <li> I decided to try out this out nail stamp craze and purchased these. They work well but I don&#x27;t feel like they have very cute designs. It&#x27;s a great deal for your money, but chances are you&#x27;re only going to like only a few of the designs.</li>
            <li> I purshased this product and even bought the shany nail art polish. I already had the salon express stamper but when I try to use it nothing comes off its like the cutouts are not deep enough. Is there a certain stamper I am supposed to use cause I tried contacting the seller but I cant find a way to email them so can somebody out there please help me??????</li>
            <li> To me, these look a little hard to use. I have not ordered them and are a bit hesitant about them because I am just beginning to really get into nails and these don&#x27;t seem very beginner friendly. But on the plus side, the designs are gorgeous and you have plenty to choose from and will never run out of ways to use them. I have watched several videos on youtube showing the gorgeous designs that you can make with this.</li>
            <li> i luv it.. i always like having my nails done and having designs on em... can&#x27;t wait to use every image thanks so much.. and shipping was super fast &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have the Konad brand also this give more variety for the price but offer the same quaily of stamp as konad.  Some of the edges were a little sharp but if you have the plate holder you don&#x27;t need to worry to much about the edges.</li>
            <li> I saw the Nail Stamping Art on Youtube and i just had to try it so I went on Amazon and saw this great deal on 25 Shany images plates. I just got them in the mail and i tried them and they work very well. They have great designs and different types for all ages. I really enjoy this product and excited to use them more.</li>
            <li> The nail designs were cute in various sized. I hope both me and my little girls will get good use out of this product</li>
            <li> Great item. Although I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try the stamping plates yet I am very happy with them. They sent me 30 pieces instead of 25 promptly.</li>
            <li> If you go to a salon and get a design ad compare it to the result of this product, you will be overwhelmed. These are very easy to use and manage . These also go well with the other shany nail products.</li>
            <li> love love them. My friends and family have more fun with these. My grand daughters and I have play make-up days and they will do my nails and I will do theirs. Great fun.</li>
            <li> worst stamps every the images are useless if they don&#x27;t go on easy! Can&#x27;t give this away if I tried!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product but very disappointed once i got it. THESE STAMPING PLATES DO NOT WORK!! Once i figure out how to add pictures youll see why. The designs DO NOT come out at all!! even with the recommended nail polishes</li>
            <li> I love the variety in the stamps! At first, I was upset because I was trying to stamp and it wasn&#x27;t working. i thought that I brought a bogus stamp set or the plates were bad, but Once i watched a tutorial on you tube showing me how to hold the scraper, stamping became a breeze! The only ones that I can&#x27;t get the hang of are the ones that are used for the tips. Im sure over time, I will get the hang of it. For now, I&#x27;m loving the details in each design and the flawless transfer! It reminds me of when i used to get my nails airbrushed!</li>
            <li> A must have for beginners to gurus!!! Awesome product and great end design!!! A must have for all nail polish fanatics!!!!</li>
            <li> These plates are fantastic! they print very well, and the transfer flawlessly. i love the fact that you can use your regular polishes, unlike the konad plates where good transfers only mostly come from konad polishes. the reason i only gave this 4 stars is because of the plates themselves. they are sharp along the edges, and i have a fear of them eventually cutting me! also, the protective peel is very hard to take off and leaves a residue. it is easily removed by your acetone, but it would be a definite plus if i didnt have to do that fro every plate.</li>
            <li> omg this plate are probably the easiest thing to use they are so simple. and they just gives your nails a little cute design it takes literally no time at all, and they are so affordable.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I am obsessed with anything nail related. And these do not disappoint. There are so many designs to choose from. Love it!</li>
            <li> These things are amazing!! They have so many designs on them and they work really well. The only problems i have had so far are the french tip nail designs. My sisters and mom love the plates and are always asking me to do their nails now. These plates are super fun and are definitely worth getting!!!</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH AT ALL. I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS . NAIL POLISH COMES OFF WITHOUT THE IMPRINT. I RETURNED THIS BACK .</li>
            <li> this works but is not amazing i use it once in awhile but taskes lots of time bc sometimes it doesnt work.</li>
            <li> I just received my package of nail art polish stamp and I am really happy with the product. I am excited to use them tonight. Most of the designs are great! Some I don&#x27;t care for. But for the amount of stamps, money well spent.</li>
            <li> I am a newbie in Nail art but those plates are just amazing. I used them easily and the result is stunning!</li>
            <li> they are great! Shany must have listened to the complaints, because the plates I received had tbe paper backings and the blue plastic was not hard to get off. they are still a little rough on the edges, but not sharp enough to cut.... the images are so cute and they show up clear on your nails. well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these plates. I have been wanting to do stamping for quite a while, but couldn&#x27;t justify paying the price other companies were asking for just one single plate.  So, when I came across these I jumped at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lot of trial and error, and a bit of research, I have to say they work perfectly! I was skeptical at first, because I was just using my own nail polish to do the stamping. I read reviews, checked out the Shany website, etc. What I found out was I was using the wrong kind of polish. They make polish specifically for stamping, but if you insist on using your own it can&#x27;t be brand new, thin, nail polish. It needs to be a thicker brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after trying again with some old nail polish that I don&#x27;t use, because it became a little too thick, the plates worked perfectly. Also, I read that you can rough up the little stamper with an emery board first, then cleanse it with some polish remover and that helps too. It really does!!!  So, for those that have bought these and not found them to work perfectly, just keep practicing. Do some research, and you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates themselves were in perfect condition when I got them. All the images stamp very well, and I had no duplicates in the box.  One more thing I forgot to mention, and also found out on trial and error, when you scrape the excess polish be sure to do it in different directions. Depending on the actual image that does make a difference. A couple of them I couldn&#x27;t get to stamp right, so then I scraped the excess polish the other way and it stamped perfectly every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just need more different colors of polish. ^_^</li>
            <li> The add says 25 pieces but I only received 24. Not a big deal but when it says 25 I expected that. Other than that I have no complaints. Great deal for $11.99. The package arrived earlier than expected and each plate seems to be ok, no damages. Now just waiting for the stamping tool &amp; ill be able to use them.</li>
            <li> These Plates Are AMAZING i Was Just Coming Back From School When My Father Told Me They Arrived I Was Shocked They Came So FAST Best Shippment And The Designs Are Amazing Too !! :D Thank You Shiny Plates :$</li>
            <li> I waited a very long time to write a review for these plates because I don&#x27;t like writing low star reviews for companies. I&#x27;d rather just deal with it privately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I bought these plates way back in March. Only about 18 of the 25 were cut deeply enough for me to get a clear image off of, and so I emailed SHANY about getting replacement plates. They said it would be totally fine, and I was like \\&quot;I&#x27;m so glad you guys are offering to fix this.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, its now almost October, the 6 month mark since I&#x27;ve been in on and off conversation with the company. Not only has this item not been taken off Amazon even after the PR lady was like \\&quot;yes, we had a bad shipment and are getting new plates printed\\&quot;, but 6 months later they are still being sold and yet she has told me that they cant send me a replacement set because they are \\&quot;behind in getting new plates pressed.\\&quot; This means one of two things: she is stalling until I forget about this and they are selling the upgraded plates on Amazon, or they are still selling the defective plates on amazon while they wait for the reprint shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that companies have to make money to stay afloat. I understand that sometimes big operations can go pear shaped and take much longer to fix small problems when it comes to a design error. The only reason I am not giving this a 1 star rating is that I can still use 18 of the plates fairly well, and I&#x27;m remaining hopeful that in the future SHANY will send me the replacement set for the mis-etched plates I did receive and I can come back and change this review. Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people looking to buy these: Beware. Yes, the designs are amazing, but they run small. You also get what you spend, and it&#x27;s a deal at $11.99/set, but know that some of the specific plates you&#x27;re buying the set for probably wont be etched deep enough. I would hold off on this purchase until they come out with a new design set, or make an official statement on this amazon.com listing about the plates being the updated versions.</li>
            <li> Most of the images are to shallow and they dont even pick up on the wand lots of designs to choose from but of the 8 designs i tried only 3 worked:-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews that these don&#x27;t work. And before people go right to this product being defective, they need to look into if its the nail polish they are using or a user error. Out of all the designs I&#x27;ve used I&#x27;ve only had an issue with the squirrel on SH10. The french tip designs you need to scrape across the design, not down the design. I&#x27;ve tried several polishes and not all of them work. Nothing with glitter, shimmer and certain metallics as well as thin polishes. Sinful colors, sally hansen xtreme wear, other more expensive thicker polishes (OPI, essie) also work. I have not tried the ELF polishes yet. It also takes practice!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find that there is one design repeated on two plates, one is a little wider. It&#x27;s okay I really love the design. I did my nails with one of the full nail designs and couldn&#x27;t stop looking at my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The designs are super cute. They have a good selection of different designs and full nail designs. There are some holiday ones, some animals, lots of flowers. The only thing is there aren&#x27;t any fall themed designs (boo). But there are pumpkins and halloween ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see now that they put out the 2013 set and I totally want to buy it and I haven&#x27;t even looked at the designs yet. You really can&#x27;t beat them for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They just need to come out with a way of storing them so they don&#x27;t get scratched (which is very easy to do as with any shiny metal product).</li>
            <li> My girfriend bought this for her nails the designes are done good. The plated comes with a plastic covering on it for protection.&lt;br /&gt;there are a bunch of designs in this set. good buy if your are in to the nails desgin thing.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get the hang of it. When I did my daughter and I love it. She loves getting her nails done by mommy. :)</li>
            <li> Great plates just like the last set I ordered. Great etching and good pickup. Some good images. great to add to any nail plate collection</li>
            <li> I read through all of the reviews before I place the order .It&#x27;s a great product! My daughter loves them so much!</li>
            <li> This came fast, and I was able to give as a gift on time, I consider this the best service.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter-in-law as a Christmas present.  She loves painting her nails wild colors and these just added the fun she has.</li>
            <li> I received them with a lot of scratches on them already. i know eventually they are going to be scratched up but i wished it didnt have so many on all of them</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the product. The reviews on Amazon are mixed but I was overall happy. I did find the protective stickers pretty annoying to remove, but with tweezers I was able to do it. I would suggest adding some sort of tab to the plastic film so it is easier to remove. Secondly, I did receive two minimally damaged plates. One plate had a dent in the edge and another had a scratch straight across a plate and through one of the designs. Have not had the chance to stamp every single image but the ones I did worked well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my daughter, who loves to do her nails before going out with the hubby. High quality heavy material made to last. Excellent selection of designs, made her very happy at Christmas...we were both pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Item was received damaged. The plates had many scratches &amp; a few DEEP gauges,where you could see the silver metal underneath.&lt;br /&gt;If the damage wasn&#x27;t over the stamped designs I would have kept it. Too bad. Junk. Returning item.</li>
            <li> this product gives you so many options to put cool designs on your nails! very nice product, thankyou A plus</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my girlfriend and she seems to like all the different designs she can do with her nails.</li>
            <li> These plates are sharp, both me and my sister (who barely handled them) got cut on them. The designs themselves stamp pretty well. I got these specifically for the star signs and those look terrible they are not detailed and they stamp badly because they fill with nail polish and overflow. Also I didn&#x27;t get all 25 plates I ended up not getting 4 of them. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it two stars is that I love the anchor stamp.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 2 because it was not at all what I was expecting to many single designs and not a lot of full finger stamps.</li>
            <li> These were my first plates i have bought! I was very excited to get them. So after trying them i will say that i like them ok..... Alot of the designs are just too shallow! Alot of the times it wont pick it up. I have tried even the nail polish that goes with it instead of normal polish. The normal stuff works better. But the designs that did work are really light. So i guess just too shallow. I would love it if i could find some more that worked amazingly! It was a great idea!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and she loves it.</li>
            <li> good for some design. but its not for sensitive design. it wont work well. I thought it would be easy to use.</li>
            <li> love these! lots of fun images to choose from and they work really well! the blue plastic that is on them when you get them is a pain in the butt to remove, but once thats off they are awesome!</li>
            <li> I have a set of salon express plates that work great. I was excited to see all the additional designs offered by SHANY. I have benn very frustrated by them. They are etched so shallowly that you can&#x27;t get enough polish in them to pick up. These are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Nails have always been my thing. I competed at the state level for nail care/design so naturally I must own everything trending in nail art. I placed my order yesterday, got the email that confirmed the shipping yesterday and they were in my mailbox by the time I got home from work today. I cannot wait to play with these all the time!</li>
            <li> My daughter has so much fun creating nail art with this set.</li>
            <li> Plates work great, lots of choices.  Easy to use, easy to clean.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment sooner than expected which is great! The edges of the plates feel somewhat sharp, but no complaints about the variety of images. Comes with a have carrying case.</li>
            <li> These are great for nail designs. Having so much fun with them!!!!!!!!!! I highly recommend them. Definitely worth it and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use. It&#x27;s sort of hit or miss with this product. I&#x27;ve watched YouTube videos and the individuals make it look so easy; however, it&#x27;s not as easy as it looks. But I&#x27;m not giving up hope because the designs are really cute. Maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this product and she loves it. Her and her friends use this when they hang out all the time.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter for Christmas. Only thing that bothered me was I got a duplicate plate. so she only ended up with 24pcs.</li>
            <li> Listen I really do like the Konad stamp plates but they&#x27;re so expensive and these work really nice.  I have to warn you that some of the plates don&#x27;t have the indents well made but if you press the rubber stamper really quick and hard it comes out just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to have some really cool nail art. I tried for over an hour to get this to work but it did not. I bought the special nail polish and scrapper but every time I tried the nail polish either cam right off the plate or the stamper would only pick up a small portion of the nail polish. Also, when my plates came in the mail they were all scratched. It looked as if someone had returned them. Maybe someone else will have better luck.</li>
            <li> love them and work great with the right polish and i seamed to got copys of some of the plates not of some but im still happy</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;All models works, it depends on the technique you use to apply before I could not until I found a tutorial in Korean, well no matter the language has pictures and explain how they are used, I followed the instructions and so far all models are ok</li>
            <li> The plates I received were not the plates pictured. I spent awhile trying to decide between different plates and I didn&#x27;t even receive the ones I chose! Sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> The material is very thin and designs does not look well embedded. This product was returned BUT I did not receive REFUND! Why?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I am not the first one to say this.  The product was not well packaged, it had no instructions, and the manicure plates were all scratched up.  I bought it as a gift for a young teen, thinking she would show her friends and they would want one as well, but I was not even able to give it as a gift.  I was too embarressed.  Even my own 19 yr old daughter, said it look like it was a used item.  What a shame.</li>
            <li> the images cannot pick up by the stamp, really bad quality! it&#x27;s waste of money and your time. at first I thought the problem was the nail polish, but I used the same polish on other plates i purchased before, and there was no problem; so I realized the problem was the plate. the images are not deep enough for the stamp to pick up the images.</li>
            <li> I bought the kit you see on tv (not going to lost brand), and was looking just for the French tip disc (was missing from other kit) when I found this offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it requires a little practise and patience to use these things, I find these discs easier to use than the other kit. This is a great deal. You get your money&#x27;s worth. So many very cool designs, I feel like I will use a higher percentage of these designs than I would from the other kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**tip: use nail art polish or you won&#x27;t be able to see design regardless of color. It uses so little polish so your design with be smooth, you need thick polish. I believe that if it was deep enough to use regular polish it would be bumpy, it wouldn&#x27;t look \\&quot;professionally done\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter and she is in heaven. They are so easy to use and you can create a lot of cute designs in just minutes! Its a must have for any household with girls!</li>
            <li> These stamps are ao easy to use! They work really well too! I compelted a nail look within 20 minutes because these make it so easy and quick to use!!</li>
            <li> a must have if you have a nail stamping kit. the discs come with so many different designs, you&#x27;re able to create a different look for every day of the week. so fast and easy to get beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> Wow! that&#x27;s the first thing that I can say! these nail polish stamps are incredible! It is perfect all different seasons! My sister and I had a lot of fun playing with these nail plates! The designs were very unique! The best thing about this product is that, there are soo many designs to choose from and you can&#x27;t go wrong! A good deal!</li>
            <li> Great plates at a great price. So far I have tried several images all with success. A great buy and good value for my money.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying nail stamping so I can&#x27;t compare these plates to others, but they work great for me. It did take some practice-a lot of trial/effort, but after a week or so, I was happy with the results! I like how there is a large variety of designs to choose from, too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let any suicidal individuals near these.  I learn the hard way when I accidentally shipped my package to the Wisconsin state mental hospital.</li>
            <li> So happy to have these! So much to choose from:)&lt;br /&gt;Lucky I read reviews before purchasing and was warned about the pesky coating the plates are wrapped it, like stated by others, be very careful. Even holding them gently feels risky.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a whole lot for a great price :)</li>
            <li> I really like the designs and they work well.  Although they do have sharp edges so be careful when taking off the plastic.  I have had a lot of fun creating themes and just trying out different color combinations.  There are a wide variety of patterns so there is a lot of potential for different holidays and occasions.</li>
            <li> My plates arrived quickly. I am pleased with how many different images there are. I&#x27;m excited to try these out!</li>
            <li> These are really cool. It took me a whlie to figure out that there was plastic wrap that needed to be removed before use (duh.. ) but after I got that out of the way I really liked them. There are tons of designs from hearts to flowers to pets and numbers so that&#x27;s pretty cool. The only other equipment I have is a little stamper and thats enough to get the job done. Its a fun novelty for a small price.</li>
            <li> Received my image plates to day and I&#x27;m not all that impressed.  Plate SH25 was made wrong so one image is cut off and unusable.  The images also did not transfer as well as I hoped. It did not matter what polish I used.  Not work the money</li>
            <li> The plates work great... only if you have the right nail polish. You get 25 plates which is great for $12. I&#x27;m doing my nails every week now and trying all the different designs.</li>
            <li> There is so many different designs and all of them is so cute ! I think it&#x27;ll look great on anyone&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> My first impression of the plates and the designs was that they were so small. The full nail design does not leave any room for error and only covered my ring finger and pinky. I was so excited to receive my plates, but they are just okay, not great. The ones I tried worked fine. You do get variety and quantity, but part of me wishes I bought a couple of other plates instead to get better quality.Besides, I do not think i will be using half of these designs anyway, and in retrospect, I would have been better off getting something I really like than something I am content with.&lt;br /&gt;They do come backed, but still have rough edges that might snag a finger. Overall, if i had had a chance to see them and test them beforehand, I would not have purchased them.</li>
            <li> Just bought these and love them. Images come out very clear. Was scared it wouldn&#x27;t be but i am very happy. Great price</li>
            <li> This product is really great. It&#x27;s easy to use (for ideas, you can go to YouTube and type in Shany Nail Art and there are a bunch of videos) and the designs come out looking great! I love how it is a consistent look every time, whereas doing designs freehand may or may not look the same on each hand. Great bargain because you get 25 plates with at least 5 or 6 designs on each plate, and of course it&#x27;s not a one-time use thing like nail art stickers.</li>
            <li> LOOKS LIKE A GOOD SET WITH EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN TO USE.  JUST WISH THEY WOULD MAKE A SET OF ONLY HOLIDAY BECAUSE SOME OF THE DESIGNS YOU MAY NEVER USE.</li>
            <li> Nail stamping takes hours to do because it doesn&#x27;t always come out right the first time. Also, only some of the given designs transfer well onto the nail. The rest either don&#x27;t transfer or only part of it gets picked up. Eventually, you will learn which ones to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you need expensive nail polish to use these image plates. I have used cheap, Wet N&#x27; Wild nail polishes from the drug store and they work well. Metallic nail polishes are hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Purchased this and a nail stamp, the little girl I take care of loves when I do her nails and use these! There are a ton of different symbols and designs to pick from and great for any age group. Great price!</li>
            <li> i love it ! it is everything i was hoping for , it is really a good buy , and when you do the 25 dollar total for free shipping its a steal&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> I purchased this stamp set in February 2012. I have trouble with many of the images not stamping fully. The etching is very shallow making it difficult to retain enough paint in the image to get a complete image. I have tried using different scrapers and a very light touch to no avail. If I knew for sure this had been improved with new batches I would be tempted to re-purchase but it&#x27;s hard to tell from the reviews here if that is the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other brands of plates from Bundle Monster and Konad to compare ease of use to and I find them easy to get great image transfer every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The images in this set are really great too. So I am bummed that there are so many I have been unable to use. I hope this review is helpful for those thinking of purchasing and encourage those who have purchased later than I to mention how their experience has been with the image transfer specifically.</li>
            <li> Some of the designs I got were really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are bigger than the image plate holder that I have, but other than that, they&#x27;re not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scratches really easily though but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the case with most of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The image plates might be uneven unless it was a problem with my scraper, but the nail polish didn&#x27;t budge sometimes when I scraped. I would have to go over it a few times.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t too happy with these. They were okay. keep in mind u need specific nail polishes for these. they dont just work for any.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect christmas gift for my manicure loving niece.  It would have been nice to know that there was another item needed in order to use these plates but I found out soon enough to get that before Christmas came.</li>
            <li> Love it! Packaging was great n quality is great n designs r so many to choose from n they kinda big but I guess my nails r small that&#x27;s y :/ lol but I love the packaging n quietly was great. Will buy again :) or as a gift</li>
            <li> I say it those its job but u need a good nail Polish has to be very pigmented and u gotta be very quick at it cuz it dries fast but I would love to buy the konad special Polish just to see I&#x27;m sure it be better but other than that it has some good images very thing I somewhat had lil trouble taking the plastic of but I did it</li>
            <li> I love these plates they are etched beautifully and with all the designs I have used they come out perfectly. The plastic wrapping was a little hard to get off at first but maybe that&#x27;s just because i wear acrylic nails. This is an amazing deal and comes with a variety of different designs! I will be buying there 2013 next! Thank you Shany!</li>
            <li> could not use, the plates are not deep enough... have tried with many different types of polish, can not get plates to work..</li>
            <li> Great price for 25 different stamp plates with 10 designs on each plate - tons of artistic nail design options!  Easy to use!</li>
            <li> this set comes with so many varieties and options and i absolutely think its amazing!! and worth the price, they make it very easy to have pretty nails!</li>
            <li> I got this for my older sister who goes to beauty school, more specifically she wants she be a nail technician.  So this type of thing is perfect for her, the plates fit perfectly into her nail stamp presser. And the application comes off as clean and highly detailed which is very difficult to achieve with other plates. So this product is definitely a big plus.</li>
            <li> I received the plates today in the mail.  I was very impressed.  I would recommend these to anyone.  Just do not forget to take off the thin plastic on top of every plate.</li>
            <li> El producto es realmente bueno, los moldes de las placas son muy variados; sin embargo, en el paquete sólo me llegaron 24 placas o piezas en lugar de las 25 que especifica el empaque. La placa que falta es precisamente la número 25.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my image plates!  I have numerous options and design choices for any season, event, or fun I want to create.  The plates are easy to use.  The price was amazing for the number of plates I received.</li>
            <li> These image plates are easy to use and have so many different patterns. I love how elegant my nails look after using them. This is a must buy for all lacqueristas!!</li>
            <li> The images on quite a few of these plates are not engraved deep enough making it impossible to lift off the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI for those of you saying these plates don&#x27;t work, the blue film comes off.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife she just loves all the designs that she can but on her nails with a little practice she&#x60;s as good as a pro</li>
            <li> I have never done Nail Art until this kit it is so cool and so easy to do! I would give this a try and you will love this product. You get so many styles and designs to choose from it is a must for all nail lovers!</li>
            <li> The product is very good for all people.....thanks&lt;br /&gt;Is very faster to use and has nice picture for nails for all ages nice for womens and mens...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a little hesitant when buying new plates because I&#x27;ve ended up getting a lot of crappy ones.  Luckily these plates work perfectly!  You have to be careful not to cut yourself on the edges, but I&#x27;m stupidly clumsy and have managed to remain cut free so far.  I definitely recommend these plates.</li>
            <li> Cute designs, and i love the idea and loved that this was cheaper than some that i&#x27;ve seen at the mall, but there was a few of the designs i wanted to do for a date and couldnt since the groves were&#x27;t deep enough to get nail polish in them to then be transfered onto the nail, but thats okay, i mean there are SOOO many options and most of the other ones i&#x27;ve tried have worked so its worth the money just be aware that not all designs on the discs will work.</li>
            <li> The designs are nice and good for a 4 year old.  The plates are good quality.  I&#x27;m starting out and this was enough for me.  Great for the price.  Lots of kid design as well as adult.  I really don&#x27;t use it for me.  I really use it more for my 4 year old.  Overall good quality and works fine with any nail polish.</li>
            <li> Designs are very cute lots of floral patterns</li>
            <li> My 12 year old loves this set and the ones given to her with it.  The colors transfer to her nails just like they are shown to.  Takes a  little practice but he was able to do her nails after just a few tries. LOVE the variety of patterns this set has and so does my daughter!</li>
            <li> omg i love my nail stamping plates they r so awesome!! n they work very well! n jus to lovet every one know i love chris brown soooooo much lol! but i tried almost very stamp n im learning how to use it but it seems easier with shany then it does with my original kit.... \\&quot;flirt\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are VERY happy with these nail plates :). They arrived in fast time. They are my first time buy for anything like this and I&#x27;m soo happy I picked this package :); there&#x27;s a gorgeous variety of stencils. The protective plastic coating peeled off nicely and easily. The only problem I&#x27;m having is not knowing what one to use next ;)!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you soo much SHANY; you made an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I received them very quickly. They were in perfect condition. I have to admit it took a few tries to get the hang of it. Its all technique. I suggest to look online for tips. What I found is to use a plastic card to scrap off the excess polish and you need to be quick about pressing it on to the stamper but dont push to hard . Dont scrap to hard. Then roll the design on your nail. Hope this helps. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These are great plates! and so inexpensive! and you get so many designs! so beautiful high recommend! Great for any girl that loves doing designs on nails!</li>
            <li> Twenty five nail art plates for only $11.99 thats like 48 cents a plate! thats just one thing I love about SHANY and amazon great products at low prices :)</li>
            <li> I really like these but they are a little sharp on the edges so be very careful when handling them. Besides that the images are very clear and they stamp very good.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;She LOVES it!&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution, beware of the sharp edges!</li>
            <li> This is my first stamping set and i&#x27;&#x27;m in love! Easy to use and fun at the same time. Will buy more....</li>
            <li> These do not work, don&#x27;t waste you time or money order something else.  I bought these as a Christmas present and they didn&#x27;t work what a horrible disappointment.  The engravings are not deep enough to work.</li>
            <li> My wife is into the whole art nail design and loves this gift i got her. She cant wait to try out all the great designs.</li>
            <li> My wife was very pleased with the quality of this item as well as the price for these items. No complaints as of now. And the edges seem to b smooth not sharp as stated in another review.</li>
            <li> When i received the plates, they were scratched up like they were old or something. So if you can get past that, then i guess you&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li> Thank you the plates were amazing!</li>
            <li> I was unable to get a good stamp onto my nail.  Not sure if it was because of these or the stamper but I gave up after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest invention ever!!!! I&#x27;m not a professional when it comes to nails, I just do my own and have fun playing with them. They do take a little practice to get the hang of, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s easy, fun and there is no limit to what you can do.</li>
            <li> My girls and I love them.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a product you will regret going cheap on.  There are so many patterns, symbols, etc to choose from!  The patterns are clear and crisp, all of them usable.  They are all big enough for my fingers, although some are clearly for faux nails because they are long.  No duplicate plates.  Edges are a tad sharp, but when used carefully, aren&#x27;t an issue.  Blue film peeled off easily (used my nails!)  This was a good deal.</li>
            <li> I love these plates!  I was hesitant at first after reading the reviews, but I am so glad I purchased them.  The image selection is amazing. Love the holiday ones!!  Great variety of designs, great value and they work just as well as the name brand plates.</li>
            <li> I love these plates.. Such a pleasant surprise. I get great stamping results every time.  An excellent selection of designs. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> These were awesome! Great value, and a wonderful variety of images. I didn&#x27;t get any duplicate plates like other people claim and the plastic came off without any problems. In fact it only took about 5 minutes. The edges are a little sharp, but if you be careful and use a plate holder it&#x27;s not a big deal. Lots of different images and they stamp really well, I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> As a blogger I&#x27;m always trying to do new things with my nails.With this stamp nail art set the possibilities are end less.I always get compiments on how creative my nails look.This is hands down a great product.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have always done super boring things with my nails (if anything at all!). After seeing these on here, I decided to purchase them and try some cute new things. I was so surprised at how easy they are to use and how great my nails end up looking. These are great for everyone- including beginners !</li>
            <li> This is my first set and I love it. They are easy to use and the edges are not sharp unlike other brands. The price you can not beat. I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> Just got this today and I am so in love with them, I got all 25 of them, for the price you cant ask for more. I dont see anything diferent than the Konad one that runs about $5 per plate. I started staping as soon as I open the bag. I got them on 2 days wich I dint have to wait much soooo happy about that. The plastin that comes with it is great so that way the plates wont get all scratch up sinces they all bunch up together. cant wait to try them all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my own set of these for a while now, but I just bought these for my niece.  Now the plates come with a backing on them - bonus! I like the variety of the designs for such a cheap price.  The Halloween selection of images is pretty good on this set.  Very happy with my purchase.  For beginner stampers, I recommend this set, plus Mash&#x27;s new set and Bundle Monster&#x27;s new set.</li>
            <li> i bought this to my wife as a birthday gift and it came before the estimated day and my wife liked very much</li>
            <li> Great set.  Not only do I use these for my nails, They are great on my arts and crafts too.</li>
            <li> Some of these give you a good print but some of them are just not deep enough.</li>
            <li> The plates are a good quality.  Wish they had more of a mix.  Like holidays ie. St. Pats, Valentines etc.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging!  It comes in a box where the plates fit snug inside and it has a magnetic closure.  The plates were protected with the plastic covering.  Great selection of images!</li>
            <li> Not original packaging, missing one plate, but the ones I got are quality. . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> These were my first stamping plates. They seem to work really well. My only complaint is that I received a couple of duplicates in the set.</li>
            <li> These plate have a variety of images for all types of personalities there are some I am very in love with but my biggest problem is that the images are much too small. I also feel like the should have made the surface scratch resistant.</li>
            <li> I love this nail art plates but Konad is very expensive so I decided to try this shany brand the plates are spectacular and the stamping set is perfect I used in my salon and the customers are very satisfied with the results</li>
            <li> These plates look great, but the description did not say that they were just stamped on them.  As a result, I have to send them back.</li>
            <li> The variety and quality of the plates are wonderful. My friends are jealous of the different images I have that they didn&#x27;t get with other plates they obtained elsewhere. Plates come well packed and protected from scratching or damage. Shipping was quick and arrived on the day projected.</li>
            <li> t doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what kind of nail polish I use, it just doesn&#x27;t work well.  I can&#x27;t seem to get a clear, precise looking stamp. Difficult to use and hard to keep clean for the next finger.</li>
            <li> Stamps very well. The full nail designs are bigger than on some other plates but not for longer nails (but can be used for french manicure.</li>
            <li> I having so much fun with these stamps. My grand daughters are thrilled. I read alot of  reviews almost talked me out of buying them. Went to walmart got small set for ten buck for kit. To see what I can do with them. I had some trouble with a few but over all using different types of polish and arylic paint.  Decided to order these had such good luck with walmart kit. possiblities are endless not just for nails. I even got my grandson involved he is our only boy grossly out numbered all of the grand kids had fun just playing with acylic paint and stamping just for the fun of it. Cleans up is easy just use water in stead of nail polish remover. Make sure you have enough stampers! something to scrape with. we used store discount cards worked best. Set each child up with stamper, scaper, paper towels, some acrylice paints, something to stamp to I use some colored paper, give each child 1 dry coton wipe and 1 wet to clean plate after each design was stamped, paint brushes or q-tips for appling paint, quirted some paint out some smaller pieces of paper. I demonstrated and they went to town. Fun Saturday afternoon. Clean up easy. Just throw away all the paper towels, wipes and q-tips, clean stamping plates and brushes with warm soupy water. Hang and display their art. Oh and no cuts or accidents accured!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week I did all the girls nails with the &amp;#34;Cheeky&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Shandy&amp;#34; sets I purchased. Each one enjoyed picking out their stamps and colors for designs every finger was designed differently and I don&#x27;t think we had any repeats.Some colors worked better then others but then others and if we didn&#x27;t like it no problem just use top coat before stamping clean and try again if you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to let you know Grandma, and her girl friends are all flaunting our newly designed nails too! Lots of complainments and oohs and awws. Husbands beware! yes I am doing my nails again....</li>
            <li> These image plates work great if you have the proper opacity of nail polishes and they are way cheaper than the Konad ones and you get a whole collection!!</li>
            <li> The design when applied to nail is very light to having gaps in the design. Some of the designs on the plates will not take well enough on the stamper to show up in full design. The few that take well you can feel the indentations on the plate. Those that do not work you cannot feel with the finger tip!! Used several different polishes. Will not be using. I will simply free hand designs and forget this.</li>
            <li> The images are crisp and perfectly visible. The disks were protected with a blue film so once removed they are clean and shiny. I was sent SH01 - SH25. I ordered Wednesay and received Friday. No cons on this one!</li>
            <li> I just got these plates 2 days ago and I am in love! It will be my first time doing stamping but I am already so excited to try it (waiting for my stamper to arrive). There are so many options to choose from and different themes. It was well packaged and comes in its own box to keep them in.</li>
            <li> This was a surprise to get! The designs are wonderful and the plates are metal so they will last for a very long time! I am so happy that I purchased this for a gift!</li>
            <li> These plates are a great price and work perfectly! We have used a lot of them, and the thing I like the most is that there is a variety of super tiny images, which is perfect for super tiny fingers. My 4 year old daughter loves having her nails stamped with tiny hearts or flowers. This is a great nail stamping set.</li>
            <li> This gift was a hit with my daughter and nieces.  They are really into nails and design and this was great for different designs and a way for them to be creative</li>
            <li> Very disapointed..Wanted to send it to my daughter, but cpuild not figure out how to use them...And they are far to heavy to be send by mail..To bad</li>
            <li> This set of nail polish stamp image plates is very nice.  There is a wide variety of designs and the impressions are cut deeply into the plate, so they are crisply outlined on your nails.</li>
            <li> my aunt and I are nail techs in the making and we find these stamps to be cute accents on nails.  Some of the larger designs are hard to transfer but it&#x27;s a good deal for so much variety</li>
            <li> Again these are very nice really good quality plates nice print easy to use easy clean up and amazing results....&lt;br /&gt;Love these plates easy to use and give nice detail to someone that is wanting to look amazing in every detail!</li>
            <li> Bit difficult to use.  Appears much easier in the description but it does take practice</li>
            <li> I have to agree with one of the most helpful reviews, these things are SHARP. I can easily see how one would slice their finger(s) using them so be careful!! I ordered them on a Saturday and they arrived by Monday! Super fast shipping! Over all decent quality, nice storage box and none of mine were damaged at all. I have not gotten the stamper set yet so I have yet to use them, but I cannot wait. The only reason I took off a star it due to how sharp these things could be. You will want to keep these away from your kids!! (I have a 3yr old). I also order the bundle monster plates, and will updated once I have had a chance to compare as the bundle monster plates were quite a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Great price for 25 image plates. Quality is remarkable. I don&#x27;t have any problems using even regular polish on these plates. Images are fun and cute, great variety. This would be an excellent addition to a plate connection. I recommend purchasing this set.</li>
            <li> just tried my new nail plates they are great love these designs will order more soon great for first timer you can save lots of money buy doing your nails at home.</li>
            <li> I love the plates, the images are super cute, but I just cannot nail down a technique. As i said in my stamper review, these image plates are not meant for nails with much length, and it only works to have part of the design going in one direction and the other part going another with some designs. Also, the wells are quite shallow so the polish dries very quickly. I don&#x27;t know how they compare to the actual KONAD ones, so take that as just an observation. Also, I agree with the other reviews that the plates are very sharp on the edges! Also, the plastic was super hard to peel off. I have very long nails and not trying to chip my polish got about 4 done in the time my sister got all the others done. Get someone with shorter nails to help! I should also add they come in cute packaging, with a magnetic lid so they all stay in a little box safely, and you won&#x27;t have to worry about finding a way to store them.</li>
            <li> These are a nail art lover&#x27;s dream! The blue plastic wasn&#x27;t too difficult to remove, the stamps themselves work great, AND they aren&#x27;t as sharp as some people are saying! I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing new designs as they come out!</li>
            <li> this was a waist of my money, the plates and stamper doesnt work together or with nail polish, if i xould get my money back i would</li>
            <li> I have not had the best luck with these plates. The Pueen plates have picked up much better than these.</li>
            <li> excelente producto lo recomiendo a mi esposa le ha funcionado de maravilla lo compre desde venezuela y llego en perfecto estado</li>
            <li> I learned on these and one of the Bundle Monster (and a couple of Konad for comparison) sets a few months ago. I waited to do my review because I didn&#x27;t have very good luck at first, and I didn&#x27;t know if it was my fault or the plates. It was all me (and my fan and not using pure acetone to clean the plates). These work great, especially with the actual Konad double stamper (the stamper matters, I&#x27;ve tried two kinds and did many comparisons) and I highly recommend these plates to anyone into nail art, or just wanting to get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m not very picky about the images as I like to have a lot of images. I use these on myself as well as my little nieces. You may imagine, what an 8 and 3 year old like, differs quite a bit for a 30 something. There&#x27;s a good selection in this set, although there are a few I can&#x27;t really see using, but you can zoom on the images and judge that part for yourself. This review is focused on how well the image picks up the polish and transfers. I have no complaints at all about that as I&#x27;ve had really good luck with these, and I&#x27;m glad I started out these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have to find something to complain about it&#x27;s that there is one duplicate image of a tropical flower. I can&#x27;t see any difference in the images and it drove me nuts for a couple of minutes trying to find the difference, thinking it has to be there, and there&#x27;s probably something, but I gave up. If it is, it&#x27;s hard to see. If you look at the image Amazon provides, you can see the same flower in the top row on the first and last plate. Not a big deal, and at $11.99 for 25 plates, I don&#x27;t think it brings down their value at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m addicted to the nail stamping and have so much fun doing it and impressing my little neices. To date, I&#x27;ve tried MASH, Shany, Bundle Monster, Red Angel &amp; Konad (I say this so you know I&#x27;ve done many comparisons). I have a couple of actual Konad, and they do seem to work extremely well, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much of difference between their quality and Shany or MASH or 2012 Bundle Monsters, except for the price. The Bundle Monsters are really good. The 2012 batch performed the best. The newer ones are better. I can tell they&#x27;re perfecting and improving them with each newer batch. I think BM has just been out a lot longer than Shany &amp; MASH. I had a probelm with the Red Angel plates, but they&#x27;re the only ones to date that I&#x27;ve truly been upset with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date these are the Shany plates available. Without a doubt I&#x27;ll order more if they come out with them. I love the MASH plates. There&#x27;s only one set available on Amazon, the first set on their website is mostly dups of another brand I have, so I didn&#x27;t buy them, but I will buy the next batch of that brand as well (if they come out with them) based on the 26-50 they sell on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i bought this and i was amazed! the quality is amazing!, and the images turn out almost perfect most of the time! the designs are soo cute and pretty! And, this product is SO cheap! As you may probably know konad can get Very pricy! one image plate is around $6-7 or even more! But when i saw that these were 25 of them for such a cheap price, i was so surprised. and i am so glad that i ordered it! sometimes when i would use my konad plates.. the images didnt even come out.. but the shany image plates come out great almost every time!</li>
            <li> I had never used any Nail Art Stamps before but I loved the idea.  It took some practice but I finally got it and the first set came out really nice and professional looking.  The plates are as advertised and the design choices have a little something for everyone.  They came together in a box and each plate has a plastic coating that wasn&#x27;t too hard to remove.  I need a bit more practice with the technique but I plan on purchasing some more plates with different designs.  I did find that this type of stamping doesn&#x27;t work with just any polish or paint.  My first plate I used was scratched because I used the metal scraper that came with the stamper I bought.  I did find some tips on YouTube that used an old credit card...works MUCH better and changed my mind for the better on nail art stamping.  All-in-all, a good selection of designs for a great price.</li>
            <li> I love the discs but one was cut slightly off center so part of a design from another disc is on it&#x27;s edge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest and cut to the chase. If you are a nail art fanatic, then I recommend you buy these. For $11-ish dollars for $25 that is a great deal! I&#x27;ve seen individual plates retail for $6.50, so you&#x27;d be a fool to not buy 25 plates for such a low price. I&#x27;m going to list the pros and cons of this plates, it&#x27;s my opinion, and I hope it&#x27;s helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* There are so many designs to choose from, and they all are pretty cute designs as well!&lt;br /&gt;* They fit in about any nail plate holder, I have the Salon Express, and they fit on the holder, others claim that it fits on Konad&#x27;s holder as well&lt;br /&gt;* Pretty inexpensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;* The truth of the matter is that they are NOT deep enough, some reviewers have said that it doesn&#x27;t matter, but it does. If you want a clean cut image to be transferred on your nail, you are not going to get it unless you use nice thick polish and have a steady hand when transferring the image. If it were deep enough, then it would be perfect, but they&#x27;re not.&lt;br /&gt;* They are a little flimsy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: It takes practice and finding your own technique. You have to try them to see if they work for you, for me they kinda did, but its just about being patient and practicing!!!</li>
            <li> Today I just recieved my package. It came sooner than i expected. I just tryed these plates and they work pretty well. Not the best but i still have to figure out how it works. Great item for the price and highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This just came in the mail today, and I am really excited to try it more extensively. My daughter and I do \\&quot;spa\\&quot; time together, and stamping makes it even more fun.  The range of designs on these are amazing.  We found a lot of ones to try for Halloween and Christmas.  Lots of girly flowers and butterflies, too.  Didn&#x27;t have a lot of time to play today, but did try one image, and it worked nicely.  Keep in mind, these are JUST the plates, not the whole kit!</li>
            <li> the designs are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;How many times do i have to say I love the artwork of nails!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for designs&lt;br /&gt;Great designs and images on the 25 pcs</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Shany image plates and I have to admit,I was a bit skeptical because I heard some bads reviews. But I tried it out and it actually worked. I used normal polish and it still worked. The only suggestion I have is maybe they should include a small case to store it all in. That would make it more effective. Great job Shany</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see such a large bundle of the stamping plates for such a low price, especially after getting a starter set at Sally&#x27;s Beauty and only getting 5 plates its wonderful to have such variety now! My only wish is that it had included the snakeskin pattern. But I&#x27;m pretty sure I can create it myself with different plates or household things. Overall thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> These designs are just so cute! I love doing my won designs, but some designs are just a bit too hard to do using a small brush, but these worked just perfectly and look like you spent alot to get your nails done professionally!</li>
            <li> do these plates come with a FRENCH manicure plate? i know this isnt a review but i really need to know before i buy it!</li>
            <li> This is my first foray into nail stamping, so I&#x27;m a complete amateur, but this is a really awesome packet of designs to work with! I can&#x27;t wait to get started!</li>
            <li> These are great! The little delicate designs work so well, and they are very visible. I used the konad stamping set with these plates. I did have some problems with some of the less delicate designs (diagonal lines) because they were bigger and it was harder to get the polish off of it, compared to the smaller designs.  Very good overall, I would recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to purchase this set of plates after reading the negative reviews it previously received, however, I decided to go ahead and but it anyways, it was a pretty good price for 25 image plates! Much cheaper than the original Kony. Firstly, it arrived in one week, please note I live in the Caribbean, so that time frame was excellent! In my opinion, SHANY went through the complaints customers had and fixed the products to suit. I didn&#x27;t have any problems peeling off the blue protective film, in 3 minutes flat I cleared all of them. The sharp edges everyone complained about has been resolved, there is a thin cardboard backing now which eliminated that issue. The product is awesome. The images are deep, they transfer cleanly, and the images are far enough away from each other for easy use. This is a great product for anyone who has gotten into the nail stamping craze. I love these plates and I&#x27;m sure you will too! (Oh and on a side note, no special nail polish needed, any opaque nail polish works really well.)</li>
            <li> The best plate ever!!! The images selected are just amazing! You might take a little time to stamp perfectly, but is easy to learn. And the best thing: shany is animal-friendly! The company do not test on animals! Just perfect!</li>
            <li> images are very clear to read and there are just so many choices and combinations to make and wear. i love that plate itself is sturdy and indentations of the images are not to deep. for me this this makes the actual stamping process to be much easier.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these plates. They work great! So many nice designs...and I read previous reviews about sharp edges and although they are thin they will not cut you. I used to buy the konad plates and these work just as good and the price is great!!! Definitely a great purchase!!</li>
            <li> Hate these things!!! The color never comes out right on my nails!!! I&#x27;m done trying to use these dumb things!</li>
            <li> I think this was more user error. The plates are awesome and have tons of cool possibilities, I on the other hand teehee have no idea how to do it. So, if you can do it, but these and make great nail art! Do it for me...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried nail stamping before but I got these plates hoping they&#x27;d be easy and they totally are! I love the variety and can&#x27;t wait to find reasons to use each and every one of the designs on my friends and family. So awesome!!</li>
            <li> Great set of stamps! Bought some similar to these another year for Christmas for my daughter, then my niece asked for some this year. I knew just what to buy her! They aren&#x27;t from the same company as the last ones I bought but I love these ones as well. Perfect gift. Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> very good value for the money!!  so many designs, Even has a hummingbird stamp!  remove the blue film on the discs before using~</li>
            <li> I love them they have difentent disigns...all new</li>
            <li> I LOVE it. It works great. It&#x27;s very easy to use. I recommend to those who like having different kinds of designs to choose from.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful, and inclusive set of plates. There are a lot of different patterns, and the quality of the stamps is great. My one complaint is that the edges of the plates themselves are very sharp and there seems to be no reason other than quick production... I would definitely recommend this, though.</li>
            <li> I loved these plates. I am not an expert nail stamper yet, but these have a lot of fun designs and give me a lot to choose from! A few of the stamps are a bit dated for me, but I decided to purchase these plates as opposed to 2013 because of the negative reviews. Thee are very fun and work perfectly.</li>
