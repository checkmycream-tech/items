            <li>Thank you for this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>it perfectly cleans my cc cream(make up) &amp;dirt</li>
            <li>Anyway, good cleanser tho!!!</li>
            <li>but my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>Smells great, feels great.</li>
            <li>I love that I get to test out all these great products from great skincare companies!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like exercise; you want to make sure you stick to it to see the greatest results.</li>
            <li>I have to do 4 pumps to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>If I am going to invest in a good face product it will be something I keep on all day.</li>
            <li>Something that will absorb...like a serum or a good cc cream.</li>
            <li>I did not like the pump but the product is good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great every day cleanser that I&#x27;m sure to reorder.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li>I love this face wash!</li>
            <li>There are no sticky side effects and as I already said, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any real significant improvement to my skins since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>All natural products &amp; my face feels great after use!</li>
            <li>This cleanser has a wonderful citrus scent which I love as well, I love the smell of oranges because they are so fresh and clean -</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s a good, mild cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love that it has Vitamin C because it is so very important to skin care.</li>
            <li>I love being able to use a cleanser and see the difference in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I guess my skin was being resistant to the change initially because this is Awesome!!!</li>
            <li>Ok....</li>
            <li>Furthermore, even when I removed the top, it still took a lot of time to get the solution onto my Shiseido cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to try this because the ingredient list looked better.</li>
            <li>I like more of a orange smell.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like a cleanser like this</li>
            <li>I really love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Azure Naturals has come to be a favorite of mine for skincare items, they have so many different formulas for anything you need, and using a lot of them together is the best way to achieve the desired results.  </li>
            <li>which is why they are used in so many cleaners.  </li>
            <li>so there are no worries - and you will not be dissatisfied with this product :)  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C, Rosehip and Aloe all come together very nicely in this product to give you a great facial cleanser that will leave your face feeling smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and makeup goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>just feels naturally clean!</li>
            <li>I love using the Vitamin C Organic Facial Cleanser in my morning skincare routine it perfectly cleanses, dissolves toxins &amp; impurities and leaves my skin feeling clean, smooth &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li>Great natural cleaner for face.  </li>
            <li>The smell is so sweet and citrus-y that I love cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also a fantastic cleanser!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product along with the toner and moisturizer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>They all feel so light like I am not using anything.</li>
            <li>and I like that it is paraben, alcohol, gluten, GMO free.</li>
            <li>It gives your face a very fresh feel.</li>
            <li>My face didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>3times, i feel squeaky clean on my skin.</li>
            <li>Kinda reminds me of neutrogenia clear skin but better!</li>
            <li>right off of my face!</li>
            <li>I ordered the full line - for morning</li>
            <li>When I recieved the product for my review I noticed right away that it had a pleasant smell, not a soapy medical type smell.</li>
            <li>It smells great and my skin feels soft and clean and not tight before moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I am loyal to Avalon Organics orange face cleaner</li>
            <li>Azure Naturals has become one of my favorites and I love testing out their new products.  </li>
            <li>I love how this product works, and that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; scent, and, after four weeks</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and clean!</li>
            <li>My skin looks young, fresh and blemish free.</li>
            <li>My face felt very soft anf clean after I used it.</li>
            <li>but I think it is because it is just more natural (like natural toothpaste).</li>
            <li>well people of this beautiful planet, these days will be behind you, or at the least..further in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was very simple to use and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Well, thanks to Azure Naturals you can have it in your cleanser too.  </li>
            <li>I expected more from this cleanser after reading the lengthy description and reviews.</li>
            <li>Dries your face too much...</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t lather much</li>
            <li>It was actually very pleasing.</li>
            <li>And when you purchase this product you are getting it risk free with Azure Naturals one year money back guarantee,</li>
            <li>so we can just pump it w/o holding the whole bottle with hands .  </li>
            <li>They sent me their Sweet Orange Infused Vitamin C Organic Facial Cleanser to test out &amp; review and not only does it smell fantastic</li>
            <li>I like the other one better too</li>
            <li>decent smell and does not enlarge my pores too much.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is a terrific however lighting has struck for the second time!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle pumper wasn&#x27;t so tiny and pumped more out in each pump or came in a larger size</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser to anyone.</li>
            <li>and I like using this along with the toner and moisturizer to really help make my face soft.</li>
            <li>I have never had such smooth and soft skin as I do now since I have started using this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I will go back to my long-time facial cleanser because I get more ounces for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Head on over to Amazon and add several Azure Natural products to your cart and really give your skin what it needs!  </li>
            <li>I bought this to clear up my breakouts which it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It is never too early to take care of your skin</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I feel this one doesn&#x27;t make my face as soft and</li>
            <li>Does not over dry and leaves no weird film</li>
            <li>It makes my face look clean, I mean really clean without having the dry,</li>
            <li>After my first ever professional facial, I had to splurge (within reason) on a facial cleanser that would help me keep up that glow and healthy-skin feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Azure Naturals Sweet Orange infused Organic Facial Cleanser for a little over a month.</li>
            <li>I am all for natural products, believe me, but I always find myself washing my face multiple times when using this.</li>
            <li>I may have gone through a stage where it was worse before it got better</li>
            <li>It is easy to pump only if you grab the bottle and pump it out ; otherwise, if you just pump it as make this bottle standing on the floor, the liquid runs down towards the bottom of the bottle!!!</li>
            <li>Overall this has less product and the Avalon more for less money.</li>
            <li>there were a few minor blemishes at first as my skin got used to the new products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 5/26/15 - After thinking about it, this product does seem to control oil a little better than what cleanser I usually use.</li>
            <li>As far as price, my usual one and this one really balances out.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Update 5/26/15 - After thinking about it, this product does seem to control oil a little better than what cleanser I usually use.</li>
            <li> As far as price, my usual one and this one really balances out.</li>
            <li> And it is all natural so there are no parabens and other cancer causing ingredients.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any other features it offers that some reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> ; You peer closer into the mirror slowly going over every pore on your face, tongue in cheek to enlarge certain areas to peer even closer?!</li>
            <li> also recommend ordering the cucumber eye product from the same company and putting it on your cheeks, eyes, and nose for dry climates.</li>
            <li> It made my skin dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out</li>
            <li> I can say after a couple of weeks there is NOTICEABLE difference in sun-related pigmentation/discoloration and a rough patch of skin that formed on my cheek a few months ago (and didn&#x27;t go away with any other skin products is now completely gone.</li>
            <li> I just had to come back and correct my previous assessment of this cleanser.</li>
            <li> but really it&#x27;s not a problem</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I have certainly not &amp;#34;discovered</li>
            <li> I may stay with this product due to the additional ingredients.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way any how.</li>
            <li> and I see a noticeable difference in the dark spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> other problem, which I have reported, had leaked !&lt;</li>
            <li> Gel washes usually leave my face very dry, but this one does not.  </li>
            <li> It takes 7-8 pumps to get enough out of the bottle&#x27;s small opening to clean my face, which I find annoying</li>
            <li> This also acts as a toner for your skin, making it firm and younger-looking.  </li>
            <li> My usual lasts about 6 months.</li>
            <li> The bottle is simply not appropriate for this solution.</li>
            <li> I usually have acne</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say about this product.</li>
            <li> have realized through this product I prefer foaming cleanser, or at least some type of suds.</li>
            <li> It is a little weird to try and get used to without the suds.</li>
            <li> but it also doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout any worse.</li>
            <li> Impossible to distribute thick THICK cleanser onto a brush from the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> When I FINALLY got some of it onto my brush, I was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I love that I get to test out all these great products from great skincare companies!  Azure Naturals has become one of my favorites and I love testing out their new products.  They sent me their Sweet Orange Infused Vitamin C Organic Facial Cleanser to test out &amp; review and not only does it smell fantastic it&#x27;s also a fantastic cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;If you follow my blog then you know how crazy I am about Vitamin C and how awesome I think it is.  Well, thanks to Azure Naturals you can have it in your cleanser too.  I love using the Vitamin C Organic Facial Cleanser in my morning skincare routine it perfectly cleanses, dissolves toxins &amp; impurities and leaves my skin feeling clean, smooth &amp; refreshed. Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> I have never had such smooth and soft skin as I do now since I have started using this facial cleanser. The smell is so sweet and citrus-y that I love cleaning my face. It is never too early to take care of your skin and I like using this along with the toner and moisturizer to really help make my face soft. There are no sticky side effects and as I already said, the smell is amazing. I love being able to use a cleanser and see the difference in just a couple of days. It&#x27;s like exercise; you want to make sure you stick to it to see the greatest results. And it is all natural so there are no parabens and other cancer causing ingredients. As a 2x cancer survivor, that is a big plus for me.  Go order yours today!</li>
            <li> It made my skin dry. Won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> After my first ever professional facial, I had to splurge (within reason) on a facial cleanser that would help me keep up that glow and healthy-skin feeling. I love how this product works, and that it&#x27;s all natural. Keeps the skin feeling soft. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month. It works. I have to do 4 pumps to get a good lather. I haven&#x27;t noticed any other features it offers that some reviewers have mentioned. I will go back to my long-time facial cleanser because I get more ounces for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/26/15 - After thinking about it, this product does seem to control oil a little better than what cleanser I usually use. I also tried 2 pumps, and it was plenty. I may stay with this product due to the additional ingredients. I think I&#x27;ll try the moisturizer as well. As far as price, my usual one and this one really balances out. My usual lasts about 6 months. I have a feeling this one will too.</li>
            <li> I ordered the full line - for morning I use the Vitamin C toner, Vitamin C serum and Vitamin C moisturizer, plus the cucumber eye. in the evening I use the Vitamin C toner, Retinol serum and Retinol moisturizer plus the cucumber eye. I also purchased the Vitamin C cleanser but I haven&#x27;t been using it yet as I finish up another cleanser. there were a few minor blemishes at first as my skin got used to the new products. I can say after a couple of weeks there is NOTICEABLE difference in sun-related pigmentation/discoloration and a rough patch of skin that formed on my cheek a few months ago (and didn&#x27;t go away with any other skin products is now completely gone. I use a Clarisonic daily. there&#x27;s been no issue with irritation or dryness. My skin feels very soft and makeup goes on beautifully. My forehead lines appear to be smoothing out and my eye crinkles do as well. for the affordable price I am REALLY IMPRESSED. I will keep ordering.</li>
            <li> *****UPDATE*** I just had to come back and correct my previous assessment of this cleanser. I was wrong! Very wrong! I guess my skin was being resistant to the change initially because this is Awesome!!! After washing my face I have an instant glow. Plain and simple. It makes my face look clean, I mean really clean without having the dry, ( I just lost a battle with with this morning&#x27;s pancake mix) look. Have you ever washed your face, looked in the mirror and felt like &amp;#34;something isn&#x27;t rigtht!&amp;#34; You peer closer into the mirror slowly going over every pore on your face, tongue in cheek to enlarge certain areas to peer even closer?! No? that&#x27;s just me? Ok....well people of this beautiful planet, these days will be behind you, or at the least..further in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have realized through this product I prefer foaming cleanser, or at least some type of suds. It is a little weird to try and get used to without the suds. I am all for natural products, believe me, but I always find myself washing my face multiple times when using this. By the way, I don&#x27;t wear make up but maybe 3-4 times a month so that doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with it, nor do I have &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin. I use aloe vera gel and rosewater for a toner and vitamin C serum/Hyaluronic acid for my skin care. I will not repurchase this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Whhhaaaatt?? Impossible to distribute thick THICK cleanser onto a brush from the pump bottle. The bottle is simply not appropriate for this solution. EXTREMELY difficult to use. Furthermore, even when I removed the top, it still took a lot of time to get the solution onto my Shiseido cleansing brush. When I FINALLY got some of it onto my brush, I was very disappointed. My face didn&#x27;t feel clean. Back to the Organic Marshmallow Cleanser for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is a terrific however lighting has struck for the second time!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Due to below zero temps, my product was frozen because the mailman left it on my porch !&lt;br /&gt;My other problem, which I have reported, had leaked !&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I needed to let you know because I NEVER want your reputation to be compromised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Sheila Jones</li>
            <li> This product works okay. I haven&#x27;t seen any real significant improvement to my skins since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Azure Naturals Sweet Orange infused Organic Facial Cleanser for a little over a month. I expected more from this cleanser after reading the lengthy description and reviews. It takes 7-8 pumps to get enough out of the bottle&#x27;s small opening to clean my face, which I find annoying and it doesn&#x27;t foam for me (not that it has to). I&#x27;m not crazy about the &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; scent, and, after four weeks, I don&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin. Perhaps that will come with longer use.  I have certainly not &amp;#34;discovered nature&#x27;s brilliance,&amp;#34; as was advertised. That said, it&#x27;s a good, mild cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product along with the toner and moisturizer is fantastic. My skin looks young, fresh and blemish free. It does not feel like it is cleaning but my skin looks great. I usually have acne but no longer do. I may have gone through a stage where it was worse before it got better but it may have been clearing my pores or another cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend ordering the cucumber eye product from the same company and putting it on your cheeks, eyes, and nose for dry climates. The moisturizer was not enough until I started doing this. They all feel so light like I am not using anything.</li>
            <li> Dries your face too much...</li>
            <li> Gel washes usually leave my face very dry, but this one does not.  The only thing preventing me from giving this a 5 star rating is that&lt;br /&gt;it burns my eyes.  Works well with the Azure Naturals moisturizer....I am on my second one of those and will purchase this cleanser again.</li>
            <li> I am loyal to Avalon Organics orange face cleaner and I wanted to try this because the ingredient list looked better. I feel this one doesn&#x27;t make my face as soft and I like more of a orange smell. It also doesn&#x27;t lather much but I think it is because it is just more natural (like natural toothpaste). Overall this has less product and the Avalon more for less money. I like the other one better too so I will not buy this again. If I am going to invest in a good face product it will be something I keep on all day. Something that will absorb...like a serum or a good cc cream.</li>
            <li> I got an allergic reaction to this product. I started getting pimples and then realized it was the facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like a cleanser like this but I was very wrong. It mademy skin look great! When I recieved the product for my review I noticed right away that it had a pleasant smell, not a soapy medical type smell. It was actually very pleasing. It was very simple to use and easy to apply. It literally melted the make up and dirt right off of my face! My face felt very soft anf clean after I used it. It gives your face a very fresh feel. I love that it has Vitamin C because it is so very important to skin care. I highly recommend this cleanser to anyone. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and I like that it is paraben, alcohol, gluten, GMO free. It&#x27;s not tested on animals either!</li>
            <li> I really love this cleanser. It smells great and my skin feels soft and clean and not tight before moisturizing. It&#x27;s a great every day cleanser that I&#x27;m sure to reorder.</li>
            <li> I did not like the pump but the product is good</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say about this product. I have used it for months and I see no difference.</li>
            <li> Great natural cleaner for face.  Leaves my skin feeling soft and clean!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! All natural products &amp; my face feels great after use! Does not over dry and leaves no weird film just feels naturally clean! Smells great, feels great. I wish the bottle pumper wasn&#x27;t so tiny and pumped more out in each pump or came in a larger size but really it&#x27;s not a problem just my only critique. A small amount goes a long way any how. Thank you for this wonderful product! Kinda reminds me of neutrogenia clear skin but better!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C, Rosehip and Aloe all come together very nicely in this product to give you a great facial cleanser that will leave your face feeling smooth and refreshed.  And knowing that every time you use it you are also helping repair your skin and help to stop the signs of aging.  This also acts as a toner for your skin, making it firm and younger-looking.  Azure Naturals has come to be a favorite of mine for skincare items, they have so many different formulas for anything you need, and using a lot of them together is the best way to achieve the desired results.  This cleanser has a wonderful citrus scent which I love as well, I love the smell of oranges because they are so fresh and clean - which is why they are used in so many cleaners.  And when you purchase this product you are getting it risk free with Azure Naturals one year money back guarantee, so there are no worries - and you will not be dissatisfied with this product :)  Head on over to Amazon and add several Azure Natural products to your cart and really give your skin what it needs!  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and smells wonderful.  Even my hubby loves it.  Has cleared both our skin up and I see a noticeable difference in the dark spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> it does not irrate my senstivie skin, acne-prone skin. it perfectly cleans my cc cream(make up) &amp;dirt IF i wash it 2-3 times througly by rubbing my face(if i wash 2-3times, i feel squeaky clean on my skin. but while i do that, for some spot on my face, i have to scratch out my liquid make up cuz it does not remove my make up if i don&#x27;t do that ). decent smell and does not enlarge my pores too much. HOWEVER, i agree to people who didnt like this product&#x27;s pump; i hope they change the pump and the only thing i do not like is, the pump.  It is easy to pump only if you grab the bottle and pump it out ; otherwise, if you just pump it as make this bottle standing on the floor, the liquid runs down towards the bottom of the bottle!!! i hope they make those pump protruded and bigger so we can just pump it w/o holding the whole bottle with hands .  Anyway, good cleanser tho!!! this is the keeper.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue. I bought this to clear up my breakouts which it doesn&#x27;t but it also doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout any worse. It leaves my skin feeling very clean.</li>
