            <li>Real easy to use.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m very pleased with my manicure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly well versed in doing my nails on my own, too (have been doing them for 31 years).</li>
            <li>I love the look of these nails!  </li>
            <li>I am SO glad I did!</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gel/uv manicures for months and months</li>
            <li>We own a computer repair shop where we also make custom vinyl signs.</li>
            <li>We own a computer repair shop where we also make custom vinyl signs.</li>
            <li>French manicure comes out beautiful and perfect, totally in love with them</li>
            <li>I love the finish and how easy it was to do!</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use this at all.</li>
            <li>a top coat and this lasts over a week with NO chips).</li>
            <li>I even put on two top coats because I know my nails get a lot of damage from typing all day.</li>
            <li>The stickers then do not come to the top of the nail.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s about how many it takes to get all 10 nails done WITHOUT cracking.</li>
            <li>There is no timer that alerts you, no ability to program the lamp,and the lamp is not intuitive and able to shut itself off after 30 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no timer that alerts you, no ability to program the lamp,and the lamp is not intuitive and able to shut itself off after 30 seconds.    </li>
            <li>But so far so good!  </li>
            <li>They provide a clean crisp line, and the nails look great.  </li>
            <li>I spent a while making sure they were perfect</li>
            <li>so I found the tips easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They do have a strong adhesive so they will stick to anything they touch.</li>
            <li>If your preference is straight-up color, you should do fine.</li>
            <li>The general product is great; I&#x27;ve had no problem with applying colors and having it last and look great.</li>
            <li>If I got them on, pressed them securely to the nail then when I filed in a downward motion it tore the tips</li>
            <li>So doing this free hand is outta the question.</li>
            <li>This kit has been a great help, and I plan to repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li>just the color itself is beautiful, it&#x27;s a light wash of pink.</li>
            <li>I bought these strips and was excited to try them out.</li>
            <li>It just takes some practice, but well worth it!</li>
            <li>First, you have to organize the starter kits contents, and read the instructions repeatedly to make sure you don&#x27;t miss anything.</li>
            <li>As a full time mom and full time working woman I do gel manicures to save time-</li>
            <li>I watched the Sensational French Tip video.  </li>
            <li>They are super tacky and melt on to your finger when adhered.</li>
            <li>It sticks like Super Glue.</li>
            <li>It may not be as perfect as the little stickies, but in the end, it&#x27;ll last longer and look better.</li>
            <li>With a little patience, I was able to get sensational looking nails the fist time done.  </li>
            <li>Glued them on first and then used the uv gel polish and light from this kit.</li>
            <li>The sticker are very brittle and crack easily.  </li>
            <li>My nails have always been strong and fast</li>
            <li>My nails have always been strong and fast growing.    </li>
            <li>Fingers (with pretty nails) crossed!</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;ve had some fun keeping the Sensationail application as a \\&quot;base\\&quot; and applying \\&quot;regular\\&quot; nail polish over the Sensationail.</li>
            <li>Also worth mentioning -</li>
            <li>Yes it does take practice and patience - but worth it when I&#x27;m not blowing $35 bucks on a manicure each time at the salon.</li>
            <li>I like having my nails done professionally, because I love the relaxation of it</li>
            <li>- they are the precise tip, looks clean, polished, professionally done, and you can&#x27;t get a straighter line.</li>
            <li>You did buy one, right?</li>
            <li>You did buy one, right?</li>
            <li>They peel right off.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried Senationail</li>
            <li>I also have the same problems as most of the reviewers.  </li>
            <li>24 hrs before the next shower, applying extra coat on top, making sure tips are sealed -</li>
            <li>If anyone has any suggestions for alternatives for a workable gel french manicure, I&#x27;d love to know.</li>
            <li>Like I said its not difficult or immposible, it just takes patience and practice.</li>
            <li>And if you need more help just go to utube and type in sensatioNail french manicure and there&#x27;s a demo video that explains everything.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My shellac nail appointments were the first cut.</li>
            <li>You want to make sure where you place them is where you want them-because there is no turning back.  </li>
            <li>If it crosses those lines, it will be more likely to not seal.  </li>
            <li>It really looks like a salon manicure!</li>
            <li>I mean, perfect french manicure?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the 2 positive reviews on this site.  </li>
            <li>(The one hand is lifting a little, so I dont recommend leaving out the primer step on purpose :)  Bottom line, it is staying on better than regular nail polish</li>
            <li>They looked great when I finished, however a few hours later I took a shower.  </li>
            <li>You just have to be gentle when you peel the white tips off the plastic and use a light hand.</li>
            <li>The problem with these is that as you&#x27;re putting them on the nail they get very brittle and crack into pieces and tear while you&#x27;re buffing the edge off of them.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really just making do until I want to redo them.  </li>
            <li>The are very sticky.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a suggestion - if they are true - please record yourself applying and filing the white tips, and post it on YouTube.  </li>
            <li>Goes to show that for the average person, this doesn&#x27;t work at all, but we&#x27;d love it to work.  </li>
            <li>I ruined many strips because filing the edge caused the strip to crack upwards, and yes I was filing down as the instructions indicated.</li>
            <li>I love French manicures, and I am used to doing them freehand which as others have mentioned can be messy and often times difficult to get that perfect edge.</li>
            <li>daughter (high schooler)</li>
            <li>I bought this with high hopes.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t normal for me.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t normal for me.</li>
            <li>it started chipping the 2nd day into my manicure, and 4 days later the white tips were all cracked &amp; peeling not to mention catching in my hair &amp; snagging on everything.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to keep the product from touching your cuticles or skin when applying the gel.</li>
            <li>Also, because it&#x27;s a pain to take this stuff off, and I expected to be able to keep this manicure a couple weeks, I went out and got some white gel polish to do touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>Just after the first shower, the white tips start to peel off, a lot.</li>
            <li>I love the Sensationail polishes, but the French manicure is not worth it.</li>
            <li>These are in a sealed packet, closed off from light, and actually gel polish.</li>
            <li>I really like the look of a french manicure though</li>
            <li>Far out, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Far out, huh?    </li>
            <li>So far my nails have lasted for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>(kitten heel, it&#x27;s a creamy hot pink color).</li>
            <li>I think if there was a white polish included instead of stickers this would get 5 stars and be so much easier to apply and would last longer.</li>
            <li>this is my first time ever reviewing ANY product - positive or negative.  </li>
            <li>I found them a little tricky to get the hang of, but once you do its not bad at all-especially if you are used to free-handing your french manicure.  </li>
            <li>and I am pretty sure they won&#x27;t last more than a few hours :(</li>
            <li>Might as well just buy white polish and the clear coat.</li>
            <li>I hope they keep making these, I get compliments on my french tips a lot, and they&#x27;re surprised</li>
            <li>But the white polish doesn&#x27;t have as complete coverage, so</li>
            <li>I applied one coat of sheer pink, then the white tip, followed by another coat of sheer pink then top coat.</li>
            <li>After the first 2 nails I got it down.</li>
            <li>It took me nearly two hours to get the white french tip stickers on.</li>
            <li>Not as pink as it looks on the box and the white tips don&#x27;t stay on very well.</li>
            <li>So, after lots of meticulous frustrating application, I had an OK looking outcome THAT DOESN&#x27;T LAST (and yes, I did cap the tips).  </li>
            <li>I used the light pink that came with the starter kit--truly not a very nice color.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I&#x27;ve NEVER left a bad review for anything online-- until now.</li>
            <li>First off the sheer pink color is called baby doll pink and</li>

            <li> Far out, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Far out, huh?    </li>
            <li> So far my nails have lasted for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> (kitten heel, it&#x27;s a creamy hot pink color).</li>
            <li> I think if there was a white polish included instead of stickers this would get 5 stars and be so much easier to apply and would last longer.</li>
            <li> this is my first time ever reviewing ANY product - positive or negative.  </li>
            <li> I found them a little tricky to get the hang of, but once you do its not bad at all-especially if you are used to free-handing your french manicure.  </li>
            <li> and I am pretty sure they won&#x27;t last more than a few hours :(</li>
            <li> Might as well just buy white polish and the clear coat.</li>
            <li> I hope they keep making these, I get compliments on my french tips a lot, and they&#x27;re surprised</li>
            <li> But the white polish doesn&#x27;t have as complete coverage, so</li>
            <li> I applied one coat of sheer pink, then the white tip, followed by another coat of sheer pink then top coat.</li>
            <li> After the first 2 nails I got it down.</li>
            <li> It took me nearly two hours to get the white french tip stickers on.</li>
            <li> Not as pink as it looks on the box and the white tips don&#x27;t stay on very well.</li>
            <li> So, after lots of meticulous frustrating application, I had an OK looking outcome THAT DOESN&#x27;T LAST (and yes, I did cap the tips).  </li>
            <li> I used the light pink that came with the starter kit--truly not a very nice color.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I&#x27;ve NEVER left a bad review for anything online-- until now.</li>
            <li> First off the sheer pink color is called baby doll pink and</li>
            <li> Firstly the tips are extremely hard to file off without tearing.</li>
            <li> And even the sheer pink over the white tip as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to stick-on French manicure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with Sensationail&#x27;s other products, but these tips are crap.  </li>
            <li> By the next day several had peeled partly off--from tiny nicks to half the tip.</li>
            <li> It dosn&#x27;t stay on it cost way too much money its hard to get the stickers on your nails and its hard to get them to file off in a straight line.</li>
            <li> they last longer and don&#x27;t take especially long.</li>
            <li> The pink has lasted longer than the french manicure.</li>
            <li> I took it upon myself to take the white stickers off and just wore the pink polish.</li>
            <li> (Thought in the long run it would pay for itself and save me</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll just use clear or pale pink polish without the tips.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, although it seems dumb to me to apply the strip after applying polish and wiping it (with Sally Hansen polish strips you first apply the strip then</li>
            <li> The nail polish stays on like sensationail&#x27;s other nail polish but the white tips continue to chip and come off.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviews on here about the white tips.</li>
            <li> The French Tips, for lack of a better word (and because I still harbor residual anger) ....are stickers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had them on for a few days, and it&#x27;s already starting to chip at the tip of the nail.</li>
            <li> the white tips look cheap and tacky, the sheer pink base color might as well be clear.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t show this particular part, not surprisingly.  </li>
            <li> the harder it is to apply without it tearing at the tip.</li>
            <li> I wasted almost an entire evening doing my nails tonight</li>
            <li> loaded the dishwasher- hands got slightly wet</li>
            <li> I bought the kit with pink chiffon a few days before this and used the french manicure before using the pink chiffon color.</li>
            <li> Press the French tips firmly and file away excess.</li>
            <li> I tried to put a tip on a nail, and spent the rest of the time trying to scrape off the parts of the tips that adhered to my skin.</li>
            <li> As far as the french tip product goes, I&#x27;m hugely disappointed (not to mention suspicious of the one positive review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very frustrating to spend that much time for it to not last for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> First off don&#x27;t pay any attention to any of the dramatic reviews down below...</li>
            <li> When the other products do start to chip, they chip at the cuticle end of the nail.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the sticky residue as mentioned in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I recently got the french manicure starter kit as well as one gel polish, I originally tried the french manicure and it was awful!</li>
            <li> but I decided to try the other polish I got beforehand</li>
            <li> The polishes are amazing, but French manicure is terrible.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other negative reviews for the Sensationail french manicure.</li>
            <li> All of my other Sensationail products don&#x27;t start chipping for about a week and half.</li>
            <li> The white tips are hard to put on.</li>
            <li> They slide down my nail, crack all over, etc.  </li>
            <li> so it melts down once applied to nail.</li>
            <li> No matter how careful you are, it is not easy to do.</li>
            <li> in the morning, I got out of the shower and half of them had peeled and chipped already.  </li>
            <li> It was so difficult to properly apply the French tips, that I had to call my husband into the room to help me.</li>
            <li> Freehand white polish can look horrible, and messy -I&#x27;ve been there too many times.</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of a learning curve to putting these on, but I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The stickers are a little tricky.  </li>
            <li> final note is that since using Sensationail, my nails are weak, thin, and VERY short.</li>

            <li> But remember how hard it is to keep the gel off your skin?</li>
            <li> The stickers have little broken lines through them.  </li>
            <li> So incredibly annoying, they took forever to stick, filing the excess away caused little chips at the bottom of the nail, and they lasted for about two days before the white started chipping away.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only been two hours :(</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed and actually thought about returning the set</li>

            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I finished peeling them off and will be disposing of the stickers.</li>

            <li> Sure it may take some practice for the best technique for applying, but it beats paying someone else to do my nails!  With a little patience, I was able to get sensational looking nails the fist time done.  Try using tweezers to take the stickers off and place onto your nail. I highly recommend this product and disregard the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use this at all. Every white piece just breaks apart when I try to place it on my nail.  A waste of money and going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I love French manicures, and I am used to doing them freehand which as others have mentioned can be messy and often times difficult to get that perfect edge. I bought these strips and was excited to try them out. I followed the instructions, although it seems dumb to me to apply the strip after applying polish and wiping it (with Sally Hansen polish strips you first apply the strip then a top coat and this lasts over a week with NO chips). Firstly the tips are extremely hard to file off without tearing. I ruined many strips because filing the edge caused the strip to crack upwards, and yes I was filing down as the instructions indicated. I even put on two top coats because I know my nails get a lot of damage from typing all day. Well it started chipping without me even having typed anything. I got up the next morning and 6 of my nails already had damage on the end; something I have never seen happen with regular gel polish. I am disappointed in this product and will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> As far as the french tip product goes, I&#x27;m hugely disappointed (not to mention suspicious of the one positive review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter (high schooler) and I started using the Sensationail products after Christmas.  I do her nails and they last for 3 weeks at a time!  Toward the end of the 2nd week, it is obvious that her nails are growing out so we&#x27;ve had some fun keeping the Sensationail application as a \\&quot;base\\&quot; and applying \\&quot;regular\\&quot; nail polish over the Sensationail. The first time I tried Senationail I used the light pink that came with the starter kit--truly not a very nice color.  So, I too did the polish over.  What was great however was that I didn&#x27;t have to file my nails once in the 2 weeks I wore the polish.  My nails got longer and looked great.  They never snagged or caught on any fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my second attempt, I tried the French Nails kit.  DON&#x27;T USE IT!!  It took over an hour to apply the stickers.  The box says 100 but you get 6 packets of stickers of varying sizes so don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be getting 9-10 manicures out of it.  The sticker are very brittle and crack easily.  Once they crack, they stick to everything (except my nail).  And then the filing to eliminate the excess is a horrible idea.  The stickers then do not come to the top of the nail.  So, after lots of meticulous frustrating application, I had an OK looking outcome THAT DOESN&#x27;T LAST (and yes, I did cap the tips).  The stickers have little broken lines through them.  By the next day, the stickers were coming off, getting caught in my hair, and leaving a sticky residue on my nails.  Needless to say, I finished peeling them off and will be disposing of the stickers.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel/uv manicures for months and months and it&#x27;s a relaxing ritual for me- until tonight. It took me nearly two hours to get the white french tip stickers on. The problem with these is that as you&#x27;re putting them on the nail they get very brittle and crack into pieces and tear while you&#x27;re buffing the edge off of them. I thought they were generous providing 100 tips- no... that&#x27;s about how many it takes to get all 10 nails done WITHOUT cracking. The wider the nail the harder it is to apply without it tearing at the tip. It took me 10 attempts to do my thumb. I am so incredibly disappointed by this product :( I am pretty sure I&#x27;ve NEVER left a bad review for anything online-- until now. Please please don&#x27;t waste your money. As a full time mom and full time working woman I do gel manicures to save time- they last longer and don&#x27;t take especially long. I wasted almost an entire evening doing my nails tonight and I am pretty sure they won&#x27;t last more than a few hours :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** update ****&lt;br /&gt;Just loaded the dishwasher- hands got slightly wet and I already have chipping on the tips- three of them- it&#x27;s only been two hours :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the 2 positive reviews on this site.  Here&#x27;s a suggestion - if they are true - please record yourself applying and filing the white tips, and post it on YouTube.  Put the link on this site.  I also have the same problems as most of the reviewers.  Everything is great until I try to file the tips.  They slide down my nail, crack all over, etc.  I watched the Sensational French Tip video.  Not helpful.  They don&#x27;t show this particular part, not surprisingly.  Also worth mentioning - this is my first time ever reviewing ANY product - positive or negative.  Goes to show that for the average person, this doesn&#x27;t work at all, but we&#x27;d love it to work.  If you are successful, please help.</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of a learning curve to putting these on, but I got the hang of it. I&#x27;ve only had them on for a few days, and it&#x27;s already starting to chip at the tip of the nail. All of my other Sensationail products don&#x27;t start chipping for about a week and half. When the other products do start to chip, they chip at the cuticle end of the nail. I have to say that I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes. I mean, perfect french manicure? yes! but I did my nails one time with this and I&#x27;ll never use these tips again. So incredibly annoying, they took forever to stick, filing the excess away caused little chips at the bottom of the nail, and they lasted for about two days before the white started chipping away. I bought the kit with pink chiffon a few days before this and used the french manicure before using the pink chiffon color. I now have a few pink chiffon nails after getting so frustrated with the tips that I had to redo that I just gave up and painted four of my nails pink. The pink has lasted longer than the french manicure. Might as well just buy white polish and the clear coat. It may not be as perfect as the little stickies, but in the end, it&#x27;ll last longer and look better.</li>
            <li> Some of these reviews seem to have a flare for the dramatic. What&#x27;s awesome about these tips - is just that - they are the precise tip, looks clean, polished, professionally done, and you can&#x27;t get a straighter line. Freehand white polish can look horrible, and messy -I&#x27;ve been there too many times. The tips are not stickers. These are in a sealed packet, closed off from light, and actually gel polish. They are super tacky and melt on to your finger when adhered. Yes it does take practice and patience - but worth it when I&#x27;m not blowing $35 bucks on a manicure each time at the salon. I&#x27;m back for another set and each manicure lasts me 12+ days. I hope they keep making these, I get compliments on my french tips a lot, and they&#x27;re surprised I did them myself.</li>
            <li> I got this product for 10 bucks at Walmart. The white tips are stickers and I kept having problems with mine tearing and not sticking properly, which began to chip shortly thereafter. I took it upon myself to take the white stickers off and just wore the pink polish. They did look awesome for a minute tho and from a distance. I think if there was a white polish included instead of stickers this would get 5 stars and be so much easier to apply and would last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to stick-on French manicure so I found the tips easy to apply. Press the French tips firmly and file away excess. French manicure comes out beautiful and perfect, totally in love with them but they don&#x27;t last. Just after the first shower, the white tips start to peel off, a lot. I had to file my nails to get rid of the peeled tips. I tried different tricks - applying tips after shower to give it approx 24 hrs before the next shower, applying extra coat on top, making sure tips are sealed - but nothing works. Still only last 1 day for me. I don&#x27;t have this problem with regular colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using gel polish for a while now, but recently invested for myself.  I&#x27;ve been happy with Sensationail&#x27;s other products, but these tips are crap.  They are difficult to put on.  My nails looked great the night I did them... in the morning, I got out of the shower and half of them had peeled and chipped already.  Very frustrating to spend that much time for it to not last for 24 hours.  Also, because it&#x27;s a pain to take this stuff off, and I expected to be able to keep this manicure a couple weeks, I went out and got some white gel polish to do touch-ups.  But the white polish doesn&#x27;t have as complete coverage, so it&#x27;s really just making do until I want to redo them.  Some of the tips are still chipping despite the touch-ups, too.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other negative reviews for the Sensationail french manicure. The general product is great; I&#x27;ve had no problem with applying colors and having it last and look great. Not so the white tips. They took forever to apply and started peeling almost immediately. By the next day several had peeled partly off--from tiny nicks to half the tip. If anyone has any suggestions for alternatives for a workable gel french manicure, I&#x27;d love to know. Don&#x27;t bother with this one if you don&#x27;t want to spend your life at it.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple times with this product and I have been disappointed each time. The nail polish stays on like sensationail&#x27;s other nail polish but the white tips continue to chip and come off. The white tips are hard to put on. They do not stay on. I was greatly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I tried the starter kit (solid color) about 2 weeks ago.  Real easy to use.  My nails came out great. Lasted 10 days. I really like the look of a french manicure though...gathered all the supplies and struggled through applying the white tips.  The shredded and tore, sometimes before I could apply them to my nail.  If I got them on, pressed them securely to the nail then when I filed in a downward motion it tore the tips and I had to reapply.  They looked great when I finished, however a few hours later I took a shower.  After drying off I noticed that the tips were coming off...one was totally off the others were lifting from the tip.  A waste of money and a waste of time.  Next time I&#x27;ll just use clear or pale pink polish without the tips.</li>
            <li> First off don&#x27;t pay any attention to any of the dramatic reviews down below... This is an amazing product and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product! And will definitely repurchase in the future. First off the sheer pink color is called baby doll pink and just the color itself is beautiful, it&#x27;s a light wash of pink. I would almost compare it to china glaze innocence. I applied one coat of sheer pink, then the white tip, followed by another coat of sheer pink then top coat. And I&#x27;m very pleased with my manicure and I also used these on my toes. You just have to be gentle when you peel the white tips off the plastic and use a light hand. They do have a strong adhesive so they will stick to anything they touch. That&#x27;s because this is actual gel polish so it melts down once applied to nail. It just takes some practice, but well worth it! It beats using those nail tip guides which I could never use. I broke my wrist yrs ago and it has not been the same since. It shakes like a leaf! So doing this free hand is outta the question. This kit has been a great help, and I plan to repurchase in the future. And I would recommend this to all friends. Like I said its not difficult or immposible, it just takes patience and practice. After the first 2 nails I got it down. And if you need more help just go to utube and type in sensatioNail french manicure and there&#x27;s a demo video that explains everything. Just try it and I promise you won&#x27;t regret it! Good luck ;)</li>
            <li> I like having my nails done professionally, because I love the relaxation of it and I know my nails will look awesome when I leave. I&#x27;m fairly well versed in doing my nails on my own, too (have been doing them for 31 years). With the economy sucking like it does, I&#x27;ve had to trim back expenses like everyone else. My shellac nail appointments were the first cut. My God, do I regret that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only do French manicures, so I purchased the Sensashucrap French Nail Tips along with the overly-priced starter kit. (Thought in the long run it would pay for itself and save me money.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A PROCESS. Grab your readers and a comfy chair. May as well pour yourself a stiff drink, too. (You will need it.) First, you have to organize the starter kits contents, and read the instructions repeatedly to make sure you don&#x27;t miss anything. In all, the instructions aren&#x27;t that bad, you just have to pay attention. If your preference is straight-up color, you should do fine. If you&#x27;re planning on doing French tips? I don&#x27;t know how else to say this......you&#x27;re screwed, and good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s not easy to keep the product from touching your cuticles or skin when applying the gel. No matter how careful you are, it is not easy to do. There&#x27;s a reason why they want you to avoid those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The French Tips, for lack of a better word (and because I still harbor residual anger) ....are stickers. The goal is to peel the different sized stickers from the paper and match them to your nail. But remember how hard it is to keep the gel off your skin? You may THINK you did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t think that for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The French Tips stick to EVERYTHING. It&#x27;s a complete mess. I tried to put a tip on a nail, and spent the rest of the time trying to scrape off the parts of the tips that adhered to my skin. It sticks like Super Glue. I used the word \\&quot;SCRAPE\\&quot;, and I wasn&#x27;t exaggerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It was so difficult to properly apply the French tips, that I had to call my husband into the room to help me. We had to scrape the crap off him, too. We own a computer repair shop where we also make custom vinyl signs. My husband thought it would have been easier to apply the vinyl to my nails. I can&#x27;t argue with his logic, because looking at my nails, I could have dipped them in pig s*** and thought they were prettier. (Sorry. My honesty isn&#x27;t meant to offend. But you try and apply those stupid tips, and you&#x27;ll be amazed what words come flowing out of you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* In regards to the UV lamp supplied with the starter kit: I advise you to watch a YouTube video on how to use it, because the instructions leave out a lot in that area. I had to use the UV lamp for periods of 30 seconds and 60 seconds to cure. There is no timer that alerts you, no ability to program the lamp,and the lamp is not intuitive and able to shut itself off after 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* So. There you are, and your nails are a flipping train wreck. Guess what. You get to flash that trashy look for the next couple weeks. Far out, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Get out your SensashuScraper. You did buy one, right? Because you cannot remove this crap without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final note is that since using Sensationail, my nails are weak, thin, and VERY short. I&#x27;m talking, PAINFULLY short. This isn&#x27;t normal for me. My nails have always been strong and fast growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line,I will never buy this stuff again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.help me.

I had to use the UV lamp for periods of 30 seconds and 60 seconds to cure. There is no timer that alerts you, no ability to program the lamp,and the lamp is not intuitive and able to shut itself off after 30 seconds.    * So. There you are, and your nails are a flipping train wreck. Guess what. You get to flash that trashy look for the next couple weeks. Far out, huh?    * Get out your SensashuScraper. You did buy one, right? Because you cannot remove this crap without it.    My final note is that since using Sensationail, my nails are weak, thin, and VERY short. I&#x27;m talking, PAINFULLY short. This isn&#x27;t normal for me. My nails have always been strong and fast growing.    Bottom line,I will never buy this stuff again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.</li>
            <li> It dosn&#x27;t stay on it cost way too much money its hard to get the stickers on your nails and its hard to get them to file off in a straight line. I would not tell my friends about this product</li>
            <li> I love the Sensationail polishes, but the French manicure is not worth it. it started chipping the 2nd day into my manicure, and 4 days later the white tips were all cracked &amp; peeling not to mention catching in my hair &amp; snagging on everything.  The polishes are amazing, but French manicure is terrible.</li>
            <li> Not as pink as it looks on the box and the white tips don&#x27;t stay on very well. Polish stayed on though.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviews on here about the white tips. I spent a while making sure they were perfect but they didn&#x27;t even last 2 days! So I got the white tips from somewhere else. Glued them on first and then used the uv gel polish and light from this kit. It worked perfectly ! The gel formula and color and everything else in this kit is perfect it&#x27;s just the tips .. They peel right off. But use my method and it&#x27;ll last we&#x27;ll over 2 weeks!!</li>
            <li> I love the look of these nails!  I found them a little tricky to get the hang of, but once you do its not bad at all-especially if you are used to free-handing your french manicure.  I purchased the sensationail kit with the uv light-so cant comment on the quantity of this product.  So far my nails have lasted for 24 hours.  I didn&#x27;t have the sticky residue as mentioned in other reviews.  I put the gel over the white tip. And even the sheer pink over the white tip as well.  I forgot the primer on one hand.  Even with my lack of experience with the product they are still on after 24 hours. (The one hand is lifting a little, so I dont recommend leaving out the primer step on purpose :)  Bottom line, it is staying on better than regular nail polish so I am one happy mamma!  The stickers are a little tricky.  The are very sticky.  You want to make sure where you place them is where you want them-because there is no turning back.  They provide a clean crisp line, and the nails look great.  Also, you can paint your nails with regular polish and then apply the gel.  My sister did this to hers yesterday and hers are still looking great.  The big key is to keep the gel off of your cuticles and the sides of your nails.  If it crosses those lines, it will be more likely to not seal.  I WOULD recommend this product!!!!!  Thanks for solving my painted nails, waste of time problem.  I know it has only been 24 hours.  But so far so good!  Fingers (with pretty nails) crossed!</li>
            <li> I recently got the french manicure starter kit as well as one gel polish, I originally tried the french manicure and it was awful! the white tips look cheap and tacky, the sheer pink base color might as well be clear. I was extremely disappointed and actually thought about returning the set but I decided to try the other polish I got beforehand (kitten heel, it&#x27;s a creamy hot pink color). I am SO glad I did! I love the finish and how easy it was to do! It really looks like a salon manicure! Don&#x27;t bother with the french, go with the colors!</li>
