    <ol>
            <li>Awesome shipping great product!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect for putting my own choice of lip balm (Aquaphor, petroleum jelly, shea butter w/grapesee oil).  </li>
            <li>Great price for the quality and quantity of product.</li>
            <li>perfect to make your own balms</li>
            <li>arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li>Lol, I died laughing when I read the review</li>
            <li>Love it for my DIY lip balm!</li>
            <li>I laughed out loud when I opened the package and said, &amp;#34;Nice!&amp;#34; I just poured my favorite recipe into the tubes and they turned out excellent.  </li>
            <li>The reason that I gave it three stars is that in the photo, the cap is a rounded piece that I consider hip and stylish.</li>
            <li>I order from China regularly and more often than not, get awesome products..</li>
            <li>I wanted tubes with a rounded top like it shows, they are ridged.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my product.</li>
            <li>Love these tubes, great quality, arrived on time, great to have quite a few</li>
            <li>Good product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Other than that, great looking!</li>
            <li>which is fine</li>
            <li>yes, they take a longer but for the price it is usually worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Good quality and came before it was due.</li>
            <li>so I can do many batches of different flavors.</li>
            <li>The one I have used so far, is working fine, and I expect it to be useful for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and sleek.</li>
            <li>These are super cool because they are black but the lids do not stay on snugly like you would expect.</li>
            <li>I love these tubes, they did take a little while to arrive (from China), but I&#x27;d ordered during the busy holiday season, around December 15th.</li>
            <li>Worked fabulously, no mess!</li>
            <li>they are all empty, some people really need to read before they click buy!!</li>
            <li>Hello they are advertised as empty, intended for people who make their own chapstick, or other types of homemade lotions/lip products that would go in such a container.  </li>
            <li>I spent some time researching the tubes available on Amazon, and have purchased from other sellers in the past, and these are my favorite so far!</li>
            <li>However, I received the plain old fashioned flat top of years gone by.</li>
            <li>The caps also fall off in your pocket as they are not tightly fitted to the tube.</li>

            <li> found only one that had a top/lid that was a bit loose, but the cap stays on, so no complaints.</li>
            <li> Not the same as what is pictured, they have sharp edged caps.</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t be sending it back for such a small purchase.</li>
            <li> Coming from China, it took a month and a half to get here..</li>
            <li> In this case I was disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Perfect for putting my own choice of lip balm (Aquaphor, petroleum jelly, shea butter w/grapesee oil).  I am not making a bunch of gifts so I didn&#x27;t need to have 25.  The one I have used so far, is working fine, and I expect it to be useful for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> Product came on time with all 25 tops and bottoms. The reason that I gave it three stars is that in the photo, the cap is a rounded piece that I consider hip and stylish. However, I received the plain old fashioned flat top of years gone by. I wouldn&#x27;t want to use these if your company is in vogue. Coming from China, it took a month and a half to get here..which is fine but I won&#x27;t be sending it back for such a small purchase. I order from China regularly and more often than not, get awesome products..yes, they take a longer but for the price it is usually worth the wait. In this case I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly what I wanted.  Thank you!</li>

Hello they are advertised as empty, intended for people who make their own chapstick, or other types of homemade lotions/lip products that would go in such a container.  I haven&#x27;t gotten them yet, just ordered them today but I couldn&#x27;t resist commenting on that review.</li>
            <li> These are super cool because they are black but the lids do not stay on snugly like you would expect. They are slightly bigger than they need to be. Other than that, great looking!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my product. Thank you!</li>
