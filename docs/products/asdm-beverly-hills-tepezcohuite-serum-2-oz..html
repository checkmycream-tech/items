            <li> I had some strange little bumps around my eyes before using and it has completely gone away.  </li>
            <li> It has a grey color.</li>
            <li> I also like to wear this under my foundation after I let it dry</li>
            <li> No real change noted.</li>
            <li> Have ditched all other products for before make up and for evening after cleansing as this stuff is a one step and you are done kinda thing.</li>
            <li> I have been trying all of these products and must admit that I have nothing negative to say because every product including this one has made a big difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> been using only about two weeks don&#x27;t notice any big differences ill keep using it to see</li>
            <li> but since I started using this, my skin became less irritated.</li>
            <li> The redness after an outbreak would have lasted a week or two, with this it&#x27;s gone in 2 days or less.</li>
            <li> Could not be happier as I won&#x27;t waste my money on anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brown liquid serum that dried &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; on my skin and discolored.</li>
            <li> Put this serum on day and night for the past week</li>
            <li> , I attribute that to excessive sweating from working outdoors in 106 degree heat and not the product.</li>
            <li> not sure I believe</li>
            <li> Thank you for not wasting my hard earned money..</li>
            <li> I too was sucked in by the Selma Hyack story and DAMN if I am not thrilled I read</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I have broken out twice with a few pimples here or there</li>
            <li> so I will continue to remain hopeful that the somewhat faint lines under my eyes&lt;br /&gt;will become less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Whoever said creams are a waste of money is wrong when it come to Tepezcohuite.</li>
            <li> The serum has faded a broken capillary I&#x27;ve had on my nose for some 20yrs..</li>
            <li> At my age, we ladies get that dreaded chicken look and this stuff seems to minimize it.  </li>

            <li> feels good, but not telling any differences after a month of use</li>
            <li> Excellent, does the job</li>
            <li> Very good product I used for a scarf and this is my 1st time using it . the skin color is been change from a dark brown color to light  and little by little start looking better.</li>
            <li> I read about the benefits of Tepezcohuite online (and heck, if Salma Hayak uses it, why not try?), so I decided to give this serum a try.  Wow!!!  With skin care products, I almost never see the results I&#x27;m hoping for, but this serum delivers!  Since I started using it, I have had absolutely NO acne, and my scars are healing up beautifully.  My skin is very moisturized and glowing, and I feel like I look at least 5 years younger.  Now I want to search out all products with Tepezcohuite in them.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!  I&#x27;ve actually used it on my upper eyelids under my brow area as well as on my upper arms.  At my age, we ladies get that dreaded chicken look and this stuff seems to minimize it.  Who knew?????  Going to be ordering a second bottle soon.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve taken a before and after picture because in the first week I&#x27;ve seen results.. Itfeels really smooth going on and leaves a nicelust renewed canvas to apply makeup... The serum has faded a broken capillary I&#x27;ve had on my nose for some 20yrs.. Thank you for not wasting my hard earned money.. Gone are of shopping for the perfect product.. For me THIS IS IT-</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Put this serum on day and night for the past week I notice my skin softer no break outs! Delivery was quick , packaging was excellent will definitely recommend this seller to all my friends.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve mostly just used it on fresh scars but after two days I can already tell a difference! I wish I had taken before and after pictures</li>
            <li> Cannot rate it because it&#x27;s too soon to say. It seems to be healing my sunburned nose wound.</li>
            <li> The healing properties of this serum were incredible!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Clears up problem areas. Even helpful on poison ivy. Not greasy at all. Absorbs right into the skin. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I like how soft my face feels but after 6 days of use so far no dramatic changes have been noticed.</li>
            <li> been using only about two weeks don&#x27;t notice any big differences ill keep using it to see</li>
            <li> So happy I have added this to my beauty arsenal.  Will buy more in the future</li>
            <li> This product is really new to me, I have not used it gor very long.  So far it feels super good on my skin, and my makeup goes on really nice.</li>
            <li> Skin feels taught and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Selma Hyak is right about the ingredient, Tepezcohuite.</li>
            <li> I received this product about 2 weeks ago during my menstrual cycle when my skin was a hot mess but since I started using this, my skin became less irritated. I had doubts at first because of the ingredient-emu oil but so far no negative reaction. This serum makes my face feel silky smooth, calm, and toned. I also like to wear this under my foundation after I let it dry and it feels like a protective barrier, no greasy feeling. It has a grey color. Smells great. I will be doing an update review to see if it works for acne scars, hyper pigmentation, sunburn etc. But so far I think this is worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I truly love the serum--it is lightweight and makes my skin feel smooth...  This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tammi Johnson</li>
            <li> Agrees with my combination skin and has seemed to help keep inflammatory acne away. I love how it soaks into my skin. I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I am really happy so far with this product.  I wash my face at night and apply it before bed (about three pumps).  It&#x27;s smooth and not greasy at all. I had some strange little bumps around my eyes before using and it has completely gone away.  Prior to this I was using coconut oil and was chalking every skin imperfection up to post pregnancy. (ha) But this is great. I think my once a day application will last me for three months and I plan to order more.  My skin is super soft and free of all blemishes and pimples.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Love love love this! My skin is soft and smooth</li>
            <li> It is, what I was looking for. Thanks!!!!!</li>
            <li> Okay.  No real change noted.</li>
            <li> I used it for almost a month and did not see any changes in my skin for the better. If anything, I started breaking out more in the time I was using the product.</li>
            <li> Have not had time to see if itt is helping  or not. Will know later.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. My skin glows. I will continue to purchase this product.  B</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing ! The skin got softer and glowing , I am very happy with the results !</li>
            <li> Love this product, I noticed an immediate difference to my skin. I will definitely buy this again</li>
            <li> It seems to make my skin heal faster if I get a zit and pop it. The redness after an outbreak would have lasted a week or two, with this it&#x27;s gone in 2 days or less.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell - no big improvement</li>
            <li> I too was sucked in by the Selma Hyack story and DAMN if I am not thrilled I read it.&lt;br /&gt;Did the research to see why it worked and what the ingredients were.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line - the results. Simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has taken on a whole other look. Its softer, more supple and definitely make me have a more youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;While I have broken out twice with a few pimples here or there, I attribute that to excessive sweating from working outdoors in 106 degree heat and not the product. Have ditched all other products for before make up and for evening after cleansing as this stuff is a one step and you are done kinda thing. Could not be happier as I won&#x27;t waste my money on anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend who knew I was having skin problems.  I&#x27;ve used this for about a week and have found it very soothing and it has brought down some of the inflammation.  I will continue to use it to see if it continues to work as well.</li>
            <li> Apparently Selma Hayak has never had botox by using this product.  Hmmm ... not sure I believe that.&lt;br /&gt;I am only 1/4 in to this bottle of serum so I will continue to remain hopeful that the somewhat faint lines under my eyes&lt;br /&gt;will become less noticeable.  The product description clearly states it repairs the skin of burn victims; I haven&#x27;t been burned, but if it repairs burn victims skin, it should, in theory, have an affect on minimal lines, right??  I like the feel of the serum, and the price point is fair,  but so far, absolutely no diff in the feel or appearance of my skin.  I am a youthful 50 year old who diligently wears sunscreen on face and body and has excellent diet and nutrition standards.  Would I buy it again?  Jury is still out on this one.</li>
            <li> I have been trying all of these products and must admit that I have nothing negative to say because every product including this one has made a big difference in my skin.  I have sensitive skin and while the item may be a bit pricey it is worth it because the results that it has had on my skin is just over the top!  Whoever said creams are a waste of money is wrong when it come to Tepezcohuite.</li>
            <li> Once again, Tepezcohuite is a fantastic natural product from God&#x27;s great Earth and you can&#x27;t go erong here in my opinion. This is is also an wonderful company. They sell great products and their customer service is top notch in my experience. Truly A++++++... &amp; that&#x27;s so important. Thank you for everything you sell and do.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, I can definitely see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I just started using it and my skin feels tighter. I&#x27;m hoping that with time my lines will dissipate. The smell is a little strong but the cream moisturizer covers it.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have only been using this about a week. He has inflamed skin from years in the sun resulting in ongoing skin cancers and &amp;#34;ruddy&amp;#34; looking skin (Irish skin). It&#x27;s a brown liquid serum that dried &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; on my skin and discolored. My husband said he thinks it&#x27;s helping his face &amp; head (bald) calm his skin. He also likes that it isn&#x27;t greasy and is absorbed right away.&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I received (as a sample) with this order some hyarlaric acid which I LOVED . I&#x27;ve never tried it before but will now. There was noticeable improvement in a week. Great company!</li>
