            <li> From other sources, the seals are in tact and not leaking.</li>
            <li> It has a tendency to dribble down the spout and then the side of the bottle, getting everything oily (and staining the label).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is difficult to drip the oil out, and causes some waste.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the oil.</li>
            <li> So this makes counting drops impossible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great value &amp; product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making lots of essential oil roller ball blends and I&#x27;ve needed a lot of Fractionated Coconut Oil, so this sized bottle and the price made it more affordable to keep producing these kinds of blends.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> very nice &amp; smooth with great absorption</li>
            <li> Good carrier oil. Decent price.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the oil. Bottle  didn&#x27;t and does not leak. Good price will order again.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a very good product. It meets my requirements just fine.</li>
            <li> The quality of the FCO is great! My only complaint is that it is difficult to drip the oil out, and causes some waste. It has a tendency to dribble down the spout and then the side of the bottle, getting everything oily (and staining the label). I can reduce the amount of mess/oil loss by quickly flip it over and immediately squeezing it into a vial. There&#x27;s still some drippage, but not as much. So this makes counting drops impossible. I&#x27;ve had to pour it into a dropper bottle and dispense from there to gain any control. This is the only reason I will be trying another comparably-priced brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great carrier oil as it doesn&#x27;t mask the smell or effectness of the oils it is mixed with.</li>
            <li> I love this and the price is great for the item !!</li>
            <li> I use this as a carrier oil with my essential oils. It&#x27;s a good quality oil.</li>
            <li> I wish I could drop a bit less into my hand when I&#x27;m ready to use it, but the product itself is great for mixing with essential oil.</li>
            <li> I am using this to mix with essential oils as a carrier, put in roll-on containers, etc. Works well, does not harden at all at room temp like regular CO does. Like it very much!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite carrier oil because it absorbs faster than any other oil I have tried.</li>
            <li> Excellent for use as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!  Love it!!! Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail today. While the product seems to be what is in the description, the cap was not on properly so 1/4 seeped out all over everything else in the package .</li>
            <li> When I get this from this source, there are no safety seals, the oils are different colors. Kind of seems like they are refilling bottles with different oils. They also leak. From other sources, the seals are in tact and not leaking.</li>
            <li> Works great but deliver if item not do great, 1/3 of product leaked during shipping. Not properly sealed. Ordered almond oil from another company &amp; theirs was sealed super tight.</li>
            <li> Works great with my essential oils added to use in roll on bottles</li>
            <li> Works in my sugar scrub perfectly, couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li> Excellent carrier oil.  Great oil to use with my essentials oils.  Thanks you Plant Guru. Excellent product.  Your the best.</li>
