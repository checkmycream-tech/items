    <ol>
            <li> Nope, nope and nope. Good for tightening up for a party but that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit anyone who&#x27;s trying to lose weight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant to be worn by someone that&#x27;s a size 2 or smaller</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Paper wrap will do better...</li>
            <li> just a waste of my money even thought they were cheaper ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¬</li>
            <li> Waste of money. You are better off using your seran wrap or your grocery bags.</li>
            <li> works great!  put it on for the walk home from work&lt;br /&gt;and when i took it off&lt;br /&gt;there was like at least a half cup of sweat!  Holy Moly!&lt;br /&gt;but its probaly all just water weight- so i dont use it that often-&lt;br /&gt;you kinda need water</li>
            <li> Did not like it it didn&#x27;t work for me it didn&#x27;t stay on it keep coming off so don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> cheap plastic is what I seen when I opened this product, I hated it and I will never order this again.</li>
            <li> Just a piece of plastic, serves no purpose.  Not sure what anyone could think that this is supposed to do</li>
            <li> I should have thoroughly checked over this thing. It&#x27;s better to put a Saran Wrap over your tummy than buy this in all honesty!!! Used it while working out today and once I took it off, the pink wrap was leaking with sweat and my mid section was drenched as well!! I didn&#x27;t see any improvement other than maybe losing water weight ? Should have reconsidered :(</li>
            <li> Just a piece of plastic, should have purchase Saran Wrap from the supermarket instead. This product didn&#x27;t do me any justice.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly with my nightly body wraps! I use them every night and I could see the results each morning.</li>
            <li> If your maybe a size 4 or 5 this will wrap around you. If your a size 7 don&#x27;t bother buying this it will not fit.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother, not worth it. If you can even get it around you who would want to, it smells, it&#x27;s sticky, uncomfortable, does not breathe, pure plastic junk.</li>
            <li> Just a piece of plastic, dont waist your money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought because I wanted to lose some inches, didnt work at all</li>
            <li> Bull s*** no ideal how it works, please don&#x27;t sell to nobody else</li>
            <li> it wont wrap around waist unless you are already skinny.</li>
            <li> The worst item I have ever purchased from Amazon</li>
            <li> Worthless even at this price.</li>
            <li> It was plastic. I thought it was a belt.</li>
            <li> U would be better off wrapping yr stomach in kitchen wrap!! Wast of money.</li>
            <li> I didnt use yet, but I am not sure how to use it, if you guys can explain me how , will be awesome, thanks :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell. Instructions written in Chinese and I cannot understand&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;This is from my daughter&#x27;s perspective of whom I purchased it for.  Sh&lt;br /&gt;asked me.  So I can&#x27;t really say, since I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> It broke my skin out with a rash and welts</li>
            <li> docent even stick to your stomach</li>
            <li> It does make you sweat by I have to secure it with a zipped body slimming belt.  But for the price it does make you sweat especially while you exercise.  Need to buy bigger because it comes a tad small and does not go all the way around.</li>
            <li> No good ya just be taking people money</li>
            <li> Didnt even fit around me I had to give it away</li>
            <li> This wrap is to be used under a waist trimmer , while you working out . It doesn&#x27;t stay on by its self . It meant to be under something to make you sweat more !!</li>
            <li> This item didn&#x27;t even fit half way around my wasit</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; I noticed a surprise difference!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great item will buy again</li>
            <li> Large peice of pink plastic does nothing!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Just a piece of pink plastic.</li>
            <li> does nothing you need it to do</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit at all and it&#x27;s too small! I will never ever gonna buy this again! I waste my money for this! So buyers don&#x27;t buy that thing!</li>
            <li> It looks good, and comfortable while wearing it. It just does not last for longueur. may a couple day or three. But it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Not a good product for a big person thouhgt it was bigger then it looks</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, you certainly sweat.</li>
            <li> doesnt stay unless you use duct tape</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok because it is a little bit smaller for me it almost don&#x27;t fit me.  I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li> work really great when applied slim green on your body. belt seals in sweat and helps you loose weight. I have ordered a second one. Really please with this belt. Can go under clothes as well. Works all day when you wear it.</li>
            <li> Its to flimsy rolls up not worth the money .</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected... Not clingy.</li>
            <li> Just came today I opened it tried it on it fit great now uf you buy this it is in Chinese but the way you wear it is under your corset or whatever you use I will order more</li>
