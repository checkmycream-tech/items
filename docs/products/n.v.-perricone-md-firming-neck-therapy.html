            <li>Best product that I&#x27;ve used!!!</li>
            <li>Spinal cord injury and this product is great</li>
            <li>so if it works I will be happy to purchase again</li>
            <li>Love this neck cream!</li>
            <li>Love that one!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s no wonder cream.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff..</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use it.....</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this neck cream, have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>A way way better neck cream that works wonders is Philosophy&#x27;s neck cream.</li>
            <li>This is pricey but well worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Dr. Perricone really needs to change to packaging that extends the life of his products way better than glass jars that have to be opened to the air-and let stuff into the jar.</li>
            <li>worth the price to maintain your neck and cheaper than his sub d product.</li>
            <li>Pleased that my skin seems to be staying the same.</li>
            <li>Use consistently</li>
            <li>I did break my first jar-ugh-</li>
            <li>A bit on the pricey side, but it really works to retract the neck; cheaper than cosmetic corrective surgery</li>
            <li>Really can&#x27;t review but had to in order to post something.</li>
            <li>And after paying such a high price?</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money - the product does nothing more than any other moisturizer, and smells like old fish - all day!  </li>
            <li>I am 58 and I have no loose skin on my neck,</li>

            <li> I am 58 and I have no loose skin on my neck,</li>
            <li> Its not sticky-its a little pricey in my opinion but a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Be careful of \\&quot;joining\\&quot; - once you order the product you will be sent products you did not request until you call and cancel.</li>
            <li> It was fluffy white and smelled like Nivea.</li>
            <li> Too expensive &amp; really doesn&#x27;t do everything it promises</li>
            <li> Because of the glass jars I have to down grade this product 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my neck area looks smoother and less saggy.</li>
            <li> This product was not true Perricone.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll realize one day how everything is tight and no &amp;#34;neck bands&amp;#34; are visible going around your neck.</li>
            <li> Just started using it for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> At least this one did not cause me to break out, like the number one rated cream did.</li>
            <li> I was forced to give this a star - it deserves no stars.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend it for any reason and the price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I can only base my opinion on the reactions people are giving me to my skin appearance.</li>
            <li> Expensive for the amount</li>
            <li> Doesnt smell bad like some of the Perricone products either.</li>
            <li> It smells awful and just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s no wonder cream. At least this one did not cause me to break out, like the number one rated cream did.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. Firms neck when used twice a day. Will not be without it!  Doesnt smell bad like some of the Perricone products either.</li>
            <li> Too expensive &amp; really doesn&#x27;t do everything it promises</li>
            <li> I love this stuff..A bit on the pricey side, but it really works to retract the neck; cheaper than cosmetic corrective surgery</li>
            <li> It has been three weeks and i have not noticed any results as of yet. I took a photo prior to using to compare. No difference yet</li>
            <li> I was forced to give this a star - it deserves no stars.  Don&#x27;t waste your money - the product does nothing more than any other moisturizer, and smells like old fish - all day!

            <li> Just started using it for a few weeks now.  I have noticed that my neck area looks smoother and less saggy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  allergic to this product.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about 5 years.  Pleased that my skin seems to be staying the same.</li>
            <li> Use it twice a day and it works.</li>
            <li> This product was not true Perricone. It was fluffy white and smelled like Nivea. I will not buy from them again. I do not believe its Perricone.</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t review but had to in order to post something. I just started using and I hope it works. Expensive for the amount so if it works I will be happy to purchase again</li>
            <li> This is pricey but well worth it! I am 58 and I have no loose skin on my neck, no turkey wattle like I see on others my age. Gravity is my enemy on my face but my neck looks like my daughter&#x27;s. Use consistently and you&#x27;ll realize one day how everything is tight and no &amp;#34;neck bands&amp;#34; are visible going around your neck.</li>
            <li> I can only base my opinion on the reactions people are giving me to my skin appearance. Seems like people are digging the way I look these days so I&#x27;m sticking with this cream!</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to use it.....I think it works that well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. Its not sticky-its a little pricey in my opinion but a tiny bit goes a long way. I did break my first jar-ugh- because I had just gotten it two weeks before. Dr. Perricone really needs to change to packaging that extends the life of his products way better than glass jars that have to be opened to the air-and let stuff into the jar. Because of the glass jars I have to down grade this product 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price to maintain your neck and cheaper than his sub d product.</li>
            <li> Love this neck cream! Visible results. Luxurious feel. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love this neck cream, have been using it for years. Does what it promises to do</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all. And after paying such a high price? I don&#x27;t get what all the hype about this or these products are about. It smells awful and just doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money. A way way better neck cream that works wonders is Philosophy&#x27;s neck cream. Love that one!</li>
            <li> Best product that I&#x27;ve used!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Received the Neck Therapy and my wife loves it. Product received promptly with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
