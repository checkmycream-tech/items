            <li> Only brand I&#x27;ve found on the market that both moisturizes the mouth and heals chapped, dry lips.</li>
            <li> I only ordered one thing from them at my old work address in the past, and they somehow turned that into the default when I was all drugged up.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Keeping the tubes in case I ever have a dry mouth for whatever reason.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my mouth protected from the extreme drying affect from using a CPAP machine.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected, I wanted something for dry mouth; this soothes but is too thin.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Use a very small amount, swish it around with your tongue and leave it alone.  </li>
            <li> The shipping got confused, and I received it too late to do me</li>
            <li> The hospital used this for my elderly Mother when she was sick and her lips were so dry.  </li>
            <li> These are completely useless.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Discovered this in my recent hospital stay.  Such a refreshing taste and moisturizing effect to the lips and mouth.  I carry none now in my bag and often use it during the day.  Nice lip balm and flavorizer.</li>
            <li> These are completely useless.</li>
            <li> My wife raves about this mouth moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product .  Discovered  this  when  caring  for  my father  in Hospice. It worked  so  well  on his lips (even  after  death  ) that  I  had  to  try it  on my healthy  lips. Excellent  moisture ,  light, and  non greasy .</li>
            <li> Really god product for soothing dry or irritatedouth.</li>
            <li> This is great for dry mouth and lips after using a cpap machine.</li>
            <li> used the product before. really helps my wife,s drymouth. great price. well satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I ordered this.  First product was good and worked well.  This one is more watery and does not work as well.  Will not order it again.</li>
            <li> Mom was given this is the hospital. She says it works the best of any dry-mouth products she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for my extremely dry mouth. Have used it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> My Mother loved this product. It was given to her in the hospital and I found it for her and she is sold on it. She has said that it is the only thing she will use. So I purchased 5 tubes and she was very happy and will purchase more when she is out.</li>
            <li> It keeps my mouth protected from the extreme drying affect from using a CPAP machine.  Use a very small amount, swish it around with your tongue and leave it alone.  The product will dry, but your skin is protected underneath.  The trick is to not move your tongue around after you apply it.  Just go to sleep and in the morning rinse out your mouth and you will be happy.  It is the best and only thing that works for me and for whatever it is worth I recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Toothette Oral Care Mouth Moisturizer is a must of your wake with dry mouth. Moisturizer are strongly recommended by dentists. This one works great.</li>
            <li> very pleased, will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; service.</li>
            <li> The hospital used this for my elderly Mother when she was sick and her lips were so dry.  It worked so well that I ordered extras off Amazon.</li>
            <li> My dad is npo we use this in his mouth and he really enjoy this product.  Came in the mail in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> So pleased I could find this Oral Care on Amazon.. First became acquainted with it when I was in the hospital. So handy to have the small tube to carry in your purse or pocket. Prior to finding Toothette, I was using a different product that was  not as convenient.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and now have purchased it again for myself and my friend. The feeling is wet not slicked over lips and is so natural.</li>
            <li> Works very well and has a good taste</li>
            <li> Absolutely met my needs.  I have COPD and cannot use petroleum based lip balm.  Toothette was given to me in the hospital many years ago and works so well.  Could not locate it at a retail establishment here in Texas, so my dental hygenist found this on Amazon and this was my 3rd order.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother-in-law who is nursing home.  She uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I order for my coworker . It very good for  lip moisturizer</li>
            <li> We originally received this product while in the hospital.  It worked so well for our daughter my husband wanted some for himself!</li>
            <li> These work the best for my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is legendary if you&#x27;re on something that dries out your mouth.  The shipping got confused, and I received it too late to do me much good- but the tube I got in the hospital after surgery was a godsend (and I only found it by accident, they didn&#x27;t even tell me it was there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping the tubes in case I ever have a dry mouth for whatever reason.  It&#x27;s a pretty good product, and I share at least half the blame for the Amazon SNAFU- I only ordered one thing from them at my old work address in the past, and they somehow turned that into the default when I was all drugged up.  Doesn&#x27;t affect the product, so four stars.  (Not five, because even though it works good, it tastes like an old person chewing mints smells.)</li>
            <li> My daughter was given these in the hospital and I thought they were so great I had to order some. Best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. Light &amp; not too greasy.</li>
            <li> Only brand I&#x27;ve found on the market that both moisturizes the mouth and heals chapped, dry lips. Great product!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this if you have dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Works great for chapped and sore lips.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected, I wanted something for dry mouth; this soothes but is too thin.  I guess I wanted more of a gel.</li>
            <li> I was recently in the hospital and came home with two tubes of this and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in our local stores, thank goodness I checked on Amazon and sure enough the same identical mouth moisturizer as they recommend in our local hospital.  Carry one in my purse at all times and also use at night.  Great buy and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Tubes only about a third full not worth what I paid</li>
