            <li> I really like this product for my short hair.</li>
            <li> After using and styling, within minutes my hair goes back to normal</li>
            <li> Really changing my hair from limp to textured!  </li>
            <li> If you like the drier look let your hair completely dry</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount to style my entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few days later, I went ahead and bought this</li>
            <li> It makes it easier to shape my hair the way I like it, while still giving it a little of that wet hair look all day long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey, but lasts a long time if you only use small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> That way my hair is still damp, but has had a few minutes to air dry.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair look messy and loose.</li>
            <li> and if it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s darn close at about half the price.  </li>
            <li> I like to use it a few minutes after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Waste of my $$.  </li>
            <li> comes in small bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pomades and waxes in the past....</li>
            <li> It feels like a gel when poured into your hand but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all shiny and hard like a gel.</li>
            <li> I use a small drop and mix it with water or it will make your hair feel dirty.</li>

            <li> Great product.  Just don&#x27;t use too much.  I use a small drop and mix it with water or it will make your hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great if you have a hairstyle you don&#x27;t need a lot of hold for. It does make your hair look messy and loose. I have very short pixie hair and want more hold and more definition.</li>
            <li> love this product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time. Works great not to strong. Hold the hair just right</li>
            <li> Works great on my short, but very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.  Highly recommended by my sister...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this maker of products is helping me handle days without washing my hair for more volume.  Really changing my hair from limp to textured!  Helping me set when my hair is curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired this with their hair powder--- wow!&lt;br /&gt;I can do some of the popular hair styles and they stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out online hair tutorials.</li>
            <li> I was shown this product during one of my hair cuts, and I love it. I have tried about every hair product for short to medium length hair, and this one is by far the best. It smells great, and works perfect for the person who wants a semi shine look without the gross flakes you get with hairspray or gel. It is a lotion type product that will also moisturize your hands while you apply it. It&#x27;s much better than a balm or a wax, and it allows for great control of your hair though out the day. It only takes a small amount to style my entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW I USE IT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about a dime size portion and put it on my hand and rub my hands together then apply it to my hair evenly. I like to use it a few minutes after getting out of the shower. That way my hair is still damp, but has had a few minutes to air dry. It makes it easier to shape my hair the way I like it, while still giving it a little of that wet hair look all day long. If you like the drier look let your hair completely dry first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Holds Great all Day&lt;br /&gt;Lotion Like Texture (Don&#x27;t have to wash your hands after, just rub it in like a lotion)&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave your hands or hair sticky or gross.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey, but lasts a long time if you only use small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;Only comes in small bottles.</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me fromthe salon I get my hair cut at and inam very very happy witht this product</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It feels like a gel when poured into your hand but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all shiny and hard like a gel. I&#x27;ve tried pomades and waxes in the past....and this is much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> great on hubbys hair :)</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I got a pixie haircut about 3 weeks ago and I don&#x27;t really like to wash my hair everyday, so the next morning I put a dime size squirt on my fingers,  rub it in my hands, then put it thru on my roots. The product really lifts your hair so you don&#x27;t have bed head. I just style it with my fingers and good to go. Not sticky. I don&#x27;t even use hair spray.</li>
            <li> This smells AMAZING!!!  love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. It doesn&#x27;t hold longer hair well though.</li>
            <li> I came across this product as a product recommendation for pixie haircuts.  It is a good product for texture for pixie cuts.  It&#x27;s not sticky or stinky.  I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  Still searching for the right hair product for my hair and cut.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser said that this stuff might be a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; since it&#x27;s not sold in a salon, but my husband can&#x27;t tell the difference, so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the real stuff...and if it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s darn close at about half the price.  We like it, and will buy it again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> After using and styling, within minutes my hair goes back to normal</li>
            <li> I have short pixie platinum hair and I like the chic look without the stiffness.  This works and the smell is nice. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. I hope if they stop I can know about it so I can buy a case!</li>
            <li> Nope.  Doesnt do a THING for my short hair😟. Waste of my $$.  Don&#x27;t buy.  Doesn&#x27;t DO anything.  I don&#x27;t get the hype...????</li>
            <li> Wow I love Amazon Prime ...so Fast and Great Product...does what it says</li>
            <li> I really like this product for my short hair. I keeps it styled all day and night and looks great.</li>
            <li> Great for short, natural hair!</li>
            <li> when I had my hair cut the stylist used this on it and immediately I was in love. I knew I had to get my hands on some and quick. A few days later, I went ahead and bought this and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. A must-have for pixie cuts!</li>
