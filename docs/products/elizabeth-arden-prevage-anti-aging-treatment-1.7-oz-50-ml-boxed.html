            <li>excellent product,</li>
            <li>I had an excellent experience with Abzoo Customer Service Team.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and I think it is the best!  </li>
            <li>it just works so good....</li>
            <li>Always loved the product.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Had a good review on another site</li>
            <li>It seems like it does make a good difference</li>
            <li>would be the orange non smelly version -and that worked amazing for me.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li>after that the lines faded a bit and my friends were big time impressed that something over the counter had that effect.  </li>
            <li>Also the bottle top was off and the bottle itself was all chipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried replacement products when I ran out and did not feel confident in their performance.  </li>
            <li>I always try to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>Excellent for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I used that kind first</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll have to pay the full price too -which</li>
            <li>I ordered online from Be Bold Store.</li>
            <li>The product from Be Bold Store was brown and not transparent.</li>
            <li>could be worth it anyway.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much for your service.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that the fine lines and wrinkles aren&#x27;t visible, but it&#x27;s because I can&#x27;t see them from the itchy red welts it caused on my face.  </li>
            <li>The serum was brown and smelled funny.</li>
            <li>but it smalls funny.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a reasonable time and comes as advertised.</li>
            <li>I contacted Be Bold store multiple times for a replacement.</li>
            <li>but in 6 weeks it has done absolutely nothing - no different than my right arm.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li>The color is normally a transparent peach.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>normally all the Elizabeth Arden products I have bought directly from Elizabeth Arden or major department stores had the Words Prevage indented into the bottle, NOT raised</li>
            <li>specially eye treatment and the serum which takes care of dark spots on face and neck..</li>
            <li>the lines on my mouth which is the only place I have lines really -but</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old</li>
            <li>When I received the product the cellophane on the box was not tightly wrapped as you would expect.</li>
            <li>That only means it&#x27;s old but it should still work.</li>
            <li>I was refunded my money for the unsatisfactory product and received an apologetic email stating they do not intend to send poor product. :)</li>

            <li> I have used this product for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this was normal since some products like Perricone MD have awful odors, but upon investigating, it should be a mustardy color and have no smell.</li>

            <li> In the meantime, I also used it on my left forearm to see if it at least gets rid on some minor sun damage and evens out my skin, so at least I get some use out of it -</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging is outrageous - a large part of their cost for making this product must go into this irrisponsibly wasteful giant plastic edifice that ends up in our landfills.  </li>
            <li> If I could give this a zero or negative rating, I would.</li>
            <li> At least the orange colored cream one does that you buy at the mall from the Elizabeth Arden counter</li>
            <li> -I&#x27;d recommend getting samples at least from the Elizabeth Arden counter if they have them -it</li>
            <li> It smells really bad, has a creepy slick texture, and a strange brown color - but if it worked, maybe I could get passed all that.  </li>
            <li> I agree regardless of the color - it&#x27;s hard to use something that smells like it&#x27;s gone bad.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, this was the case with this.</li>
            <li> Bad seller.</li>
            <li> Bummer :(</li>
            <li> This time though the color was brown &amp; smells awful!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s true that the fine lines and wrinkles aren&#x27;t visible, but it&#x27;s because I can&#x27;t see them from the itchy red welts it caused on my face.  And I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin! It smells really bad, has a creepy slick texture, and a strange brown color - but if it worked, maybe I could get passed all that.  But after 6 weeks of stopping (to wait for the rash to go away, 5-6 days) and starting again, the red irritated itchy rash starts again, every time.  In the meantime, I also used it on my left forearm to see if it at least gets rid on some minor sun damage and evens out my skin, so at least I get some use out of it - but in 6 weeks it has done absolutely nothing - no different than my right arm.  Just because a big name company makes claims for a product and charges a lot for it doesn&#x27;t mean it works.  Save your money and your time - and both kinds of irritation.  Also, the packaging is outrageous - a large part of their cost for making this product must go into this irrisponsibly wasteful giant plastic edifice that ends up in our landfills.  If I could give this a zero or negative rating, I would.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too good to be true, it probably is. Sadly, this was the case with this. It came today in an unopened box and sealed in its capsule. I should have caught on to the brittle tape that sealed the capsule but I was blinded by my excitement. The serum was brown and smelled funny. Wasn&#x27;t sure if this was normal since some products like Perricone MD have awful odors, but upon investigating, it should be a mustardy color and have no smell. Bummer :( ....UPDATE- I was refunded my money for the unsatisfactory product and received an apologetic email stating they do not intend to send poor product. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using prevage anti age serum, anti age treatment and eye treatment for last 2 years, and I can tell you..I will not switch to anything else...it just works so good....specially eye treatment and the serum which takes care of dark spots on face and neck..</li>
            <li> At least the orange colored cream one does that you buy at the mall from the Elizabeth Arden counter -and that one does &#x27;not&#x27; stink.  I used that kind first and it did make my face peel a bit -around the lines on my mouth which is the only place I have lines really -but after that the lines faded a bit and my friends were big time impressed that something over the counter had that effect.  I too just ordered Prevage via the internet (to try to save money) and the cream this time is brown and it does stink.  I called Elizabeth Arden and they assured me that both the orange and brown colored creams that come out of the same Prevage bottle have the same effectiveness and the cream just turns brown over time and that&#x27;s normal.  I guess if you buy Prevage from a place like the mall when it&#x27;s still orange and use it however you&#x27;d never see or smell the brown cream -but you&#x27;ll have to pay the full price too -which could be worth it anyway.  I agree regardless of the color - it&#x27;s hard to use something that smells like it&#x27;s gone bad.  If you are going to try it -I&#x27;d recommend getting samples at least from the Elizabeth Arden counter if they have them -it would be the orange non smelly version -and that worked amazing for me.  The jury is still out for me if the smelly brown cream does work as well as the non smelly orange cream - but guess you get what you pay for.  Anyone else try both to know if the brown cream works as well as the orange cream?</li>
            <li> Always loved the product.  This time though the color was brown &amp; smells awful! That only means it&#x27;s old but it should still work.</li>
            <li> excellent product, but i don&#x27;t think i would pay the store price</li>
            <li> Excellent for very dry skin. The Amazon price is quite a savings.</li>
            <li> Was advertided with an eyw cream which i did not receive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to it!  Bummer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time. I really like it.  I ordered online from Be Bold Store. It arrived defective. The color is normally a transparent peach. The product from Be Bold Store was brown and not transparent. I contacted Be Bold store multiple times for a replacement. They do not respond.    Good product. Bad seller.</li>
            <li> When I received the product the cellophane on the box was not tightly wrapped as you would expect. Also the bottle top was off and the bottle itself was all chipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was different about the actual bottle product was that the embossed Prevage emblem was raised but normally all the Elizabeth Arden products I have bought directly from Elizabeth Arden or major department stores had the Words Prevage indented into the bottle, NOT raised</li>
            <li> Had a good review on another site so I wanted to try it.  It seems like it does make a good difference but it smalls funny.</li>
            <li> I had an excellent experience with Abzoo Customer Service Team. I will keep buying Elizabteh Arden products through them.  My order arrived just in time.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product. It comes in a reasonable time and comes as advertised. Thank you very much for your service.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used. I am 70 years old and  I used another product for years, then a year ago I lost 65 pounds and it showed on my skin. That&#x27;s when I found Elizabeth Arden Prevage. I use the eye cream, the night cream and his product. I saw a big difference in the smoothness and small lines in my skin after the  first week.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last few years.  Prior to that I did very little for skin treatment.  I am 65 and felt that the initial use of this product reduced the depth of the face lines and tightened the pores.  I have tried replacement products when I ran out and did not feel confident in their performance.  I always try to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and I think it is the best!  However, the eye treatment that came in this kit (a metal bottle like the serum) was faulty and I could not get the product out.  So, the purchase was a 5 in my book.</li>
