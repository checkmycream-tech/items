            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>This bronzer does a great deal of camouflaging by flaws</li>

            <li>Great tan but use gloves</li>
            <li>What a great product.  </li>
            <li>I do not notice the smell of l&#x27;oreal sublime at all, and found it to be a very effective bronzer and tanner.</li>
            <li>When a consumer report rated this product good, I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>There is a reason it received a good report.</li>
            <li>(im 26 now) and loved it.</li>
            <li>But l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s sublime bronze (in medium!) worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good in terms of safety of chemicals according to the EWG website, but the quality is meh.</li>
            <li>I have good tanning skin to begin with so that probably helps with self tanners.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really good stuff</li>
            <li>I loved it and used it for 4-5 years until Target stopped carrying it.</li>

            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>and it looks amazing ...</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product for years and liked it, now it appears they&#x27;ve added a perfume scent to it</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t understand how some people have had problems with streaking with this formula unless they just don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>Affordable and effective.  </li>
            <li>This has got to be the absolute best self tanner out there.  </li>
            <li>By and far, this is the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Excellent product because it gives you a natural tan or helps to extend your winter tan.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best indoor tanning product.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned, kind of pinkish tones, I guess you could classify me as cool toned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that when I take more time to do things right, it will turn out great.</li>
            <li>This is just what I wanted and I was lucky and happy to find it available from Amazon at a good price and brought right to my door!</li>
            <li>it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>Overall a great self tanner, and no sun damage!</li>
            <li>And honestly I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming then either</li>
            <li>As for the way it works, I love it.</li>
            <li>you look like you ate too many carrots..</li>
            <li>Also make sure to wear gloves when applying this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a gel rather than a lotion.</li>
            <li>This product is outstanding.</li>
            <li>always have good success with this product - I have been using it spring/summer for 4 years.</li>
            <li>how -to videos for tips on getting the most out of your sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>Its not as overwhelming as some have made it out to be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though, this is my favorite tinting lotion I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>30 min after applying&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than most self-tanners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works ok for it&#x27;s purpose</li>
            <li>at 1st it smelled ok but after an hour</li>
            <li>Just do some research about sunless tanners (ingredients) and skintone and you will be able to decide if its for you or not.</li>
            <li>I have used this tanning lotion for years, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Best to exfoliate prior to using in order to obtain optimal results.</li>
            <li>My favorite rub on skin tanner.  </li>
            <li>So many sparkles.</li>
            <li>it does leave streaks ..make sure you get it even</li>
            <li>This was more my error in purchasing it for use on my face.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with yellowy (not pink) undertones.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, nice color, no streaks, no funny smell, dries quickly, I love it!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s tinted so you can easily tell where it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It will wash off in the shower and is fairly easy to remove but</li>
            <li>Easy to apply evenly so there are no streaks.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no streaking if you take your time rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure there are far superior products out there.</li>
            <li>This formula with SPF 20 goes on very smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not orange or too dark, so it&#x27;s perfect for those who burn instead of tan.</li>
            <li>I used it pregnant when my smell was more keen</li>
            <li>Great overall, dries very quickly and is light weight feeling which is the biggest pro.</li>
            <li>Like i was sweating in a dust filled room.</li>
            <li>Best to apply it the day before, or a few times a week, rather than just before going somewhere.</li>
            <li>Have fun getting brown without the skin cancer risks and wrinkles, folks. :)</li>
            <li>Fortunately though they don&#x27;t rub off on stuff.</li>
            <li>Ok, so let me first start off with that</li>
            <li>I feel like it gives my skin a healthy pretty glow.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena makes a sunless tanner like the original Loreal tanner w/o the suncreen, and I will stick with that on my face.</li>
            <li>Very believable because your face will look healthy, alive and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>My skin is a medium COOL toned and it doesn&#x27;t make me look orange at all.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice, natural glow.</li>
            <li>Well, I put mine on at night for the full effect.</li>
            <li>Takes a full week to get a good solid tan from it.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly but does have a stickiness to it.</li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend commented the other day on my skin tone and asked if I&#x27;d been getting more sun and that he liked it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really strong and personally really dislike it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super natural and I love how quickly it works.</li>
            <li>:P I enjoy the color looks natural on my pink skin tones and that the smell is very mild compared to others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li>and i thought it was going to actually have a nice color</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the effort, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This left a nice natural color that lasts after many days and showers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and the color has held up very nicely.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair and other products can tend to make me look yellow.</li>
            <li>It left a film on top of my skin and it is sticky.</li>
            <li>This is exactly why we don&#x27;t like to order online sometimes through this AMAZON system,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s streaky even when I exfoliate first and feels sticky.</li>
            <li>I recently picked up some more bc</li>
            <li>Within the first two applications I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I consistently use self-tanners and thought I would give this one a try.</li>
            <li>but I have yet to be able to put it on without having streaks left no matter how diligent I am about rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>First off, sparkles.</li>
            <li>Try a patch first.</li>
            <li>When you first apply, there is a shimmer.</li>
            <li>so I could apply generously to avoid streaks, and I was delighted to find a natural looking, streak-free tan after a single application.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it gives a beautiful lasting glow.</li>
            <li>First of all I must say that for every single self tanner you will find at least 1 review of someone saying; \\&quot;Iv tried almost every tanner there is\\&quot; and then they usually go on to say how awesome the tanner is, no smell, great color...</li>
            <li>and I believe it would rub off on any normal fitting clothing, but the same goes for every self tanner I have used so</li>
            <li>The $30 lotion took 20 minutes to dry, and still rubbed off on my clothes more then this lotion.</li>
            <li>Yet this product can&#x27;t even live up to its promises of a streak free and natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I can only apply this at night and wear loose clothing because it stays fairly moist</li>
            <li>Very sticky, very streaky and VERY orange.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who, if I spend too much time in the sun, burns instead of tans.</li>
            <li>For the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s darker than most sunless tanners and you have to be careful that it doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li>You can use on it&#x27;s own or she also mixes it with her everyday body and face lotion to still get her lotion and tan.</li>
            <li>Some words of advice: wear gloves (it will turn your hands brown), start with a small amount and add more as it absorbs (more likely to get streaks if you apply too much, too fast)</li>
            <li>I am not a huge fan of the glitter, however it does not make me orange as a carrot and its very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I am very pale, and a few applications of this I have a wonderful tan that lasts almost a week.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li>What helps me most is exfoliating before applying and putting lotion on my knees and elbows as a sort of barrier to prevent dark spots.</li>
            <li>I saw results instantly and a FULL bronze in 3 nights.</li>
            <li>Smells a million times better than any other self tanner I have tried!</li>
            <li>When you bathe several hours later, then it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>A couple spritzes of my favorite perfume usually masks it pretty</li>
            <li>I used to be super self conscience about my ghost white skin</li>
            <li>Instead of the deathly pale that I naturally am, my skin now looks warm and sunkissed without dealing with sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mean, really though, all I wanted was a nice tan, without the harmful Uv rays or harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff in high school</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended A+++++&#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
            <li>It is a little sticky so make sure you was your hands after use.</li>
            <li>A GREAT NOT TOO EXPENSIVE TANNING PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>I really like this tanning cream as it give you a natural looking tan, it does have sparkles in it though</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the shimmery-ness so much, but then I can be pretty eccentric.</li>
            <li>I love the results of this lotion after just a few applications.</li>
            <li>It gives my pale skin the most natural glow and it lasts for more than a few days.  </li>
            <li>Most natural looking faux tan, with a little bit of sparkle.</li>
            <li>My wife complained a bout the smell, but i did not find it very strong.</li>
            <li>The resulting color is very natural, not orange at all.</li>
            <li>The color is very natural for me.</li>
            <li>Very natural color.  </li>
            <li>very useful before sunbathing, very natural especially when combined with regular body lotion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to sunless tanning, and on my first try, I didn&#x27;t take enough time to thoroughly rub the lotion in fully so</li>
            <li>Second, I followed the directions exactly and after two applications</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and the slight glitter didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wear white or anything that you really don&#x27;t want stained  </li>
            <li>It actually dries really fast.</li>
            <li>When I made this purchase on Amazon, I DID NOT NOTICE it contained an \\&quot;SPF 20 Suncreeen,\\&quot; and put in on, and as one might expect with avobenzene suncreeens, when it gets near your eyes, it will leave them burning and watering for hours, even after you wash it off.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend using this product on your face, or if you do, do not put it anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li>For the areas in which I did a better job, the tan the next day was noticeable, the &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; is hardly noticeable</li>
            <li>Only caveat is the subtle sparkle--not my favorite but washes off while the faux tan stays put.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get it in medium natural as I normally use the dark natrual version which is a tad too dark for me, even after only one application.</li>
            <li>My ONLY issue with this is the shimmer; to deal with it, I apply the lotion at night - in the morning, i use a lightly damp washcloth and that usually takes all the shimmer off.</li>
            <li>I looked like I murdered an Oompa Loompa with my bare hands and drug him in a ditch.</li>
            <li>Looks natural, and holds color for several days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products like Jergens and been much happier with those.</li>
            <li>, I use it full strength until I get the desired color (usually 3-4 applications) then to maintain the color I mix this lotion about 1/2 and 1/2 with just regular lotion.</li>
            <li>I have stupidly bought and wasted the $ on so many tanners due to those reviews, people listing these reviews should give info on their skin type so people can compare and figure out if it would do good on their skin.    </li>

            <li> I tried this product for the first time and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> It will wash off in the shower and is fairly easy to remove but</li>
            <li> Easy to apply evenly so there are no streaks.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no streaking if you take your time rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure there are far superior products out there.</li>
            <li> This formula with SPF 20 goes on very smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not orange or too dark, so it&#x27;s perfect for those who burn instead of tan.</li>
            <li> I used it pregnant when my smell was more keen</li>
            <li> Great overall, dries very quickly and is light weight feeling which is the biggest pro.</li>
            <li> Like i was sweating in a dust filled room.</li>
            <li> Best to apply it the day before, or a few times a week, rather than just before going somewhere.</li>
            <li> Have fun getting brown without the skin cancer risks and wrinkles, folks. :)</li>
            <li> Fortunately though they don&#x27;t rub off on stuff.</li>
            <li> Ok, so let me first start off with that</li>
            <li> I feel like it gives my skin a healthy pretty glow.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena makes a sunless tanner like the original Loreal tanner w/o the suncreen, and I will stick with that on my face.</li>
            <li> Very believable because your face will look healthy, alive and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a medium COOL toned and it doesn&#x27;t make me look orange at all.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice, natural glow.</li>
            <li> Well, I put mine on at night for the full effect.</li>
            <li> Takes a full week to get a good solid tan from it.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly but does have a stickiness to it.</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend commented the other day on my skin tone and asked if I&#x27;d been getting more sun and that he liked it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really strong and personally really dislike it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super natural and I love how quickly it works.</li>
            <li> :P I enjoy the color looks natural on my pink skin tones and that the smell is very mild compared to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li> and i thought it was going to actually have a nice color</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the effort, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This left a nice natural color that lasts after many days and showers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and the color has held up very nicely.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and other products can tend to make me look yellow.</li>
            <li> It left a film on top of my skin and it is sticky.</li>
            <li> This is exactly why we don&#x27;t like to order online sometimes through this AMAZON system,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s streaky even when I exfoliate first and feels sticky.</li>
            <li> I recently picked up some more bc</li>
            <li> Within the first two applications I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I consistently use self-tanners and thought I would give this one a try.</li>
            <li> but I have yet to be able to put it on without having streaks left no matter how diligent I am about rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> First off, sparkles.</li>
            <li> Try a patch first.</li>
            <li> When you first apply, there is a shimmer.</li>
            <li> so I could apply generously to avoid streaks, and I was delighted to find a natural looking, streak-free tan after a single application.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it gives a beautiful lasting glow.</li>
            <li> First of all I must say that for every single self tanner you will find at least 1 review of someone saying; \\&quot;Iv tried almost every tanner there is\\&quot; and then they usually go on to say how awesome the tanner is, no smell, great color...</li>
            <li> and I believe it would rub off on any normal fitting clothing, but the same goes for every self tanner I have used so</li>
            <li> The $30 lotion took 20 minutes to dry, and still rubbed off on my clothes more then this lotion.</li>
            <li> Yet this product can&#x27;t even live up to its promises of a streak free and natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I can only apply this at night and wear loose clothing because it stays fairly moist</li>
            <li> Very sticky, very streaky and VERY orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who, if I spend too much time in the sun, burns instead of tans.</li>
            <li> For the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s darker than most sunless tanners and you have to be careful that it doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> You can use on it&#x27;s own or she also mixes it with her everyday body and face lotion to still get her lotion and tan.</li>
            <li> Some words of advice: wear gloves (it will turn your hands brown), start with a small amount and add more as it absorbs (more likely to get streaks if you apply too much, too fast)</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the glitter, however it does not make me orange as a carrot and its very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I am very pale, and a few applications of this I have a wonderful tan that lasts almost a week.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li> What helps me most is exfoliating before applying and putting lotion on my knees and elbows as a sort of barrier to prevent dark spots.</li>
            <li> I saw results instantly and a FULL bronze in 3 nights.</li>
            <li> Smells a million times better than any other self tanner I have tried!</li>
            <li> When you bathe several hours later, then it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> A couple spritzes of my favorite perfume usually masks it pretty</li>
            <li> I used to be super self conscience about my ghost white skin</li>
            <li> Instead of the deathly pale that I naturally am, my skin now looks warm and sunkissed without dealing with sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, really though, all I wanted was a nice tan, without the harmful Uv rays or harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff in high school</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended A+++++&#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky so make sure you was your hands after use.</li>
            <li> A GREAT NOT TOO EXPENSIVE TANNING PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> I really like this tanning cream as it give you a natural looking tan, it does have sparkles in it though</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the shimmery-ness so much, but then I can be pretty eccentric.</li>
            <li> I love the results of this lotion after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> It gives my pale skin the most natural glow and it lasts for more than a few days.  </li>
            <li> Most natural looking faux tan, with a little bit of sparkle.</li>
            <li> My wife complained a bout the smell, but i did not find it very strong.</li>
            <li> The resulting color is very natural, not orange at all.</li>
            <li> The color is very natural for me.</li>
            <li> Very natural color.  </li>
            <li> very useful before sunbathing, very natural especially when combined with regular body lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to sunless tanning, and on my first try, I didn&#x27;t take enough time to thoroughly rub the lotion in fully so</li>
            <li> Second, I followed the directions exactly and after two applications</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and the slight glitter didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear white or anything that you really don&#x27;t want stained  </li>
            <li> It actually dries really fast.</li>
            <li> When I made this purchase on Amazon, I DID NOT NOTICE it contained an \\&quot;SPF 20 Suncreeen,\\&quot; and put in on, and as one might expect with avobenzene suncreeens, when it gets near your eyes, it will leave them burning and watering for hours, even after you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this product on your face, or if you do, do not put it anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li> For the areas in which I did a better job, the tan the next day was noticeable, the &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; is hardly noticeable</li>
            <li> Only caveat is the subtle sparkle--not my favorite but washes off while the faux tan stays put.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get it in medium natural as I normally use the dark natrual version which is a tad too dark for me, even after only one application.</li>
            <li> My ONLY issue with this is the shimmer; to deal with it, I apply the lotion at night - in the morning, i use a lightly damp washcloth and that usually takes all the shimmer off.</li>
            <li> I looked like I murdered an Oompa Loompa with my bare hands and drug him in a ditch.</li>
            <li> Looks natural, and holds color for several days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products like Jergens and been much happier with those.</li>
            <li> , I use it full strength until I get the desired color (usually 3-4 applications) then to maintain the color I mix this lotion about 1/2 and 1/2 with just regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I have stupidly bought and wasted the $ on so many tanners due to those reviews, people listing these reviews should give info on their skin type so people can compare and figure out if it would do good on their skin.    </li>
            <li> You have to be careful how much you apply or it can appear slightly streaky.</li>
            <li> I have always been extremely pale, and I&#x27;ve tried several self-tanners with little success.</li>
            <li> since I read reviews beforehand...), and the smell was pretty usual for this kind of product, not too bad.</li>
            <li> ( my personal favorite especially in the cold winter months)</li>
            <li> and it only takes about 2-3 mins to dry.</li>
            <li> Unless you are super pale, didn&#x27;t exfoliate good, or just plain retarded</li>
            <li> I have used $30 lotions and they take twice as long to dry and do not last as long.</li>
            <li> This product was FANTASTIC... until I broke out in an angry rash all over my body about 24 hours after I application.</li>
            <li> One tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry</li>
            <li> The ONLY downside is it does have a little sparkly glow to it which is not the look I would want to have on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> She has been using it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I did find that it took a while to dry with this method, so I would apply a couple times a week at night.</li>
            <li> , I have two kids and don&#x27;t want to worry about tending to them while I&#x27;m waiting to dry.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have time to wait for the lotion to dry on your skin, blow dry it!</li>
            <li> This definitely works well without looking too dark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a slightly suntan lotiony smell to it, but I personally don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> Less orangy when mixed with body lotion.</li>
            <li> I literally had to stay dormant for a whole week showering/ exfoliating (bath salts, loufa &amp; a hard heavy duty kitchen scrubber)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I spent close to $10 on this stuff and it has glitter in it.  </li>
            <li> As I get older, my skins just gets funkier, cellulite worse, spider veins, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other lotions with very little satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Contrary to a couple of other reviews, there is no sparkle effect in this product.</li>
            <li> No lingering smell like some other bronzing lotions.</li>
            <li> I think my friend said the other Sublime Gradual tan does not have the \\&quot;sparkle\\&quot; to it.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with it streaking, but I am very careful about rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> Hard to see coverage when applied until later when I&#x27;d notice my inconsistencies.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really strong or bad.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and the smell isn&#x27;t NEARLY as bad as some of the other self tanners.</li>
            <li> , my hands looked orange, I had blotches in random areas (to the point where my fianc&amp;eacute; was asking questions about it looking concerned), and it certainly didn&#x27;t look like a &amp;#34;natural tan&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My legs in particular are driving me crazy and I&#x27;ve actually left scratches in my skin!</li>
            <li> Just 3 uses and your a dark tan</li>
            <li> I will usually purchase two or three bottles at a time since my local store doesn&#x27;t carry it year round.</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and dark hair and complements my coloring.</li>
            <li> It looks natural and lasts approximately five days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d write more, but I have to take another shower today to get this crap off.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m olive-skinned, but this product slightly stained my skin in places, but no tan.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU MIX A LITTLE &amp;#34;SALLY HANSENS&amp;#34; LEG MAKEUP WITH IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a very pale individual who has an extremely hard time tanning.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in a product that had such high hopes for.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> everyday to try and remove the spots.</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed a stickiness for a few hours after application.</li>
            <li> This stuff plainly turned my face, neck, and chest orange.</li>
            <li> Also lotion on my palms as I apply and wash my hands at least twice while applying to prevent getting dark palms.</li>
            <li> Ive an olive skin tone and usually tan</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> And probably the biggest nuisance of all, it dried my skin out!</li>
            <li> Smells funny and leaves stupid sparkles on your skin.</li>
            <li> Hardly something I can put on and go out the door...</li>
            <li> Not as bad as others i have used but either way it did not look natural.</li>
            <li> But at least all the glitter is gone!</li>
            <li> im not happy</li>
            <li> Victoria Secret&#x27;s works but its not convenient to go to Victoria Secrets.</li>
            <li> The color develops after a couple of hours and is very subtle.</li>
            <li> Unless you don&#x27;t know what you are doing and really weird about applying LOTION</li>
            <li> But the smell is horrible and it makes you very gross feeling.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the shipment from ABC Wholesale is the wrong product, they sent &amp;#34;Tinted&amp;#34; not the product showed in the picture.</li>
            <li> The smell is faint, unlike other tanners I have used (Neutrogena Gradual Tanner is horribly overpowering).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bronzer that did not smell so bad to me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a brand like Loreal to put glitter crap in their product</li>
            <li> I hate getting tan (bad for the skin!)</li>
            <li> or so it has a smell to it that smells like nasty sunless tanner trying to be masked by \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; smelling perfume.     </li>
            <li> Having my chest sparkle like glitter looks terrible, hence the title of this review.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Sublime for a couple of years now...it just keeps getting better. This formula with SPF 20 goes on very smoothly and dries quickly. The color develops after a couple of hours and is very subtle. I use it on my face as well. Contrary to a couple of other reviews, there is no sparkle effect in this product.</li>
            <li> Great overall, dries very quickly and is light weight feeling which is the biggest pro. You have to be careful how much you apply or it can appear slightly streaky. Takes a full week to get a good solid tan from it. Smells a million times better than any other self tanner I have tried!</li>
            <li> Smells funny and leaves stupid sparkles on your skin. Hardly something I can put on and go out the door...ugh. Does give an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; glow. Will try another brand.</li>
            <li> i did not follow it all the way through. only allied it for 3 days. My wife complained a bout the smell, but i did not find it very strong. she also noticed how tan i got after only 2 days.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get it in medium natural as I normally use the dark natrual version which is a tad too dark for me, even after only one application. I can only apply this at night and wear loose clothing because it stays fairly moist and I believe it would rub off on any normal fitting clothing, but the same goes for every self tanner I have used so I don&#x27;t mind. The resulting color is very natural, not orange at all. I have never had a problem with it streaking, but I am very careful about rubbing it in. The smell is faint, unlike other tanners I have used (Neutrogena Gradual Tanner is horribly overpowering). Overall a great self tanner, and no sun damage!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for years and liked it, now it appears they&#x27;ve added a perfume scent to it that&#x27;s really strong and personally really dislike it. It smells like old-lady perfume. Choosing a perfume is a personal choice, it&#x27;s not something you want via your tanning lotion. This change wasn&#x27;t indicated anywhere on the bottle, if it were, I would have left it on the shelf. I will be looking for another brand asap.</li>
            <li> Ok, so let me first start off with that Ive an olive skin tone and usually tan easy.&lt;br /&gt;After I exfoliate with an oily type one, I apply this. I love that it&#x27;s tinted so you can easily tell where it&#x27;s been applied. Unless you are super pale, didn&#x27;t exfoliate good, or just plain retarded then I cannot understand why this product would streak on you. When a consumer report rated this product good, I gave it a shot. And honestly I&#x27;m glad I did. There is a reason it received a good report. It dries quickly but does have a stickiness to it. I&#x27;ve had no problems from thar either. I use this before bed and it doesn&#x27;t rub off or anything. I will say yes it has a shimmer but the product says on the front. It&#x27;s not too bad but I can see why some dislike that fact. Just wear it before bed like me and problem solved. As for the smell, yes it smells like a self tanner. Why? Because it is one people! It&#x27;s really not overpowering. I used it pregnant when my smell was more keen and it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming then either.. use perfume if you use it in the day and again, problem solved. As for the way it works, I love it. It&#x27;s super natural and I love how quickly it works. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments not oh god you look like you ate too many carrots.. yeesh. Unless you don&#x27;t know what you are doing and really weird about applying LOTION then I don&#x27;t see you disliking this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even order it.</li>
            <li> im not happy I spent close to $10 on this stuff and it has glitter in it.  I put it on 30 minutes before I needed to get dressed to leave for somewhere and had to immediately jump in the shower to wash it off.  I didn&#x27;t expect a brand like Loreal to put glitter crap in their product which is why I bought it.  And it doesn&#x27;t  mention glitter on the label.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 2 stars even though it does make you orange if you&#x27;re a very white person and no streaks that I&#x27;ve noticed. So it does work. But the smell is horrible and it makes you very gross feeling. Like i was sweating in a dust filled room. After I took 3 showers you can still smell it. But at least all the glitter is gone! Yes glitter..! It makes you shiney. Also make sure to wear gloves when applying this stuff. My left hand looks like I choked a candy bar.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years, works well. Wear gloves! Stay in a/c and/or under a fan so it doesn&#x27;t run while drying! Don&#x27;t wear white or anything that you really don&#x27;t want stained  (white bra or blouse) just after, and for several hours after you apply. When you bathe several hours later, then it&#x27;s better. Best to apply it the day before, or a few times a week, rather than just before going somewhere. If going out in the heat just after applied, it might run. Looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li> Always use this on arms and legs in the summer. I hate getting tan (bad for the skin!) but don&#x27;t want to look like a ghost. I have very fair skin with yellowy (not pink) undertones. This definitely works well without looking too dark. I even put it on my face sometimes. Only caveat is the subtle sparkle--not my favorite but washes off while the faux tan stays put.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would like this stuff? It left a film on top of my skin and it is sticky. It&#x27;s more like a gel rather than a lotion. Returning tomorrow for sure, ill stick to jergens...</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding. Unfortunately, the shipment from ABC Wholesale is the wrong product, they sent &amp;#34;Tinted&amp;#34; not the product showed in the picture. Just a heads up. I have ordered this before from another supplier and it was correct. I have requested a return but according to AMAZON they have to get approval from ABC Wholesale before they authorize. I have an email into ABC Wholesale and waiting to hear if they will honor my request to return the product that is not what I ordered. This is exactly why we don&#x27;t like to order online sometimes through this AMAZON system, can be a lot of work, time and crossing your fingers that you will get a refund. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to sunless tanning, and on my first try, I didn&#x27;t take enough time to thoroughly rub the lotion in fully so thus I got streaks, but that was obviously my fault. For the areas in which I did a better job, the tan the next day was noticeable, the &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; is hardly noticeable (I probably wouldn&#x27;t have known it was there, but since I read reviews beforehand...), and the smell was pretty usual for this kind of product, not too bad. I&#x27;m sure that when I take more time to do things right, it will turn out great. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> always have good success with this product - I have been using it spring/summer for 4 years.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Most natural looking faux tan, with a little bit of sparkle. As I get older, my skins just gets funkier, cellulite worse, spider veins, etc. This bronzer does a great deal of camouflaging by flaws</li>
            <li> By and far, this is the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m very fair and other products can tend to make me look yellow. I don&#x27;t mind the shimmery-ness so much, but then I can be pretty eccentric. :P I enjoy the color looks natural on my pink skin tones and that the smell is very mild compared to others. I recommend viewing YouTube how -to videos for tips on getting the most out of your sunless tanner. What helps me most is exfoliating before applying and putting lotion on my knees and elbows as a sort of barrier to prevent dark spots. Also lotion on my palms as I apply and wash my hands at least twice while applying to prevent getting dark palms. Have fun getting brown without the skin cancer risks and wrinkles, folks. :)</li>
            <li> I used numerous self-tanners and this one is gross. It&#x27;s streaky even when I exfoliate first and feels sticky. I&#x27;ve tried other products like Jergens and been much happier with those. I won&#x27;t be using this one again. It&#x27;s also a tacky color.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff in high school (im 26 now) and loved it. I recently picked up some more bc I&#x27;ve been lagging making it to the tanning bed. The formula is definitely different then what I remember it being but it&#x27;s still the best one I&#x27;ve used. The color is very natural for me. I picked up the deep color. It makes me look just like i do mid summer. My skin is a medium COOL toned and it doesn&#x27;t make me look orange at all. I have had zero problems with streaking. I honestly don&#x27;t understand how some people have had problems with streaking with this formula unless they just don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing. It is shimmery but I don&#x27;t mind it one bit. Its not as overwhelming as some have made it out to be. I feel like it gives my skin a healthy pretty glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a very pale individual who has an extremely hard time tanning. I&#x27;m one of those people who, if I spend too much time in the sun, burns instead of tans. I&#x27;m a bit nervous about tanning beds so my obvious choice was to find a tanning lotion. I&#x27;ve tried several other lotions with very little satisfaction. One day I found this in the store and decided to give it a try. Within the first two applications I noticed a difference. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and the color has held up very nicely. Instead of the deathly pale that I naturally am, my skin now looks warm and sunkissed without dealing with sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slightly suntan lotiony smell to it, but I personally don&#x27;t mind it. It isn&#x27;t really strong or bad. A couple spritzes of my favorite perfume usually masks it pretty decently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is that when you put it on, it almost seems like it has glitter in it or something. It will wash off in the shower and is fairly easy to remove but still something I could do without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, this is my favorite tinting lotion I&#x27;ve found. Even my boyfriend commented the other day on my skin tone and asked if I&#x27;d been getting more sun and that he liked it. I&#x27;m happy. He&#x27;s happy. Will definitely continue using!</li>
            <li> Tinted lets you see where applying. No lingering smell like some other bronzing lotions.</li>
            <li> I consistently use self-tanners and thought I would give this one a try. Bad decision.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;GLITTER EVERYWHERE&lt;br /&gt;Sticky&lt;br /&gt;Long dry-time&lt;br /&gt;Stained clothes and sheets (after 12+ hours of application)&lt;br /&gt;Splotchy the day after&lt;br /&gt;Does not come off with exfoliation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell&lt;br /&gt;Streak-free and glowing 30 min after applying&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than most self-tanners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story, I should&#x27;ve done my research rather than grabbing something off the shelf.</li>
            <li> Advertises as non streak but I have yet to be able to put it on without having streaks left no matter how diligent I am about rubbing it in. Works ok for it&#x27;s purpose but I&#x27;m sure there are far superior products out there. I will not be buying this again or recommending it.</li>
            <li> First of all I must say that for every single self tanner you will find at least 1 review of someone saying; \\&quot;Iv tried almost every tanner there is\\&quot; and then they usually go on to say how awesome the tanner is, no smell, great color...blah.     I have stupidly bought and wasted the $ on so many tanners due to those reviews, people listing these reviews should give info on their skin type so people can compare and figure out if it would do good on their skin.    COLOR:I am fair skinned, kind of pinkish tones, I guess you could classify me as cool toned. and incase it makes a difference I am 3/4 German and 1/4 Irish....I got this stuff and i thought it was going to actually have a nice color but it turned orange. Not as bad as others i have used but either way it did not look natural. But then again it could just be my skin tone to start with.     SMELL: at 1st it smelled ok but after an hour or so it has a smell to it that smells like nasty sunless tanner trying to be masked by \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; smelling perfume.     Just do some research about sunless tanners (ingredients) and skintone and you will be able to decide if its for you or not.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, nice color, no streaks, no funny smell, dries quickly, I love it!</li>
            <li> I have always been extremely pale, and I&#x27;ve tried several self-tanners with little success. But l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s sublime bronze (in medium!) worked surprisingly well. I mixed the self-tanner in my palms with my regular lotion so I could apply generously to avoid streaks, and I was delighted to find a natural looking, streak-free tan after a single application. I did find that it took a while to dry with this method, so I would apply a couple times a week at night.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to self tanning lotion. It actually dries really fast. I put it on after I shower and it only takes about 2-3 mins to dry. My ONLY issue with this is the shimmer; to deal with it, I apply the lotion at night - in the morning, i use a lightly damp washcloth and that usually takes all the shimmer off. For the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I love the results of this lotion after just a few applications. Some words of advice: wear gloves (it will turn your hands brown), start with a small amount and add more as it absorbs (more likely to get streaks if you apply too much, too fast), I use it full strength until I get the desired color (usually 3-4 applications) then to maintain the color I mix this lotion about 1/2 and 1/2 with just regular lotion. It works great!</li>
            <li> Used this only 2 days before I had a doctors appointment and had to end up asking the doctor of ANY way to remove it. Very sticky, very streaky and VERY orange. I literally had to stay dormant for a whole week showering/ exfoliating (bath salts, loufa &amp; a hard heavy duty kitchen scrubber) everyday to try and remove the spots. I looked like I murdered an Oompa Loompa with my bare hands and drug him in a ditch. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Gives a nice, natural glow.</li>
            <li> A GREAT NOT TOO EXPENSIVE TANNING PRODUCT.  HERE&#x27;S A HINT....IF YOU MIX A LITTLE &amp;#34;SALLY HANSENS&amp;#34; LEG MAKEUP WITH IT, IT BECOMES WATERPROOF AND STAYS ON FOR A WEEK...EVEN THROUGH SHOWERING.</li>
            <li> I have used this tanning lotion for years, and I absolutely love it. In my opinion, it&#x27;s the best self tanning lotion on the market. I would highly recommend it. It looks natural and lasts approximately five days.</li>
            <li> Excellent product because it gives you a natural tan or helps to extend your winter tan.  Very believable because your face will look healthy, alive and vibrant.  This is great for men and women.  Best to exfoliate prior to using in order to obtain optimal results.</li>
            <li> I think this self tanner is wonderful! It goes on smooth and the smell isn&#x27;t NEARLY as bad as some of the other self tanners. The ONLY downside is it does have a little sparkly glow to it which is not the look I would want to have on a daily basis. I think my friend said the other Sublime Gradual tan does not have the \\&quot;sparkle\\&quot; to it.</li>
            <li> My favorite rub on skin tanner.  Just the right amount of color.  Looks natural, and holds color for several days.  Affordable and effective.  One tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m olive-skinned, but this product slightly stained my skin in places, but no tan.  Being in Seattle, headed to Orlando, I difn&#x27;t want to have paler legs thsn my arms.  I used it a week, every day.  It went on smooth and the slight glitter didn&#x27;t bother me. No obnoxious smell.  Price was reasonable. Hard to see coverage when applied until later when I&#x27;d notice my inconsistencies.  Kicker was that I put on adhesive tape on an unobtrusive spot to see the difference before and after the week and there was no detectable difference.  Wasn&#x27;t worth the effort, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Bought this item at Target and I have to say, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. It&#x27;s good in terms of safety of chemicals according to the EWG website, but the quality is meh. First off, sparkles. So many sparkles. Fortunately though they don&#x27;t rub off on stuff. Second, I followed the directions exactly and after two applications, my hands looked orange, I had blotches in random areas (to the point where my fianc&amp;eacute; was asking questions about it looking concerned), and it certainly didn&#x27;t look like a &amp;#34;natural tan&amp;#34;. Also, I noticed a stickiness for a few hours after application. And probably the biggest nuisance of all, it dried my skin out! My legs in particular are driving me crazy and I&#x27;ve actually left scratches in my skin! I am really disappointed in a product that had such high hopes for. I mean, really though, all I wanted was a nice tan, without the harmful Uv rays or harmful chemicals. Yet this product can&#x27;t even live up to its promises of a streak free and natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner out there. I use both regular (no spf) and the spf versions depending on what i want to accomplish. No orangy streaks. I have good tanning skin to begin with so that probably helps with self tanners. But I&#x27;ve tried everything and have been using this for years.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply evenly so there are no streaks.</li>
            <li> It leaves streaks. I am going to sell it at a consignment shop and see if I can get some of my money back.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no streaking if you take your time rubbing it in. Very natural color.  Hatin&#x27; the glitter but it goes away after 1st shower.&lt;br /&gt;Really good stuff</li>
            <li> My wife loves this self tanner. She has been using it for a very long time. You can use on it&#x27;s own or she also mixes it with her everyday body and face lotion to still get her lotion and tan. Less orangy when mixed with body lotion.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! It works in 2 days. Well, I put mine on at night for the full effect. I saw results instantly and a FULL bronze in 3 nights. I&#x27;m actually going to ease up use because people think I went on vacation.</li>
            <li> Go product for woman, it has glitter in it</li>
            <li> It does streak.  Victoria Secret&#x27;s works but its not convenient to go to Victoria Secrets.</li>
            <li> Great tan but use gloves it does leave streaks ..make sure you get it even and it looks amazing ...I have tried plenty ...</li>
            <li> Loreal Sublime Bronze turned me into a Twilight vampire. I&#x27;m sparkling. My skin is sparkling in the sun. Having my chest sparkle like glitter looks terrible, hence the title of this review. I&#x27;d write more, but I have to take another shower today to get this crap off.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the Loreal Tanner w/o Suncreen I used to buy at Target. I loved it and used it for 4-5 years until Target stopped carrying it. I never knew WHY. When I made this purchase on Amazon, I DID NOT NOTICE it contained an \\&quot;SPF 20 Suncreeen,\\&quot; and put in on, and as one might expect with avobenzene suncreeens, when it gets near your eyes, it will leave them burning and watering for hours, even after you wash it off. I would not recommend using this product on your face, or if you do, do not put it anywhere near your eyes. And if you sweat, it can leach into your eyes from further away. Their product w/o the suncreen had worked well on my face. Neutrogena makes a sunless tanner like the original Loreal tanner w/o the suncreen, and I will stick with that on my face. I have no complaints with the seller. This was more my error in purchasing it for use on my face. Perhaps the mfr no longer makes it w/o a suncreen.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time and am very pleased. I was looking for a bronzer that did not smell so bad to me. I do not notice the smell of l&#x27;oreal sublime at all, and found it to be a very effective bronzer and tanner.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have used $30 lotions and they take twice as long to dry and do not last as long. I am very pale, and a few applications of this I have a wonderful tan that lasts almost a week. It&#x27;s not orange or too dark, so it&#x27;s perfect for those who burn instead of tan. I like that it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry, I have two kids and don&#x27;t want to worry about tending to them while I&#x27;m waiting to dry. The $30 lotion took 20 minutes to dry, and still rubbed off on my clothes more then this lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff plainly turned my face, neck, and chest orange. I even exfoliated and used evenly. I had to use makeup remover to help remove this orange. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is just what I ordered.This is just what I wanted and I was lucky and happy to find it available from Amazon at a good price and brought right to my door!</li>
            <li> What a great product.  I have been a fan but this is the best ever.  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product was FANTASTIC... until I broke out in an angry rash all over my body about 24 hours after I application. Try a patch first.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best indoor tanning product. Just 3 uses and your a dark tan and I never tan so this is what I&#x27;ve been using for years. Highly recommended A+++++&#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
            <li> This has got to be the absolute best self tanner out there.  It gives my pale skin the most natural glow and it lasts for more than a few days.  I use it about twice a week just to keep my color up, especially during the Spring and Summer months.  I used to be super self conscience about my ghost white skin but this tanner combined with SPF has turned out to be my savior.  I will usually purchase two or three bottles at a time since my local store doesn&#x27;t carry it year round.</li>
            <li> I really like this tanning cream as it give you a natural looking tan, it does have sparkles in it though but I dont mind that.</li>
            <li> very useful before sunbathing, very natural especially when combined with regular body lotion</li>
            <li> One of my favorites and great price and shipping!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I am not a huge fan of the glitter, however it does not make me orange as a carrot and its very easy to apply. It is a little sticky so make sure you was your hands after use. If you don&#x27;t have time to wait for the lotion to dry on your skin, blow dry it! Yes, use a fan or a hair blow dryer( my personal favorite especially in the cold winter months) and you will be ready to get dressed within few minutes.</li>
            <li> This left a nice natural color that lasts after many days and showers. When you first apply, there is a shimmer. It&#x27;s not noticeable at night but I wouldn&#x27;t put it on and go out during the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s darker than most sunless tanners and you have to be careful that it doesn&#x27;t streak. On the other hand, it gives a beautiful lasting glow. I have olive skin and dark hair and complements my coloring.</li>
