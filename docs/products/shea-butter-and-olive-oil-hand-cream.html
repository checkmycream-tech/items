            <li>Smells amazing.!</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best of all worlds for the hands and more.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, non-greasy too.</li>
            <li>It smells light and delicious, and isn&#x27;t too oily.</li>
            <li>It is especially handy as it is a 3 oz tube making it easy to board planes with and is handy for everything when you travel.</li>
            <li>Otherwise feels nice but will not reorder.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I found I am ordering more in bulk:)</li>
            <li>as another one mentioned, you do need to reapply throughout the day, but that&#x27;s no problem with me since I do instinctively anyway :)</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Give it a try, I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cream.</li>
            <li>As a nurse who has extremely dry hands from over-washing, this is THE BEST.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance that is pleasant and keeps my hand soft for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>This was an easy 5 star review.</li>
            <li>smells nice, not too much perfume.</li>
            <li>On the tube it says &amp;#34;fresh, light fragrance&amp;#34</li>
            <li>silky smooth results...</li>
            <li>Fabulous non-greasy hand cream.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and clean.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product and works wonderfully on dry hands, elbows.</li>
            <li>and it absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>Really does a great job on my dry hands!</li>
            <li>pleasant fresh non heavy smell</li>
            <li>While this cream is okay, I eventually went back and purchased the L&#x27;Occitane.  </li>
            <li>I bought several and am glad I did</li>
            <li>Right now,some of the skin on my hands is  cracked, and this lotion is very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite hand cream ever - not too greasy, yet lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I really like this hand cream.  </li>
            <li>and this is really helping.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in place of the L&#x27;Occitane Shea Butter hand cream that costs three times as much.</li>
            <li>non-greasy &amp; leaves hands soft and the smell is soft and fresh!</li>
            <li>many people, I&#x27;ve tried a ton of other products, but this one is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; choice (Gold Bond hand creams work well for me too; just depends on my mood).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Love this product but you can get it for half the price in retail stores.</li>
            <li>One application and my hands go from extremely dry to fantastic.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Given the rave reviews I read, I expected it to be more intensely moisturizing and for the effect to last longer.  </li>
            <li>It is nice and thick but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and rich and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I agree that in sinks into the skin very rapidly, but it doesn&#x27;t seem rich enough to really help my winter chapped hands.</li>
            <li>It does the job, makes your hands soft and moisturizes well, however, I&#x27;m not all that fond of the scent.</li>
            <li>SILKY SOFT WITHOUT FEELING GREASY.  </li>
            <li>Luxuriously soft.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get past the cheap fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really wrong with this cream, it does an okay job for not too much money, but it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has dry skin problems.</li>

            <li> AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from extremely dry chapped hands, especially during the winter, and let me tell you!</li>
            <li> To me the smell is not mild and natural but offensive.  </li>
            <li> Scent very strong and unpleasant.</li>

            <li> some, the Silk Elements lotion with shea and olive oil might be a little greasy, but for me, it absorbs quite well within 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> This lotion does not make your hands feel greasy, it isn&#x27;t heavily scented, and I never got an allergic reaction..</li>

            <li> This stuff is the best of all worlds for the hands and more.  It is especially handy as it is a 3 oz tube making it easy to board planes with and is handy for everything when you travel.</li>
            <li> I use it as a face moisturizer as well as hand cream.  It is not greasy so makeup stays in place.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream ever. Smells amazing.!</li>
            <li> smells nice, not too much perfume. Its great in my guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from extremely dry chapped hands, especially during the winter, and let me tell you! This lotion does not make your hands feel greasy, it isn&#x27;t heavily scented, and I never got an allergic reaction..(for some reason a lot of lotions give me allergic reactions)&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this and definitely urge others to try it as well.&lt;br /&gt;One thing though...as another one mentioned, you do need to reapply throughout the day, but that&#x27;s no problem with me since I do instinctively anyway :)</li>
            <li> As a nurse who has extremely dry hands from over-washing, this is THE BEST. non-greasy &amp; leaves hands soft and the smell is soft and fresh!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the cheap fragrance.  I just HATE it.  And being a hand cream, invariably the smell wafts up to my nose on a regular basis.  On the tube it says &amp;#34;fresh, light fragrance&amp;#34; which is what you would expect from Shea Butter and olive oil.  To me the smell is not mild and natural but offensive.  Will have to give it away or throw it away.</li>
            <li> In four days my eczema had dramatically improved! The scent is light and clean. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It does the job, makes your hands soft and moisturizes well, however, I&#x27;m not all that fond of the scent. I do use it though because it is an affective hand cream!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product and works wonderfully on dry hands, elbows.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. Really does a great job on my dry hands! I highly recommend it to anyone who has dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> silky smooth results...and you only need a little bit...good size tube...pleasant fresh non heavy smell</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST HAND CREAM EVER.  I HAVE REALLY DRY SKIN AND THIS LEAVES MY SKIN SILKY SOFT WITHOUT FEELING GREASY.  I WILL ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Makes ur feet and hands feel soooo good!! Need to buy in bulk!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hands feeling very soft, and seems to stay on at least for 1 hand washing. I work in a hospital, and I use hand sanitizer a lot, and my hands don&#x27;t dry out.

Check it out for giggles is you haven&#x27;t already.  :)</li>
            <li> I really like this hand cream.  It is nice and thick but not greasy.  A little bit goes a long way. It has a light fragrance that is pleasant and keeps my hand soft for most of the day.  I have dry skin and this is really helping.  Give it a try, I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Great hand cream... Helped my nails also! I recommend.</li>

Pleasant smell, non-greasy too.</li>
            <li> I bought this hand cream at Sally beauty supply I bought several and am glad I did it makes my hands feel soooo goog and it absorbs quickly so your hands aren&#x27;t left feeling greasy.  I am very glad I found I am ordering more in bulk:)</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this hand cream.  Given the rave reviews I read, I expected it to be more intensely moisturizing and for the effect to last longer.  I agree that in sinks into the skin very rapidly, but it doesn&#x27;t seem rich enough to really help my winter chapped hands.</li>
            <li> But my local Sally&#x27;s says they are not carrying it anymore. It&#x27;s currently $3.50 on their web site, though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I adore that stuff!</li>
            <li> Fabulous non-greasy hand cream. Luxuriously soft.</li>
            <li> Great product. Everyone I give it to loves it.</li>
            <li> The scent is over bearing but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very active and picked this up at a local retailer. Works like a charm. One application and my hands go from extremely dry to fantastic.</li>
