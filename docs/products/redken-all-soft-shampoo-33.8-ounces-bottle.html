            <li>Normally a great brand</li>

            <li>Favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, the more you scrub, the more shampoo it releases, but if you scrub too much the shampoo will overpower the conditioner, so you have to find a happy balance.</li>
            <li>then most store brands without breaking bank</li>
            <li>Glad they are still making this formula for fine-soft hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need anything else more than my Redken shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great, gentle shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it comes in the 33.8 oz bottle, which is at a better price that what you pay at a salon.</li>
            <li>But they just dont seem to be any better than</li>
            <li>Does create healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Lathers up nice, rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with  All Soft Shampoo!  </li>
            <li>While I do still use a clarifying shampoo maybe once a week, this is a very good daily shampoo for me.</li>
            <li>Glad that I can now order it with free shipping.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look great and soft</li>
            <li>Such a good deal!</li>
            <li>rinsing, I feel my hair easy to comb.</li>
            <li>After trying it, I have to admit that my hair feels and looks better than with the really cheap stuff, and it seems to stay clean longer.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Lol can be used daily.</li>
            <li>They cheerfully refunded money immediately.</li>
            <li>It stays smooth and has plenty of bounce and shine.</li>
            <li>I am back here ordering more!!</li>
            <li>it is a rich shampoo, I recommend you to use every shampoo.</li>
            <li>Always just get a clean head of manageable hair.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft on my hair</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I have used for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>Smooth Down shampoo by Redken is also great for taming tangles and frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair, which tends to be dry, and this shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>Since so many shampoos and conditioners have strong scents these days, this is a major plus for me!</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a good shampoo for my hair, which has become dry and lackluster - I also have highlights, so wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t strip the color .  </li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair feeling light and soft and easy to comb through;  and I don&#x27;t need a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I like the aroma a little bit more of the &#x27;Clear Moisture&amp;#34;, but it seems a great product.</li>
            <li>I have color treated permed hair and this product keeps my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>so I have tried shampoos from Fekkai to Matrix to Suave and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love Redken&#x27;s All Soft Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, but not as smooth as their Smooth version shampoo.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair look healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is taking awhile for this particular shipper to get it to me, but that was explained to me in advance when I ordered it with the free shipping option.</li>
            <li>The small bottle lasted quite awhile, and the results I got were really great, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s worth 25 times as much as my cheap brand, and I wonder about the chemistry involved in changing the texture of my hair so much, but the results are good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very scent sensitive, and I love that the Redken All Soft products don&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair with a natural wave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; and \\&quot;silky\\&quot; shampoos, as well as shampoos for normal hair, but none have worked as well as the All Soft.</li>
            <li>It works equally as well as Fekkai Glossing Shampoo, with more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>Using this shampoo makes my hair feel soft, light, and flowy (if that is a word).  </li>
            <li>B002WTC38Y Redken All Soft Conditioner, 33.8 ounces Bottle]], which is also fantastic), and</li>
            <li>It detangles, and keeps hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, especially combined with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>It was in no way better than any cheap shampoos, not worth th money at all.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and soft with no scalp issues (flacking etc,).  </li>
            <li>If you really have to scrub your hair you can simply rinse and apply some more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a long time and I love it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff as usual.</li>
            <li>To satisfy my cheap side I use my old stuff for the first wash and a small amount of the Redken afterward as a kind of conditioner.</li>
            <li>It works on many hair types, not just dry hair.</li>
            <li>My normal favorite shampoo is brocato daily, so for me the price is comparable.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo I have found that tames my fly aways without weighing down the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>and that it comes in a large container.</li>
            <li>I could probably skip a days wash and my hair still would not be very greasy.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a separate conditioner as it&#x27;s all-in-one and works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>yes, it is thanks to the chance that I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo</li>
            <li>My hair is in such better condition since using All Soft Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>a hairdresser recommended this years ago for my aging coarse, wiry hair, and it has never disappointed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a much better price buying it in this large bottle as the much smaller size is not that much cheaper, and I can&#x27;t always find this size locally.</li>
            <li>Normally Amazon free shipping only takes 3-5 days, but this particular seller is the exception.</li>
            <li>feel more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34;, less dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>--my stylist highly recommends Redken and I can see why.  </li>
            <li>I found this shampoo highly recommended on Lauren Conrad&#x27;s beauty department website.</li>
            <li>If anyone is heartbroken like me about the old formula being changed there is a petition going to Redken to ask them to go back to the original.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to like the Redken Extreme Conditioner better rather than the conditioner in this product line when using it after I shampoo with All Soft.</li>
            <li>Feels gentle and not harsh</li>
            <li>and it works very well making hair soft</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that is very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>cons, as is a rich shampoo, they may tend to regrease faster than expected.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair feel very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I combine this with almost any (cheap) conditioner and a little bit of Moroccan Oil while blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>5 Stars for the old Avocado Formula.</li>
            <li>Makes hair manageable And soft .</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t strip not harsh at all</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need the conditioner to know this makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>This was advertised as the old version with avacado oil.  </li>
            <li>Also, it uses a lot natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I go to recommended the All Soft Shampoo</li>
            <li>I like it because it leaves my hair soft, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel soft and nice..highly recommend</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes your hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser turned me on to All Soft.</li>
            <li>I really wish I hadn&#x27;t bought the big size of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have frizzy, wavy hair and this shampoo did not make my hair soft in anyway.</li>
            <li>It makes my thick hair so soft and light!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it based on all the gleaming reviews, but this left my fine hair weighed down, clumped together, feeling and looking greasy as soon as it dried after the shower.</li>
            <li>I was told I would receive a refund because it is actually the new version without the avacado oil.</li>
            <li>This is gentle on my dry color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I got tired of paying salon prices even at the grocery store and this larger size is effectively 30 percent under what I pay in any store.</li>
            <li>Finding the right shampoo has always been a challenge for me - some products make my scalp itch &amp; break out, others just leave my hair feeling brittle and/or weighed down.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend All Soft!</li>
            <li>This is important, because if it nourishes my hair, but they are hard to disentangle, bah</li>
            <li>Of course, your significant other and/or roommate might start complaining about your extra long showers:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No regrets</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an American brand of shampoo and it is a professional brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>moisturizes very well, but be careful not to abuse it to prevent grease</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra money over your average store brand.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally pretty silky and will typically become oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>plus I live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair shiny, not oily, and soft all day long.</li>
            <li>small nut enough for a first shampoo and do not be surprised if it does not foam too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>You can almost lather up your whole body with half a teaspoon.</li>
            <li>I use it with the &amp;#34;heavy cream&amp;#34; - which i really recomend; you can leave a little in  your hair (dont rinse it all out)</li>

            <li> It works equally as well as Fekkai Glossing Shampoo, with more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Using this shampoo makes my hair feel soft, light, and flowy (if that is a word).  </li>
            <li> B002WTC38Y Redken All Soft Conditioner, 33.8 ounces Bottle]], which is also fantastic), and</li>
            <li> It detangles, and keeps hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, especially combined with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> It was in no way better than any cheap shampoos, not worth th money at all.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean and soft with no scalp issues (flacking etc,).  </li>
            <li> If you really have to scrub your hair you can simply rinse and apply some more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a long time and I love it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff as usual.</li>
            <li> To satisfy my cheap side I use my old stuff for the first wash and a small amount of the Redken afterward as a kind of conditioner.</li>
            <li> It works on many hair types, not just dry hair.</li>
            <li> My normal favorite shampoo is brocato daily, so for me the price is comparable.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I have found that tames my fly aways without weighing down the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> and that it comes in a large container.</li>
            <li> I could probably skip a days wash and my hair still would not be very greasy.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a separate conditioner as it&#x27;s all-in-one and works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very concentrated</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> yes, it is thanks to the chance that I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo</li>
            <li> My hair is in such better condition since using All Soft Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> a hairdresser recommended this years ago for my aging coarse, wiry hair, and it has never disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a much better price buying it in this large bottle as the much smaller size is not that much cheaper, and I can&#x27;t always find this size locally.</li>
            <li> Normally Amazon free shipping only takes 3-5 days, but this particular seller is the exception.</li>
            <li> feel more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34;, less dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> --my stylist highly recommends Redken and I can see why.  </li>
            <li> I found this shampoo highly recommended on Lauren Conrad&#x27;s beauty department website.</li>
            <li> If anyone is heartbroken like me about the old formula being changed there is a petition going to Redken to ask them to go back to the original.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to like the Redken Extreme Conditioner better rather than the conditioner in this product line when using it after I shampoo with All Soft.</li>
            <li> Feels gentle and not harsh</li>
            <li> and it works very well making hair soft</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> cons, as is a rich shampoo, they may tend to regrease faster than expected.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I combine this with almost any (cheap) conditioner and a little bit of Moroccan Oil while blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars for the old Avocado Formula.</li>
            <li> Makes hair manageable And soft .</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t strip not harsh at all</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need the conditioner to know this makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This was advertised as the old version with avacado oil.  </li>
            <li> Also, it uses a lot natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I go to recommended the All Soft Shampoo</li>
            <li> I like it because it leaves my hair soft, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel soft and nice..highly recommend</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes your hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to All Soft.</li>
            <li> I really wish I hadn&#x27;t bought the big size of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, wavy hair and this shampoo did not make my hair soft in anyway.</li>
            <li> It makes my thick hair so soft and light!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it based on all the gleaming reviews, but this left my fine hair weighed down, clumped together, feeling and looking greasy as soon as it dried after the shower.</li>
            <li> I was told I would receive a refund because it is actually the new version without the avacado oil.</li>
            <li> This is gentle on my dry color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying salon prices even at the grocery store and this larger size is effectively 30 percent under what I pay in any store.</li>
            <li> Finding the right shampoo has always been a challenge for me - some products make my scalp itch &amp; break out, others just leave my hair feeling brittle and/or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend All Soft!</li>
            <li> This is important, because if it nourishes my hair, but they are hard to disentangle, bah</li>
            <li> Of course, your significant other and/or roommate might start complaining about your extra long showers:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No regrets</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an American brand of shampoo and it is a professional brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> moisturizes very well, but be careful not to abuse it to prevent grease</li>
            <li> It is worth the extra money over your average store brand.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally pretty silky and will typically become oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> plus I live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair shiny, not oily, and soft all day long.</li>
            <li> small nut enough for a first shampoo and do not be surprised if it does not foam too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> You can almost lather up your whole body with half a teaspoon.</li>
            <li> I use it with the &amp;#34;heavy cream&amp;#34; - which i really recomend; you can leave a little in  your hair (dont rinse it all out)</li>
            <li> Whereas with other shampoos your hair gets &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; of it after a while, that never happens with All Soft.  </li>
            <li> With All Soft, I hardly have any tangles and my hair is soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is designed for dry, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I tried a very small bottle at first (paired with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> dry them in the open and as soon as they are dry, I see that my hair is shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It only takes a little blob so this big jug should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo with the Redken All Soft Conditioner everyday and I have no complaints.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time</li>
            <li> I have really long, wavy hair that gets frizzy and this has helped a lot to keep that in control.</li>
            <li> Very strange.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> I have no problems with dry frizzy hair...ever!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> , I have not experienced any irritations to this shampoo, and the large bottle lasts me nearly a year (with at least quarter-sized amounts per use.)</li>
            <li> At least I have enough left to hold me over until then.</li>
            <li> I usually rotate my shampoos because it helps refresh your hair (especially with products like Pantene with wax build-up) but there is really no need with this</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> We keep a small plastic bottle in the shower and refill it periodically from the big bottle.</li>
            <li> It also does NOT strip the color from my hair (like the Redken Extreme Shampoo does).</li>
            <li> I hardly ever use styling products for the same reasons.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is..</li>
            <li> but with less lathering this time</li>
            <li> Smells like Apricots, creamy lather, hair appears smoother but no more moisture than any other product.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit does it.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived with shampoo missing; from another country.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed hearing lot of people feel the same after they came up with this new formula</li>
            <li> my hair gets a little bit too oily sometimes - usually by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a firm believer in buying the cheapest possible shampoo, so I cringed a bit when my wife bought this expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I found that I had to use very little shampoo compared to cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> Every time I wash my hair, I usually have to spend 10-15 minutes combing the tangles out in the shower with a wide-tooth comb.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed, now I need to find someone to take this huge expensive bottle of shampoo off my hands.</li>
            <li> It is hard to beat Redken products</li>
            <li> and I advise you if your hair is dull and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> it sucks.</li>
            <li> If your hair is badly damaged this will get it back into shape.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Love this! Works great! Lathers up nice, rinses clean. Smells great too. Leaves my hair moisturized. Used this for years and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Favorite shampoo. Makes hair manageable And soft . Doesn&#x27;t strip not harsh at all</li>
            <li> This product along with the All Soft Conditioner are the best products I have used on my hair. I have color treated permed hair and this product keeps my hair soft and healthy. I have no problems with dry frizzy hair...ever!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic! It works on many hair types, not just dry hair. My hair is naturally pretty silky and will typically become oily by the end of the day. I&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; and \\&quot;silky\\&quot; shampoos, as well as shampoos for normal hair, but none have worked as well as the All Soft. My mother is a hair stylist so I have tried shampoos from Fekkai to Matrix to Suave and this is by far my favorite. I usually rotate my shampoos because it helps refresh your hair (especially with products like Pantene with wax build-up) but there is really no need with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair shiny, not oily, and soft all day long. I combine this with almost any (cheap) conditioner and a little bit of Moroccan Oil while blow drying my hair. I could probably skip a days wash and my hair still would not be very greasy. It cleans your hair well, I have not experienced any irritations to this shampoo, and the large bottle lasts me nearly a year (with at least quarter-sized amounts per use.) If you are looking for THE shampoo, give this one a try. It works equally as well as Fekkai Glossing Shampoo, with more bang for your buck. I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Works well for me.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  Using this shampoo makes my hair feel soft, light, and flowy (if that is a word).  I use this shampoo with the Redken All Soft Conditioner everyday and I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also never had any issues with irritation to my scalp or eyes.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product, and I have to admit--I was initially scared by the price tag. It seems like a lot of money to pay for a shampoo! I tried a very small bottle at first (paired with the [[ASIN:B002WTC38Y Redken All Soft Conditioner, 33.8 ounces Bottle]], which is also fantastic), and I found that I had to use very little shampoo compared to cheaper brands. The small bottle lasted quite awhile, and the results I got were really great, so I bought the larger bottles on Amazon and saved some money compared to buying in the salon. The 33.8 ounce bottles have lasted for months, and I&#x27;m still seeing the great results I started with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very scent sensitive, and I love that the Redken All Soft products don&#x27;t have a strong scent. Since so many shampoos and conditioners have strong scents these days, this is a major plus for me!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and it&#x27;s great. You don&#x27;t need a separate conditioner as it&#x27;s all-in-one and works very well. It&#x27;s very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much. You can almost lather up your whole body with half a teaspoon. From what I can tell, the more you scrub, the more shampoo it releases, but if you scrub too much the shampoo will overpower the conditioner, so you have to find a happy balance. If you really have to scrub your hair you can simply rinse and apply some more but with less lathering this time so the conditioner part of the formula can do it&#x27;s job. Leaving it in for 3 or 4 minutes works best for my particular hair, YMMV. Of course, your significant other and/or roommate might start complaining about your extra long showers:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a much better price buying it in this large bottle as the much smaller size is not that much cheaper, and I can&#x27;t always find this size locally. Plus I saved several dollars off the local price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is taking awhile for this particular shipper to get it to me, but that was explained to me in advance when I ordered it with the free shipping option. Seems they don&#x27;t ship all that often so I&#x27;m having to wait some 3 weeks to get it. At least I have enough left to hold me over until then. Normally Amazon free shipping only takes 3-5 days, but this particular seller is the exception.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need the conditioner to know this makes my hair soft. Such a good deal! I will consider buying the conditioner soon, but this bottle will last me forever!</li>
            <li> This is the one of the best shampoo i have been used ! It makes my thick hair so soft and light! I like it very much!</li>
            <li> Product good. Company ordrred from not helpful</li>
            <li> Nice and soft on my hair&lt;br /&gt;better then most store brands without breaking bank</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good shampoo for my hair, which has become dry and lackluster - I also have highlights, so wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t strip the color .  This shampoo is the answer!  Love it!  It smells wonderful, too!  After only one use, my hair was softer, shinier than it&#x27;s been in ages!!  I am so happy with  All Soft Shampoo!  I am back here ordering more!!</li>
            <li> Glad they are still making this formula for fine-soft hair.  I have been using this for years (20+) and it still works even after my hair has turned gray. It leaves my hair clean and soft with no scalp issues (flacking etc,).  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good stuff as usual. Glad that I can now order it with free shipping.</li>
            <li> This was advertised as the old version with avacado oil.  I was told I would receive a refund because it is actually the new version without the avacado oil.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and needed and at a great price!!!</li>
            <li> I have dry hair plus I live in a dry climate.  Finding the right shampoo has always been a challenge for me - some products make my scalp itch &amp; break out, others just leave my hair feeling brittle and/or weighed down.  I hardly ever use styling products for the same reasons.  This shampoo leaves my hair feeling light and soft and easy to comb through;  and I don&#x27;t need a conditioner.  While I do still use a clarifying shampoo maybe once a week, this is a very good daily shampoo for me.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  After using it, my hair feels like all of the dirt, gel, and everything else is out of it.  Also, it uses a lot natural ingredients.  It is worth the extra money over your average store brand.</li>
            <li> I like the aroma a little bit more of the &#x27;Clear Moisture&amp;#34;, but it seems a great product.</li>
            <li> Smells like Apricots, creamy lather, hair appears smoother but no more moisture than any other product. Feels gentle and not harsh</li>
            <li> I have use this shampoo since about 6 years ago. I don&#x27;t need anything else more than my Redken shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great, gentle shampoo.  Just a little bit does it.  We keep a small plastic bottle in the shower and refill it periodically from the big bottle.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, and truly cleans my hair just like the blonde glam did.</li>
            <li> This is gentle on my dry color treated hair. It also does NOT strip the color from my hair (like the Redken Extreme Shampoo does). My hair seems to like the Redken Extreme Conditioner better rather than the conditioner in this product line when using it after I shampoo with All Soft. Great product and use all the time.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this on Amazon for a great price. I can refill the smaller bottle I got at my beauty salon and it&#x27;s like buying 3 bottles but only paying for one of them. This shampoo makes my hair feel very soft and silky. My hair tends to be quite coarse and this is just what I need.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying salon prices even at the grocery store and this larger size is effectively 30 percent under what I pay in any store.</li>
            <li> a hairdresser recommended this years ago for my aging coarse, wiry hair, and it has never disappointed.  Whereas with other shampoos your hair gets &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; of it after a while, that never happens with All Soft.  Always just get a clean head of manageable hair.</li>
            <li> I love Redken&#x27;s All Soft Shampoo.  I have very dry, brittle hair.  My stylist at the salon I go to recommended the All Soft Shampoo and I have been happy ever since I started using it three years ago.  I like it because it leaves my hair soft, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I love the fact that it comes in the 33.8 oz bottle, which is at a better price that what you pay at a salon.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, which tends to be dry, and this shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have chemical allergies, and use this because it doesn&#x27;t trigger anything. Leaves hair soft, but not as smooth as their Smooth version shampoo. All the same, I&#x27;ll continue buying it until they &amp;#34;new and improve&amp;#34; it, which is why I had to stop buying their LAST product.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, I am so happy with this purchase. It makes my hair look great and soft</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to Redken. I try different ones my stylist recommends - and I get at the shop - always more expensive of course.  But they just dont seem to be any better than Redken - I like the &amp;#34;all soft&amp;#34; series.  I use it with the &amp;#34;heavy cream&amp;#34; - which i really recomend; you can leave a little in  your hair (dont rinse it all out) and it works very well making hair soft, no tangles..</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is very frizzy.  Every time I wash my hair, I usually have to spend 10-15 minutes combing the tangles out in the shower with a wide-tooth comb.  With All Soft, I hardly have any tangles and my hair is soft, shiny and manageable. Any product that can get rid of my snarled mass of tangles as well as prevent further frizz is a keeper.  Smooth Down shampoo by Redken is also great for taming tangles and frizz.  It is hard to beat Redken products--my stylist highly recommends Redken and I can see why.  She uses Redken color on my hair as well. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo to use in between purple shampoo since I don&#x27;t want to be a blue-haired lady. Lol can be used daily. Makes your hair feel soft and nice..highly recommend</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes your hair really soft and shiny. However to get that softness the shaft of your hair is blown up causing alot of friziness. There is no smoothness to your hair at all so if you have frizzy hair to begin with, this is like double the frizz. Adds alot of fullness and body to your hair since it is poofing it out. If you had fine hair this would be perfect to give some body. Does create healthy hair. If your hair is badly damaged this will get it back into shape.</li>
            <li> Item arrived with shampoo missing; from another country. Very strange. They cheerfully refunded money immediately. I will buy this product from a brick and mortar store in the future.</li>
            <li> best shampoo around if you have damaged hair. It is terrific to make your hair manageable and healthier looking. No regrets</li>
            <li> gives my hair a healthy shine! my only complaint is.. my hair gets a little bit too oily sometimes - usually by the end of the day. I would definitely recommend All Soft!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair with a natural wave. This is the only shampoo I have found that tames my fly aways without weighing down the rest of my hair. It smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to All Soft. I absolutely love this! My hair is in such better condition since using All Soft Shampoo and Conditioner. It stays smooth and has plenty of bounce and shine. I haven&#x27;t used anything else in probably two years. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Good product.Use all the time</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and I do not even need a conditioner with this.  Cleans my hair with out over drying it.  Great product and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I would recommand not ordering this oroduct in the winter. It came frozen.wnd doesnt work as well. Normally a great brand</li>
            <li> There is an immediate difference when using this product on your hair. It detangles, and keeps hair soft and smooth. I have really long, wavy hair that gets frizzy and this has helped a lot to keep that in control. I&#x27;m a religious user now.</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo highly recommended on Lauren Conrad&#x27;s beauty department website. So I had to try it. My normal favorite shampoo is brocato daily, so for me the price is comparable. It is lightweight and a little seems to go a long way. I will keep this one in my rotation!</li>
            <li> I really wish I hadn&#x27;t bought the big size of this shampoo. I was so excited to try it based on all the gleaming reviews, but this left my fine hair weighed down, clumped together, feeling and looking greasy as soon as it dried after the shower. So disappointed, now I need to find someone to take this huge expensive bottle of shampoo off my hands.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that is made entirely by chance that I had it in my possession.&lt;br /&gt;And yes, it is thanks to the chance that I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and I hope my review will help you to choose (not by chance; o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an American brand of shampoo and it is a professional brand.&lt;br /&gt;It is designed for dry, coarse hair. So if your hair is colored, especially discolored, it is for you. Me it was.&lt;br /&gt;As it is a rich shampoo, I recommend you to use every shampoo. This is why I alternate.&lt;br /&gt;A small nut enough for a first shampoo and do not be surprised if it does not foam too.&lt;br /&gt;The second shampoo, then it will foam. It smells good, maybe a bit strong, but nothing disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon rinsing, I feel my hair easy to comb. This is important, because if it nourishes my hair, but they are hard to disentangle, bah it sucks. And there, this is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;I dry them in the open and as soon as they are dry, I see that my hair is shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I feel more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34;, less dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By cons, as is a rich shampoo, they may tend to regrease faster than expected. In this case, I obviously take a neutral shampoo. Want hair nourished but not greasy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good shampoo. I am delighted to have it and I advise you if your hair is dull and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes very well, but be careful not to abuse it to prevent grease</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a firm believer in buying the cheapest possible shampoo, so I cringed a bit when my wife bought this expensive stuff. After trying it, I have to admit that my hair feels and looks better than with the really cheap stuff, and it seems to stay clean longer. The smell is pleasant and not intrusive. Who knew?&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s worth 25 times as much as my cheap brand, and I wonder about the chemistry involved in changing the texture of my hair so much, but the results are good. To satisfy my cheap side I use my old stuff for the first wash and a small amount of the Redken afterward as a kind of conditioner. It only takes a little blob so this big jug should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, love the smell of it, moisturizers fairly wee&lt;br /&gt;Ll and that it comes in a large container.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, especially combined with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have used for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, wavy hair and this shampoo did not make my hair soft in anyway. It was in no way better than any cheap shampoos, not worth th money at all. Was disappointed hearing lot of people feel the same after they came up with this new formula</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a long time and I love it. It&#x27;s a great choice!  It makes your hair look healthy and soft. I recommend.</li>
