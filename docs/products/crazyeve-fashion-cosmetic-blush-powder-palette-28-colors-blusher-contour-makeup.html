            <li>The color palette has a nice selection.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product, excellent price.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Instead of wasting tons of money on one color with Mac. :)</li>
            <li>With that said, you may need to apply more often.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my girl wasn&#x27;t sure if she would like</li>
            <li>Love all the colors.</li>
            <li>then that I&#x27;m satisfied though :)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love it &amp; love how they included the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; -- i use it to set my concealer/highlight.</li>
            <li>So much to choose from and all very nice colors.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented very nice colors</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re amazing and true.</li>
            <li>Satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I received this  wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but for what you get it is  a good buy and cheaper than buying individual palettes that work almost the same.</li>
            <li>Kind of ticked off because it came to me covered in pink powder.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors may be too bright for me because I am pale.  </li>

            <li>I tried of the lightest pinks in this palette &amp; it&#x27;s surprisingly VERY pigmented.</li>
            <li>Vibrant and yes quite pigmented.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that there are no refills on single colors, so if you run out of your favorite color then you would have to buy a whole new palette; which isn&#x27;t good for the environment.</li>
            <li>She said she really likes the set because it did not irritate her normally sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It seems good, little long lasting.</li>
            <li>The colors are super pigmented and long lasting.</li>
            <li>She is a avid make-up user, but does try to keep the cost to a minimal.</li>
            <li>It was easy to fix by adding a few drops of alcohol, smoothing it out, and allowing it to air dry</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t put more starts because the 3 colors in the pallet were broken</li>

            <li> I like the product it is very nice.. I just don&#x27;t put more starts because the 3 colors in the pallet were broken, it was not carefully packed :(</li>
            <li> I love this.They&#x27;re amazing and true. great as a makeup kit start up</li>
            <li> I love the colors, theyre just as they appear on the images! Vibrant and yes quite pigmented. Would definitely give this as a gift or buy again for myself!</li>
            <li> Satisfied so far. Haven&#x27;t even tried it but tested it on my hand. It seems good, little long lasting. It&#x27;s worth the price. It&#x27;s no Mac but it would do. One had a tiny crack and was kinda messy when I opened it but I cleaned it. Probably got shifted during delivery I don&#x27;t know. But yeah I recommend it. Instead of wasting tons of money on one color with Mac. :)</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a coworker. She is a avid make-up user, but does try to keep the cost to a minimal. The color palette has a nice selection. She said she really likes the set because it did not irritate her normally sensitive skin. Keep in mind, you get what you pay for it. With that said, you may need to apply more often.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, very well packaged, and exactly as described. This is a good quality product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like the palette but I put four star because it&#x27;s late for arrived the product only for that the service for the client is excellent</li>

            <li> Bought this for my girl wasn&#x27;t sure if she would like it seeing how picky she is with her makeup and she loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I give four star&#x27;s because one came broken and all over the pallet</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t as i expected one came out.</li>
            <li> This palette has it all! The colors are super pigmented and long lasting. My only complaint is that there are no refills on single colors, so if you run out of your favorite color then you would have to buy a whole new palette; which isn&#x27;t good for the environment.</li>
            <li> I received this  wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but for what you get it is  a good buy and cheaper than buying individual palettes that work almost the same. Love all the colors.</li>
            <li> Kind of ticked off because it came to me covered in pink powder. When I opened it, I realized one of the colors had cracked and spilled all over the freaking thing -__- .....other then that I&#x27;m satisfied though :)</li>
            <li> I just revive it and one color was broken</li>
            <li> I returned it as one of the blushes had broken and the interior was covered with pink powder.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. So much to choose from and all very nice colors. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Some matte, some shimmer. One circle was a little broken when it arrived. It was easy to fix by adding a few drops of alcohol, smoothing it out, and allowing it to air dry so the alcohol will evaporate. You can fix any broken powder makeup this way.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented very nice colors</li>
            <li> I thought for the price this cosmetic blush powder palette you would need to apply layers &amp; layers of blush in order to see &amp;#34;color&amp;#34;. I tried of the lightest pinks in this palette &amp; it&#x27;s surprisingly VERY pigmented. Love it &amp; love how they included the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; -- i use it to set my concealer/highlight.</li>
