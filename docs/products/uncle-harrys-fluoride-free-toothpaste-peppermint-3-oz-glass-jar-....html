            <li>I am not saying you shouldn&#x27;t stop using it, it is at your own will, and this helps your teeth and mouth</li>
            <li>It has a nice mint flavor.</li>

            <li>It almost burns at first with it&#x27;s minty freshness, but it&#x27;s a good kind of burn, I swear!  </li>

            <li>I actually love the way it tastes now.</li>
            <li>and I notice I even wake up with a better smelling mouth.</li>
            <li>The flavor is very salty, minty and clove so be prepared that it doesn&#x27;t taste great but the benefits of it are outstanding.</li>
            <li>I found myself searching for an alternative to the Costco or SAMs club brand I had been using for many years after my family started the GAPS diet.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t know better</li>
            <li>This is a grand product.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is a remineralization</li>
            <li>But am liking the paste much better.  </li>
            <li>It will keep your teeth healthy.  </li>
            <li>so I can have my favorite toothpaste for the rest of my life.</li>

            <li>Incredible ingredients and makes me feel like my teeth are getting a much better cleaning than with a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>So many  wrote wonderful reviews so I won&#x27;t repeat it all but do completely agree with everything positive</li>
            <li>OK so why use it, No chemicals (NO BPA) and Great cleaning of your teeth and after a few minutes it leaves a really good taste and freshness in your mouth.</li>
            <li>the toothpaste is quite strong, effective and leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how clean it felt for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>strong.</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and I love that it isn&#x27;t sweet.  </li>
            <li>Peppermint Toothpaste 3oz toothpaste by Uncle Harry&#x27;s Natural Products is a great product but takes some getting use to, it has not such a good taste when you use it, its not horrible though.</li>
            <li>you know that film on your teeth you get after some rich foods like cheese or sugary foods or drinks?</li>
            <li>okay first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>So clean,  </li>
            <li>Eventhou afterwards my teeth and mounth feel incredibly clean</li>
            <li>I clean my tongue with it too.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean all day</li>
            <li>It clean my teeth in a way that I haven&#x27;t experience before.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt clean like never before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going through the jar pretty quickly and wishing I could get more quantity at once.</li>
            <li>Amazing natural paste.</li>
            <li>and it makes your mouth and tongue super clean.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much, that I need you to buy it to keep them in business</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>No bad breath issues</li>
            <li>Great product leaves mouth feeling fresh and clean without all the chemicals of other toothpaste</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and breath feels super fresh after brushing.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel clean, and I didn&#x27;t think the taste was too strong at all, even though I normally don&#x27;t like peppermint flavor in candy or any food.</li>
            <li>and the next time will be even better!</li>
            <li>But your mouth just feels clean for the first time.</li>
            <li>so fresh.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth trying if you have dental issues.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t deny the fresh feeling immediately though.</li>
            <li>Some natural ingredients seem like they may be better for gum health or alkalizing the mouth or both.</li>
            <li>(in fact, bentonite clay is a useful detoxifying agent, so that&#x27;s a double-win).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that it dries out over time though, so I repackage the jar into smaller containers, which works out nicely for travel as well.</li>
            <li>The tooth powder is also handy, and a similar experience...</li>
            <li>It just gives you a very minty clean taste in your mouth after you brush.</li>
            <li>Pure ingredients with no compromise like many &#x27;natural&#x27; products do.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple of weeks, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>My breath stays fresh longer, and I get the smooth, squeaky clean surface that generally only comes after dentist appointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Initially, the taste of salt and mint is a bit overwhelming, but you get used to it with continued use.</li>
            <li>A jar should last many months because you can use this sparingly.</li>
            <li>After the first use of this toothpaste my mouth felt as if I had just come from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a lot healthier than regular toothpaste though.</li>
            <li>If I use more than a very tiny drop it burns my mouth.</li>
            <li>And as I write this, I feel like it does such a good job cleaning my teeth that the &#x27;dirt&#x27; taste is barely even a concern.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Glycerin in toothpaste can inhibit and/or totally block minerals from being able to re-mineralize the enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I know that Uncle Harry&#x27;s isn&#x27;t available near me anymore, so I had to stock up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is now my favorite toothpaste, and after about 1.5 years of use I got a thumbs up from my dentist at my last cleaning.</li>
            <li>It tastes salty and a bit like dirt at first, but it leaves your teeth feeling SO clean and the essential oils really kick in and keep your breath fresh!</li>
            <li>Three weeks later it still feels super clean after brushing and</li>
            <li>The essential oils they use for flavoring also leave your mouth feeling really fresh and minty and completely free of the clay taste once you are done brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m still pretty young, I take good care of my teeth, and I have only 2 cavities)--I&#x27;m willing to try anything different now.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go back to the other kind!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in health of my mouth.</li>
            <li>Gave it two stars from four because I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>Very minty when done.</li>
            <li>It just refreshes your whole mouth.</li>
            <li>It really activated my gag reflex.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging is very old-fashioned and makes me feel like I&#x27;m using a product that has truly been</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a very earthy taste</li>
            <li>That feeling lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>When I moved away from Seattle, on my way out of town I stopped by Whole Paycheck and picked up all they had on the shelf.</li>
            <li>but it made my mouth SOOOO much fresher.</li>
            <li>It certainly has a different taste while brushing, but leaves the mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I mouth is clean all day long.</li>
            <li>I love the naturalness and freshness of this toothpaste, it&#x27;s lasted a month so far with only about a quarter of the container gone, I will definitely reorder</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This paste REALLY cleans your teeth, no film left at all.</li>
            <li>1 star is completely in error.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is like no other!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made up of only 11 ingredients (5 of them being different essential oils) and it does such a fantastic job of cleaning because those ingredients include mineral clay and sea salt.</li>
            <li>Just genius formula that works like no other.  </li>
            <li>also find the little glass jar quite fun to dip my toothbrush in to (and</li>
            <li>Not only did this take forever to arrive despite ordering it with amazon Prime (it took a week), after two days of using it my teeth are so sensitive I can&#x27;t even drink room temperature water without being in a lot of pain.</li>
            <li>And it leaves a bit of a salty taste in your mouth for the first few minutes after use.</li>
            <li>After using Uncle Harry&#x27;s for the last 6 months, I absolutely cannot go back to using other commercial brands that you see on TV.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically like brushing your teeth with very minty clay - the extreme mint factor along with the slightly rougher than usual texture makes me scoff at all other toothpastes now because my mouth feels so much more sparkly after brushing in comparison.</li>

            <li> It is definitely worth trying if you have dental issues.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t deny the fresh feeling immediately though.</li>
            <li> Some natural ingredients seem like they may be better for gum health or alkalizing the mouth or both.</li>
            <li> (in fact, bentonite clay is a useful detoxifying agent, so that&#x27;s a double-win).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that it dries out over time though, so I repackage the jar into smaller containers, which works out nicely for travel as well.</li>
            <li> The tooth powder is also handy, and a similar experience...</li>
            <li> It just gives you a very minty clean taste in your mouth after you brush.</li>
            <li> Pure ingredients with no compromise like many &#x27;natural&#x27; products do.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of weeks, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> My breath stays fresh longer, and I get the smooth, squeaky clean surface that generally only comes after dentist appointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Initially, the taste of salt and mint is a bit overwhelming, but you get used to it with continued use.</li>
            <li> A jar should last many months because you can use this sparingly.</li>
            <li> After the first use of this toothpaste my mouth felt as if I had just come from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a lot healthier than regular toothpaste though.</li>
            <li> If I use more than a very tiny drop it burns my mouth.</li>
            <li> And as I write this, I feel like it does such a good job cleaning my teeth that the &#x27;dirt&#x27; taste is barely even a concern.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Glycerin in toothpaste can inhibit and/or totally block minerals from being able to re-mineralize the enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I know that Uncle Harry&#x27;s isn&#x27;t available near me anymore, so I had to stock up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is now my favorite toothpaste, and after about 1.5 years of use I got a thumbs up from my dentist at my last cleaning.</li>
            <li> It tastes salty and a bit like dirt at first, but it leaves your teeth feeling SO clean and the essential oils really kick in and keep your breath fresh!</li>
            <li> Three weeks later it still feels super clean after brushing and</li>
            <li> The essential oils they use for flavoring also leave your mouth feeling really fresh and minty and completely free of the clay taste once you are done brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m still pretty young, I take good care of my teeth, and I have only 2 cavities)--I&#x27;m willing to try anything different now.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to the other kind!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in health of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Gave it two stars from four because I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> Very minty when done.</li>
            <li> It just refreshes your whole mouth.</li>
            <li> It really activated my gag reflex.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging is very old-fashioned and makes me feel like I&#x27;m using a product that has truly been</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a very earthy taste</li>
            <li> That feeling lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> When I moved away from Seattle, on my way out of town I stopped by Whole Paycheck and picked up all they had on the shelf.</li>
            <li> but it made my mouth SOOOO much fresher.</li>
            <li> It certainly has a different taste while brushing, but leaves the mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I mouth is clean all day long.</li>
            <li> I love the naturalness and freshness of this toothpaste, it&#x27;s lasted a month so far with only about a quarter of the container gone, I will definitely reorder</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This paste REALLY cleans your teeth, no film left at all.</li>
            <li> 1 star is completely in error.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is like no other!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made up of only 11 ingredients (5 of them being different essential oils) and it does such a fantastic job of cleaning because those ingredients include mineral clay and sea salt.</li>
            <li> Just genius formula that works like no other.  </li>
            <li> also find the little glass jar quite fun to dip my toothbrush in to (and</li>
            <li> Not only did this take forever to arrive despite ordering it with amazon Prime (it took a week), after two days of using it my teeth are so sensitive I can&#x27;t even drink room temperature water without being in a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> And it leaves a bit of a salty taste in your mouth for the first few minutes after use.</li>
            <li> After using Uncle Harry&#x27;s for the last 6 months, I absolutely cannot go back to using other commercial brands that you see on TV.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically like brushing your teeth with very minty clay - the extreme mint factor along with the slightly rougher than usual texture makes me scoff at all other toothpastes now because my mouth feels so much more sparkly after brushing in comparison.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve asked the small town hippy natural food stores near me to carry it.</li>
            <li> I also wonder when it is made/shelved and how long it has before expiration.</li>
            <li> texture is a little different than you may be used to, but after brushing with it for two days, you won&#x27;t want to go back.</li>
            <li> it takes a little while to get used to the slightly salty taste, but this toothpaste freshens my breath like no other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grey-brown in color and looks and feels weird when you&#x27;re used to white paste, but the awkward taste isn&#x27;t bad at all (very strong, very natural tasting), and your mouth feels amazingly clean afterward for an amazingly long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> but if you choose to use it be careful and DO NOT swallow it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this toothpaste</li>
            <li> no more arguments about squeezing the tube from the bottom vs. the middle).</li>
            <li> Taste took less than a a week to get used to.</li>
            <li> I have noticed way less plaque build up and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get used to</li>
            <li> I have no problem ingesting a little of this from time to time.</li>
            <li> This is not because it is a bad product, but because it tastes distinctly like someone tried to disguise dirt with some salt and peppermint extract.</li>
            <li> but you get past that</li>
            <li> Although I love the concept of this toothpaste, it taste horrible.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars only if it weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time keeping my tongue overgrowth in control and cleaning conventional toothpastes seemed to make it worse.</li>
            <li> And sometimes it feels like it has a hard time coming off?</li>
            <li> Bad enough that I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The taste is not very good either, it tastes as peppermint but then really bad.</li>
            <li> The reason he asked is because I had really bad plaque buildup...</li>
            <li> I hated this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I based my purchase on reviews and it could just be me, but my wife tried it as well and agrees that it&#x27;s just too awful to use.</li>
            <li> It was disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the naturalness and freshness of this toothpaste, it&#x27;s lasted a month so far with only about a quarter of the container gone, I will definitely reorder</li>
            <li> Very good toothpaste. Initially, the taste of salt and mint is a bit overwhelming, but you get used to it with continued use. I have only used it a couple of weeks, but so far so good. What leaves me most impressed is how well it cleans my tongue. I&#x27;ve always had a hard time keeping my tongue overgrowth in control and cleaning conventional toothpastes seemed to make it worse. My tongue has never been cleaner and healthier using this toothpaste without even brushing it.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste on the planet! Not the best tasting but you get past that and it is the best!</li>
            <li> does a nice job on gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used, thus far. A jar should last many months because you can use this sparingly. the toothpaste is quite strong, effective and leaves your mouth fresh. It&#x27;s by far the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.. I&#x27;ve used Colgate, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Earthpaste, Desert Essence, Jason&#x27;s, Nature&#x27;s Gate and possibly others. This toothpaste is different than any I&#x27;ve had before. I love this toothpaste and will buy this for life, not kidding. Their mouthwash is also just as amazing, but I will write another review for that .</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean after brushing. The taste is almost unbearable for me...</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel clean, and I didn&#x27;t think the taste was too strong at all, even though I normally don&#x27;t like peppermint flavor in candy or any food. It just gives you a very minty clean taste in your mouth after you brush.</li>
            <li> So many  wrote wonderful reviews so I won&#x27;t repeat it all but do completely agree with everything positive said.  My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve got a dental cleaning every time I use it... So clean,  so fresh.  Pure ingredients with no compromise like many &#x27;natural&#x27; products do.  Just genius formula that works like no other.  Get it,  spread the word. Kudos to this wonderful company. Everything I have ever used that they make is gold!</li>
            <li> I have used Vermont Soap toothpowder---it is great---- i did not like uncle Harry&#x27;s -- it was too&lt;br /&gt;Clayish--i did not care for the texture nor the taste.</li>
            <li> After the first use of this toothpaste my mouth felt as if I had just come from the dentist.  I could not believe how clean it felt for most of the day.  I found myself just running my tongue  on the inside of my mouth.  Three weeks later it still feels super clean after brushing and I have gotten used to the clove aftertaste.  I have an issue with receding gums so I will have to see if helps to reverse it.  It is definitely worth trying if you have dental issues.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in health of my mouth. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a lot healthier than regular toothpaste though. Edit: 1/26/16. I recently went to the dentist and he asked me if I&#x27;d brushed my teeth or flossed in between the 6 months from my prior visit. The reason he asked is because I had really bad plaque buildup... Nothing changed besides using this toothpaste. I didn&#x27;t tell him anything because I was too embarrassed to admit I bought into this stuff... Gave it two stars from four because I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> Although I love the concept of this toothpaste, it taste horrible. Bad enough that I can&#x27;t use it. Best I can describe is listerine mixed with baking soda. I based my purchase on reviews and it could just be me, but my wife tried it as well and agrees that it&#x27;s just too awful to use.</li>
            <li> mouth feels great afterwards - the feeling lasts as well.  Very happy with this product and I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love it. Will be reordering soon.</li>
            <li> Eventhou afterwards my teeth and mounth feel incredibly clean&lt;br /&gt;and havent any of that soap latter, the mustard seeds and clay felt a bit awful&lt;br /&gt;and strong. i just would like to be able to confirm that whats in it, before i use again.&lt;br /&gt;i think this is really good quality.</li>
            <li> It certainly has a different taste while brushing, but leaves the mouth feeling clean and refreshed. Very minty when done.</li>
            <li> my only go to for whitening your teeth</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I would give it 5 stars only if it weren&#x27;t so expensive. With ingredients like colloidal silver though I guess I could understand.. tastes amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product which leaves your mouth feeling so refreshing.  Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I like this but the peppermint is VERY strong. If I use more than a very tiny drop it burns my mouth. I probably won&#x27;t ever buy it again, but I&#x27;ll finish the container.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what you could call my teeth after using this. Really great. Wish they sold a tube with 4X the amount. If I brushed my teeth as often as my dentist told me to this would run out even faster. Taste took less than a a week to get used to. You can&#x27;t deny the fresh feeling immediately though. I actually love the way it tastes now. (Pause)</li>
            <li> Good tasting and nourishing to the teeth.  Great product!  I am working on re-mineralizing my teeth and this was a great suggestion.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I hated this toothpaste. It smelled gross and tasted let&#x27;s say like salt. I would not recommend and never buy again. Yuck</li>
            <li> Best crunchy toothpaste I have ever used. Great ingredients and it makes your mouth and tongue super clean. No bad breath issues and I notice I even wake up with a better smelling mouth. A little goes a long way with this toothpaste so be careful. The flavor is very salty, minty and clove so be prepared that it doesn&#x27;t taste great but the benefits of it are outstanding. I have noticed way less plaque build up and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> This product might be very good to your mouth and teeth, however this product contains lead, a substance in bentonite clay which can cause reproductive harm.I learnt this from what it said at the bottom of the product (Prop 65 Warning). I am not saying you shouldn&#x27;t stop using it, it is at your own will, and this helps your teeth and mouth but if you choose to use it be careful and DO NOT swallow it. The taste is not very good either, it tastes as peppermint but then really bad. Good Luck!🎈</li>
            <li> Not only did this take forever to arrive despite ordering it with amazon Prime (it took a week), after two days of using it my teeth are so sensitive I can&#x27;t even drink room temperature water without being in a lot of pain. Definitely won&#x27;t be using it, or buying again.</li>
            <li> This is like no other!! Amazing better than Toms. It just refreshes your whole mouth. Is it the best tasting, no.. But your mouth just feels clean for the first time. I clean my tongue with it too. Wow. I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;impressed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to be an expert on oral hygiene or organic toothpaste. I found myself searching for an alternative to the Costco or SAMs club brand I had been using for many years after my family started the GAPS diet. After trying the tooth soap,I thought there was no hope. It really activated my gag reflex. I tried this tooth paste and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a nice mint flavor. It takes a little time to get used to but I feel good about what I am using on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I keep this toothpaste at my work and use it almost daily.  It tastes great and always leaves a minty fresh, clean feeling in my mouth afterwards.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> taste is not a minty at the end</li>
            <li> I bought this as sort of an impulse buy at a fancy retail store. I&#x27;m dealing with periodontal disease and not dealing with it well (I&#x27;m still pretty young, I take good care of my teeth, and I have only 2 cavities)--I&#x27;m willing to try anything different now. Some natural ingredients seem like they may be better for gum health or alkalizing the mouth or both. Going on instinct alone, this feels like one. It&#x27;s grey-brown in color and looks and feels weird when you&#x27;re used to white paste, but the awkward taste isn&#x27;t bad at all (very strong, very natural tasting), and your mouth feels amazingly clean afterward for an amazingly long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going through the jar pretty quickly and wishing I could get more quantity at once. I also wonder when it is made/shelved and how long it has before expiration. It&#x27;s VERY fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you know that film on your teeth you get after some rich foods like cheese or sugary foods or drinks? And sometimes it feels like it has a hard time coming off? This paste REALLY cleans your teeth, no film left at all.</li>
            <li> MY mouth feels super clean!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The boyfriend and I have commenced to calling this the &#x27;dirt&#x27; toothpaste. This is not because it is a bad product, but because it tastes distinctly like someone tried to disguise dirt with some salt and peppermint extract. If I didn&#x27;t know better I&#x27;d think I was tricked into actually using a Stinky Santa gift left over after the holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this toothpaste leaves my teeth feeling amazing! My breath stays fresh longer, and I get the smooth, squeaky clean surface that generally only comes after dentist appointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s actually not made of dirt. It&#x27;s made up of only 11 ingredients (5 of them being different essential oils) and it does such a fantastic job of cleaning because those ingredients include mineral clay and sea salt. The essential oils they use for flavoring also leave your mouth feeling really fresh and minty and completely free of the clay taste once you are done brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find the little glass jar quite fun to dip my toothbrush in to (and no more arguments about squeezing the tube from the bottom vs. the middle). The packaging is very old-fashioned and makes me feel like I&#x27;m using a product that has truly been time-tested (The brand has been around for 20 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I keep using this, it continues growing on me. And as I write this, I feel like it does such a good job cleaning my teeth that the &#x27;dirt&#x27; taste is barely even a concern. Still, I think I have to remove a star for it - 4/5.</li>
            <li> it takes a little while to get used to the slightly salty taste, but this toothpaste freshens my breath like no other. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Peppermint Toothpaste 3oz toothpaste by Uncle Harry&#x27;s Natural Products is a great product but takes some getting use to, it has not such a good taste when you use it, its not horrible though. And it leaves a bit of a salty taste in your mouth for the first few minutes after use. That&#x27;s to balance out our PH level. OK so why use it, No chemicals (NO BPA) and Great cleaning of your teeth and after a few minutes it leaves a really good taste and freshness in your mouth. Its a great toothpaste and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a grand product.  Love that it is a remineralization product.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a very earthy taste and I want you to know this; especially if you are used to regular minty toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I  made an error on the smallflower store front review section.&lt;br /&gt;This product contains NO glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin in toothpaste(s) will coat the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin in toothpaste can inhibit and/or totally block minerals from being able to re-mineralize the enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 star is completely in error.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good company and they are well know for their niche marketing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a tooth paste work as effectively as this one. I have some gingivitis and even though I take good care of my teeth it never seems to go away. After 4 days I can already see a difference in my mouth/gums/teeth. I look forward to brushing my teeth now because I know that it&#x27;s actually working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a tad phobic going to the dentist but feel pretty good about it today.  I know there&#x27;s a difference and the next time will be even better! Thank God for this AMAZING product.</li>
            <li> I had been using the tooth powder and ordered this by mistake.  But am liking the paste much better.  Had a tooth that was bothering me some and don&#x27;t know if this helped resolve it or not.  But will continue with the paste.</li>
            <li> Incredible ingredients and makes me feel like my teeth are getting a much better cleaning than with a regular toothpaste. That feeling lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> If you make one change to your dental hygiene, make it this one.  It almost burns at first with it&#x27;s minty freshness, but it&#x27;s a good kind of burn, I swear!  It will keep your teeth healthy.  Try it with the abc oral care tooth brushes!  Thank me later. ;)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to the other kind! After using Uncle Harry&#x27;s for the last 6 months, I absolutely cannot go back to using other commercial brands that you see on TV. My mouth feels so clean all day and I no longer wake up with morning &amp;#34;dragon breath.&amp;#34; My mouth actually still tastes okay first thing in the morning. I am a recovered Colgate user and have tried to use it again recently. All I could taste was soapy bubbles in my mouth. It was disgusting. Also, my teeth are whiter (about as white as 3 cups of coffee a day can get) and are no longer streaked that fluoride causes. When I moved away from Seattle, on my way out of town I stopped by Whole Paycheck and picked up all they had on the shelf. I know that Uncle Harry&#x27;s isn&#x27;t available near me anymore, so I had to stock up. I bought 5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a little different than you may be used to, but after brushing with it for two days, you won&#x27;t want to go back. I&#x27;ve asked the small town hippy natural food stores near me to carry it. Hopefully, next time I go in, they will have it. I love this stuff so much, that I need you to buy it to keep them in business so I can have my favorite toothpaste for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste by far.  Leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and I love that it isn&#x27;t sweet.  This is my third jar, can&#x27;t go back to my Tom&#x27;s now that I have used this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It tastes salty and a bit like dirt at first, but it leaves your teeth feeling SO clean and the essential oils really kick in and keep your breath fresh! You will feel like you just got your teeth cleaned at the dentist every time you brush.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It clean my teeth in a way that I haven&#x27;t experience before. I mouth is clean all day long. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and my teeth and gum are healthy and my teeth are abut 4 shades whiter as a bonus!! You have to get use to the taste but I love it now. If you want to have a healthy mouth I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! My teeth feel clean and breath feels super fresh after brushing.</li>
            <li> Great product leaves mouth feeling fresh and clean without all the chemicals of other toothpaste</li>
            <li> Amazing natural paste. Great for gum issues.</li>
            <li> This does not have a taste I love but it made my mouth SOOOO much fresher. My teeth felt clean like never before. I am using this going forward!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste EVER!  It makes my teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> I found this during my search for non-toxic toothpaste that I could swallow for camping and keep next to the bed with a toothbrush for those nights when I forgot to brush my teeth but don&#x27;t want to get out of bed again. I have no problem ingesting a little of this from time to time. (in fact, bentonite clay is a useful detoxifying agent, so that&#x27;s a double-win).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my favorite toothpaste, and after about 1.5 years of use I got a thumbs up from my dentist at my last cleaning. It&#x27;s basically like brushing your teeth with very minty clay - the extreme mint factor along with the slightly rougher than usual texture makes me scoff at all other toothpastes now because my mouth feels so much more sparkly after brushing in comparison. I find that it dries out over time though, so I repackage the jar into smaller containers, which works out nicely for travel as well. The tooth powder is also handy, and a similar experience...but I prefer the paste.</li>
