            <li>This product goes on smoothly and does a good job moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>When I first used this product I thought it was great.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and feels good on your skin.  </li>
            <li>The butter itself is light and airy and absorbs into the skin leaving a wonderful soft feelig!  </li>
            <li>My favorite lotion for my feet</li>
            <li>would love if this product were made without it.</li>
            <li>Once it is applied, the fragrance eases off, and smells more like pear.  </li>
            <li>I love the body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love all your products.</li>
            <li>would buy some more.</li>
            <li>I love the rich velvety texture and the pear/apple smell.</li>
            <li>The body butter is rich and your skin feels lovely after applying the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Avani Dead Sea Body Butter for about 6 months and think its one of the best moisturizers out there.  </li>
            <li>Their product is a great replacement for minor to medium cases of psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>Really creamy very rich and moisturizing..</li>
            <li>I have been using this body butter since June and love how soft my skin is!  </li>
            <li>and since it was a gift I hope it is enjoyed as it  makes skin feel soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent, but I do like the consistency of the butter.</li>
            <li>I love the Avani products overall, but I did not find the scent of this product to be as pleasant as other Avani scents.  </li>
            <li>Within about 10 minutes after its been completely absorbed, your hands will feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Much better than more pricey products that I have tried without being heavy.</li>
            <li>The smell is a faint pear apple at best.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like this product, but I like my unscented Eucerin cream better, for both moisturizing and fragrance.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is soft and light yet strong enough that it leaves a feminine scent, which I like.</li>
            <li>Love this Body Butter so much that I gave several as gifts</li>
            <li>It goes on creamy and you have to get it rubbed in really</li>
            <li>Less is always more.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend all of them.</li>
            <li>After the third use in 2 weeks I broke out with large boil type pimples on both my arms and legs of which is where I used this product.</li>
            <li>It keeps you feeling soft for hours.  </li>
            <li>But it does the job as far as moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li>The old saying &amp;#34; a dab will</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so soft and not oily.  </li>
            <li>They keep my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I only use it at night before bed that way I&#x27;m not touching anything important til it dries.</li>
            <li>Apparently it works well with the Avani Body Scrub as well.</li>
            <li>Skin still very try after multiple uses back to back.</li>
            <li>They area reasonable price compared to other products.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft and keeps it from getting dry.</li>
            <li>I would recommend their products to anyone who has dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin</li>

            <li> The Pear/Apple feels like its almost whipped and you only need a little bit to thoroughly coat your hands.   </li>
            <li> Would order again and a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> Too expensive.  </li>
            <li> when the jar is opened, it smells like artificial banana.  </li>
            <li> These boils were quite painful and taking quite awhile to rid</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avani Dead Sea Body Butter for about 6 months and think its one of the best moisturizers out there.  Unlike some that feel slimy and greasy, this product is especially light and airy.  The Pear/Apple feels like its almost whipped and you only need a little bit to thoroughly coat your hands.

            <li> Love this Body Butter so much that I gave several as gifts and they did not let me down.  Thank you once again Avani :0</li>
            <li> I bought a set of Avani products that included the mud mask, dead sea salt, body scrub and body butter.  I felt like I had just left a spa treatment after using all of these products.  I would highly recommend all of them.</li>
            <li> wife thrilled with product</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion for my feet</li>
            <li> I have been using this body butter since June and love how soft my skin is!  The butter itself is light and airy and absorbs into the skin leaving a wonderful soft feelig!  It keeps you feeling soft for hours.  Will definitly keep on using!</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels after I use it.  Makes my skin feel so soft and keeps it from getting dry.</li>
            <li> Their product is a great replacement for minor to medium cases of psoriasis.  Using this works as well as steroid creams.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product I thought it was great. After the third use in 2 weeks I broke out with large boil type pimples on both my arms and legs of which is where I used this product. I believe it was due to clogged pores?..However that is just an opinion. If you use this product use it with care. These boils were quite painful and taking quite awhile to rid</li>
            <li> as a gift for someone else. She told me it has been some of the best scrub she&#x27;s ever used and I&#x27;ve even heard her friends say they are jealous she has this and they don&#x27;t. Apparently it works well with the Avani Body Scrub as well.</li>
            <li> Really creamy very rich and moisturizing.. Arrived on time</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells nice and the price was excellent on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of body butter I have ordered of Avani.  I have loved all their products.  I have very dry, sensitive skin and this is great on my skin.  It keeps my skin well moisturized.  I would recommend their products to anyone who has dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizer and the scent is delightful.  Much better than more pricey products that I have tried without being heavy.</li>
            <li> Two words luxury experience, my chocolate skin loves this product!!</li>
            <li> The smell is a faint pear apple at best. But it does the job as far as moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li> I found this product quite by accident in Hawaii. I love the rich velvety texture and the pear/apple smell. Since I have ordered it online whenever I run out. I am only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I was very disappointed in finding that parabens were part of this products ingredients which are now known to be cancer causing agents that are directly absorbed into the blood stream.&lt;br /&gt;I would love if this product were made without it.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money and since it was a gift I hope it is enjoyed as it  makes skin feel soft</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with this line.  Too expensive.  I would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin and it didn&#x27;t relieve my dryness.</li>
            <li> Cream is not greasy and smells nice.  It absorbs quickly and feels good on your skin.  Product arrived undamaged; packed well.</li>
            <li> The old saying &amp;#34; a dab will do&amp;#34; applies to this stuff. It goes on creamy and you have to get it rubbed in really really good. Its is a bit greasy til it all soaks in. I only use it at night before bed that way I&#x27;m not touching anything important til it dries. Only real complaint it is that doesn&#x27;t work as well or last as long as I had hoped for. Skin still very try after multiple uses back to back.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about this product line.  I have very dry skin.  This product goes on smoothly and does a good job moisturizing.  I was initially put off by the fragrance:  when the jar is opened, it smells like artificial banana.  Once it is applied, the fragrance eases off, and smells more like pear.  Even so, I&#x27;m not sure that in a blind sniff test one could identify the fragrance as either pear or apple.  Overall, I like this product, but I like my unscented Eucerin cream better, for both moisturizing and fragrance.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent but the cream is nice.</li>
            <li> I love the body lotion.  It leaves your skin so soft and not oily.  I will  use this from now on.  I love all your products.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product that work&#x27;s very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy some more.</li>
            <li> too thick and greasy when smearing. I just use once.</li>
            <li> I love the Avani products overall, but I did not find the scent of this product to be as pleasant as other Avani scents.  The body butter is rich and your skin feels lovely after applying the product.  I  like to use this especailly during the winter months when my skin is dryer.</li>
            <li> This was listed as  Cuumber Pear but came as Apple something. Opened it before I realized it and not very happy. Not even the same consistency let alone fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent, but I do like the consistency of the butter.</li>
            <li> I have used both products for about a year now. They keep my skin soft and moisturized. They area reasonable price compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to go along with the salt scrub by Avani. Love&#x27;em both! Would order again and a little goes a long way. The fragrance is soft and light yet strong enough that it leaves a feminine scent, which I like. Less is always more. The salt scrub is great too! Would make a great gift if even for your self.</li>
