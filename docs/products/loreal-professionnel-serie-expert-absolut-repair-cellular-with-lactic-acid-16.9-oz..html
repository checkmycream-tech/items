            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My hair felt silky after the first time I used this product and smelled wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is not an authentic product!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>I was SO glad to find it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Amazing Product for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Amazing for damaged hair</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>My wife liked it.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell, the quality of the product ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice hair product, leaves it smooth, and controls the damage.</li>
            <li>is incredible aim really really happy, the hair is soft clean and smell soooooo good</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and smells very good too.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, sometimes colored, and this stuff is like a wonderful moisture balm that makes my hair feel silky.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference and it&#x27;s good for day to day use.  </li>
            <li>Truly -- by far -- BEST hair conditioner, ever.  </li>
            <li>Great product, works for a two minute application in the shower or a powerful one over night.</li>
            <li>The best I have found so far.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend more than 5 minutes and rinsing with warm water more towards the colder side to lock in the treatment on your hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner does leave your hair very smooth and the price is about 1/2 of what you would pay at a beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>Better Products out there though.</li>
            <li>For sure would purchase again, no doubt</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a better bargain on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>the better</li>
            <li>My hair dresser recommended this product to be used gathered with the shampoo and it is simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>The packing on this is not my favorite but</li>
            <li>What another review where I have to say more</li>
            <li>I would have returned the product except wasn&#x27;t sure how to pack and send.</li>
            <li>and I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.  </li>
            <li>Better off which Pureology or Keratase, I even like Pantene better.</li>
            <li>Undeniably, I think this is a better product vs. Nature&#x27;s Therapy.</li>
            <li>I like the texture more--</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s much more scent-free than the Nature&#x27;s Therapy, whose faux-apple scent is a bit cloying.</li>
            <li>I have dyed my hair too many times so its kinda damaged.</li>
            <li>I have used kerastasse and this product is much better</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>More course and just ugh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair nice and smooth...</li>
            <li>The product is ok.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know of a more efficient mask as a post chemical hair care.</li>
            <li>I am using this mask many years..</li>
            <li>always satisfied</li>
            <li>It goes without saying that this product makes my hair smooth and healthy.  :)</li>
            <li>Works great makes hair soft &amp; doesn&#x27;t change colored hair&#x27;s tint.&lt;br /&gt;Great product will buy again.  </li>
            <li>Have always loved this product and can&#x27;t find it anywhere locally any more!</li>
            <li>This product was highly rated in a magazine, but I can&#x27;t say it was as good as the comments that were made there.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, wavy, somewhat porous and processed.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a fine product, just not for me.</li>
            <li>The jar is conveniently large and handy to use.  </li>
            <li>It repairs the ends and is a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>Lactic acid is key for a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner rinses clean and leaves my hair easy to manage without causing damage.</li>
            <li>This product is simply fantastic.....</li>
            <li>It works great, especially In conjunction with the L&#x27;Oreal Cellular Repair shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is neat and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>both leave my curly hair shinny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>These products are definitely very similar, and I had been a devotee to the Nature&#x27;s Therapy creme, but I decided to give this a try because I had heard great things.</li>
            <li>Finally, I also greatly prefer the packaging of this product.</li>
            <li>So that my hair wont feel too oily and the bottom is silky and smooth</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>I use this (and the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Protein Mask) as conditioner whenever I wash my hair and it keeps my hair in really good condition.</li>
            <li>The smell is good, and my hair is smoothy and soft after using it.</li>
            <li>I loved everything that Loreal Professional make.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !!!</li>
            <li>Tried this for the first time and found it to be a very good conditioner as I needed some extra moisture in the winter for my chemically treated and colored hair.</li>
            <li>I do love the effect this product has on my unruly hair, HOWEVER, it never fails that about halfway through the bottle, the product starts to smell fishy.</li>
            <li>I first bought in on a 2003 ski trip to Canada and fell in love then and continue to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky smooth and super shiny.</li>
            <li>This is great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Every product in this line is great for dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great conditioner, smells nice, and absolutely makes hair stronger and less brittle.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, my hair has never been so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great on my naturally curly hair, leaving it tangle free with soft, conditioned curls.</li>
            <li>It smells great and adds a nice softness to my coarse Asian hair.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair soft, healthy and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Super for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>This jar is sturdier and the lid has teeth to provide better grip--and it&#x27;s not as wide of a jar so better fit for soapy hands in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the amazon price i paid was about $33 for the 16oz jar.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal, healthy state..</li>
            <li>Although I think it is a bit overpriced, it is very good conditioner for dry, fine hair such as mine.</li>
            <li>I am able to keep my hair very long and HEALTHY with this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff , Makes my hair super soft</li>
            <li>My hair is completely changed, very smooth and hidrated.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky and soft like no other conditioner, plus it smells so nice!</li>
            <li>Coloring my hair really does damage it, but this conditioner makes it smooth again.</li>
            <li>Absolute Repair Cellular is fantastic for damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner gives my hair a healthy look and makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li>Made my scalp itchy which rarely happens.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a marginal difference, but I think it may be worth it.</li>
            <li>Love the quality and the fact that my hair gets soft after the application.</li>
            <li>my opinion it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft and shiny, and knot free!</li>
            <li>The days I use this product, my hair combs right out after washing.</li>
            <li>Use too much of fragrance and full of chemicals...</li>
            <li>Full up to the lid and the smell lasts for the whole day</li>
            <li>Added that last bit because it can be such a challenge to find product that doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, and leaves your hair smelling and feeling great.</li>
            <li>The delivery is very fast though the hurricane Sandy met here.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This is the only conditioner, and I&#x27;ve tried many, that will treat  my hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves the hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The Liss Ultime is better for my coarse curly hair.  </li>
            <li>People ask me all the time how I get my blonde hair to look healthy and not fried...</li>
            <li>My hair became more unmanageable and coarse after using this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not the real deal!</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and have had many procedures done to it</li>
            <li>This works magic on my dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, not bad or anything, but any moderately priced conditioner will do the same thing.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft and makes it look more straight after I blow dry it :) I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress that enough smell is so huge for me when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li>It really improved my hair&#x27; condition and I have processed, blond hair.</li>
            <li>Really recommend it.</li>
            <li>Use this conditioner along with the  Loreal Series Expert Absolute Repair Lactic Acid Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Had very damaged hair because of the highlights.</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged from bleaching.  </li>
            <li>This product is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I used this conditioner 3 times and it did absolutely NOTHING for my hair.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must for over processed hair.</li>
            <li>It has really helped to keep the integrity of my hair.</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal Absolut is very waxy and does not condition my hair well.  </li>
            <li>I already knew the range of products and are very good.&lt;br /&gt;good price for the quantity.</li>
            <li>have tried a number of conditioners and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>Using this in combination with the Oribe Ultra Gentle Shampoo for Keratin treated mixie chick hair (filipino/jamaican).</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky smooth and back to</li>
            <li>The product purchased from Beautylime is not the real product.</li>
            <li>it is the real stuff just like my 5th avenue salon uses but</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this mask.</li>
            <li>It seems expensive, but MUCH better than your hair falling out, and smells nice too.</li>
            <li>This conditioner helps my hair get back a soft healthy feel.  </li>
            <li>The smell has a pleasant buttery note to it, subtle, and not over powering, just like I like it.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than having expensive salon treatments and just as good!</li>
            <li>but I like the other better.</li>
            <li>My hair is colored and easily gets dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I was told this is as good as Keratase nutritive masquintense nourishing treatment which I love but very expensive</li>
            <li>No doubt, they provide similar results, but this product just leaves my dyed and damaged hair a little bit softer, easier to manage/comb, more tangle free, etc.</li>
            <li>Super rich, works instantly or can also be used as a deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I expected, however the package came cracked therefore there is no guarantee this is the original product.</li>
            <li>been using this stuff for years and will continue to do so as long as its available.</li>
            <li>My hair is problematic, with hypothyrodism and a very dry climate, my hair breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>Love this product - I previously purchased from my hairdresser</li>
            <li>My hair is less frizzy and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone that is chemically treating their hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.....</li>
            <li>Both this and the Liss Ultime Smoothing Masque are highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product arrived in a very timely manner, the price was very encouraging, however, when i opened it today to use it on my hair, it smelled very differently from all the other L&#x27;Oreal absolut repair i bought throughout the many years i have been using them.</li>
            <li>The other issue is the smell, its really strong.  </li>
            <li>This product does not have the bad stuff in it and it makes my hair feel great!  </li>
            <li>i am so happy with this produce loreal professional eerie expert absolute repair</li>
            <li>Incidentally, I also tried the Absolut Repair conditioner, and don&#x27;t waste your money; this is better and like 4x</li>
            <li>This is almost 3x the price of Nature&#x27;s Therapy, but since I am not super price sensitive, it is worthwhile to me</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have too much more than a slight pleasant smell (I hate it when hair products smell strongly) and I think my hair looks a lot healthier since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>but now that I live in the desert, I decided to try some again.  </li>
            <li>As a result, I end up using a lot less of it because it sticks in my hair whereas Nature&#x27;s Therapy is so goopy that it easily plops off.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and very soft.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine naturally blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky and I can blow dry it straight without much effort.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know but a huge waste of money</li>
            <li>It is going to leave your hair so soft and workable with any hair style.</li>
            <li>It keeps mine soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>If you are price sensitive, stick to Nature&#x27;s Therapy.</li>
            <li>I had a stylist absolutely ruin my hair and tried numerous products.  </li>
            <li>I makes hair soft and shine.</li>
            <li>Then, I blow dry and use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>It looks European based not the same stuff they sell in the US like in CVS much higher quality</li>
            <li>Intense mask for dry hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, and I can see a definite improvement.</li>
            <li>While most of my hair survived the LONG agonizing transition to platinum, my bangs definitely went crispy with this last round.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve straightened it numerous times after using this product and it is so shiny soft</li>
            <li>When I opened the plastic bag the top to the container was broken.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair, and this conditioner really helps my color last and my hair not get too dry and damaged from the chemicals.  </li>
            <li>This is the only conditioner that makes my bleach blonde hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have thinning hair due to medical issues so I need to be gentle when washing and styling.</li>
            <li>the product inside of it is worth every bit of small work it takes to get into your hands and then on your locks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really thickens creamy butdoesnt weigh your hair down later.</li>

            <li> My hair felt silky after the first time I used this product and smelled wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This is not an authentic product!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> I was SO glad to find it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> Amazing Product for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing for damaged hair</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> My wife liked it.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell, the quality of the product ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice hair product, leaves it smooth, and controls the damage.</li>
            <li> is incredible aim really really happy, the hair is soft clean and smell soooooo good</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and smells very good too.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, sometimes colored, and this stuff is like a wonderful moisture balm that makes my hair feel silky.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference and it&#x27;s good for day to day use.  </li>
            <li> Truly -- by far -- BEST hair conditioner, ever.  </li>
            <li> Great product, works for a two minute application in the shower or a powerful one over night.</li>
            <li> The best I have found so far.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend more than 5 minutes and rinsing with warm water more towards the colder side to lock in the treatment on your hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does leave your hair very smooth and the price is about 1/2 of what you would pay at a beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> Better Products out there though.</li>
            <li> For sure would purchase again, no doubt</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a better bargain on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> the better</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this product to be used gathered with the shampoo and it is simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> The packing on this is not my favorite but</li>
            <li> What another review where I have to say more</li>
            <li> I would have returned the product except wasn&#x27;t sure how to pack and send.</li>
            <li> and I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.  </li>
            <li> Better off which Pureology or Keratase, I even like Pantene better.</li>
            <li> Undeniably, I think this is a better product vs. Nature&#x27;s Therapy.</li>
            <li> I like the texture more--</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s much more scent-free than the Nature&#x27;s Therapy, whose faux-apple scent is a bit cloying.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair too many times so its kinda damaged.</li>
            <li> I have used kerastasse and this product is much better</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> More course and just ugh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair nice and smooth...</li>
            <li> The product is ok.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of a more efficient mask as a post chemical hair care.</li>
            <li> I am using this mask many years..</li>
            <li> always satisfied</li>
            <li> It goes without saying that this product makes my hair smooth and healthy.  :)</li>
            <li> Works great makes hair soft &amp; doesn&#x27;t change colored hair&#x27;s tint.&lt;br /&gt;Great product will buy again.  </li>
            <li> Have always loved this product and can&#x27;t find it anywhere locally any more!</li>
            <li> This product was highly rated in a magazine, but I can&#x27;t say it was as good as the comments that were made there.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine, wavy, somewhat porous and processed.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a fine product, just not for me.</li>
            <li> The jar is conveniently large and handy to use.  </li>
            <li> It repairs the ends and is a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Lactic acid is key for a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner rinses clean and leaves my hair easy to manage without causing damage.</li>
            <li> This product is simply fantastic.....</li>
            <li> It works great, especially In conjunction with the L&#x27;Oreal Cellular Repair shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is neat and smooth.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> both leave my curly hair shinny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> These products are definitely very similar, and I had been a devotee to the Nature&#x27;s Therapy creme, but I decided to give this a try because I had heard great things.</li>
            <li> Finally, I also greatly prefer the packaging of this product.</li>
            <li> So that my hair wont feel too oily and the bottom is silky and smooth</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this (and the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Protein Mask) as conditioner whenever I wash my hair and it keeps my hair in really good condition.</li>
            <li> The smell is good, and my hair is smoothy and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I loved everything that Loreal Professional make.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !!!</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time and found it to be a very good conditioner as I needed some extra moisture in the winter for my chemically treated and colored hair.</li>
            <li> I do love the effect this product has on my unruly hair, HOWEVER, it never fails that about halfway through the bottle, the product starts to smell fishy.</li>
            <li> I first bought in on a 2003 ski trip to Canada and fell in love then and continue to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky smooth and super shiny.</li>
            <li> This is great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Every product in this line is great for dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great conditioner, smells nice, and absolutely makes hair stronger and less brittle.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, my hair has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great on my naturally curly hair, leaving it tangle free with soft, conditioned curls.</li>
            <li> It smells great and adds a nice softness to my coarse Asian hair.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair soft, healthy and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> Super for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> This jar is sturdier and the lid has teeth to provide better grip--and it&#x27;s not as wide of a jar so better fit for soapy hands in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the amazon price i paid was about $33 for the 16oz jar.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal, healthy state..</li>
            <li> Although I think it is a bit overpriced, it is very good conditioner for dry, fine hair such as mine.</li>
            <li> I am able to keep my hair very long and HEALTHY with this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff , Makes my hair super soft</li>
            <li> My hair is completely changed, very smooth and hidrated.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky and soft like no other conditioner, plus it smells so nice!</li>
            <li> Coloring my hair really does damage it, but this conditioner makes it smooth again.</li>
            <li> Absolute Repair Cellular is fantastic for damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner gives my hair a healthy look and makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li> Made my scalp itchy which rarely happens.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a marginal difference, but I think it may be worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and the fact that my hair gets soft after the application.</li>
            <li> my opinion it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair soft and shiny, and knot free!</li>
            <li> The days I use this product, my hair combs right out after washing.</li>
            <li> Use too much of fragrance and full of chemicals...</li>
            <li> Full up to the lid and the smell lasts for the whole day</li>
            <li> Added that last bit because it can be such a challenge to find product that doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, and leaves your hair smelling and feeling great.</li>
            <li> The delivery is very fast though the hurricane Sandy met here.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner, and I&#x27;ve tried many, that will treat  my hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The Liss Ultime is better for my coarse curly hair.  </li>
            <li> People ask me all the time how I get my blonde hair to look healthy and not fried...</li>
            <li> My hair became more unmanageable and coarse after using this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not the real deal!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and have had many procedures done to it</li>
            <li> This works magic on my dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not bad or anything, but any moderately priced conditioner will do the same thing.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair soft and makes it look more straight after I blow dry it :) I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress that enough smell is so huge for me when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li> It really improved my hair&#x27; condition and I have processed, blond hair.</li>
            <li> Really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use this conditioner along with the  Loreal Series Expert Absolute Repair Lactic Acid Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Had very damaged hair because of the highlights.</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged from bleaching.  </li>
            <li> This product is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner 3 times and it did absolutely NOTHING for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must for over processed hair.</li>
            <li> It has really helped to keep the integrity of my hair.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Absolut is very waxy and does not condition my hair well.  </li>
            <li> I already knew the range of products and are very good.&lt;br /&gt;good price for the quantity.</li>
            <li> have tried a number of conditioners and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> Using this in combination with the Oribe Ultra Gentle Shampoo for Keratin treated mixie chick hair (filipino/jamaican).</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky smooth and back to</li>
            <li> The product purchased from Beautylime is not the real product.</li>
            <li> it is the real stuff just like my 5th avenue salon uses but</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> It seems expensive, but MUCH better than your hair falling out, and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner helps my hair get back a soft healthy feel.  </li>
            <li> The smell has a pleasant buttery note to it, subtle, and not over powering, just like I like it.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than having expensive salon treatments and just as good!</li>
            <li> but I like the other better.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored and easily gets dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I was told this is as good as Keratase nutritive masquintense nourishing treatment which I love but very expensive</li>
            <li> No doubt, they provide similar results, but this product just leaves my dyed and damaged hair a little bit softer, easier to manage/comb, more tangle free, etc.</li>
            <li> Super rich, works instantly or can also be used as a deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I expected, however the package came cracked therefore there is no guarantee this is the original product.</li>
            <li> been using this stuff for years and will continue to do so as long as its available.</li>
            <li> My hair is problematic, with hypothyrodism and a very dry climate, my hair breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> Love this product - I previously purchased from my hairdresser</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone that is chemically treating their hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.....</li>
            <li> Both this and the Liss Ultime Smoothing Masque are highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a very timely manner, the price was very encouraging, however, when i opened it today to use it on my hair, it smelled very differently from all the other L&#x27;Oreal absolut repair i bought throughout the many years i have been using them.</li>
            <li> The other issue is the smell, its really strong.  </li>
            <li> This product does not have the bad stuff in it and it makes my hair feel great!  </li>
            <li> i am so happy with this produce loreal professional eerie expert absolute repair</li>
            <li> Incidentally, I also tried the Absolut Repair conditioner, and don&#x27;t waste your money; this is better and like 4x</li>
            <li> This is almost 3x the price of Nature&#x27;s Therapy, but since I am not super price sensitive, it is worthwhile to me</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have too much more than a slight pleasant smell (I hate it when hair products smell strongly) and I think my hair looks a lot healthier since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> but now that I live in the desert, I decided to try some again.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I end up using a lot less of it because it sticks in my hair whereas Nature&#x27;s Therapy is so goopy that it easily plops off.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and very soft.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair so soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine naturally blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky and I can blow dry it straight without much effort.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know but a huge waste of money</li>
            <li> It is going to leave your hair so soft and workable with any hair style.</li>
            <li> It keeps mine soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> If you are price sensitive, stick to Nature&#x27;s Therapy.</li>
            <li> I had a stylist absolutely ruin my hair and tried numerous products.  </li>
            <li> I makes hair soft and shine.</li>
            <li> Then, I blow dry and use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> It looks European based not the same stuff they sell in the US like in CVS much higher quality</li>
            <li> Intense mask for dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, and I can see a definite improvement.</li>
            <li> While most of my hair survived the LONG agonizing transition to platinum, my bangs definitely went crispy with this last round.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve straightened it numerous times after using this product and it is so shiny soft</li>
            <li> When I opened the plastic bag the top to the container was broken.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair, and this conditioner really helps my color last and my hair not get too dry and damaged from the chemicals.  </li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that makes my bleach blonde hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair due to medical issues so I need to be gentle when washing and styling.</li>
            <li> the product inside of it is worth every bit of small work it takes to get into your hands and then on your locks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thickens creamy butdoesnt weigh your hair down later.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse, curly and color processed (double) over grey.  </li>
            <li> I like how you don&#x27;t have to wait a long time for the product to soak in, unlike deep conditioners where you have to wait for awhile.</li>
            <li> My hair is Blonde and this repaired my dry hair..</li>
            <li> After I rinse this out, I towel dry, and use FrizzEase double strength serum.</li>
            <li> especially if your hair is colored and dry.</li>
            <li> have mixed hair and very dry</li>
            <li> my hair is long and color treated....</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it lasted almost 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> Been using this brand for a long time.</li>
            <li> the smallest amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you hair is dry from over using styling tools this product is a must have for bi weekly treatments.</li>
            <li> My hair gets dry from coloring it.</li>
            <li> The nature&#x27;s therapy jar is so big and unwieldy and the lid is so smooth that if your hands have any bit of soapiness on them, it&#x27;s impossible to open.</li>
            <li> Works on dry porous  hair</li>
            <li> I look no more.&lt;br /&gt;Great for damaged, dry, curly or ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my blond highlighted hair from looking dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It leaves hair silky and shiny and only takes a few extra minutes in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I use it the same way I use the Nature&#x27;s Therapy Creme, which means I essentially use it as an everyday (or every other day in my case) 2-min conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very dry color treated hair</li>
            <li> A little cream is enough to take effect.</li>
            <li> When dry, it is not so fly-away and has a shine to it that I don&#x27;t get from other conditioners, (except the L&#x27;Oreal products).  </li>
            <li> It really helps control and moisturize my thin hair that tends to frizz in humidity.</li>
            <li> Product delivered on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as expected</li>
            <li> A few times a week I use as a regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have natural, spiral curls...which are thick</li>
            <li> and I use it every time, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit go a long way.</li>
            <li> I took this into my local salon centric (I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist but am unable to purchase through salon centric, have to work at a L&#x27;Oreal Salon)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to this conditioner and will be trying their other products.  </li>
            <li> I recomend this product to other shoppers . .</li>
            <li> I even apply a small to the ends and leave in for extra conditioning when needed.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just a little dry, and this conditioner overwhelms it.  </li>
            <li> so I know if it is fake or the real thing.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down when styling.</li>
            <li> Had a previous experience with this which led to this purchase.</li>
            <li> This one has a slight medicinal smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m also banking on using less of this product vs. Nature&#x27;s Therapy to close some of the price gap).</li>
            <li> It was a mess.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick</li>
            <li> I have fairly long thick hair that I color about every 6 months.</li>
            <li> only negative is the directions are so small</li>
            <li> I have longer hair and have had trouble coming through it after washing.</li>
            <li> A few years ago my hair was so burned by a perm that I had to go buy some wigs.  </li>
            <li> Without leaving my hair oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> It is thick and leaves the hair extremely hydrated.</li>
            <li> aside from those small marginal differences vs. Nature&#x27;s Therapy in results, what else do I like?</li>
            <li> There was a cheaper one but was sold from a different seller so given some of the dodgy ratings claiming fake product, I paid the premium to go with an Amazon sold product.</li>
            <li> I see a dramatic difference using this vs average conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and have a hard time with conditioners.</li>
            <li> this one is definitely fake and an imitation.  </li>
            <li> It smells like I am wearing a lot of perfume and not a good one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> Authentic absolut repair will work wonders on your hair but this crap is worthless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe a fake product?</li>
            <li> It was awful - made my hair tacky and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I found it impossible to read so went on line.  </li>
            <li> but since I can&#x27;t find this in the stores this is not too bad.</li>
            <li> I doubt on quality of it :(</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> My hair is awful after using this for a week.</li>

            <li> This stuff is great! Made my hair so soft and silky! Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Great product. Leave-in 2 minutes, rinse out.  Leaves hair silky smooth and super shiny. Repairs the total hair shaft and split ends.</li>
            <li> Better Products out there though.</li>
            <li> is the best !!!!!! i am so happy with this produce loreal professional eerie expert absolute repair is incredible aim really really happy, the hair is soft clean and smell soooooo good</li>
            <li> Amazing Product for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great product for those with color treated hair. It repairs the ends and is a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great product at a huge savings!  Lactic acid is key for a great shampoo.  For sure would purchase again, no doubt</li>
            <li> I do love the effect this product has on my unruly hair, HOWEVER, it never fails that about halfway through the bottle, the product starts to smell fishy. I&#x27;ve purchased it twice online and once in a salon, and it&#x27;s the same thing every time.</li>
            <li> Love this product - I previously purchased from my hairdresser but it&#x27;s a better bargain on Amazon.  The longer you leave it it the better you hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> THIS IS SPETACULAR. MY HAIR LOOOKS AWESOME WITH IT.&lt;br /&gt;FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and have a hard time with conditioners. But this one is awesome. It&#x27;s really thickens creamy butdoesnt weigh your hair down later. Love it!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product about 5 yrs ago and I&#x27;ve used it ever since.  I have color treated hair and I&#x27;m all gray underneath. This conditioner gives my hair a healthy look and makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. It really improved my hair&#x27; condition and I have processed, blond hair. I use it instead of regular conditioner. Really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use this conditioner along with the  Loreal Series Expert Absolute Repair Lactic Acid Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;and your hair....my hair is long and color treated....will be the best it can be.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price too compared to the Salon price.</li>
            <li> Perfect!! My wife liked it.</li>
            <li> Great hair mask......</li>
            <li> Intense mask for dry hair. My daughter&#x27;s hair was damaged from sun and pool and this cream renews it to the naked eye.</li>
            <li> Amazing for damaged hair</li>
            <li> I love this product! It really helps control and moisturize my thin hair that tends to frizz in humidity. It smells great too! So much cheaper than having expensive salon treatments and just as good!</li>
            <li> This, I used after the shampoo, and  have used it several times now, and I can see the elasticity coming back to my hair.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s soft, and I can see a definite improvement.</li>
            <li> Happy I got this. I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product did an excellent job, very happy.</li>
            <li> I use this product 2-3 times a week after shampooing. Since using this product there has been a noticible difference in my hair looking healthier. I have longer hair and have had trouble coming through it after washing. The days I use this product, my hair combs right out after washing. It&#x27;s a great conditioner, smells nice, and absolutely makes hair stronger and less brittle. It also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down when styling. I love this product and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> really good productor</li>
            <li> Had very damaged hair because of the highlights. My hair dresser recommended this product to be used gathered with the shampoo and it is simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is completely changed, very smooth and hidrated. Totatly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it! leaves my hair soft and makes it look more straight after I blow dry it :) I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I was introduced to it by my stylist and have been hooked for a couple years. I have thinning hair due to medical issues so I need to be gentle when washing and styling. This conditioner rinses clean and leaves my hair easy to manage without causing damage.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky after this treatment!</li>
            <li> I used it for several  years. It goes without saying that this product makes my hair smooth and healthy.  :)</li>
            <li> A few years ago my hair was so burned by a perm that I had to go buy some wigs.  A salon recommended this conditioner and it did help nurture my hair back to health.  Hadn&#x27;t used it since then, but now that I live in the desert, I decided to try some again.  Although I think it is a bit overpriced, it is very good conditioner for dry, fine hair such as mine.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time and found it to be a very good conditioner as I needed some extra moisture in the winter for my chemically treated and colored hair. It&#x27;s pricy but since I can&#x27;t find this in the stores this is not too bad.</li>
            <li> My hair felt silky after the first time I used this product and smelled wonderful.  If you hair is dry from over using styling tools this product is a must have for bi weekly treatments.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, sometimes colored, and this stuff is like a wonderful moisture balm that makes my hair feel silky.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair conditioner. It keeps my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Coloring my hair really does damage it, but this conditioner makes it smooth again.</li>
            <li> This product is simply fantastic.....I never used this product.....but i really loved and i advised for everyone who is looking for a great product</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged from bleaching.  This is the only conditioner, and I&#x27;ve tried many, that will treat  my hair.  I LOVE it and couldn&#x27;t do without!!!</li>
            <li> This works magic on my dry and damaged hair. I am not buying anything else ever! Leaves the hair soft and smooth. I have long hair and it lasted almost 6 months.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and frizzy, this product decreases frizzes a lot and makes my curly hair look nicer.</li>
            <li> Absolute Repair Cellular is fantastic for damaged hair.  I  recommend it for any hair needing repair. I have used it for years but isn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;easy to find. I always find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works great! I highly recommend for anyone that is chemically treating their hair. It works great, especially In conjunction with the L&#x27;Oreal Cellular Repair shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is Blonde and this repaired my dry hair.. it is simply beautiful.. I am definitely ordering this again!</li>
            <li> Product delivered on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I have natural, spiral curls...which are thick and I tend to have frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer use mousse, gel or hairspray....instead, after washing and conditioning&lt;br /&gt;my hair, I work a half-dollar size amount of Absolut Repair through my hair...&lt;br /&gt;Perfect results, every time !</li>
            <li> The packing on this is not my favorite but the product inside of it is worth every bit of small work it takes to get into your hands and then on your locks.  It smells wonderful I can&#x27;t stress that enough smell is so huge for me when it comes to hair products. It is going to leave your hair so soft and workable with any hair style. It works great on your ends and you don&#x27;t have to worry about build up on your scalp. Never a waxy or oily strand of hair to be seen with this product. Works best the longer you let set but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend more than 5 minutes and rinsing with warm water more towards the colder side to lock in the treatment on your hair.</li>
            <li> The Liss Ultime is better for my coarse curly hair.  This conditions well, but I like the other better. My hair is softer with the Liss Ultime</li>
            <li> While most of my hair survived the LONG agonizing transition to platinum, my bangs definitely went crispy with this last round. I use this (and the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Protein Mask) as conditioner whenever I wash my hair and it keeps my hair in really good condition. It seems expensive, but MUCH better than your hair falling out, and smells nice too. Definite must!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best and this was a great price!  It is great for color treated hair.  It keeps mine soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that makes my bleach blonde hair soft and manageable. People ask me all the time how I get my blonde hair to look healthy and not fried...and I tell them about this product! I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff , Makes my hair super soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. This product is very hydrating. Without leaving my hair oily or heavy. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. What another review where I have to say more and it really isn&#x27;t necessary!</li>
            <li> This product was highly rated in a magazine, but I can&#x27;t say it was as good as the comments that were made there.  It&#x27;s okay, not bad or anything, but any moderately priced conditioner will do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in the Philippines so I know if it is fake or the real thing.  this one is definitely fake and an imitation.  My hair became more unmanageable and coarse after using this product.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review about this product mixing it up with another kerastase mask i bought earlier from my hair salon. This product arrived in a very timely manner, the price was very encouraging, however, when i opened it today to use it on my hair, it smelled very differently from all the other L&#x27;Oreal absolut repair i bought throughout the many years i have been using them. It also took longer to get rinsed off my hair. Not sure if this is an original that has been sitting on shelf for many years before arriving to me, or if it just a fake! I ordered the same hair mask from another supplier through Amazon and they smelled different. I am not going to buy from this seller because the item raised a flag of authinticity.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever. I use it a few times a week. Keeps my hair soft. My hair gets dry from coloring it. My daughter used it on me when she was  a stylist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner/mask twice a week for years.  My hair is coarse, curly and color processed (double) over grey.  After I rinse this out, I towel dry, and use FrizzEase double strength serum. Then, I blow dry and use hot rollers.  I always get compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li> This is great for dry hair.  It makes a huge difference and it&#x27;s good for day to day use.  I see a dramatic difference using this vs average conditioners.  I like how you don&#x27;t have to wait a long time for the product to soak in, unlike deep conditioners where you have to wait for awhile.</li>
            <li> I like the product and had used it before I ordered from Amazon.  But when the container of conditioner arrived, it was wrapped in a plastic bag. When I opened the plastic bag the top to the container was broken.  Conditioner was pouring out of the jar.  It was a mess.  I had to put the conditioner in another container.  I would have returned the product except wasn&#x27;t sure how to pack and send.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast. The product was exactly as expected and I have already ordered more. Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is the same quality as the one I have purchased at my local salon, only it was $11 cheaper. It smells great and adds a nice softness to my coarse Asian hair. I can feel a difference when I condition with this product.</li>
            <li> Truly -- by far -- BEST hair conditioner, ever.  I have long, fine naturally blonde hair.  I am able to keep my hair very long and HEALTHY with this product.  It is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, my hair has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> Great product by loreal.  Had a previous experience with this which led to this purchase. Would recommend to those with course hair texture also.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal conditioner is always what I order.  The jar is conveniently large and handy to use.  My hair is neat and smooth.</li>
            <li> Super for color treated hair. Keeps hair soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> Good product! Good seller!!</li>
            <li> This is not an authentic product! I&#x27;ve used this product before, purchased through a salon, and this is not the same formula. I took this into my local salon centric (I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist but am unable to purchase through salon centric, have to work at a L&#x27;Oreal Salon) and it&#x27;s not the real deal! The consistency is off, the fragrance is off, and the texture is off. I used this conditioner 3 times and it did absolutely NOTHING for my hair. Authentic absolut repair will work wonders on your hair but this crap is worthless. i am returning and buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I love it. On my third time using it. My hair is shinning and looks healthier. I totally recomend it</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.  I&#x27;ve switched to this conditioner and will be trying their other products.  It looks European based not the same stuff they sell in the US like in CVS much higher quality</li>
            <li> This is the best conditional on the market.</li>
            <li> Use too much of fragrance and full of chemicals... Temporary fix for your hair</li>
            <li> Great product ! This is my 2nd jar</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my hair,it makes it shine,&lt;br /&gt;softness and volume...5 stars for it.&lt;br /&gt;For me Loreal is the best.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I expected, however the package came cracked therefore there is no guarantee this is the original product.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product is satisfactory. The delivery is very fast though the hurricane Sandy met here. The smell is good, and my hair is smoothy and soft after using it. I like the product.</li>
            <li> I loved everything that Loreal Professional make. I liked the smell, the quality of the product ... I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the shampoo and I love it! both leave my curly hair shinny and smooth.  The price is reasonable and smells very good too.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must for over processed hair. It has really helped to keep the integrity of my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, works for a two minute application in the shower or a powerful one over night. (sleep with a shower cap on and wake to silky softness)</li>
            <li> This masque is a must for anyone with damaged hair.  It leaves hair silky and shiny and only takes a few extra minutes in the shower.  I&#x27;ll never be without this!</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle to justify the price. It is a regular mask like others.&lt;br /&gt;The result is similar of others  cheaper masks.</li>
            <li> I was told this is as good as Keratase nutritive masquintense nourishing treatment which I love but very expensive so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all its nothing like the above product.  The L&#x27;Oreal Absolut is very waxy and does not condition my hair well.  Made my scalp itchy which rarely happens.  The other issue is the smell, its really strong.  It smells like I am wearing a lot of perfume and not a good one.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again and needing to give it away.  Better off which Pureology or Keratase, I even like Pantene better.</li>
            <li> I already knew the range of products and are very good.&lt;br /&gt;good price for the quantity. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> These products are definitely very similar, and I had been a devotee to the Nature&#x27;s Therapy creme, but I decided to give this a try because I had heard great things. Undeniably, I think this is a better product vs. Nature&#x27;s Therapy. No doubt, they provide similar results, but this product just leaves my dyed and damaged hair a little bit softer, easier to manage/comb, more tangle free, etc. It&#x27;s a marginal difference, but I think it may be worth it. I use it the same way I use the Nature&#x27;s Therapy Creme, which means I essentially use it as an everyday (or every other day in my case) 2-min conditioner. Incidentally, I also tried the Absolut Repair conditioner, and don&#x27;t waste your money; this is better and like 4x the size of the conditioner they sell on Amazon at 2x the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So aside from those small marginal differences vs. Nature&#x27;s Therapy in results, what else do I like? I like the texture more--it&#x27;s way thicker like a masque should be. As a result, I end up using a lot less of it because it sticks in my hair whereas Nature&#x27;s Therapy is so goopy that it easily plops off.  I also prefer the smell of this product--it&#x27;s much more scent-free than the Nature&#x27;s Therapy, whose faux-apple scent is a bit cloying. This one has a slight medicinal smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it. Finally, I also greatly prefer the packaging of this product. The nature&#x27;s therapy jar is so big and unwieldy and the lid is so smooth that if your hands have any bit of soapiness on them, it&#x27;s impossible to open. This jar is sturdier and the lid has teeth to provide better grip--and it&#x27;s not as wide of a jar so better fit for soapy hands in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the amazon price i paid was about $33 for the 16oz jar. There was a cheaper one but was sold from a different seller so given some of the dodgy ratings claiming fake product, I paid the premium to go with an Amazon sold product. In comparison, Nature&#x27;s Therapy I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon for about $13. This is almost 3x the price of Nature&#x27;s Therapy, but since I am not super price sensitive, it is worthwhile to me (I&#x27;m also banking on using less of this product vs. Nature&#x27;s Therapy to close some of the price gap). If you are price sensitive, stick to Nature&#x27;s Therapy. It is still a great product with great results.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored and easily gets dry and frizzy.  This conditioner helps my hair get back a soft healthy feel.  No longer frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of conditioners and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Fast shipping !!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky and I can blow dry it straight without much effort. Doesn&#x27;t have too much more than a slight pleasant smell (I hate it when hair products smell strongly) and I think my hair looks a lot healthier since I&#x27;ve been using it. My hairdresser even noticed. I use in conjunction with either the matching shampoo or the \\&quot;clear\\&quot; shampoo in this same line.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, It has replaced the conditioner. I have dyed my hair too many times so its kinda damaged. I only apply it on the bottom of the hair and avoid the root part. So that my hair wont feel too oily and the bottom is silky and smooth</li>
            <li> Very good! A little cream is enough to take effect. Restores damaged hair, leaving it strong and beautiful. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells great and hair feels great afterwards. Detangles my hair with no problem at all. Using this in combination with the Oribe Ultra Gentle Shampoo for Keratin treated mixie chick hair (filipino/jamaican). Added that last bit because it can be such a challenge to find product that doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, and leaves your hair smelling and feeling great.</li>
            <li> use it regularly , does its job</li>
            <li> Not good quality. I doubt on quality of it :(</li>
            <li> This conditioner does leave your hair very smooth and the price is about 1/2 of what you would pay at a beauty supply store.  I have used kerastasse and this product is much better</li>
            <li> I use Absolut Repair once a week after I wash and rinse. I keep it on for 30 minutes wearing a shower cap. My hair is less frizzy and more manageable. A MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> If you use a lot your hair becomes sticky even if you rinse several times. Works on dry porous  hair</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  I have color treated hair, and this conditioner really helps my color last and my hair not get too dry and damaged from the chemicals.  I wash my hair twice a week and I use it every time, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Horrible. My hair is awful after using this for a week. More course and just ugh.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a fake product? I don&#x27;t know but a huge waste of money</li>
            <li> Drug stores are selling 8 ounces for $30.  Works great makes hair soft &amp; doesn&#x27;t change colored hair&#x27;s tint.&lt;br /&gt;Great product will buy again.  Absolutely.</li>
            <li> The best masque ever!!!!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a hair dresser since 1974. Always looked for the best conditioner. I look no more.&lt;br /&gt;Great for damaged, dry, curly or ethnic hair. Super rich, works instantly or can also be used as a deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best hair products ever.</li>
            <li> This conditioner came hairdresser recommended.  It keeps my blond highlighted hair from looking dry and frizzy.  I use it daily to produce shiny, lustrous locks!</li>
            <li> I had a stylist absolutely ruin my hair and tried numerous products.  This one works.  only negative is the directions are so small I found it impossible to read so went on line.  I&#x27;ve used by wetting my hair and letting it sit for a while, then shampoo and rinse.  A few times a week I use as a regular conditioner.  Highly recommend.....&lt;br /&gt;Marsha McDonald is the user...</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and have had many procedures done to it (coloring, straightening, curling, etc) This product does everything it says. It leaves my hair silky and soft like no other conditioner, plus it smells so nice! Ever since I discovered this cream I stopped using others (and I have used a lot!)</li>
            <li> Je suis contente et je vais recommandé</li>
            <li> I have long hair and I wanted a good conditioner that didn&#x27;t have the harmful stuff in it.  This product does not have the bad stuff in it and it makes my hair feel great!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair conditioner ever! My hair is fine, wavy, somewhat porous and processed. This keep away frizzies and gives my hair body &amp; shine. I think it&#x27;s helped at strengthening it too.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this to me after my hair was getting over processed. I was SO glad to find it on Amazon!  It makes my hair silky smooth and back to it&#x27;s normal, healthy state..</li>
            <li> My hair is problematic, with hypothyrodism and a very dry climate, my hair breaks easily.  Using the Absolut Repair system helps maintain healthier hair.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and the fact that my hair gets soft after the application.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair nice and smooth...&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed hair and very dry</li>
            <li> If you have super-dry hair, this is the conditioner for you.  I personally have hair that&#x27;s just a little dry, and this conditioner overwhelms it.  I think it&#x27;s a fine product, just not for me.</li>
            <li> The product purchased from Beautylime is not the real product. It was awful - made my hair tacky and heavy.  I returned it and ordered the product from Kandi Cosmetics and what  a world of difference it is the real stuff just like my 5th avenue salon uses but at 1/2 the price!</li>
            <li> The product is ok. No suprise.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick and I dye it often. I use this 2-3x a week and it makes my hair healthy and beautiful. I&#x27;ve straightened it numerous times after using this product and it is so shiny soft, I can&#x27;t keep my hands off it.  Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this product and can&#x27;t find it anywhere locally any more!</li>
            <li> Even after using this conditioner one time, I can feel the difference in my hair.  When dry, it is not so fly-away and has a shine to it that I don&#x27;t get from other conditioners, (except the L&#x27;Oreal products).  Both this and the Liss Ultime Smoothing Masque are highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have very dry color treated hair and I use this for my regular conditioning.  It makes my hair shiny and very soft.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I like it very much. I recomend this product to other shoppers . .</li>
            <li> This is the greatest stuff since sliced bread. I first bought in on a 2003 ski trip to Canada and fell in love then and continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It is great on my naturally curly hair, leaving it tangle free with soft, conditioned curls. The smell has a pleasant buttery note to it, subtle, and not over powering, just like I like it. I even apply a small to the ends and leave in for extra conditioning when needed. Every product in this line is great for dry or damaged hair. It is masque-like and works awesome. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is thick and leaves the hair extremely hydrated. The best I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Great product! Been using this brand for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was buying this product a the salon after my hairdresser recommended it, until I found it for a bit cheaper on Amazon. I have fairly long thick hair that I color about every 6 months. This keeps my hair soft, healthy and easy to manage.  I use it on my hair about every three days.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Full up to the lid and the smell lasts for the whole day</li>
            <li> best conditioner ever. the smallest amount goes a long way. leaves my hair soft and shiny, and knot free! been using this stuff for years and will continue to do so as long as its available. highly recommend! especially if your hair is colored and dry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this mask. I don&#x27;t know of a more efficient mask as a post chemical hair care. I recommend the shampoo and the Thermo repair as well.</li>
            <li> This is a professionnel hair mask indeed. It is worth every penny, smells delicious and it does wonders for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice hair product, leaves it smooth, and controls the damage. Instead of using it as recommended I leave it on for about 20 min with a heat cover, since that was the way my hairdresser used to do it.</li>
            <li> I am using this mask many years.. always satisfied</li>
            <li> Great for colored hair. I makes hair soft and shine. I always use this. Just a little bit go a long way.</li>
