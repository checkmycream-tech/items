    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Just perfect!  </li>
            <li>Superb... one of the best, a must have.</li>
            <li>but he thinks it is the best.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good buy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the night life scene and sometimes during the day.</li>
            <li>But still, this is a TOP three all-time best.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells so good</li>
            <li>Is an every day prerequisite for a man that want&#x27;s to smell good without being over powering.</li>
            <li>Nice try</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great intimate smell and not as strong as one may think.  </li>
            <li>Lesson learned - Stick to buying perfumes from reputable retailers or better still the duty free shops.</li>
            <li>He is very pleased with it, spell great and lasts long!</li>
            <li>and it really smells good.  </li>
            <li>This is the \\&quot;one\\&quot; that people ask me all the time \\&quot;what is your perfume?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;And to make sure it is original, I always buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I got more and more success (harassed often) just using those samples.  </li>
            <li>a lot of humidity specially during the summer, the other perfumes that I have from then are more suited for use at night and this one is an exceptional perfume to use on a regular day to day, as it has a very fresh and delightful woody  scent to it, and it*s very elegant and discrete as it should be.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and clean and although I am allergic to many colognes and perfumes, this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>I used these two parfumes for 3 years, and I know the original smell.</li>
            <li>I never forgot how much I loved it &amp; searched for it last month on Amazon and bought it for my husband</li>
            <li>The brand name already said*s it all, as Givenchy has many classic fragrances, I*ve being using their perfunes for some years by now and decided to add this one to my list.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my dad because he absolutely loves this cologne but couldn&#x27;t find it in the department stores!!</li>
            <li>It has a fresh pleasant /not very strong but long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>It is fresh, unique, sexy, sophisticated, long lasting.</li>
            <li>Cheap, fast shipment, but this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>I used the sample going out to a party (my first use), and I got bitten by three girls in that party.</li>
            <li>Always test the perfume on your skin, before buying it, ask for a sample, try it at a store, as you may know, perfumes may dramatically change from the recipient were it*s contained and when it*s on your skin, so ALWAYS try it first.</li>
            <li>Delivery is indeed fast!</li>
            <li>In reality, these parfumes differ much!</li>
            <li>I love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li>Moreover, in my package Givenchy blue label and Givenchy pour homme are absolutely identical - a cheap odecolone!</li>
            <li>I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and as you can figure out, here is very hot and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years and the smell remains strong till the last drop -</li>
            <li>By the time I wanted to buy the full bottle, a lot of older and young men were wearing Givenchy Pour Homme, just like Armani Acqua di Gio.</li>
            <li>I found it to be a little strong for me</li>
            <li>All of them were like \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>Is manly, but soft, powdery feel.</li>
            <li>Perfume lasted for only the first three sprays, I guess they mixed something else</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This cologne smells so good I got up to sniff out who had just walked past my desk wearing it to ask what it was. That was years ago but I couldn&#x27;t find it. I never forgot how much I loved it &amp; searched for it last month on Amazon and bought it for my husband and I LOVE it. He does too. It&#x27;s so light and clean and although I am allergic to many colognes and perfumes, this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Perfume lasted for only the first three sprays, I guess they mixed something else &#x27;cos I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years and the smell remains strong till the last drop - well not for this bottle.    Lesson learned - Stick to buying perfumes from reputable retailers or better still the duty free shops.</li>
            <li> I had 3 spray samples of this perfume before it was even in stores worldwide. I was just 19 back then.  I used the sample going out to a party (my first use), and I got bitten by three girls in that party. All of them were like \\&quot;Wow you just smell so good\\&quot;. I got more and more success (harassed often) just using those samples.  By the time I wanted to buy the full bottle, a lot of older and young men were wearing Givenchy Pour Homme, just like Armani Acqua di Gio. So I went for Givenchy pour Homme Blue Label.   But still, this is a TOP three all-time best. It is fresh, unique, sexy, sophisticated, long lasting. Just perfect!  Now that there are a lil bit less people using it, I will go and get it.</li>
            <li> The brand name already said*s it all, as Givenchy has many classic fragrances, I*ve being using their perfunes for some years by now and decided to add this one to my list.  I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and as you can figure out, here is very hot and there*s a lot of humidity specially during the summer, the other perfumes that I have from then are more suited for use at night and this one is an exceptional perfume to use on a regular day to day, as it has a very fresh and delightful woody  scent to it, and it*s very elegant and discrete as it should be.  You can*t miss adding this one.    P.S&gt; Always test the perfume on your skin, before buying it, ask for a sample, try it at a store, as you may know, perfumes may dramatically change from the recipient were it*s contained and when it*s on your skin, so ALWAYS try it first.</li>
            <li> Superb... one of the best, a must have. Head turner.</li>
            <li> I could only find on line this Christmas gift and it was well received by my son.  I found it to be a little strong for me personally but he thinks it is the best.  Glad to find it this way and will shop for other items when the going gets complicated!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad because he absolutely loves this cologne but couldn&#x27;t find it in the department stores!! He is very pleased with it, spell great and lasts long!</li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 perfumes from Dealsbreaker - Givenchy pour hommme and Givenchy blue label. Delivery is indeed fast! However, the smell is fake! I used these two parfumes for 3 years, and I know the original smell. These two are FAKE! not original! Moreover, in my package Givenchy blue label and Givenchy pour homme are absolutely identical - a cheap odecolone! In reality, these parfumes differ much! probable chinese fake production! Perhaps, Dealsbreaker hoped that in Uzbekistan, noone could feel the difference. ((( Very disappointed! NOT recommend to buy from this supplier!</li>
            <li> Cheap, fast shipment, but this is not the real deal. Nice try</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It has a fresh pleasant /not very strong but long lasting scent. This is the \\&quot;one\\&quot; that people ask me all the time \\&quot;what is your perfume?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;And to make sure it is original, I always buy from Amazon. Why would you risk $45 for buying $3 cheaper?! and I don&#x27;t understand the people who is blaming the perfume by giving one star instead of the those fake perfume sellers. That comments belong to the seller&#x27;s profile, not to the product itself.</li>
            <li> This is a very good buy.  Cheaper than any department store and it really smells good.  I love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s becoming impossible to find these days. If you do find it at a merchant, they&#x27;re going to want to remind you of that and charge you $70 for it. Screw that.</li>
            <li> Great intimate smell and not as strong as one may think.  It&#x27;s great for the night life scene and sometimes during the day.</li>
            <li> Givenchy Pour Homme is one of those scents you will not ever get tiered of. Is an every day prerequisite for a man that want&#x27;s to smell good without being over powering. People will remember you, in a comforting way. Is manly, but soft, powdery feel. Again, a little goes a long way. Enjoy.</li>
