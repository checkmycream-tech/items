    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Works best when followed by a night serum/</li>
            <li>Even my husband was impressed after he felt the results.  </li>
            <li>Those are also both items I&#x27;d recommend, but I have a \\&quot;best of\\&quot; REN kit from Seph0ra that I haven&#x27;t tried... at this rate I&#x27;ll probably end up being a REN junkie.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product &amp; product line.</li>
            <li>The 4 star review for an otherwise excellent product is for the length that you have to leave this on- 10</li>
            <li>One of the best masks I&#x27;ve ever bought!  </li>
            <li>so I stopped using it, hoping it would ease my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product!</li>
            <li>I actually do my best to time it</li>
            <li>so I use the mask close to a date or an occasion in which I want to look my best.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>(although now I wonder if those were awesome as well.).</li>
            <li>Impressed...</li>
            <li>The best compliment I have ever received?</li>
            <li>Superb product!</li>
            <li>It is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I Love this mask!!!</li>
            <li>price is very good about 9 dollars cheaper...</li>
            <li>Their product are great and wonderful.</li>
            <li>My face feels great after using this mask.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great for evening out skin tone and preventing razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great after I use the mask, gets rid of any dryness and flakes.</li>
            <li>Everyone has had a great response to this.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>Great results</li>
            <li>My coworkers commenting on how great my face looks.</li>
            <li>This is a great mask.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>I used this twice already (in one week) and my skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to do it a couple times a week if you want to see the best results.  </li>
            <li>so good pricing here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken good care of my skin since my 30&#x27;s, but I have some stubborn enlarged pores and age spots that I want to get rid of.  </li>
            <li>Its good but does not work as well as I thought</li>
            <li>LOVE this and all Ren products!</li>
            <li>I just reordered this renewal mask because it is just so great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The peel smells very nice and is easy too use.</li>
            <li>This mask is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>So, I think it might be a nice product, but doesn&#x27;t work for everyone (like all products, I guess).  </li>
            <li>Beauty control stopped making the one I really liked.</li>
            <li>The instruction say to leave on for 10 minutes then using a wash cloth and warm water to remove.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin glow so nicely.</li>
            <li>This just gave my face a nice glow</li>
            <li>It does smell nice; It feels nice when it&#x27;s on my face</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes, I begin thoroughly rinsing my face with warm water.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a bit pricey, but nice to have in your arsenal of skin care products.</li>
            <li>It feels kind of slimy on the face - I don&#x27;t like the feeling it has on my skin.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply(avoid eyes)</li>
            <li>Best stuff for sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have never used a product that was more effective on my congested pores than this.</li>
            <li>product is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin bright and smooth.  </li>
            <li>(the sample box didn&#x27;t come with very detailed instructions)</li>
            <li>Very gentle but very effective results.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin very smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice weekly maintenance product, but I&#x27;d consider it very mild.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I have used this for over a year, and have received many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 6 times now and my skin looks so much better than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you can look at the reviews on the Sephora website and see most people leave it on for a lot longer than it says-</li>
            <li>I also moisturize with Egyptian Magic every night.</li>
            <li>; thus, this product has been mostly relegated to weekend use when I have the time.  </li>
            <li>Origins A Perfect World White Tea Skin Guardian serum, and Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer.</li>
            <li>have a sample with maybe one more application in it, so I&#x27;ll give it another try in maybe a week.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>On my second bottle and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li>This is, without a doubt, the best facial product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best part is this bottle will last for 6 months in my opinion with weekly use.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>,I&#x27;ve used cheaper products and have gotten way better results from them than this</li>
            <li>I could swear my makeup went on much better and looked better after the treatments.</li>
            <li>I think its great because it really helps to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It is totally smooth!</li>
            <li>this is possibly the best peel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Ren started out with a lower % of acid to be safe and to not decompose the package material.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, like orange marmalade.  </li>
            <li>Figured I would get some more paperwork done while it was \\&quot;working\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Ren products.</li>
            <li>Since using glycol lactic radiance renewal, my skin is clearer, more luminous, and the stubborn clogged pores on my t-zone are visibly improved.</li>
            <li>My post acne marks became prominent once more</li>
            <li>but the results are a lot better</li>
            <li>I had to many expectations over this product, only problem i has to be use more often during the week for a beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>However, I have to admit that it does a good job of pore-cleaning, and it also works as a gentle cuticle remover.</li>
            <li>i fell in love with this mask since the first use i just love it, my face is just bright and glows, i actually had and have many products by REN and most of them are amazing</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about this mask!</li>
            <li>I am not so sure it is original.</li>
            <li>That being said, this is a great mild product for more frequent usage.</li>
            <li>I love this mask, cleans out every pore, makes my skin wrinkle free and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Not so with my Mychelle Pumpkin mask or Cecilia Wong Blemish Peel (both strong enzymatic peels that take 3-4 minutes tops--</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if your skin is good with fruit and lactic acid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice mask, and if you are young, have combination skin or a bit of trouble with breakouts, this is probably the perfect product to start peels with.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any fine lines</li>
            <li>It smells fine.</li>
            <li>And while I will reserve the word \\&quot;miraculous\\&quot; for more important events, I am exceptionally pleased with the first time results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an amazing and effective product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be in smooth skin Mecca</li>
            <li>I had only read really great reviews for this product</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling radiant and smooth.</li>
            <li>Skin is gradient and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and my skin was no longer smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have always loved any type of peel that I could feel tingling and see results immediately.  </li>
            <li>right after I took it off, nothing more.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try for improving skin texture!</li>
            <li>Makes skin dewy and clean</li>
            <li>I intend to post a follow up review after several weeks of use, but this is a good start.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because I did a follow up treatment one week after the initial treatment, and haven&#x27;t needed another once since then, until today - and not because my skin feels like it needs it, but rather because it&#x27;s a good idea to be pro-active in skin care.  </li>
            <li>I am cheap and this is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I used all that up and bought the full size from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing the full size.</li>
            <li>Geting ready to order some more.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me as a good product for younger skin.</li>
            <li>Waayyyy back before peels exploded, Ren had a really good product.</li>
            <li>heard good things about product though, report back after use.</li>
            <li>I had no bad reactions at all</li>
            <li>still no bad reactions or burning pain.</li>
            <li>The product has a very pleasant fruity smell, certainly not an unappealing chemical odor like other masks I have used.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells nice and makes your skin calm and soft after use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Cleanses face well and is mild.</li>
            <li>There is mild tingling/burning sensation when I use this, but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li>it is a mild peel.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t exfoliate regularly or if your skin is sensitive to scrubs, this product might be ideal for you and produce noticeable results.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it has pure and high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once, but I feel okay about reviewing it since most people say they see results after the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these products for the last 2 weeks to prepare for my 40th bday and I am now looking better than I have in a while!</li>
            <li>I love to try new things, but they rarely stick.</li>
            <li>Really does a nice job of exfoliating and leaves your skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin feel smooth, but no dramatic difference in wrinkles or pore size.</li>
            <li>The orangey marmalade smell doesn&#x27;t really bother me, but I can&#x27;t say my fine lines are minimized after a usage.</li>
            <li>This definitely gives you a radiant glow after every use, making your face super smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I believe this product can minimize fine lines, fade blotches, and give you an overall better skin texture with prolonged use.</li>
            <li>my skin is showing signs of aging and this stuff really helps smooth things out.</li>
            <li>I knew this product was great when I stopped using it for a few months.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin baby soft smooth, no break outs!</li>
            <li>For my skin, this stuff is worth its weight in gold.  </li>
            <li>what its worth, the rest of my skin care regime consists of PanOxyl 10% benzoyl peroxide face wash,</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>-- this product USED to be good when there was not much competition.</li>
            <li>so I went ahead and ordered it, thinking it would be worth the price.</li>
            <li>in all, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>That will get you through your first month to see results before investing in the full size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love it, it leaves skin super fresh and clean, it is a like a facial in just 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have sensitive skin any more after years of chemicals peels and laser.</li>
            <li>But now, other brands have outpaced Ren in product development and superior formulation.</li>
            <li>My skin seemed to be a bit clearer when I used this, but nothing major - there are better masks for fighting congestion than this one.</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin,</li>
            <li>Feels great after use but not sure if it is doing anything.  </li>
            <li>I have been in denial for some time now that I may need to take better care of my skin, since I passed the big 3-0.  </li>
            <li>I started noticing a difference after my first mask in a sample I received from birchbox.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice anything different or better from using this peel and for the price</li>
            <li>I did this the first time and my skin just glowed afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is the stuff you use when you really want a fresh look.  </li>
            <li>I received a free 15ml sample from sephoras for accumulating 100 points on my frequent buyer card.</li>
            <li>I have tried this product first time purchasing a sample size in sephora.</li>
            <li>I first got a sample at Sephores.</li>
            <li>At this price, it&#x27;s a real bargain!</li>
            <li>My makeup looks better when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li>My skin is used to chemical exfoliation, but this will tingle a bit when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>While it does nothing for my pore size, this stuff leaves my face shockingly soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Great product for removing that dull winter look!</li>
            <li>This mask is easy to use, and I like the 2-ply linen cloth included with the product, as it helps to further exfoliate when used to remove the mask.</li>
            <li>skin super soft &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li>it only takes 10 minutes, I do it weekly, strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I only have fine lines and have seen a difference with it.</li>
            <li>And it really didn&#x27;t do much for my pores.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this fruit acid-based exfoliating mask.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Though this product did not irritate my skin and did not burn or tingle upon application, it really did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>i really trust this brand.</li>
            <li>was fast..</li>
            <li>Really helped my pregnancy acne.</li>
            <li>I believe so much in RENs products, because have been using RENs bio retinoids oil.</li>
            <li>I would say about a dime size to do your whole face.</li>
            <li>My face has become so smooth, my hubby woke up twice in the middle of the night just to feel my face!</li>
            <li>An absolute must for a person with acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Thanks for carring it.</li>
            <li>I used to entertain myself by dragging the tips of my fingers along my jawline to measure the amount of \\&quot;sag\\&quot; from my aging skin, but now there&#x27;s not as much sag, and my skin feels very elastic and supple.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Ren!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten a break out since I&#x27;ve started using this, and I feel my pores are much clearer as well.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do much,</li>
            <li>He has kind of alligator skin on his forehead that he&#x27;s slowly starting to get rid of with proper skin care.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact this is my first purchase of Glycol Lactic Radiance Renewal mask, and my face feel relaxed and clear.</li>
            <li>Since children in my 30&#x27;s have consistently battled with cystic acne, which I have had under complete control since about 49.  </li>
            <li>As per the product instructions, applied generously to clean dry face, left on for 10 minutes and gently rinsed / wiped off with a warm wet washcloth.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft, clear and fresh.</li>
            <li>Where the actress&#x27; skin appears vibrant and glowing)?  </li>
            <li>am very hopeful that this mask, when added to my current regimen, will assist me in maintaining the fresh look of my aging skin.</li>
            <li>I just put it on the backs of my hands and on my cuticles after applying the mask to my face, and after 10-15 minutes, it does a decent job of removing excess cuticles.</li>
            <li>Seriously after the first time I used it my face felt so smooth, my pores were much much smaller and my acne scarring looked better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this 5 times and my skin is back to normal, possibly even better than before moving.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have a highly congested nose area.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for weekly use.</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;ve used this product twice and the pores on my nose have shrunken 85%!!</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel much cleaner and softer after using and wonderfully natural - almost want to eat it.</li>
            <li>i have no complaint with service nor product</li>
            <li>But the mask itself doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job at exfoliating as other physical and/or chemical exfoliators I&#x27;ve been using on a regular basis for years.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new skin regime to help \\&quot;prevent\\&quot; signs of aging.</li>
            <li>I feel as if I have new skin.</li>
            <li>I reckon with one more application, my congested pores will be only a distant memory.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tons of acne and acne scars (new and ages old) and this mask works wonders!</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel very soft, feel firmer and glow afterwards.</li>
            <li>I recommend, though, not trying it for the first time the day or two before a new job, big date, etc.</li>
            <li>Semi-regular use (perhaps once a week to every other week) keeps my skin clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review after only one usage, but am compelled to begin as I was blown away after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41 now, ugh, and I definitely noticed a difference the first time I used the Renewal Mask.</li>
            <li>Just finished using this product for the first time upon a recommendation from my naturopath as a fix for my moderate acne.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so i suggest buying the travel size first.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not familiar with the line, I highly recommend it if you are looking for hypo-allergenic, perfume free, eco-friendly products for any type of skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very minor complaint, as the other products I have used that require less time have many more unnatural chemicals in them that allow faster (and more risky, irritation prone) exfoliation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, isn&#x27;t messy like some masks and doesn&#x27;t require a lot to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I am a 20something year old with combination skin and mild brown/pink discolorations from years old acne scarring; I use this once a week to boost the natural radiance of  my skin and to reduce discolorations in the long run.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely worth every single cent</li>
            <li>When I used it last night (I left it on for an hour with no problem---its pretty gentle) as soon as I wiped it off</li>
            <li>In the end you will realize that it is a better buy than drugstore brands; and when I did the math, I saw I was paying less daily.</li>
            <li>particular item is amazing, I have gone to spas and spent major $$$ for enzyme masks to peel away dead skin; and this items does the trick.</li>
            <li>Well, my skin felt really soft afterward</li>
            <li>As my mother says, \\&quot;It&#x27;s never too early to take care of your skin\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 23 years old</li>
            <li>is that it had 2 ingredients I am proven sensitive to</li>
            <li>I try a lot of different products, and this one really does stand out.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve had this for 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I have been using this item for a lomg time,Makes your face feel really soft.</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft and radiant after this mask.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with adult acne since i was 22 years old.</li>
            <li>This product within 1 month has completely transformed my complexion.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and frequently break out to perfumey products.</li>
            <li>I feel that this mask keep my now 30 year-old skin looking young and glowing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and did not experience irritation or burning.</li>
            <li>Feels kinda soft when it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>(I have oily, acne-proned, and sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>This was recommended by a friend of mine and I was skeptical as my skin is fairly fair.  </li>
            <li>and my skin went from flakey and dry on my forehead and cheeks to my pores reducing in size and absolutely radiant skin!</li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth, the other parts of my skin regimen (and have been for a couple years)</li>
            <li>have decent combo skin with the occasional pms breakout.</li>
            <li>cost: Might seem high priced, but will last you three to five months (depending on the time of year, and usage</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin won&#x27;t tolerate physical exfoliators with grains, but it will tolerate AHAs and other mild acids.  </li>
            <li>After washing it off, my skin feels smooth, tight, and I can definitely feel like my face has regained its elasticity.</li>
            <li>That may seem like a long time for an acid mask but this one is very gentle and I didn&#x27;t see any results when I left it on for shorter amounts of time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little itchy after a couple minutes, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I experienced a bit of  what I would call very low dose fumes...not unpleasant but noticeable.</li>
            <li>My husband was kind of skeptical</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had generally good skin, but I felt that my skin started to get dingy and prone to small breakouts in my late 20s.</li>
            <li>acid % potency is just not strong enough and degrades quickly before the expiry date, rendering it unstable (you can see it</li>
            <li>after all i really do like this product i&#x27;m gonna try other REN masks.</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone oily skin,it didn&#x27;t burn going on like a lot of other people were saying</li>
            <li>I used it every other day for 20mins, as my naturopathic dermatologist suggested, and it faded the scars nearly 2x as fast as if I had just left them alone.</li>
            <li>I bought this, I was hoping for a miracle for my troubled skin, and although its good, i still have breakouts a lot (but i think it&#x27;s due to food sensitivities that I keep</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any really noticable results except that some brown spots might be slightly lighter.  </li>
            <li>The product is vacum packed and will not dry out if left unused.</li>
            <li>it will feel sticky...do not expect it to dry down very much.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Works best when followed by a night serum/</li>
            <li> Even my husband was impressed after he felt the results.  </li>
            <li> Those are also both items I&#x27;d recommend, but I have a \\&quot;best of\\&quot; REN kit from Seph0ra that I haven&#x27;t tried... at this rate I&#x27;ll probably end up being a REN junkie.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product &amp; product line.</li>
            <li> The 4 star review for an otherwise excellent product is for the length that you have to leave this on- 10</li>
            <li> One of the best masks I&#x27;ve ever bought!  </li>
            <li> so I stopped using it, hoping it would ease my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> I actually do my best to time it</li>
            <li> so I use the mask close to a date or an occasion in which I want to look my best.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> (although now I wonder if those were awesome as well.).</li>
            <li> Impressed...</li>
            <li> The best compliment I have ever received?</li>
            <li> Superb product!</li>
            <li> It is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I Love this mask!!!</li>
            <li> price is very good about 9 dollars cheaper...</li>
            <li> Their product are great and wonderful.</li>
            <li> My face feels great after using this mask.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great for evening out skin tone and preventing razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great after I use the mask, gets rid of any dryness and flakes.</li>
            <li> Everyone has had a great response to this.</li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> Great results</li>
            <li> My coworkers commenting on how great my face looks.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask.</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> I used this twice already (in one week) and my skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to do it a couple times a week if you want to see the best results.  </li>
            <li> so good pricing here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken good care of my skin since my 30&#x27;s, but I have some stubborn enlarged pores and age spots that I want to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> Its good but does not work as well as I thought</li>
            <li> LOVE this and all Ren products!</li>
            <li> I just reordered this renewal mask because it is just so great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The peel smells very nice and is easy too use.</li>
            <li> This mask is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> So, I think it might be a nice product, but doesn&#x27;t work for everyone (like all products, I guess).  </li>
            <li> Beauty control stopped making the one I really liked.</li>
            <li> The instruction say to leave on for 10 minutes then using a wash cloth and warm water to remove.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin glow so nicely.</li>
            <li> This just gave my face a nice glow</li>
            <li> It does smell nice; It feels nice when it&#x27;s on my face</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes, I begin thoroughly rinsing my face with warm water.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a bit pricey, but nice to have in your arsenal of skin care products.</li>
            <li> It feels kind of slimy on the face - I don&#x27;t like the feeling it has on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply(avoid eyes)</li>
            <li> Best stuff for sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product that was more effective on my congested pores than this.</li>
            <li> product is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin bright and smooth.  </li>
            <li> (the sample box didn&#x27;t come with very detailed instructions)</li>
            <li> Very gentle but very effective results.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin very smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice weekly maintenance product, but I&#x27;d consider it very mild.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a year, and have received many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 6 times now and my skin looks so much better than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you can look at the reviews on the Sephora website and see most people leave it on for a lot longer than it says-</li>
            <li> I also moisturize with Egyptian Magic every night.</li>
            <li> ; thus, this product has been mostly relegated to weekend use when I have the time.  </li>
            <li> Origins A Perfect World White Tea Skin Guardian serum, and Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer.</li>
            <li> have a sample with maybe one more application in it, so I&#x27;ll give it another try in maybe a week.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> This is, without a doubt, the best facial product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Best part is this bottle will last for 6 months in my opinion with weekly use.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> ,I&#x27;ve used cheaper products and have gotten way better results from them than this</li>
            <li> I could swear my makeup went on much better and looked better after the treatments.</li>
            <li> I think its great because it really helps to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It is totally smooth!</li>
            <li> this is possibly the best peel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, Ren started out with a lower % of acid to be safe and to not decompose the package material.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, like orange marmalade.  </li>
            <li> Figured I would get some more paperwork done while it was \\&quot;working\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Ren products.</li>
            <li> Since using glycol lactic radiance renewal, my skin is clearer, more luminous, and the stubborn clogged pores on my t-zone are visibly improved.</li>
            <li> My post acne marks became prominent once more</li>
            <li> but the results are a lot better</li>
            <li> I had to many expectations over this product, only problem i has to be use more often during the week for a beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> However, I have to admit that it does a good job of pore-cleaning, and it also works as a gentle cuticle remover.</li>
            <li> i fell in love with this mask since the first use i just love it, my face is just bright and glows, i actually had and have many products by REN and most of them are amazing</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this mask!</li>
            <li> I am not so sure it is original.</li>
            <li> That being said, this is a great mild product for more frequent usage.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, cleans out every pore, makes my skin wrinkle free and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Not so with my Mychelle Pumpkin mask or Cecilia Wong Blemish Peel (both strong enzymatic peels that take 3-4 minutes tops--</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if your skin is good with fruit and lactic acid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice mask, and if you are young, have combination skin or a bit of trouble with breakouts, this is probably the perfect product to start peels with.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any fine lines</li>
            <li> It smells fine.</li>
            <li> And while I will reserve the word \\&quot;miraculous\\&quot; for more important events, I am exceptionally pleased with the first time results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an amazing and effective product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be in smooth skin Mecca</li>
            <li> I had only read really great reviews for this product</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling radiant and smooth.</li>
            <li> Skin is gradient and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and my skin was no longer smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have always loved any type of peel that I could feel tingling and see results immediately.  </li>
            <li> right after I took it off, nothing more.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try for improving skin texture!</li>
            <li> Makes skin dewy and clean</li>
            <li> I intend to post a follow up review after several weeks of use, but this is a good start.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because I did a follow up treatment one week after the initial treatment, and haven&#x27;t needed another once since then, until today - and not because my skin feels like it needs it, but rather because it&#x27;s a good idea to be pro-active in skin care.  </li>
            <li> I am cheap and this is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I used all that up and bought the full size from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the full size.</li>
            <li> Geting ready to order some more.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me as a good product for younger skin.</li>
            <li> Waayyyy back before peels exploded, Ren had a really good product.</li>
            <li> heard good things about product though, report back after use.</li>
            <li> I had no bad reactions at all</li>
            <li> still no bad reactions or burning pain.</li>
            <li> The product has a very pleasant fruity smell, certainly not an unappealing chemical odor like other masks I have used.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells nice and makes your skin calm and soft after use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Cleanses face well and is mild.</li>
            <li> There is mild tingling/burning sensation when I use this, but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> it is a mild peel.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t exfoliate regularly or if your skin is sensitive to scrubs, this product might be ideal for you and produce noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Most importantly it has pure and high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once, but I feel okay about reviewing it since most people say they see results after the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for the last 2 weeks to prepare for my 40th bday and I am now looking better than I have in a while!</li>
            <li> I love to try new things, but they rarely stick.</li>
            <li> Really does a nice job of exfoliating and leaves your skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin feel smooth, but no dramatic difference in wrinkles or pore size.</li>
            <li> The orangey marmalade smell doesn&#x27;t really bother me, but I can&#x27;t say my fine lines are minimized after a usage.</li>
            <li> This definitely gives you a radiant glow after every use, making your face super smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I believe this product can minimize fine lines, fade blotches, and give you an overall better skin texture with prolonged use.</li>
            <li> my skin is showing signs of aging and this stuff really helps smooth things out.</li>
            <li> I knew this product was great when I stopped using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin baby soft smooth, no break outs!</li>
            <li> For my skin, this stuff is worth its weight in gold.  </li>
            <li> what its worth, the rest of my skin care regime consists of PanOxyl 10% benzoyl peroxide face wash,</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> -- this product USED to be good when there was not much competition.</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and ordered it, thinking it would be worth the price.</li>
            <li> in all, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> That will get you through your first month to see results before investing in the full size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love it, it leaves skin super fresh and clean, it is a like a facial in just 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have sensitive skin any more after years of chemicals peels and laser.</li>
            <li> But now, other brands have outpaced Ren in product development and superior formulation.</li>
            <li> My skin seemed to be a bit clearer when I used this, but nothing major - there are better masks for fighting congestion than this one.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin,</li>
            <li> Feels great after use but not sure if it is doing anything.  </li>
            <li> I have been in denial for some time now that I may need to take better care of my skin, since I passed the big 3-0.  </li>
            <li> I started noticing a difference after my first mask in a sample I received from birchbox.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice anything different or better from using this peel and for the price</li>
            <li> I did this the first time and my skin just glowed afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is the stuff you use when you really want a fresh look.  </li>
            <li> I received a free 15ml sample from sephoras for accumulating 100 points on my frequent buyer card.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product first time purchasing a sample size in sephora.</li>
            <li> I first got a sample at Sephores.</li>
            <li> At this price, it&#x27;s a real bargain!</li>
            <li> My makeup looks better when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li> My skin is used to chemical exfoliation, but this will tingle a bit when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> While it does nothing for my pore size, this stuff leaves my face shockingly soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Great product for removing that dull winter look!</li>
            <li> This mask is easy to use, and I like the 2-ply linen cloth included with the product, as it helps to further exfoliate when used to remove the mask.</li>
            <li> skin super soft &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li> it only takes 10 minutes, I do it weekly, strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I only have fine lines and have seen a difference with it.</li>
            <li> And it really didn&#x27;t do much for my pores.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this fruit acid-based exfoliating mask.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Though this product did not irritate my skin and did not burn or tingle upon application, it really did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> i really trust this brand.</li>
            <li> was fast..</li>
            <li> Really helped my pregnancy acne.</li>
            <li> I believe so much in RENs products, because have been using RENs bio retinoids oil.</li>
            <li> I would say about a dime size to do your whole face.</li>
            <li> My face has become so smooth, my hubby woke up twice in the middle of the night just to feel my face!</li>
            <li> An absolute must for a person with acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Thanks for carring it.</li>
            <li> I used to entertain myself by dragging the tips of my fingers along my jawline to measure the amount of \\&quot;sag\\&quot; from my aging skin, but now there&#x27;s not as much sag, and my skin feels very elastic and supple.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Ren!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten a break out since I&#x27;ve started using this, and I feel my pores are much clearer as well.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do much,</li>
            <li> He has kind of alligator skin on his forehead that he&#x27;s slowly starting to get rid of with proper skin care.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact this is my first purchase of Glycol Lactic Radiance Renewal mask, and my face feel relaxed and clear.</li>
            <li> Since children in my 30&#x27;s have consistently battled with cystic acne, which I have had under complete control since about 49.  </li>
            <li> As per the product instructions, applied generously to clean dry face, left on for 10 minutes and gently rinsed / wiped off with a warm wet washcloth.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft, clear and fresh.</li>
            <li> Where the actress&#x27; skin appears vibrant and glowing)?  </li>
            <li> am very hopeful that this mask, when added to my current regimen, will assist me in maintaining the fresh look of my aging skin.</li>
            <li> I just put it on the backs of my hands and on my cuticles after applying the mask to my face, and after 10-15 minutes, it does a decent job of removing excess cuticles.</li>
            <li> Seriously after the first time I used it my face felt so smooth, my pores were much much smaller and my acne scarring looked better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 5 times and my skin is back to normal, possibly even better than before moving.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have a highly congested nose area.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for weekly use.</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve used this product twice and the pores on my nose have shrunken 85%!!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel much cleaner and softer after using and wonderfully natural - almost want to eat it.</li>
            <li> i have no complaint with service nor product</li>
            <li> But the mask itself doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job at exfoliating as other physical and/or chemical exfoliators I&#x27;ve been using on a regular basis for years.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new skin regime to help \\&quot;prevent\\&quot; signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I feel as if I have new skin.</li>
            <li> I reckon with one more application, my congested pores will be only a distant memory.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tons of acne and acne scars (new and ages old) and this mask works wonders!</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel very soft, feel firmer and glow afterwards.</li>
            <li> I recommend, though, not trying it for the first time the day or two before a new job, big date, etc.</li>
            <li> Semi-regular use (perhaps once a week to every other week) keeps my skin clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after only one usage, but am compelled to begin as I was blown away after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 now, ugh, and I definitely noticed a difference the first time I used the Renewal Mask.</li>
            <li> Just finished using this product for the first time upon a recommendation from my naturopath as a fix for my moderate acne.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so i suggest buying the travel size first.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not familiar with the line, I highly recommend it if you are looking for hypo-allergenic, perfume free, eco-friendly products for any type of skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very minor complaint, as the other products I have used that require less time have many more unnatural chemicals in them that allow faster (and more risky, irritation prone) exfoliation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, isn&#x27;t messy like some masks and doesn&#x27;t require a lot to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I am a 20something year old with combination skin and mild brown/pink discolorations from years old acne scarring; I use this once a week to boost the natural radiance of  my skin and to reduce discolorations in the long run.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely worth every single cent</li>
            <li> When I used it last night (I left it on for an hour with no problem---its pretty gentle) as soon as I wiped it off</li>
            <li> In the end you will realize that it is a better buy than drugstore brands; and when I did the math, I saw I was paying less daily.</li>
            <li> particular item is amazing, I have gone to spas and spent major $$$ for enzyme masks to peel away dead skin; and this items does the trick.</li>
            <li> Well, my skin felt really soft afterward</li>
            <li> As my mother says, \\&quot;It&#x27;s never too early to take care of your skin\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 years old</li>
            <li> is that it had 2 ingredients I am proven sensitive to</li>
            <li> I try a lot of different products, and this one really does stand out.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve had this for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for a lomg time,Makes your face feel really soft.</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft and radiant after this mask.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with adult acne since i was 22 years old.</li>
            <li> This product within 1 month has completely transformed my complexion.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and frequently break out to perfumey products.</li>
            <li> I feel that this mask keep my now 30 year-old skin looking young and glowing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and did not experience irritation or burning.</li>
            <li> Feels kinda soft when it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> (I have oily, acne-proned, and sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend of mine and I was skeptical as my skin is fairly fair.  </li>
            <li> and my skin went from flakey and dry on my forehead and cheeks to my pores reducing in size and absolutely radiant skin!</li>
            <li> what it&#x27;s worth, the other parts of my skin regimen (and have been for a couple years)</li>
            <li> have decent combo skin with the occasional pms breakout.</li>
            <li> cost: Might seem high priced, but will last you three to five months (depending on the time of year, and usage</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin won&#x27;t tolerate physical exfoliators with grains, but it will tolerate AHAs and other mild acids.  </li>
            <li> After washing it off, my skin feels smooth, tight, and I can definitely feel like my face has regained its elasticity.</li>
            <li> That may seem like a long time for an acid mask but this one is very gentle and I didn&#x27;t see any results when I left it on for shorter amounts of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little itchy after a couple minutes, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I experienced a bit of  what I would call very low dose fumes...not unpleasant but noticeable.</li>
            <li> My husband was kind of skeptical</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had generally good skin, but I felt that my skin started to get dingy and prone to small breakouts in my late 20s.</li>
            <li> acid % potency is just not strong enough and degrades quickly before the expiry date, rendering it unstable (you can see it</li>
            <li> after all i really do like this product i&#x27;m gonna try other REN masks.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone oily skin,it didn&#x27;t burn going on like a lot of other people were saying</li>
            <li> I used it every other day for 20mins, as my naturopathic dermatologist suggested, and it faded the scars nearly 2x as fast as if I had just left them alone.</li>
            <li> I bought this, I was hoping for a miracle for my troubled skin, and although its good, i still have breakouts a lot (but i think it&#x27;s due to food sensitivities that I keep</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any really noticable results except that some brown spots might be slightly lighter.  </li>
            <li> The product is vacum packed and will not dry out if left unused.</li>
            <li> it will feel sticky...do not expect it to dry down very much.</li>
            <li> In the last two years or so I&#x27;ve developed very noticeable scarring on my cheeks, plus I have other skin imperfections (black heads, oily t-zone, pores, dry patches.)  </li>
            <li> I cannot explain it other than to say that (for me), my face was smoother, softer and glowing (remember the old Hollywood movies close-up trick . . .</li>
            <li> It was dull and bumpy and (to me) was pretty gross.  </li>
            <li> This product will slowly fade dark spots and make your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin, with mild to moderate sun damage and, well, a few thousand miles behind me.  </li>
            <li> It has completely converted me from my previous regimen and saved my self esteem.</li>
            <li> If you do please be careful a nd try first on small area for one minute or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a early thirty-something that has given up on using average drugstore items that leave my skin dry and irritated and, if you are like me, prone to sun burning rather than tanning.</li>
            <li> not sure why the retail price is listed so high on here...</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, too.</li>

            <li> separate).&lt;br /&gt;--takes too long (12-15 minutes) to break down dead skin vs. other newer peels which have a higher % of acid</li>
            <li> Seriously, after spending the past 5 years trying to fix the damage of hormonal break outs on top of previous acne and sensitive skin during my past two pregnancies, this is the first thing to make a serious change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> and this never seems to dry it out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting or burn at all or dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> (I generally don&#x27;t get pimples, so this was a little upsetting.)  </li>
            <li> I typically have dry skin, sometimes with mixed zones.</li>
            <li> I mean, my skin feels soft, but there was absolutely NO difference in any acne or related</li>
            <li> Tried this after a salon facial and found it works just as well for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> It feels kind of tight on your face, but it doesn&#x27;t burn or feel bad.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have found that it works wonders when my skin is feeling dull.</li>
            <li> I use this weekly and with prudent use, think this will last a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i expected it to be a bit stronger peeling product.</li>

            <li> I was skeptical that it wouldn&#x27;t live up to the hype, but after one use, the radiance of my skin was enough to convince me.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the professional chemical peels and the cost is less than one treatment and you get at least 10 treatments out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of my Juice beauty peel because Sephora was out of the other.  </li>
            <li> use the mask every other evening for 20-30 minutes</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I have always been on the lazy side when it came to regular exfoliation, mask, moisturizing,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was prepared (as is my wont) to have to use more of the Ren than recommended and to be disappointed by the product.</li>
            <li> its soooo not worth it</li>
            <li> I am a man w dark, combination skin and some issues around the beard area.</li>
            <li> It smells good, feels like marmalade and rinses off to reveal insanely glowy skin.</li>
            <li> One bottle can last probably around 10 uses or so, depending upon how thickly you apply it.  </li>
            <li> but this low % of acid means, slow waiting time (these days, peels should take only a few minutes, not 10-15), and slow efficacy.</li>
            <li> A half pump is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> My acne scars are reduced and my skin is less congested.</li>
            <li> While the price is steep for my tight grad school budget, this product is a must and has lasted me 6+ months.  </li>
            <li> Less harsh then the face scrub</li>
            <li> , \\&quot;you want me to put acid on my face, then rub little rocks into it?</li>
            <li> When I run a finger over my nose, I can no longer feel any little bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li> Why so few?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh and does not leave my skin feeling like I put Elmer&#x27;s glue on it.</li>
            <li> In every case, I followed the mask with an exfoliator to get the newly-liberated dead skin cells off of my face.</li>
            <li> and I feel my skin firm up a bit after it&#x27;s wiped away.  </li>
            <li> I use this once a week and it removes all the dead skin and leaves me with a dewy finish, but without redness.  </li>
            <li> Was worried about my regimen of Retin A and whether my skin would be irritated, but I figured, it couldn&#x27;t look any worse that it does currently . . .  </li>
            <li> I used it for a few months once a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Following the directions (clean skin base, etc.)</li>
            <li> However, for the past 14 months, due to a lack of sleep resulting from 20+ hour workdays coupled with symptoms of menopause (night sweats, day sweats, lack of sleep which results in dull, blemish prone skin) and the stress of being a woman, my skin has been working overtime to look dull, lackluster and blemish prone, despite using Retin A 1% nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need very little...</li>
            <li> method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite having averaged 3-4 hours of sleep nightly for the past 6 months . . .</li>
            <li> To save money (because this mask is overpriced in my opinion) I would apply a very thin layer with a flat sided foundation brush, and then leave it on my face for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> yes, it tingles, but at least i know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First this product has a mango/vanilla smell to me with the consistency of a thick honey.</li>
            <li> but I can hardly wait to use again!  </li>
            <li> which is very disappointing because I&#x27;m such a fan of everything in the REN line</li>
            <li> plus I wanted the combination of glycolic / lactic acid - I favor fruit based acids over trichloroacetic acid ANY DAY (burned the crap out of my face with trichloro about 4 years ago and will never ever ever go back).  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any burning, save for when I have gotten the product too close to around my eyes (which the instructions specifically tell you to avoid, in any case the redness was cured by Clinique&#x27;s All About the Eyes).  </li>
            <li> , the texture is just outdated.</li>
            <li> I had developed serious breakouts on my cheeks and the worst blackheads covering my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> I grew up in the sun (not good!)  </li>
            <li> This product does make your skin a little softer and I like the fact that&#x27;s its organic with nothing bad in it.  </li>
            <li> but I am really bad about not touching it.</li>
            <li> + minutes, which is difficult for me to do in the morning</li>
            <li> It has an annoying tendency to drip into my eyes - stinging them so badly</li>
            <li> The instructions tell you to use the product weekly, and I agree with another reviewer who wrote that the waiting is the worst part.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! This is my go to brightening mask</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of my Juice beauty peel because Sephora was out of the other.  I&#x27;d read a review or two that said it caused pimples but thought I&#x27;d try it anyway.  Well, my skin felt really soft afterward but I got 4 giant pimples over the next couple of days.  And it really didn&#x27;t do much for my pores.  (I generally don&#x27;t get pimples, so this was a little upsetting.)  So, I think it might be a nice product, but doesn&#x27;t work for everyone (like all products, I guess).  I recommend, though, not trying it for the first time the day or two before a new job, big date, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this after an employee gave me a sample when purchasing the cleanser. If you&#x27;re not familiar with the line, I highly recommend it if you are looking for hypo-allergenic, perfume free, eco-friendly products for any type of skin. I&#x27;m a early thirty-something that has given up on using average drugstore items that leave my skin dry and irritated and, if you are like me, prone to sun burning rather than tanning. I was looking for a new skin regime to help \\&quot;prevent\\&quot; signs of aging. As my mother says, \\&quot;It&#x27;s never too early to take care of your skin\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular item is amazing, I have gone to spas and spent major $$$ for enzyme masks to peel away dead skin; and this items does the trick. I use this every two weeks in the winter and once a month in the summer. I use it after cleansing my face at night, usually leaving it on for 20-30 mins (depending on the length of the TV program I am watching and the timing of their commercial breaks) then to remove I use a face cloth steeped in hot water to wipe off. I proceed to cleanse my face again, then apply the Omega 3 Overnight Lipid Renewal Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results: Leaves my skin baby soft smooth, no break outs! My skin has never looked better. I have used this for over a year, and have received many compliments on my skin. Works best when followed by a night serum/moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost: Might seem high priced, but will last you three to five months (depending on the time of year, and usage) a little goes a long way. The product is vacum packed and will not dry out if left unused. In the end you will realize that it is a better buy than drugstore brands; and when I did the math, I saw I was paying less daily.</li>
            <li> LOVE this and all Ren products!</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after only one usage, but am compelled to begin as I was blown away after the first use.  I have normal to oily skin, with mild to moderate sun damage and, well, a few thousand miles behind me.  I picked this up @ Seph0ra upon an associate&#x27;s recommendation, plus I wanted the combination of glycolic / lactic acid - I favor fruit based acids over trichloroacetic acid ANY DAY (burned the crap out of my face with trichloro about 4 years ago and will never ever ever go back).  As per the product instructions, applied generously to clean dry face, left on for 10 minutes and gently rinsed / wiped off with a warm wet washcloth.  Once I was done, I swear, my face felt like a freaking baby&#x27;s bottom.  Even my husband was impressed after he felt the results.  Instructions say to use weekly but I can hardly wait to use again!  Smells lovely as well.  I intend to post a follow up review after several weeks of use, but this is a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/17... I&#x27;ve used the product a total of 3 times now... Why so few?  Because I did a follow up treatment one week after the initial treatment, and haven&#x27;t needed another once since then, until today - and not because my skin feels like it needs it, but rather because it&#x27;s a good idea to be pro-active in skin care.  For my skin, this stuff is worth its weight in gold.  For folks who have commented they they broke out after, it&#x27;s a shame your skin reacted that way, but I&#x27;ve had Aveda stuff do that to me... everyone&#x27;s skin is different, I suppose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, the other parts of my skin regimen (and have been for a couple years) La Roche-Posay cleanser and their Anthelios SPF15 moisturizer.  Those are also both items I&#x27;d recommend, but I have a \\&quot;best of\\&quot; REN kit from Seph0ra that I haven&#x27;t tried... at this rate I&#x27;ll probably end up being a REN junkie.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Awesome product &amp; product line. It does what is promises to do. Leaves skin soft, clear and fresh. No animal testing, quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 years old and I&#x27;ve always had mild-moderate acne but I am really bad about not touching it. In the last two years or so I&#x27;ve developed very noticeable scarring on my cheeks, plus I have other skin imperfections (black heads, oily t-zone, pores, dry patches.)  I got a sample of the Glycolactic mask at Sephora and after reading a ton of reviews on their website (the sample box didn&#x27;t come with very detailed instructions) I was so excited to try it.  Seriously after the first time I used it my face felt so smooth, my pores were much much smaller and my acne scarring looked better.  I&#x27;ve used it 6 times now and my skin looks so much better than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the mask every other evening for 20-30 minutes (I know it says 10 minutes on the instructions but you can look at the reviews on the Sephora website and see most people leave it on for a lot longer than it says-I&#x27;ve never had any burning or anything from doing this.) I think it&#x27;s important to do it a couple times a week if you want to see the best results.  I also moisturize with Egyptian Magic every night.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this fruit acid-based exfoliating mask.  I am a 20something year old with combination skin and mild brown/pink discolorations from years old acne scarring; I use this once a week to boost the natural radiance of  my skin and to reduce discolorations in the long run.  While the price is steep for my tight grad school budget, this product is a must and has lasted me 6+ months.  The product has a very pleasant fruity smell, certainly not an unappealing chemical odor like other masks I have used. I have not experienced any burning, save for when I have gotten the product too close to around my eyes (which the instructions specifically tell you to avoid, in any case the redness was cured by Clinique&#x27;s All About the Eyes).  The 4 star review for an otherwise excellent product is for the length that you have to leave this on- 10+ minutes, which is difficult for me to do in the morning; thus, this product has been mostly relegated to weekend use when I have the time.  This is a very minor complaint, as the other products I have used that require less time have many more unnatural chemicals in them that allow faster (and more risky, irritation prone) exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what its worth, the rest of my skin care regime consists of PanOxyl 10% benzoyl peroxide face wash, Origins A Perfect World White Tea Skin Guardian serum, and Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Seems to work for me - makes my skin clearer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once, but I feel okay about reviewing it since most people say they see results after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though this product did not irritate my skin and did not burn or tingle upon application, it really did nothing for me. I mean, my skin feels soft, but there was absolutely NO difference in any acne or related scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a sample with maybe one more application in it, so I&#x27;ll give it another try in maybe a week. If there&#x27;s any change, I&#x27;ll update.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about one month, two times per week.  I don&#x27;t see any really noticable results except that some brown spots might be slightly lighter.  The peel smells very nice and is easy too use.</li>
            <li> My face feels great after using this mask.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> One of the best masks I&#x27;ve ever bought!  Really does a nice job of exfoliating and leaves your skin super soft.  Wouldn&#x27;t want to go without it.</li>
            <li> I had to many expectations over this product, only problem i has to be use more often during the week for a beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. Best stuff for sensitive acne prone skin. Very gentle but very effective results.  On my second bottle and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> Works as well as the professional chemical peels and the cost is less than one treatment and you get at least 10 treatments out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is, without a doubt, the best facial product I have ever used. I was skeptical that it wouldn&#x27;t live up to the hype, but after one use, the radiance of my skin was enough to convince me. It smells good, feels like marmalade and rinses off to reveal insanely glowy skin. I use this weekly and with prudent use, think this will last a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am cheap and this is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> i fell in love with this mask since the first use i just love it, my face is just bright and glows, i actually had and have many products by REN and most of them are amazing i really trust this brand. it smells like orange in a way.&lt;br /&gt;the delivery was fast.. after all i really do like this product i&#x27;m gonna try other REN masks.</li>
            <li> Really helped my pregnancy acne. Feels sticky on but brightens and clears.</li>
            <li> I have been in denial for some time now that I may need to take better care of my skin, since I passed the big 3-0.  It hit me like a ton of bricks about a month ago when I moved to Hawaii.  My skin looked like a leather handbag.  It was dull and bumpy and (to me) was pretty gross.  I&#x27;ve used this 5 times and my skin is back to normal, possibly even better than before moving.  I&#x27;ve never been prone to break outs...just the occasional pimple.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have always loved any type of peel that I could feel tingling and see results immediately.  With this product, you definitely will.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I have tons of acne and acne scars (new and ages old) and this mask works wonders! I used it every other day for 20mins, as my naturopathic dermatologist suggested, and it faded the scars nearly 2x as fast as if I had just left them alone. It did nothing for the acne, but that is not why I bought it. So, in a nutshell, this stuff does what it claims it will do-fade hyperpigmentation. Also, it smells nice and makes your skin calm and soft after use.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall I found with this product is that it had 2 ingredients I am proven sensitive to so I stopped using it, hoping it would ease my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product! It does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this mask! I have sensitive skin and have found that it works wonders when my skin is feeling dull. I have dry skin and this never seems to dry it out. I am always left with a glow after I use it. I only have fine lines and have seen a difference with it. I use this once a week while using a 5% glycolic acid face wash daily. I believe this product can minimize fine lines, fade blotches, and give you an overall better skin texture with prolonged use. I don&#x27;t think it will go beyond that. I started noticing a difference after my first mask in a sample I received from birchbox. Since then I was hooked! Best part is this bottle will last for 6 months in my opinion with weekly use. Definitely worth a try for improving skin texture!</li>
            <li> I try a lot of different products, and this one really does stand out. I&#x27;m 41 now, ugh, and I definitely noticed a difference the first time I used the Renewal Mask. It just made my face look brighter and fresher. The instructions tell you to use the product weekly, and I agree with another reviewer who wrote that the waiting is the worst part. I actually do my best to time it so I use the mask close to a date or an occasion in which I want to look my best. I got the sample size with my Sephora points. I used all that up and bought the full size from Amazon. Love this product. It&#x27;s not too harsh and does not leave my skin feeling like I put Elmer&#x27;s glue on it. It&#x27;s definitely something I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Cleanses face well and is mild. I was looking for something a bit stronger though, something like an actual peel that u lift from ur face and provides a deeper cleaning with instant visible results. Beauty control stopped making the one I really liked. That being said, this is a great mild product for more frequent usage.</li>
            <li> i have no complaint with service nor product</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a while and it still makes a big difference each time.  It firms and makes my skin glow at the same time.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my face. I have very acne prone oily skin,it didn&#x27;t burn going on like a lot of other people were saying but I didn&#x27;t notice anything different or better from using this peel and for the price its soooo not worth it,I&#x27;ve used cheaper products and have gotten way better results from them than this which is very disappointing because I&#x27;m such a fan of everything in the REN line but this is just one item I will never buy again.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve had this for 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve done 4 applications.  My skin feel smooth, but no dramatic difference in wrinkles or pore size.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very smooth and radiant. It does not hurt or tingle like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> BUY THIS! Seriously, after spending the past 5 years trying to fix the damage of hormonal break outs on top of previous acne and sensitive skin during my past two pregnancies, this is the first thing to make a serious change in my skin. I had developed serious breakouts on my cheeks and the worst blackheads covering my nose and chin. I tried medical grade peels, regular aesthetician facials, dermaplaning AND Retin-A. None of them worked as quickly or as obviously as using this twice in one week along with the AHA concentrate on the off days. It has completely converted me from my previous regimen and saved my self esteem. I also have started using their BB cream sunscreen and plan on ordering backups of both the Glyco Lactic Renewal mask and the AHA Concentrate. There is mild tingling/burning sensation when I use this, but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> Feels great after use but not sure if it is doing anything.  Have used 3 times and have seen no effects.</li>
            <li> Because i believe it deserve the rating. As a matter of fact this is my first purchase of Glycol Lactic Radiance Renewal mask, and my face feel relaxed and clear. I believe so much in RENs products, because have been using RENs bio retinoids oil. Their product are great and wonderful. I recommend it to everyone I come in contact with.</li>
            <li> I apply on my face and let it sit for about 30 minutes perhaps once a week. After washing it off, my skin feels smooth, tight, and I can definitely feel like my face has regained its elasticity. The orangey marmalade smell doesn&#x27;t really bother me, but I can&#x27;t say my fine lines are minimized after a usage.</li>
            <li> I received a sample size packet which allowed me 4 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First this product has a mango/vanilla smell to me with the consistency of a thick honey. Very easy to apply(avoid eyes) it will feel sticky...do not expect it to dry down very much. I pin my hair away from my face. I experienced a bit of  what I would call very low dose fumes...not unpleasant but noticeable. The instruction say to leave on for 10 minutes then using a wash cloth and warm water to remove. I did this the first time and my skin just glowed afterwards. I had no bad reactions at all so I upped the time to 30 minutes the next time...then 45 minutes the next time...still no bad reactions or burning pain. The fourth time I let it sit close to an hour...no problem at all. Your skin will feel very soft, feel firmer and glow afterwards. I could swear my makeup went on much better and looked better after the treatments. You need very little...I would say about a dime size to do your whole face. You can use this on your neck as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price is very good about 9 dollars cheaper...so good pricing here. I will be purchasing the full size. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Geting ready to order some more. It lasts a long time. I think its great because it really helps to exfoliate. I use it with my steamer. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an amazing and effective product. It makes my skin glow so nicely. Most importantly it has pure and high quality ingredients. Defi. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am a man w dark, combination skin and some issues around the beard area. This stuff is great for evening out skin tone and preventing razor burn and ingrown hairs. This is the stuff you use when you really want a fresh look.  I apply it about 1x a week. Goes on easy, isn&#x27;t messy like some masks and doesn&#x27;t require a lot to get the job done. Highly recommended if your skin is good with fruit and lactic acid.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great after I use the mask, gets rid of any dryness and flakes. I use instead of the microdermabrasion brushes.</li>
            <li> Just finished using this product for the first time upon a recommendation from my naturopath as a fix for my moderate acne. OMG, my 40+ skin looks 20. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a mask for a while. I&#x27;m basing my review off of 3 samples that I got through Sephora. Each sample was enough for 2 masks, so each time I used the mask on myself and a friend. Everyone has had a great response to this. It feels kind of tight on your face, but it doesn&#x27;t burn or feel bad. I&#x27;m 27, and I used it on my brother&#x27;s girlfriend, 22, my mother-in-law, age-not-defined, and my husband just for kicks. He has kind of alligator skin on his forehead that he&#x27;s slowly starting to get rid of with proper skin care. In every case, I followed the mask with an exfoliator to get the newly-liberated dead skin cells off of my face. My husband was kind of skeptical, \\&quot;you want me to put acid on my face, then rub little rocks into it? YOU DO THIS??\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. The .1 ounce sample worked for 2 people, so the 1.7 oz. size should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why the retail price is listed so high on here... it should be $55. So it&#x27;s still cheaper here than at, say, Sephora, but the discount isn&#x27;t quite what the site would have you believe.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel much cleaner and softer after using and wonderfully natural - almost want to eat it.</li>
            <li> I received a free 15ml sample from sephoras for accumulating 100 points on my frequent buyer card. I am so glad that I picked this item over the random mascara and lipgloss (although now I wonder if those were awesome as well.). I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decent combo skin with the occasional pms breakout. I have a highly congested nose area. I have to admit that I have always been on the lazy side when it came to regular exfoliation, mask, moisturizing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve used this product twice and the pores on my nose have shrunken 85%!! When I run a finger over my nose, I can no longer feel any little bumps on my skin. It is totally smooth! I have never used a product that was more effective on my congested pores than this. I reckon with one more application, my congested pores will be only a distant memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to add that about three days prior to using ren, I started to use Philosphy Purity Made Simple face wash and I think that helped as well.  I am now waiting for my clarisonic pro to arrive and I&#x27;ll be in smooth skin Mecca soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth every single cent and then some!! My face has become so smooth, my hubby woke up twice in the middle of the night just to feel my face! He has never done that before in his sleep! Lol. Get it get it get it!</li>
            <li> Impressed... this is possibly the best peel I&#x27;ve used. Granted, results will vary with skin type (as with all products). I typically have dry skin, sometimes with mixed zones. This was recommended to me as a good product for younger skin. While it does nothing for my pore size, this stuff leaves my face shockingly soft and clean. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Estou adorando essa mascara. Recomendo</li>
            <li> I have tried this product first time purchasing a sample size in sephora. Since then I m hooked to it. An absolute must for a person with acne prone skin</li>
            <li> i expected it to be a bit stronger peeling product. it is a mild peel. i do hope the strength will improve</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 4 times....2x week for 2 weeks and followed the instructions carefully.  It&#x27;s a very nice mask, and if you are young, have combination skin or a bit of trouble with breakouts, this is probably the perfect product to start peels with.  It&#x27;s a nice weekly maintenance product, but I&#x27;d consider it very mild.  I grew up in the sun (not good!)  I&#x27;ve taken good care of my skin since my 30&#x27;s, but I have some stubborn enlarged pores and age spots that I want to get rid of.  This just gave my face a nice glow right after I took it off, nothing more.  Maybe they need a \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin temporarily glow and it does tingle when it goes on. However, it has never actually resulted in any peeling or exfoliation. It also does not make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for a lomg time,Makes your face feel really soft. I first got a sample at Sephores.And been ordering ever since. Thanks for carring it.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;This product is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried. I feel as if I have new skin. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Waayyyy back before peels exploded, Ren had a really good product. But having gone thru 4 full-size bottles, I&#x27;ve abandoned this brand and moved on. Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--the acid % potency is just not strong enough and degrades quickly before the expiry date, rendering it unstable (you can see it separate).&lt;br /&gt;--takes too long (12-15 minutes) to break down dead skin vs. other newer peels which have a higher % of acid, that only take 3-4 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;--the oily texture is too slippery and fluid -- low viscosity means it will slide all over your face.  It has an annoying tendency to drip into my eyes - stinging them so badly i had to wash it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Ren started out with a lower % of acid to be safe and to not decompose the package material. but this low % of acid means, slow waiting time (these days, peels should take only a few minutes, not 10-15), and slow efficacy. we want to see results, FAST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the texture is just outdated. Too fluid, doesnt \\&quot;stay put\\&quot; and forget doing errands around the house while this is on -- it&#x27;ll drip-drop onto every surface. Not so with my Mychelle Pumpkin mask or Cecilia Wong Blemish Peel (both strong enzymatic peels that take 3-4 minutes tops--and they don&#x27;t drip either). A newer, even faster peel is [[ASIN:B00MU8KC94 Dr. Jart+ Pore Medic Derma@home Peeling Set]], which takes 1-2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it -- this product USED to be good when there was not much competition. But now, other brands have outpaced Ren in product development and superior formulation. It&#x27;s time to play catch-up.</li>
            <li> Makes skin dewy and clean</li>
            <li> Its good but does not work as well as I thought</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend of mine and I was skeptical as my skin is fairly fair.  It did not have the burn I thought I would expect.  Great results and I feel my skin firm up a bit after it&#x27;s wiped away.  Less harsh then the face scrub I was using on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> Tried this after a salon facial and found it works just as well for a lot less money.  I like the way the bag inside collapses as you pump out the product.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin won&#x27;t tolerate physical exfoliators with grains, but it will tolerate AHAs and other mild acids.  This is transformative.  I use this once a week and it removes all the dead skin and leaves me with a dewy finish, but without redness.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin,</li>
            <li> I love this mask, cleans out every pore, makes my skin wrinkle free and smooth.  I love the smell, like orange marmalade.  Doesn&#x27;t sting or burn at all or dry my skin out.  I have combo skin on the drier side and I&#x27;m 37, so my skin is showing signs of aging and this stuff really helps smooth things out.</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft and radiant after this mask. it only takes 10 minutes, I do it weekly, strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had only read really great reviews for this product so I went ahead and ordered it, thinking it would be worth the price. I have used it twice a week for about 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any differences. It does smell nice; It feels nice when it&#x27;s on my face and it does feel and look smoother and cleaner after I rinse it off, but my skin&#x27;s appearance has not changed overall.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m the eternal skeptic and have read a plethora of reviews about this product from multiple sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was prepared (as is my wont) to have to use more of the Ren than recommended and to be disappointed by the product. After 5 uses (one mask every four days), my skin is noticeably tighter. I used to entertain myself by dragging the tips of my fingers along my jawline to measure the amount of \\&quot;sag\\&quot; from my aging skin, but now there&#x27;s not as much sag, and my skin feels very elastic and supple. My pores are much smaller and the \\&quot;crepey\\&quot; skin under my eyes has also diminished, although the bags are still noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that I&#x27;ve not noticed any fading of the scarring or brown patches left by the occasional pimple, nor in the freckles I have on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling radiant and smooth. It&#x27;s a little itchy after a couple minutes, but definitely worth it. Lasts a long time, too.</li>
            <li> still havent used it yet, requires me to sit still ! heard good things about product though, report back after use.</li>
            <li> I am 52.  Since children in my 30&#x27;s have consistently battled with cystic acne, which I have had under complete control since about 49.  However, for the past 14 months, due to a lack of sleep resulting from 20+ hour workdays coupled with symptoms of menopause (night sweats, day sweats, lack of sleep which results in dull, blemish prone skin) and the stress of being a woman, my skin has been working overtime to look dull, lackluster and blemish prone, despite using Retin A 1% nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found an article about this product in an upscale fashion mag and figured I would give it a try.  Was worried about my regimen of Retin A and whether my skin would be irritated, but I figured, it couldn&#x27;t look any worse that it does currently . . .  so what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the directions (clean skin base, etc.), I put this one my skin last night.  Figured I would get some more paperwork done while it was \\&quot;working\\&quot;.  After 10 minutes, I begin thoroughly rinsing my face with warm water.  I did not use the cloth method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite having averaged 3-4 hours of sleep nightly for the past 6 months . . . I stared into the mirror at a face that looked revived.  I cannot explain it other than to say that (for me), my face was smoother, softer and glowing (remember the old Hollywood movies close-up trick . . . the \\&quot;vasoline on the lens\\&quot; trick? Where the actress&#x27; skin appears vibrant and glowing)?  That&#x27;s what it reminded me of.  And while I will reserve the word \\&quot;miraculous\\&quot; for more important events, I am exceptionally pleased with the first time results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product will help keep my skin in check until my work schedule reverts back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very hopeful that this mask, when added to my current regimen, will assist me in maintaining the fresh look of my aging skin.</li>
            <li> The best compliment I have ever received? My coworkers commenting on how great my face looks. I have struggled with adult acne since i was 22 years old. This product within 1 month has completely transformed my complexion. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so i suggest buying the travel size first. That will get you through your first month to see results before investing in the full size. I have used it every Saturday for 6 weeks... like I said, transformation.</li>
            <li> I just finished this product.  It is a wonder.  Skin is gradient and smooth.  I keep it on 20 min once a week.  A half pump is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> I am not so sure it is original. It does not seem to be as functional as the one I bought from the store. My face gets red after.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Ren products. This mask is absolutely amazing. My skin feels tightened and hydrated.  I also use the V-cense night cream and day cream along with the resurfacing serum. I have a clarisonic that I use daily and my skin went from flakey and dry on my forehead and cheeks to my pores reducing in size and absolutely radiant skin! I&#x27;ve been using these products for the last 2 weeks to prepare for my 40th bday and I am now looking better than I have in a while! I highly recommend Ren!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and frequently break out to perfumey products. I used this twice already (in one week) and my skin feels amazing! been telling my friends about it! yes, it tingles, but at least i know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Since using glycol lactic radiance renewal, my skin is clearer, more luminous, and the stubborn clogged pores on my t-zone are visibly improved.</li>
            <li> This product does make your skin a little softer and I like the fact that&#x27;s its organic with nothing bad in it.  When I used it last night (I left it on for an hour with no problem---its pretty gentle) as soon as I wiped it off, I noticed it had brought a lot of blackheads to the surface that I hadn&#x27;t seen before.&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this, I was hoping for a miracle for my troubled skin, and although its good, i still have breakouts a lot (but i think it&#x27;s due to food sensitivities that I keep getting.)&lt;br /&gt;This is a bit pricey, but nice to have in your arsenal of skin care products.</li>
            <li> This mask is easy to use, and I like the 2-ply linen cloth included with the product, as it helps to further exfoliate when used to remove the mask. But the mask itself doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job at exfoliating as other physical and/or chemical exfoliators I&#x27;ve been using on a regular basis for years. I&#x27;ll continue to use this mask until it&#x27;s gone, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. However, I have to admit that it does a good job of pore-cleaning, and it also works as a gentle cuticle remover. I just put it on the backs of my hands and on my cuticles after applying the mask to my face, and after 10-15 minutes, it does a decent job of removing excess cuticles. If you don&#x27;t exfoliate regularly or if your skin is sensitive to scrubs, this product might be ideal for you and produce noticeable results. If nothing else, it should definitely leave your pores cleaner.ideal for you and produce noticeable results. If nothing else, it should definitely leave your pores cleaner.</li>
            <li> I am a fickle skin care product user. I love to try new things, but they rarely stick. I just reordered this renewal mask because it is just so great and easy to use. Like others users, I keep it on for 30 minutes to an hour. Semi-regular use (perhaps once a week to every other week) keeps my skin clear and smooth. I haven&#x27;t gotten a break out since I&#x27;ve started using this, and I feel my pores are much clearer as well. I&#x27;ve always had generally good skin, but I felt that my skin started to get dingy and prone to small breakouts in my late 20s. I feel that this mask keep my now 30 year-old skin looking young and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Superb product! Will definitely repurchase 😊&lt;br /&gt;Makes skin super soft &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;*I like REN products and this is my current fave</li>
            <li> I have been using this weekly for about a month. My acne scars are reduced and my skin is less congested. I highly recommend for weekly use. I have sensitive skin and did not experience irritation or burning.</li>
            <li> Great product for removing that dull winter look! Does wonders for your pores, too! At this price, it&#x27;s a real bargain!</li>
            <li> This is a great mask. I used it for a few months once a week. To save money (because this mask is overpriced in my opinion) I would apply a very thin layer with a flat sided foundation brush, and then leave it on my face for an hour or two. That may seem like a long time for an acid mask but this one is very gentle and I didn&#x27;t see any results when I left it on for shorter amounts of time. It feels kind of slimy on the face - I don&#x27;t like the feeling it has on my skin. Someone likened the smell to rotting fruit and I have to agree; I don&#x27;t like the smell at all. I knew this product was great when I stopped using it for a few months. My post acne marks became prominent once more and my skin was no longer smooth. This product will slowly fade dark spots and make your skin smooth. My makeup looks better when I use this regularly. I don&#x27;t have any fine lines so I can&#x27;t attest to its line fighting ability. My skin seemed to be a bit clearer when I used this, but nothing major - there are better masks for fighting congestion than this one. Since using this I have used Dr. Brandt&#x27;s Microdermabrasion and another microdermabrasion product that I can&#x27;t remember the name of and have to say I prefer them. Dr. Brandt&#x27;s is a lot more expensive than this but the results are a lot better and I don&#x27;t have to sit around with slime on my face for long periods of time. The amount that you get also lasts triple the amount of time that this does.</li>
            <li> It smells fine. Feels kinda soft when it&#x27;s on but it doesn&#x27;t do much, if anything. I&#x27;ve tried it for 4 weeks now and nothing</li>
            <li> I have repurchased this product three times now.  One bottle can last probably around 10 uses or so, depending upon how thickly you apply it.  It leaves my skin bright and smooth.  I use it about once a week, and the rest of the week I use a 2% BHA exfoliant and 8% AHA exfoliant each night.  My skin is used to chemical exfoliation, but this will tingle a bit when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> Love it, it leaves skin super fresh and clean, it is a like a facial in just 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin any more after years of chemicals peels and laser. If you do please be careful a nd try first on small area for one minute or so.</li>
            <li> This definitely gives you a radiant glow after every use, making your face super smooth and healthy looking. I bought it initially for acne scarring, but I did not notice any effect from this product (even though I religiously applied it twice every week for 20 minutes each). This has never caused any acne breakout or irritation for me (I have oily, acne-proned, and sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I Love this mask!!! It is amazing!!! My face feels like after spa salon!!!</li>
