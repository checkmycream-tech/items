            <li>This is great stuff!</li>
            <li>Awesome shampoo.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get all the conditioner out of my hair sticky feeling - this is the perfect solution!  </li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing this product and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>Keratin treatment worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This product is great at clarifying my dyed hair.</li>
            <li>Great for getting all of the buildup out of my hair, without over stripping.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great, and is vegan.</li>
            <li>Just good....  </li>
            <li>Good and STRONG...will strip your hair of all gook and oils so</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I love this clarifying shampoo, it&#x27;s great for colored hair — doesn&#x27;t strip colors from hair or dries it too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Neutrogena anti residue shampoo is so much better!</li>
            <li>Smells lovely and works good...</li>
            <li>My hair felt nice and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; after using this.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for an awesome clarifying shampoo that won&#x27;t strip your hair of its essence, basically.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>but it is very fine.</li>
            <li>The shampoo made my hair feel like straw; I now use pureology&#x27;s clarifying shampoo, which is a much better product.</li>
            <li>I did some research on the internet and found out the many woman have been experiencing allergic reactions to permanent and temporary hair coloring because they ALL contain some form of PPD&#x27;s (paraphenylenediamine).</li>
            <li>Finally I chucked the salt machine for a descaler unit which isn&#x27;t perfect</li>
            <li>My conditioner works better when I use this product.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser suggested it and my hair has been better ever since.</li>
            <li>Plan to get more as soon as this one is finished.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am able to get some volume and lift again because of this product.  </li>
            <li>Love Malibu products.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s safe for color treated hair, like mine.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair and leaves it nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent and makes my hair feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Conditioners can also buildup and it removes that too, leaving a nice, clean slate.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a product made to strip your hair of all the product buildup you&#x27;re using throughout the month, week, etc., so it&#x27;s best to use it when your hair feels weighed down by all the products used (hairspray, creams, lotions,</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>You might have to experiment with it a little like I did to see how it works best for you</li>
            <li>Save your money and mix baking soda with your cheap shampoo once a week...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m flipping happy over how my hair is, its the way it was way back in the day!  </li>
            <li>I researched for sulfate free clarifying shampoo and found out</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be sulfate free</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, that&#x27;s as much as i can say for this product, I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Great gentle shampoo that really cleans your hair.</li>
            <li>I have used Bumble and Bumble, Pureology, and a few other higher end shampoos and while they are wonderful, they don&#x27;t compare to what I have experienced with this more affordable shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels clean.</li>
            <li>It removes all the product that is put in my hair - styling spray and hair spray, etc. - making it feel clean and also helping to add body.</li>
            <li>This takes off my hair products in a gentle way and I love it.</li>
            <li>course, as with all clarifying shampoos, it&#x27;s best to use this product about once a month or so, maybe a bit more, but not every day, because it will definitely leave you with frizzy, dried hair.</li>
            <li>exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>this takes it right out.  </li>
            <li>It didnt really make my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a sulfate free clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle</li>
            <li>I love it, it actually washes the built up away.</li>
            <li>I actually think that Neutrogena Shampoo, Anti-Residue Shampoo works better and is cheaper - even if it does have sulfates in it.  </li>
            <li>and I found that it didn&#x27;t work very well at all!</li>
            <li>First time using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>First Amazon review here.</li>
            <li>but if you use more than once a week like me (almost daily) you won&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li>This stuff really gives my hair the fresh start it needs about once a week to undo all the product buildup.</li>
            <li>It was very important that I remove as much of the color from my hair and scalp as possible.</li>
            <li>Within 24 hours the tingling, itching and headaches didn&#x27;t completely stop, but it was a significant difference.</li>
            <li>You might have to use a little bit more of it, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>but that means it just really stripped it of every gunk in your hair.</li>
            <li>Needed a sulphate/salt free shampoo to use prior to doing a keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>That combo works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>Do Goo no less than 4 times and let it sit on my scalp for about 10 minutes just to make sure I was getting as much color removed as possible.</li>
            <li>But the ingredients are highly suspect</li>
            <li>This shampoo really works to remove all styling products I use to enhance my ridiculously fine, straight, very long blond hair and makes it fluffy and full and ready to do what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>Had been looking for a clarifying that was sulfate free and did not dry out my hair and further damage it.  </li>
            <li>I used prior to Keratin smoothing and it worked better than expected.</li>
            <li>Left it pretty straw</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells good and isn&#x27;t harsh like other clarifiers.</li>
            <li>*really* shiny and does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>Including natural oils.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise that you use a good humectant (moisturizing) conditioner afterward because it left my hair dry and hard to comb thru.</li>
            <li>I use a considerable amount of firm hold hairspray and styling goo that regular sulfate free shampoo doesn&#x27;t always remove.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m still checking the rest of the ingredients on this because it&#x27;s not natural...</li>
            <li> Will leave it kinda dry</li>
            <li> I am a 47 yr old African American woman who recently put a temporary color in my hair and unfortunately had an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> and I think it gets a little dry if i use only this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This product was poorly packaged; the lid was taped on,making it seem like it was open although it was supposed to be brand new.</li>
            <li> Read other reviews and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I do use other products in my hair and wanted a sulfate-free shampoo to do some &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; cleaning without stripping.</li>
            <li> (there is hard water to deal with in tiny amounts)</li>
            <li> No matter what the cause -hard water, left in product - whatever is causing a build up feeling in your hair</li>
            <li> I like that it does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t feel as if I want to wash it every other day, since it does not go limp.</li>
            <li> When using my previous shampoos immediately after washing my hair my hair looked like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in a week.</li>
            <li> not something you want to use everyday.  </li>
            <li> Conditioner leaves my hair limp and it feels greasy (even though it isn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> I use this for a few days then switch to my moisturising shampoo for a day or two.  </li>
            <li> It also was a lot harsher than described since it dried my hair out quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gets rid of the stickiness and heaviness in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I never had to use a water softener until we moved far up north and for approximately 9 years I struggled with limp, unresponsive, weak hair.  </li>
            <li> this made me break out, not sure why</li>
            <li> Washed hair twice with a small amount of this product and applied keratin treament as directed.  </li>
            <li> My stylist told me no more sulfate hair products.</li>
            <li> I have hard water and we use a de-scaler instead of a water softener.</li>
            <li> I use one about every 4 months because of our hard water.  </li>
            <li> but I also use pomade to achieve that slick hair look so needless to say I have a lot of product to wash out.</li>
            <li> Buildup from styling products and some conditioners can keep hair from responding to styling efforts, making it hard to curl and generally difficult.  </li>
            <li> Not great!  </li>
            <li> you are sadly mistaken.</li>
            <li> I hated the way the water softener made my hair and skin feel, like slime regardless</li>
            <li> and this was awful.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair feel awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The pores in my scalp currently produce a ton of built up from hormonal health problems I&#x27;m currently going through. This shampoo was a lifesaver. When using my previous shampoos immediately after washing my hair my hair looked like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in a week. With this shampoo I have almost no build up left on my hair follicles. I love it, it actually washes the built up away. My hair looks and feels clean.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product for chlorine and this was awful.  I only used it once.  It made my hair feel awful.</li>
            <li> This product was poorly packaged; the lid was taped on,making it seem like it was open although it was supposed to be brand new. The shampoo made my hair feel like straw; I now use pureology&#x27;s clarifying shampoo, which is a much better product.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I get so much build up in my hair that once a week I need a HEAVY cleaning. This works WONDERS!</li>
            <li> I love this clarifying shampoo, it&#x27;s great for colored hair — doesn&#x27;t strip colors from hair or dries it too much.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, as with all clarifying shampoos, it&#x27;s best to use this product about once a month or so, maybe a bit more, but not every day, because it will definitely leave you with frizzy, dried hair. It&#x27;s a product made to strip your hair of all the product buildup you&#x27;re using throughout the month, week, etc., so it&#x27;s best to use it when your hair feels weighed down by all the products used (hairspray, creams, lotions, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for an awesome clarifying shampoo that won&#x27;t strip your hair of its essence, basically.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! It removes all the product that is put in my hair - styling spray and hair spray, etc. - making it feel clean and also helping to add body.</li>
            <li> Did not &amp;#34;un-do&amp;#34; the goo in my hair. Save your money and mix baking soda with your cheap shampoo once a week...</li>
            <li> I am a 47 yr old African American woman who recently put a temporary color in my hair and unfortunately had an allergic reaction. My scalp was tingling and itching and I had headaches that would wake me out of my sleep. I did some research on the internet and found out the many woman have been experiencing allergic reactions to permanent and temporary hair coloring because they ALL contain some form of PPD&#x27;s (paraphenylenediamine). It was very important that I remove as much of the color from my hair and scalp as possible. I shampooed my hair with Malibu Un Do Goo no less than 4 times and let it sit on my scalp for about 10 minutes just to make sure I was getting as much color removed as possible. Within 24 hours the tingling, itching and headaches didn&#x27;t completely stop, but it was a significant difference. I&#x27;d advise that you use a good humectant (moisturizing) conditioner afterward because it left my hair dry and hard to comb thru. I recommended this product without reservation.</li>
            <li> It does get product residue out of your hair...t LEAVES IT SHINIER..</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and works good... Not great!  Just good....  I actually think that Neutrogena Shampoo, Anti-Residue Shampoo works better and is cheaper - even if it does have sulfates in it.  I might go back to it.  Especially since I&#x27;d only be using it about once ever 2 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> This product is great at clarifying my dyed hair. It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair and leaves it nice and clean.  You might have to use a little bit more of it, but totally worth it.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Great for getting all of the buildup out of my hair, without over stripping.</li>
            <li> This clarifying shampoo actually clarifies my highlighted hair without drying it out like some others can.  That&#x27;s all I expect!</li>
            <li> Read other reviews and gave it a try. I do use other products in my hair and wanted a sulfate-free shampoo to do some &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; cleaning without stripping. Does the job, I use it once a week or even longer.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, and is vegan. But the ingredients are highly suspect and I found that it didn&#x27;t work very well at all!</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a clarifying that was sulfate free and did not dry out my hair and further damage it.  This is it!  Nice scent and makes my hair feel clean.  I use once or twice per week or after swimming and then deeply condition my hair.  I will definitely purchase again,</li>
            <li> this made me break out, not sure why</li>
            <li> I have used Bumble and Bumble, Pureology, and a few other higher end shampoos and while they are wonderful, they don&#x27;t compare to what I have experienced with this more affordable shampoo.  I have hard water and we use a de-scaler instead of a water softener. I never had to use a water softener until we moved far up north and for approximately 9 years I struggled with limp, unresponsive, weak hair.  I hated the way the water softener made my hair and skin feel, like slime regardless how I tried to regulate it.  Finally I chucked the salt machine for a descaler unit which isn&#x27;t perfect (there is hard water to deal with in tiny amounts) but I&#x27;d never go back to a water softener.  Anyway, I use this Un-Do-Goo along with Malibu Hair Care Color Wellness and I&#x27;m flipping happy over how my hair is, its the way it was way back in the day!  This shampoo really works to remove all styling products I use to enhance my ridiculously fine, straight, very long blond hair and makes it fluffy and full and ready to do what I want it to do.  Yea....I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and I sometimes get a lot of buildup from different styling products.  I use this every couple of weeks just to get rid of all the garbage that builds up.  It has a pleasant smell and leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This clarifying shampoo works well in removing product from hair.</li>
            <li> Good and STRONG...will strip your hair of all gook and oils so not something you want to use everyday.  I used prior to Keratin smoothing and it worked better than expected.</li>
            <li> exactly as described!  I can feel a difference in my hair.  Use it about once a week or two, depending on how my hair is feeling.</li>
            <li> This takes off my hair products in a gentle way and I love it. My conditioner works better when I use this product.  My hairdresser suggested it and my hair has been better ever since.</li>
            <li> I have lots of hair but it is very fine. Conditioner leaves my hair limp and it feels greasy (even though it isn&#x27;t). My hair stylist recommended I try this shampoo. It makes my hair *really* shiny and does not dry it out. I also don&#x27;t feel as if I want to wash it every other day, since it does not go limp. I alternate using DermOrganic and Joico Color Endure shampoo. But whenever I feel like styling product is building up, I use this shampoo.  I don&#x27;t use any conditioner with it. Plan to get more as soon as this one is finished. It won&#x27;t strip color from you hair either.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> First time using this shampoo. I wanted to prep my hair for a color glaze. The shampoo smells good and isn&#x27;t harsh like other clarifiers. My hair felt nice and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; after using this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing.  Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great gentle shampoo that really cleans your hair. Will leave it kinda dry but that means it just really stripped it of every gunk in your hair. Including natural oils.</li>
            <li> Needed a sulphate/salt free shampoo to use prior to doing a keratin treatment.  The keratin treatment I use comes with a claifying shampoo, but only enough for one use, while the keratin product itself  is enough for two or three treatments.  Bummer.  So I found this shampoo on Amazon and tried it.  Works perfectly. My hair is color treated and tends to be frizzy with unruly curls.  Washed hair twice with a small amount of this product and applied keratin treament as directed.  Keratin treatment worked beautifully.  Would definately buy this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> It didnt really make my hair feel clean. Left it pretty straw like . Neutrogena anti residue shampoo is so much better!</li>
            <li> If you have ever had that - ooops I didn&#x27;t get all the conditioner out of my hair sticky feeling - this is the perfect solution!  No matter what the cause -hard water, left in product - whatever is causing a build up feeling in your hair this takes it right out.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with build-up.  I like that it does not weigh my hair down.  I am able to get some volume and lift again because of this product.  I use this for a few days then switch to my moisturising shampoo for a day or two.  I wash my hair every day and I think it gets a little dry if i use only this shampoo.  That combo works very well for me.  I would also recommend using a Malibu treatment (like the normalizer).  I use one about every 4 months because of our hard water.  It works miracles!</li>
            <li> First Amazon review here. I&#x27;m a male with thick wavy hair which I try to keep somewhat straight unless I&#x27;m going for that Matthew McConaughey look. So recently I had that Keratin treatment done to my hair and I loved it. My stylist told me no more sulfate hair products. So he sold me the shampoo I needed but he had nothing for a &#x27;clarifying&#x27; shampoo. I researched for sulfate free clarifying shampoo and found out I didn&#x27;t have a lot of choices. I ended up purchasing this product and I&#x27;m very happy. It doesn&#x27;t lather so what I do is mix some in with the shampoo he sold me from the salon and sometimes I have to rinse it and do it again but I also use pomade to achieve that slick hair look so needless to say I have a lot of product to wash out. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a sulfate free clarifying shampoo. You might have to experiment with it a little like I did to see how it works best for you and if you are a woman with a lot of hair, I&#x27;d get two bottles. It is very gentle but if you use more than once a week like me (almost daily) you won&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be sulfate free and maybe it is but it lathered up just like the sulfates do. It also was a lot harsher than described since it dried my hair out quite a bit. Stopped using it after one shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you put all kinds of products in your hair while styling this is the undo for you!</li>
            <li> This stuff really gives my hair the fresh start it needs about once a week to undo all the product buildup. Leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny. I&#x27;ll order this again.</li>
            <li> Love Malibu products.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works like a charm.  I use a considerable amount of firm hold hairspray and styling goo that regular sulfate free shampoo doesn&#x27;t always remove.  I use Un Do Goo every week or so and it definitely takes care of the buildup.  Conditioners can also buildup and it removes that too, leaving a nice, clean slate.  It&#x27;s sulfate free so it&#x27;s safe for color treated hair, like mine.  It removes the gunk and leaves my hair manageable and shiny. Buildup from styling products and some conditioners can keep hair from responding to styling efforts, making it hard to curl and generally difficult.  This shampoo gets rid of the stickiness and heaviness in just a few minutes.  I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and always keep it on hand.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This works well. I bought it as a clarifying shampoo to use prior to Keritan treatments. It removes buildup as designed.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, that&#x27;s as much as i can say for this product, I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> For those of you think this is sulfate-free you are sadly mistaken. Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, the second ingredient in this is a sulfate and gave me a severe allergic react. I look like a freak..I&#x27;m still checking the rest of the ingredients on this because it&#x27;s not natural...by the way I did not buy this on Amazon but through my hairdresser</li>
