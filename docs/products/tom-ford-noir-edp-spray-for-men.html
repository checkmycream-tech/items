            <li>I bought this as my husband wanted it, but though he loved the perfume, he agreed that paying $90 for a 1.7 Oz is a bit too much.</li>
            <li>This perfume isn&#x27;t for people who like a light or medium scent.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s too heavy for daytime, but perfect for a special date or evening out.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice mature, not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>Bottomline is that the fragnace stays long so it makes it good because that is what I look forward to when i wear a perfume</li>

            <li>This cologne smells too much like baby powder for my liking.  </li>
            <li>I only spray it on for special occasion&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The scent actually lasts long, but i would have thought the scent would be a strong one,as it is for men.</li>
            <li>Smells like Old Spice for $80.  </li>
            <li>If you like Old Spice stick with that.</li>
            <li>Packaged well, good value, should last a long time if kept in dark dry place.</li>

            <li> love it on my husband!!! I lay on his pillow when he goes to work to absorb the smell...good stuff!</li>
            <li> No I did not like it at all. Was very fruity.  Not at all what I expected.  I wish I returned it.</li>
            <li> The scent actually lasts long, but i would have thought the scent would be a strong one,as it is for men. Bottomline is that the fragnace stays long so it makes it good because that is what I look forward to when i wear a perfume, I want it to linger on for a long time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ANYTHING BY TOM FORD THIS IS NO EXCEPTION WONDERFUL AROMA AND LAST WITH ME FOR HOURS WILL DEFINETLY REORDER THIS</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way, don&#x27;t spray...spritz! Packaged well, good value, should last a long time if kept in dark dry place.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this parfum.  I will be purchasing more for my SOS and for the birthdays for the males in my family.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product expecting a bit more...  This cologne smells too much like baby powder for my liking.  I am more of a Versace Pour Homme guy.</li>
            <li> I smelled this cologne from the Details magazine. Purchased the small bottle, what a mistake. This cologne is one of best cologne I have EVER purchased. I only spray it on for special occasion&#x27;s. Ladie&#x27;s always give me compliments.</li>
            <li> Sexy for a night out - deep, rich florals and a hint of sandalwood (?).  Reminds me of a nightclub in Morocco or Rio.  I think it&#x27;s too heavy for daytime, but perfect for a special date or evening out.  This perfume isn&#x27;t for people who like a light or medium scent.  I think it&#x27;s a great unisex perfume - both my husband and I wear this scent.</li>
            <li> My son enjoys this, It arrived ahead of time, and does have a pleasant scent.  But  I get buy with a less costly after shave</li>
            <li> It is a nice mature, not overpowering scent. A refreshing change for a young man. We recommend giving it a try</li>
            <li> Great scent and pleasing to others also!</li>
            <li> I should have bought the bigger bottle! (I finally did buy the bigger bottle). Gave this one to my son. The women will go crazy over this!!!!!!! Try it, please. Your will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Guys one thing I have to say about Tom Fords cologne, it&#x27;s the best. I used to have a bunch of cologne and the desser was decorated with many bottles from various designers. I now narrowed it down to 3 bottles from Tom Ford, one bottle from Hermes and one from Aramis ( Caligraphy...it&#x27;s unbelievable!). Tom Ford hit the mark with this. It last the hole day and has a fragrance unlike any others.</li>
            <li> great smell but very expensive</li>
            <li> So so. Smells like Old Spice for $80.  Doesn&#x27;t last that long.  If you like Old Spice stick with that.</li>
            <li> Tom Ford&#x27;s newest cologne Noir smells great on my husband. It&#x27;s a light scent and he doesn&#x27;t have to spray much on for someone to notice it. I recommend this as a gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my husband wanted it, but though he loved the perfume, he agreed that paying $90 for a 1.7 Oz is a bit too much.</li>
