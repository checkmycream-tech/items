            <li>Great price!</li>
            <li>After spending thousands on hair products, this is the best.</li>
            <li>My hair holds its shape without feeling like cement or pulling my hair out when combing thru....absolutely the best!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 3 years and have to say it is the best men&#x27;s hair gel out there.</li>
            <li>It holds great and best of all doesn&#x27;t leave the flakes at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>This is a great Gel, for the price.</li>
            <li>Great Gel - Doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work great forever</li>
            <li>and it holds great.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>Hold my hair good.</li>
            <li>Great product which I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li>Gotta love subscribe &amp; save!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very affordable, effective product in my opinion</li>
            <li>and when he rubs his head and cracks the hold it kind of flakes.</li>
            <li>He loves it and we haven&#x27;t been able to find any product as good.  </li>
            <li>It works great in making your hair look full and in control.</li>
            <li>I have very fine baby hair</li>
            <li>but didn&#x27;t really hold that great.</li>
            <li>Just buy your favorite gel at the dollar store.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>This product is just ok.</li>
            <li>I love how this hair gel smells.</li>
            <li>I guess the hold is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Light, not sticky and gives my hair more volume--holds curler better.</li>
            <li>very good, make different styles.</li>
            <li>most important is no dandruff or stuff sticks to it.</li>
            <li>it holds pretty nicely</li>
            <li>I get it on the subscribe and save program and it is a great price as well compared to regular non-sale in store price.</li>
            <li>After it dries in place, I&#x27;ll brush those out and it stays smooth with the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although it holds it definitely doesn&#x27;t hold as great as a maximum hold</li>
            <li>It literally smells like a light perfume, which you don&#x27;t often get in cheaper hair products.</li>
            <li>I have been through many other hair products and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold as good as the Redken or American Crew.</li>
            <li>However, this is better than LA Looks that it doesn&#x27;t flake as much as LA Looks.</li>
            <li>One of the best; This comes from a former American Beauty Academy Beauty Culture Teacher of Chicago, IL.</li>
            <li>Works very well and is light not gooy.</li>
            <li>but I have to put a fair amount where it feels wet still</li>
            <li>and it does the job with giving your hair the right look and texture.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This does exactly that.</li>
            <li>Only problem is I have to wash my hair more often.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described</li>
            <li>It does not leave white flaky residue like so many others do.  </li>
            <li>and i love it no grease and give me hear a little shine and good firm but</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and often don&#x27;t like to take the time to dry/flat iron etc.  </li>
            <li>They work great and don&#x27;t leave residue behind.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say too much about this gel.</li>
            <li>This is the only gel I&#x27;ve found that has a very strong hold that does not leave white flakes or powder etc after it dries.  </li>
            <li>Decent quality hair gel.</li>
            <li>not hard fell.</li>
            <li>Those days I tend to pull it back in a barrette and slick back the fly aways with some gel.  </li>
            <li>I have short trimmed hair on the side and back with some slight bangs and hair on the top and this stuff cant hold worth a damn.</li>
            <li>I would go with Redken first, American Crew</li>
            <li>You can comb your hair &amp; feels natural.</li>
            <li>This is my old stand by now.  </li>
            <li>so it wilts in humid weather, wet weather or too hot weather.</li>
            <li>Will try a new gel next~</li>
            <li>but you use less and is worth it..</li>
            <li>The hold is just about OK and might work if you have soft / thin hair.</li>
            <li>These days I use it to tame fly-aways, since it really is very unnoticeable, and doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a soft texture when it dries like American Crew products do</li>
            <li>This product is fairly wet, unlike some other gels, It has 4/5 strength hold which is not bad</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake, it&#x27;s pretty firm [not super, super firm, but its enough].</li>

            <li> we t and dry</li>
            <li> This one leaves a pretty firm hold which gets a little stiff.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair, and the gel does little to nothing when styling it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and it has become harder and harder to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> often use it even when I flat iron my hair to tame the shorter frizzy hair around the sides.  </li>
            <li> Not too thick where your hair is too hard, stays soft enough.</li>
            <li> but my hair gets curly when it gets wet, so its hard to style my hair with this after I spent an hour straightening it, btw I am a guy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student with a tight budget, so I just wanted something that would spike my hair and not make my hair flake like</li>
            <li> It will still dry hard</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair - which to make matters worse is very unruly as well.</li>
            <li> For people with thick hair - look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s hair gel</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found that the product was too thin to withstand a tough workout or tight ponytail/bun.</li>
            <li> has a bad smell and  extreme hold</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t help matters.</li>
            <li> Sadly the reviews steered me wrong this time.</li>
            <li> To consider this some of their extreme hold hair gels is pathetic.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re desperate go with LA Looks.</li>
            <li> like they say no is like put whater in my hair :(</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Been using for several years.  Comfy with using it.  Not too thick where your hair is too hard, stays soft enough.</li>
            <li> Light, not sticky and gives my hair more volume--holds curler better.</li>
            <li> My husband is picky out his hair gel and this passes muster. I get it on the subscribe and save program and it is a great price as well compared to regular non-sale in store price.</li>
            <li> I used some of this at a friends house and have been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it already!</li>
            <li> Decent quality hair gel. I only used it for a short while though. (My hair grew out.)</li>
            <li> Great product which I have been using for many years. It works great in making your hair look full and in control.</li>
            <li> There must be a million hair gels on the market these days.  We&#x27;ve come a long way from Brylcream.  This one leaves a pretty firm hold which gets a little stiff.  Not greasy.  For the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Hold my hair good. It is long lasting too once applied.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair - which to make matters worse is very unruly as well. Without applying gel, I always looks like I just woke up from sleep! Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t help matters. The hold is just about OK and might work if you have soft / thin hair. For people with thick hair - look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Claims to be max hold but didn&#x27;t really hold that great. Just buy your favorite gel at the dollar store.  Works the same.</li>
            <li> use this over 10 years and i love it no grease and give me hear a little shine and good firm but not hard fell. most important is no dandruff or stuff sticks to it.</li>
            <li> This is a great Gel, for the price. It holds &amp; is not sticky. You can comb your hair &amp; feels natural.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time...leaves hair a little stiff for my liking...but you use less and is worth it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would buy again</li>
            <li> Five stars!  Everything about the transaction was awesome!</li>
            <li> This product is fairly wet, unlike some other gels, It has 4/5 strength hold which is not bad it holds pretty nicely but my hair gets curly when it gets wet, so its hard to style my hair with this after I spent an hour straightening it, btw I am a guy.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and often don&#x27;t like to take the time to dry/flat iron etc.  Those days I tend to pull it back in a barrette and slick back the fly aways with some gel.  This is the only gel I&#x27;ve found that has a very strong hold that does not leave white flakes or powder etc after it dries.  It will still dry hard but if I brush it out you can&#x27;t tell it even had gel in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often use it even when I flat iron my hair to tame the shorter frizzy hair around the sides.  After it dries in place, I&#x27;ll brush those out and it stays smooth with the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very affordable, effective product in my opinion</li>
            <li> Great Gel - Doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky. Been using it for years. Can&#x27;t beat the Amazon Price. Gotta love subscribe &amp; save!</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue</li>
            <li> I have short trimmed hair on the side and back with some slight bangs and hair on the top and this stuff cant hold worth a damn. I tried it both we t and dry and it wont hold anything. To consider this some of their extreme hold hair gels is pathetic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used teh max and mega hold gels for years.  They work great and don&#x27;t leave residue behind.  They don&#x27;t work great forever so you need to use it up within a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say too much about this gel. I mean, it&#x27;s hair gel - I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t nerd over the different types of hair gel. I&#x27;m a college student with a tight budget, so I just wanted something that would spike my hair and not make my hair flake like it&#x27;s christmas every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does exactly that. It doesn&#x27;t flake, it&#x27;s pretty firm [not super, super firm, but its enough]. 4 dollars is also a steal, considering one of these bottles will last me for months of daily usage.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Doesn&#x27;t leave a soft texture when it dries like American Crew products do</li>
            <li> I got this gel for my son who is 6. I like putting his hair in a fohawk but I have to put a fair amount where it feels wet still and when he rubs his head and cracks the hold it kind of flakes. So that I&#x27;ve notice and he says it hurts when it breaks from the hold. I guess the hold is pretty good.</li>
            <li> very good, make different styles. I love it</li>
            <li> Works well. Just a little dab will do. Lasts all day.  Only problem is I have to wash my hair more often.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. Great price! I use it one my son. It holds great and best of all doesn&#x27;t leave the flakes at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as good as the Redken or American Crew. However, this is better than LA Looks that it doesn&#x27;t flake as much as LA Looks. This product is just ok. I would go with Redken first, American Crew next, then this product. If you&#x27;re desperate go with LA Looks. I have short hair, but I spike it up a bit.</li>
            <li> Although it holds it definitely doesn&#x27;t hold as great as a maximum hold gel should.  I have flyaway hairs that just don&#x27;t holdwith this product.</li>
            <li> I have short hair, and the gel does little to nothing when styling it. Sadly the reviews steered me wrong this time. Will try a new gel next~</li>
            <li> I have very fine baby hair so it wilts in humid weather, wet weather or too hot weather. After spending thousands on hair products, this is the best. My hair holds its shape without feeling like cement or pulling my hair out when combing thru....absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> Works very well and is light not gooy.</li>
            <li> Items arrived intact. Works exactly as described</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 3 years and have to say it is the best men&#x27;s hair gel out there. It is invisible in your hair and does make your head feel heavier. There is bo build-up either and it does the job with giving your hair the right look and texture. I have been through many other hair products and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> One of the best; This comes from a former American Beauty Academy Beauty Culture Teacher of Chicago, IL.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair gel my husband will use.  It does not leave white flaky residue like so many others do.  It has just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li> has a bad smell and  extreme hold like they say no is like put whater in my hair :(</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and it has become harder and harder to find in the stores.  He loves it and we haven&#x27;t been able to find any product as good.  Holds without buildup.</li>
            <li> I have already given my approval on this product.  I would not buy if I didn&#x27;t like it.  I use it a lot.</li>
            <li> I love how this hair gel smells. It literally smells like a light perfume, which you don&#x27;t often get in cheaper hair products. Unfortunately I found that the product was too thin to withstand a tough workout or tight ponytail/bun. These days I use it to tame fly-aways, since it really is very unnoticeable, and doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is my old stand by now.  I like the fragrance and it holds great.  I&#x27;ll just keep buying this.</li>
