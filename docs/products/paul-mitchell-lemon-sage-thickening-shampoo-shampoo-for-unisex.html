            <li>My hair never looked better</li>
            <li>I really like this product - great smell</li>
            <li>and my hair seems to have more substance.  </li>
            <li>Helps to thicken my hair better than most similarly-advertised products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t style it or anything, but in a week or two this started making my hair feel much more substantial.</li>
            <li>I think it looks quite a bit better, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but doesnt really do much more than just the PM Thickening spray does</li>
            <li>I have had many people ask me what I have done to my hair since I started using this product..</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It was just ok shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I so far I am happy with it</li>

            <li>I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>Smells great--highly recommend it to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a rich scent.</li>
            <li>I would lose a significant amount of hair every shower.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo keeps my hair looking clean</li>
            <li>Nothing special but not bad either.</li>
            <li>This thickening shampoo is not as good as another that I am currently using - OGX Thick &amp; Full Biotin &amp; Collagen Shampoo is awesome!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now spendy toilet bowl cleaner that smells really good.</li>
            <li>This product makes a difference with the very first use.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my hair silky, soft, and full of body.  </li>
            <li>Usually I ignore reviews, especially on Amazon, where many products I&#x27;ve bought that people raved about have been ho-hum at best.</li>
            <li>I happen to have very fine hair and now that I am getting older it seems to be much thinner.  </li>
            <li>My hair has a natural lift from many cowlicks and</li>
            <li>Given the possible health risks associated with those ingredients it certainly would have been nice if either Amazon or Paul Mitchell had listed those items in their description [or in this case non-description] of this product.</li>
            <li>I really meant never!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m losing my hair due to PCOS and this product is helping tremendously to hide that and give me more confidence.</li>
            <li>I like how it gives a certain nourishing and protecting sensation to one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s such an effective shampoo for those of us with fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>removed one star not because the product isn&#x27;t th best but purely because it is expensive, although for me it is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>I have used the product and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I have to wash it every day or it gets really oily and looks dirty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have oily hair, I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li>but I know that it has worked for me better than I ever expected it to.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is much healthier.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this trio.  </li>
            <li>and it really makes my hair fuller.  </li>
            <li>gray ,dry,wavy  hair is usually not soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe others won&#x27;t have the dramatic results I have experienced..</li>
            <li>its ok but not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have dry scalp and this hydrates perfectly so no annoying &amp;#34;itchies&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>But the probable reason for this is that the first two ingredients in the bottle following the first ingredient, water, happen to be sodium laureth sulfate and sodium laurel sulfate which aid in lathering and have been conveniently omitted in listing what is contained in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brand of shampoo and conditioner and have been using it faithfully for a little over a year now.  </li>
            <li>Other shampoos are less money and are just as good.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very soft, and it looks shiny.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different shampoos that left my hair kind of limp and hanging and not at all fluffy.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I tried to wash this out it always felt as though it left a residue in my hair.</li>
            <li>I used to have a quarter size nearly bald spot that I could do nothing to conceal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 50s and am experiencing the hair changes that many woman do at this age.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a lovely subtle scent, and it only takes a small amount to have a very rich lather.</li>
            <li>Which is sad, because I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo along with Paul Mitchell Lemon Sage Thickening conditioner and Lemon Sage Thickening spray has given me back my shiny, thick, healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>With other shampoos, my hair looks pretty oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Threw it away, it is full of Sulfur, I have enough trouble trying to grow my hair after Chemo.</li>
            <li>Love it, does exactly what I expected, makes my hair feel thick!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other sets intended for thin hair with claims of re-growing healthy hair but nothing really worked.</li>

            <li> My hair is silver white and other shampoos left it drab and not at all shiny.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s getting harder to find at my local salons, which is a shame</li>
            <li> Remember, Never try to open the bottle cap when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> I had used herbal essences for years simply because I was lazy before I finally decided to try a different shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you try to open the cap with a wet hand, it will be so slippery and hard to pry open.</li>
            <li> I was truly concerned that I was going to have bald patches which is hard enough for men but far far more devastating for women.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it arrived a few days later.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it has done anything to noticeably thicken my hair, but works well as a daily shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this to give to my daughter who is experiencing thinning hair due to health issues.  </li>
            <li> It is sharp like a razor.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of surgeries over the past four years along with several prescription medication regimins.</li>
            <li> In case you are not aware this can drastically affect hair.  </li>
            <li> I have my hair colored every five weeks and add highlights every other visit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any thickening, but I bought it because I&#x27;m paranoid and think my hair is thinning, like, every other day.</li>
            <li> Not particularly thickening, but sadly also very drying.</li>
            <li> So be very careful if you use this product.</li>
            <li> Not the real paul mitchell shampoo, its fake.</li>
            <li> I DO decide to wash my hair the night before, I can do that with this shampoo and my hair looks much less oily than it would otherwise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years but find it is difficult to find locally.  </li>
            <li> It does thicken my hair just a little.</li>
            <li> I went from having super thick hair to thin, breakable, and incredibly unhealthy hair.  </li>
            <li> a few years ago for our children.  </li>
            <li> My hair no longer feels so limp.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s earlier thickness I no longer have thin spots and my hair is no longer brittle.</li>
            <li> usually always shower and wash my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> The cap is a piece of hard and thin plastic.</li>
            <li> I have thinner hair on the dry side, so to have a shampoo make my hair feel oily was an unpleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Yes, there was a noticeable difference in the volume of my hair, but the oil on my face and ears (everywhere my hair touched) was not attractive.</li>
            <li> and I have not learn the result, but minus 2 stars for worst bottle design ever.</li>
            <li> POOR BOTTLE DESIGN!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I broke out in a terrible rash wherever it touched, including my face, around my ears, etc.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I happen to have very fine hair and now that I am getting older it seems to be much thinner.  I have tried many different shampoos that left my hair kind of limp and hanging and not at all fluffy. My hair is silver white and other shampoos left it drab and not at all shiny.  I have started to use this Paul Mitchell Thickening Shampoo and I love it. My hair shines and it is thicker. My hair has a natural lift from many cowlicks and it now almost seems curly. Try this shampoo if you need to add some body to your hair and some sparkle too.</li>
            <li> Not the real paul mitchell shampoo, its fake.</li>
            <li> I had been trying to find this shampoo for several weeks before I decided to check Amazon.  I ordered it at soon as I saw it and it arrived a few days later.  I have used the product and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. It cleans effectively, smells nice, and lathers well. Not sure if it has done anything to noticeably thicken my hair, but works well as a daily shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product smells great - invigorating. However, it did not seem to make my hair noticeable thicker. If you want each strand to feel thicker, try the Nexxus Diametress line.</li>
            <li> Not particularly thickening, but sadly also very drying.</li>
            <li> We bought this Paul Mitchell Thickening Shampoo (Lemon Sage) a few years ago for our children.  Now everyone uses it.  Smells great, leave hair feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I tried to wash this out it always felt as though it left a residue in my hair. I have thinner hair on the dry side, so to have a shampoo make my hair feel oily was an unpleasant surprise. I actually threw it out after using it for a week. I gave it a shot, but it wasn&#x27;t good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!! I have very fine hair and I have to wash it every day or it gets really oily and looks dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually always shower and wash my hair in the morning. With other shampoos, my hair looks pretty oily by the end of the day. This shampoo keeps my hair looking clean all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I DO decide to wash my hair the night before, I can do that with this shampoo and my hair looks much less oily than it would otherwise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily hair, I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> This thickening shampoo is not as good as another that I am currently using - OGX Thick &amp; Full Biotin &amp; Collagen Shampoo is awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought this to give to my daughter who is experiencing thinning hair due to health issues.  Turns out she had already found and purchased this wonderful product, so I kept it.  Love how it makes my hair silky, soft, and full of body.  I have dry scalp and this hydrates perfectly so no annoying &amp;#34;itchies&amp;#34;.  Very glad to have found this A-one product!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product (all of Paul Mitchell products are good in my book!). But I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s getting harder to find at my local salons, which is a shame, it&#x27;s such an effective shampoo for those of us with fine, limp hair. This product makes a difference with the very first use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my grandmother who is thinning.  I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to talk to her yet about it.  But I used to use Paul Mitchell products when I was in college and they were amazing.</li>
            <li> awesome smell that lasts all day.  its a good product too.  pricey but the fragrance hooks you immediately, its a good thing</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  This shampo adds thickness and body.  Have been using it for quite a while and I like it.</li>
            <li> My hair never looked better</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but there is no thickening going on.  Try the Dove or L&#x27;Oreal Men&#x27;s version of hair thickening at 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product with the Paul Mitchell gel. I have used it for years and like it .</li>
            <li> It does not shine like I thought it would!</li>
            <li> Great quality and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> POOR BOTTLE DESIGN!!!!!!!! Cuts finger!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the shampoo for a week and I have not learn the result, but minus 2 stars for worst bottle design ever. Remember, Never try to open the bottle cap when your hands are wet. I really meant never! The cap is a piece of hard and thin plastic. It is sharp like a razor. After you use the shampoo once, there will be some stains left around the opening. If you try to open the cap with a wet hand, it will be so slippery and hard to pry open. If you extract some force, it would cut your finger so deep. So be very careful if you use this product.</li>
            <li> This works AWESOME! My hairs smells and feels great and it looks thicker. I&#x27;m losing my hair due to PCOS and this product is helping tremendously to hide that and give me more confidence. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> I really like this product - great smell and my hair seems to have more substance.  I&#x27;ll keep using it...</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a rich scent. I like how it gives a certain nourishing and protecting sensation to one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Threw it away, it is full of Sulfur, I have enough trouble trying to grow my hair after Chemo.</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Helps to thicken my hair better than most similarly-advertised products.</li>
            <li> Usually I ignore reviews, especially on Amazon, where many products I&#x27;ve bought that people raved about have been ho-hum at best. In any case, this stuff actually made a difference. I have really, really fine hair. I don&#x27;t style it or anything, but in a week or two this started making my hair feel much more substantial. My hair no longer feels so limp. I think it looks quite a bit better, too. I had used herbal essences for years simply because I was lazy before I finally decided to try a different shampoo. There is no way I could ever go back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but doesnt really do much more than just the PM Thickening spray does alone.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy the spray again but probably not the shampoo/conditioner. JMHO!</li>
            <li> its ok but not worth the money.Other shampoos are less money and are just as good.</li>
            <li> Yes, there was a noticeable difference in the volume of my hair, but the oil on my face and ears (everywhere my hair touched) was not attractive. I did not have the oil before, used it or a week, and when I stopped the oil went away too. Which is sad, because I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to like this shampoo. I debated the purchase for quite some time as it&#x27;s spendy. I broke out in a terrible rash wherever it touched, including my face, around my ears, etc. It&#x27;s now spendy toilet bowl cleaner that smells really good. Sigh.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 1 week now and the results are absolutely outstanding!!!! Within just 3 days of using it daily, I noticed a difference. After the next 4 days of use...I can&#x27;t even tell where my hair was thinning at anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely subtle scent, and it only takes a small amount to have a very rich lather. I have had many people ask me what I have done to my hair since I started using this product..The difference in the thickness of my hair is truly amazing. I used to have a quarter size nearly bald spot that I could do nothing to conceal.Now it is gone..thanks to this wonderful shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe others won&#x27;t have the dramatic results I have experienced..but I know that it has worked for me better than I ever expected it to.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brand of shampoo and conditioner and have been using it faithfully for a little over a year now.  I have had a couple of surgeries over the past four years along with several prescription medication regimins. In case you are not aware this can drastically affect hair.  I went from having super thick hair to thin, breakable, and incredibly unhealthy hair.  I was truly concerned that I was going to have bald patches which is hard enough for men but far far more devastating for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other sets intended for thin hair with claims of re-growing healthy hair but nothing really worked. I would lose a significant amount of hair every shower.  Now my hair is much healthier. While it is not back to it&#x27;s earlier thickness I no longer have thin spots and my hair is no longer brittle. It is perfectly normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed one star not because the product isn&#x27;t th best but purely because it is expensive, although for me it is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t leave home without using Paul Mitchell Lemon Sage Thickening shampoo.  This shampoo is amazing.  I have my hair colored every five weeks and add highlights every other visit. I&#x27;m in my late 50s and am experiencing the hair changes that many woman do at this age.  This shampoo along with Paul Mitchell Lemon Sage Thickening conditioner and Lemon Sage Thickening spray has given me back my shiny, thick, healthy hair.  I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this trio.  I appreciate the effortless transaction through Amazon, also.</li>
            <li> It does thicken my hair just a little. It has a great fragrance. My hair feels very soft, and it looks shiny.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, and it leaves my fine hair, shiny and fuller</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Makes my hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li> gray ,dry,wavy  hair is usually not soft and easy to manage.  Now mine is.  This stuff is great!  Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product does, as some have noted, lather well. But the probable reason for this is that the first two ingredients in the bottle following the first ingredient, water, happen to be sodium laureth sulfate and sodium laurel sulfate which aid in lathering and have been conveniently omitted in listing what is contained in the bottle. Given the possible health risks associated with those ingredients it certainly would have been nice if either Amazon or Paul Mitchell had listed those items in their description [or in this case non-description] of this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any thickening, but I bought it because I&#x27;m paranoid and think my hair is thinning, like, every other day. It does, however, smell incredible and makes it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Very effective shampoo, great smell for those who despise perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years but find it is difficult to find locally.  I have baby fine hair and it really makes my hair fuller.  Smells great--highly recommend it to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years.</li>
            <li> It was just ok shampoo. Nothing special but not bad either.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended it to me, she spoke wonder about this shampoo and I so far I am happy with it</li>
            <li> Love it, does exactly what I expected, makes my hair feel thick!!</li>
