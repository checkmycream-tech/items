            <li>Easy to switch out!</li>

            <li>Love my electric toothbrush,when ordering I did not realize there were 2 in a pack.</li>
            <li>I was able to find these on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my Waterpik for about a year now, and I STILL love it.  </li>
            <li>I have wised up now and will replace more often.</li>
            <li>It handles braces very well and is great quality.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love my water pik.</li>
            <li>Just as great as my ones that came new in box with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>Still runs fine after a year.</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes are fine.  </li>
            <li>They fit my toothbrush just fine.  </li>
            <li>These are the genuine replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Fit well</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I love the compact head because it reaches all areas of my teeth and makes them feel super clean.</li>
            <li>to replace the toothbrush that came with my original purchase of the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted to help clean my teeth better.</li>
            <li>And let me tell you, when you brush w/ the waterpik, your teeth feel amazingly clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth always feel clean and fresh, and the dentist always tells me how plaque free they are.  </li>
            <li>I like how my mouth feels after using them (clean and fresh).</li>
            <li>These tooth brushes bring back to life my Waterpic system that I love so dearly because it does such a great job.  </li>
            <li>The company has been very generous in giving free replacements.</li>
            <li>I liked the brush head that was pointy for between the teeth and several</li>
            <li>But I found my waterpik sensonic model is way to old for them to fit right.</li>
            <li>This product has taken that clean feeling after oral hygiene to a new level.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I had before.</li>
            <li>These are exactly as I ordered.</li>
            <li>however I was able to get these to work well enough to use.</li>
            <li>No hassle, they are exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>great product at a reasonable price -  much cheaper than other brands but high quality</li>
            <li>If you notice the way the brush is made with a wider barrel then the other kind offered.  </li>
            <li>No other replacements will fit.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Waterpik toothbrush because of the excellent reviews and low price compared to other toothbrushes that claim to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>these are  of course good but hard to install and  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about these.</li>
            <li>The cost is much lower than the Phillips.</li>
            <li>Really felt like the system worked for me but got turned off after contacting them.</li>
            <li>I really like the waterpik electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a couple of years, and really like it.</li>
            <li>Very recommendable.</li>
            <li>Not too much to say, Waterpik replacement heads for the Waterpik battery operated toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>You really have to practically hammer them on.</li>
            <li>They are the larger size made and work well and fit correctly.</li>
            <li>These are the standard brushes, so if you like the way the original one that came with the unit works, you&#x27;ll like these.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with the purchase and the anticipated results that were desired from the reviews of other users of this product.</li>
            <li>They are medium firmness and do not lose the form after months of use on the high speed.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable, long lasting and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>i asked the manufacturer to give me instructions to replace the new heads i bought years ago.  </li>
            <li>Brand new in the package.</li>
            <li>The one star does not reflect my opinion of my Waterpik toothbrush, which I actually like very much.  </li>
            <li>Brushes are too tight to go on the Sensonic easily.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to bear down on brush, it just glides smoothly the teeth</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s not forget useful, subscribe and save tells me when to change my brush head every other time.</li>
            <li>As is common with most men who are red/green color-blind, the boy doesn&#x27;t have a problem with primary colors, but the muted red and green tones look brown to him.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected to get and it saved me money.  </li>
            <li>They fit my (recently replaced) toothbrush and brush my teeth, with a little help from me.</li>
            <li>Good quality (as the whole Waterpik system) but expensive, for the brushes don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Originally, it stated I would receive 3 brushes per pack; 1 standard, 1 small head and 1 interdental brush.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a tight fit as some have noted, but that&#x27;s not really a problem.</li>
            <li>They are much cheaper than any other brands out there as well.</li>

            <li> Bought smaller brushes but they are really too small.  </li>
            <li> It was a reasonable price and delivered quickly as usual from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that the identifying bands are a muted foil green and a muted foil red.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is this needs to be recharged weekly</li>
            <li> Not much to say, if your buying this product you should already have the unit.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> Replacements work as expected.  </li>
            <li> It now states 2 brushes per pack; 1 standard and 1 small.  </li>
            <li> Not much to review!</li>
            <li> Tooth brushes wear down after time</li>
            <li> In either case, 2 brushes for less than $11 is still a bargin.  </li>
            <li> and I can get a pack of six of those for less than these two little replacements cost.</li>
            <li> I sent them the \\&quot;compact\\&quot; heads for exchange, and I received the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; heads in a matter of a few days.</li>
            <li> they are not the only game in town  </li>
            <li> I wanted the latter, and the seller has graciously agreed to exchange, but this bad description is costing me $2.05 return postage.  </li>
            <li> I hate it when a packing invoice says one thing and what you actually receive is another.  </li>
            <li> My son who is color-blind has a difficult time telling them apart--has to stand there for a minute.  </li>
            <li> The product description by Amazon was wrong.  </li>
            <li> but it is still wrong.  </li>
            <li> My toothbrush would be useless if I could not find replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> not impressed with their customer service.  </li>
            <li> While I like the Waterpik toothbrush, I cannot figure out why the replacement brushes are so darn expensive!</li>
            <li> It is annoying that it turns off with no warning when the batter needs charging.</li>
            <li> that is totally insane.  </li>

            <li> Love my electric toothbrush,when ordering I did not realize there were 2 in a pack. So, got double what I was expecting. Sweet!</li>
            <li> I was able to find these on Amazon.com (what can&#x27;t you find!) to replace the toothbrush that came with my original purchase of the electric toothbrush. They are exactly what I had before.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Still runs fine after a year. It is annoying that it turns off with no warning when the batter needs charging.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love my Waterpik toothbrush and even get the brushes on Subscribe and Save to save money.  And I have two units to make life easier was well.  Only problem is that the identifying bands are a muted foil green and a muted foil red.  My son who is color-blind has a difficult time telling them apart--has to stand there for a minute.  As is common with most men who are red/green color-blind, the boy doesn&#x27;t have a problem with primary colors, but the muted red and green tones look brown to him.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes are fine.  Wish they were not so expensive, but this is the only place I have been able to find them.</li>
            <li> So happy to find the replacement brushes for my husband, he is very happy with them!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about these. Perfect replacement heads. I love the compact head because it reaches all areas of my teeth and makes them feel super clean.</li>
            <li> Bought smaller brushes but they are really too small.  Regular size too big, what can I say?</li>

            <li> COULDN&#x27;T find replacement brushes in any of the stores around here!    YEAH for AMAZON for being such a reliable GO-TO place for just about  EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement brush for my Water Pik SR-1000W. This \\&quot;sensonic\\&quot; brush has served me well for about four years,I have gotten good reports from my hygienist on my gums! I use the cone shaped brush for gum massage. The cost is much lower than the Phillips. The company has been very generous in giving free replacements. My rechargeable handle broke two years ago, and they sent me another n/c without requiring a receipt.</li>
            <li> Really felt like the system worked for me but got turned off after contacting them. I liked the brush head that was pointy for between the teeth and several uses the head popped out and after being unsuccessful gluing it I contacted them. Their email response blew me off, plus the expense I felt was designed to encourage you to buy anew brush. So I have moved on to OralB.</li>
            <li> These are the standard brushes, so if you like the way the original one that came with the unit works, you&#x27;ll like these.  The product description by Amazon was wrong.  Originally, it stated I would receive 3 brushes per pack; 1 standard, 1 small head and 1 interdental brush.  I received 2 standard brushs per pack not the 3 mixed pack.  I called Amazon twice on it and now the product description has been changed but it is still wrong.  It now states 2 brushes per pack; 1 standard and 1 small.  That is incorrect.  There are 2 standard brushes per pack.  So Amazon sort of listened and sort of corrected it.  In either case, 2 brushes for less than $11 is still a bargin.  I would purchase these again.  Waterpik makes a great product even though Oral B and Sonicare get all the publicity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Waterpik for about a year now, and I STILL love it.  My teeth always feel clean and fresh, and the dentist always tells me how plaque free they are.  I buy the replacement brushes about every 4 months, as there are 2 in the pkg. and they last me 6-8 weeks.  I think the price is great, and don&#x27;t see myself switching tooth brushes any time soon.</li>
            <li> I am the biggest fan of the waterpik &amp; have been using it for over 2yrs. Everytime I go to the dentist for a check-up, he raves how plaqueless my teeth. And let me tell you, when you brush w/ the waterpik, your teeth feel amazingly clean. Amazon offered the best price out there.</li>
            <li> I have been using Waterpik toothbrush and water floss for six months now. This product has taken that clean feeling after oral hygiene to a new level. My dentist approves.</li>
            <li> I can always count on Amazon to help me find just what I need.  My toothbrush would be useless if I could not find replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes bring back to life my Waterpic system that I love so dearly because it does such a great job.  Tooth brushes wear down after time and I let mine wear out.  I have wised up now and will replace more often.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as I ordered. The order was completed efficiently and without incident.  Amazon is to be commended for their professionalism and rapid response.  I have ordered the Waterpik Sensonic Toothbrush Replacement before and received the same prompt service.</li>
            <li> But I found my waterpik sensonic model is way to old for them to fit right. however I was able to get these to work well enough to use.</li>
            <li> I really like the waterpik electric tooth brush. The price is good and the price of replacement head is also very good. The only down side is this needs to be recharged weekly and it takes about 10 hours to charge.</li>
            <li> The one star does not reflect my opinion of my Waterpik toothbrush, which I actually like very much.  I did that to get your attention.  Beware that the Waterpik SRSB-3W I ordered are \\&quot;compact\\&quot; not \\&quot;standard\\&quot; size brush heads.  I wanted the latter, and the seller has graciously agreed to exchange, but this bad description is costing me $2.05 return postage.  Not a biggie, but I hope this spares someone my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  OneCountryShop, the supplier, was excellent.  I sent them the \\&quot;compact\\&quot; heads for exchange, and I received the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; heads in a matter of a few days.</li>
            <li> great value for toothbrush</li>
            <li> These brushes are a good size and appear to be effective.  I like how my mouth feels after using them (clean and fresh).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a couple of years, and really like it. It handles braces very well and is great quality.  I still buy the replacements.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for grandson.  He requested these books and was very happy to get them as a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> These are the genuine replacement heads. They&#x27;re a tight fit as some have noted, but that&#x27;s not really a problem. They work great.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, if your buying this product you should already have the unit. They are medium firmness and do not lose the form after months of use on the high speed. Just sanitize with alcohol once in a while and it will last.</li>
            <li> While I like the Waterpik toothbrush, I cannot figure out why the replacement brushes are so darn expensive! They aren&#x27;t even the size of a regular toothbrush and I can get a pack of six of those for less than these two little replacements cost.</li>
            <li> these are  of course good but hard to install and  4 yrs ago they were $9.99 and today they are OVER $30.00!!!  that is totally insane.  i asked the manufacturer to give me instructions to replace the new heads i bought years ago.  Did they answer YOUR question? not impressed with their customer service.  they are not the only game in town  so i may just change systems.</li>
            <li> Not much to say. The replacement toothbrushes work perfectly with the product. They are much cheaper than any other brands out there as well.</li>
            <li> chose this rating because i&#x27;ve used them before and had to replace - would recommend to everyone that has the waterpik toothbrush.  i like the way my teeth feels after brushing.  I don&#x27;t have to bear down on brush, it just glides smoothly the teeth</li>
            <li> Not much to say. The replacement toothbrushes work perfectly with the product. They are much cheaper than any other brands out there as well.</li>
            <li> They work great. Not much to review!</li>
            <li> The cleaning I get from this brush is amazing.  Great quality and a great value on Amazon.  Let&#x27;s not forget useful, subscribe and save tells me when to change my brush head every other time.</li>
            <li> Have been getting the replacement brushes here for years. No hassle, they are exactly as advertised and I will continue to buy them on line</li>
            <li> Extra toothbrushes are always needed.  I should have ordered the storage case at the same time. Extra flosser tips too.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable, long lasting and reasonably priced. What more could you ask for? Very recommendable. I will continue to order these.</li>
            <li> Price was GREAT, QUALITY is fabulous! Glad we bought extras! Nice variety of colors on the bands. Just wish you would NOT send daily updates on Specials: I like to know weekly, not daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Waterpik toothbrush because of the excellent reviews and low price compared to other toothbrushes that claim to do the same thing. Whenever I need replacements, I head to Amazon who had the best price on quality name brand replacements.</li>
            <li> These do what they&#x27;re supposed to. They fit my (recently replaced) toothbrush and brush my teeth, with a little help from me.</li>
            <li> These work great.  They got here on time and I love them.  I will definitely use this service again.  WOOHOO</li>
            <li> great product at a reasonable price -  much cheaper than other brands but high quality - I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best I’ve used.  If you notice the way the brush is made with a wider barrel then the other kind offered.  I  have been using electric toothbrush for over 20 years and found waterpik is the best.</li>
            <li> Not too much to say, Waterpik replacement heads for the Waterpik battery operated toothbrushes.  No other replacements will fit.  Replacements work as expected.  No issues with the heads.  If you need replacements, there is no reason not to buy these, unless the price is prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.</li>
            <li> Brushes are too tight to go on the Sensonic easily.  You really have to practically hammer them on.</li>
            <li> I love my water pik. The replacement brushes are awesome. Easy to switch out!</li>
            <li> it was great i will try to buy more in a couple of months its a great product thank you</li>
            <li> My hubby and I change out the brush heads on our Waterpik Sensonic toothbrushes 2 to 3 times a year, and we have been very happy with both the dependability and performance of the Waterpik Sensonic as well as the replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> As represented. Fit well</li>
            <li> Just as great as my ones that came new in box with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the purchase and the anticipated results that were desired from the reviews of other users of this product.</li>
            <li> product was good / just disapointed that you can not find in a store</li>
            <li> Brushes are the correct replacements for the Waterpik SR-1000 Sensonic power toothbrush.  They are the larger size made and work well and fit correctly.</li>
            <li> These are great.  Exactly what I expected to get and it saved me money.  They fit my toothbrush just fine.  Brand new in the package.</li>
            <li> I hate it when a packing invoice says one thing and what you actually receive is another.  This indicates I received a three pack and I did not receive a three pack.  I did receive a two pack. I would give 5 stars to the subscription for a two pack because that is what I need, that is what I actually ordered, and that is what I prefer to receive as my subscription.  Otherwise the subscription works well and deserves five stars for conveinence.</li>
