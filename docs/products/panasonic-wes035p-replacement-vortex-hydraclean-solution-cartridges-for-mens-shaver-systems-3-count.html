            <li>The Panasonic Shaving System does a good job of cleaning the razor.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, I have had one razor that I loved.</li>
            <li>I change this cartridge once a month and it does a good job of cleaning and lubricating my Panasonic razor.  </li>
            <li>I notice, every month when I change it, that it&#x27;s fairly loaded with chaving hair clippings.</li>
            <li>I get a darn good shave with my electric.</li>
            <li>Good product but manufacturer claims each cartridge lasts appx.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good but close.</li>
            <li>Shaves good in shower..</li>
            <li>but razor is good.</li>

            <li>Cleaning system works good but noisy--</li>
            <li>Works good but kinda on the pricey side.  </li>
            <li>Good Value on time delivery.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Would it not be great if your car can wash itself, change its oil, and refill its own gas tank?  </li>
            <li>in good time too</li>
            <li>what can you say about something you use once a month guess it good</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic makes really good shavers.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>does a good job</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say these are as good as shaving cartridges get.  </li>
            <li>The price is exceptional as well.</li>
            <li>It works great in the shower, and is very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>It is very pleasant to have a clean razor when I need to shave.</li>
            <li>Its function is just what I needed, when it is received I am very satisfied, I will also recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and will use it again.</li>
            <li>The solution is refreshing and smells great, believe me, you wouldn&#x27;t want to shave your face if you had run out of them.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic system uses a very sophisticated process to do this.  </li>
            <li>hey i love this stuff and it works great  </li>
            <li>Works great to keep my shaver in top condition.</li>
            <li>You bought a $200 shaver but can&#x27;t afford $10 every six months to keep it nice and in good working condition?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Filter is very good... but not all that accessible if you wanted to purchase it someplace else..</li>
            <li>As for charging...I haven&#x27;t recharged in almost a full month, so battery life is very good.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>cleaned the head perfectly and does exactly what it is supposed to</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am perfectly satisfied!</li>
            <li>Could not ask for any thing better!</li>
            <li>How magical!</li>
            <li>Works great and easy to remove and install from the Panasonic washer device.</li>
            <li>Could use a more pleasant fragrance however.</li>
            <li>and they are a great value and easy install.</li>
            <li>So for me, it&#x27;s not a ripoff since in addition to my own cleaning, using these</li>
            <li>If you own the Panasonic ES-93K razor, use the cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>Nice that they are inexpensive too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no secret that Panasonic arguably makes the best electric shavers on the market (some Braun users would argue that point though I&#x27;ve owned Brauns</li>
            <li>The price is good and even better using the auto ship program.</li>
            <li>I own both the Braun and the Panasonic self cleaning shavers.  </li>
            <li>Run the oscillating shaver blades under warm water for 10-30 seconds</li>
            <li>I signed up for the auto-delivery program and it&#x27;s nice getting a supply of these periodically.  </li>
            <li>This cleaning cartridge is a no-brainer if you own a Panasonic Vortex shaver.</li>
            <li>I also liked that it came in a 3-pack.</li>
            <li>Excellent replacement and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I own the ES8078 and used the cartridges for a while.  </li>
            <li>either way, they&#x27;re effective and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>After a set time, warm air circulated around the razor heads to speed up drying time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a self-cleaning shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;These cartridges are effective at cleaning the Panasonic shavers they were designed to complement.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic made a really nice job when engineered this cartridge series.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t take my word for it, if you own a Panasonic shaving system which requires this cartridge - I&#x27;d say give it a try.  </li>
            <li>These refills are great at keeping my husbands Razer so clean.</li>
            <li>Great stuff right here!</li>
            <li>it does it job very nicely and keeps my razor clean as a whistle.</li>
            <li>The price for these cartridges is the best that I have for new cartridges from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Very easy to swap out.</li>
            <li>Very easy to install with the included directions.</li>
            <li>Very easy to install and replace.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, and very easy to swap out.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast,much to my delight, and the product was exactly the item I was looking for -at a fair price!</li>
            <li>Fit right into the cleaner/charger perfectly.</li>
            <li>it works very good, i put it into the vortex system and it works very well</li>
            <li>This product is a good fit with the cleaning system of panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li>My biggest problem with these is of my own making--I tend to forget to order more of them</li>
            <li>I just started using this shaver and so far very impressed and</li>
            <li>Good cartridges and cheap.</li>
            <li>They are great for the money and worth it.</li>
            <li>this makes for a more effective, closer shave.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years with great success.  </li>
            <li>these are great, and the price is right...</li>
            <li>I can easily say that the HydraClean process saves me a lot of work each week!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend not buying this system or cartriges!</li>
            <li>Original replacement at good price.</li>
            <li>my razor is always nice and clean and ready to work, and the best part is that I was able to setup a subscription for these puppys</li>
            <li>To be honest, I really don&#x27;t know what else to say but that these just work great</li>
            <li>Good Product, keeps razor clean.</li>
            <li>sparkling clean and leaves my shaver smelling good in the process..</li>
            <li>The product was a great price and shipping was very very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>This is great if you find yourself using the shaver immediately after drying, as you can avoid that alcohol burning sensation upon first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great to have exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>The cartrdiges are very cheap, as another reviewer said, it costs max.</li>
            <li>The water of the cleaner should be changed more often then this filter is changed.</li>
            <li>I love the unit itself</li>
            <li>Then be sure to use the drying function on cleaning station as I think this helps prevent corrosion on the blades.</li>
            <li>Glad I went for the HydraClean package as it cleans much better than I ever could.</li>
            <li>This one agrees with my husband and he is satisfied with the cartidges and their price.</li>
            <li>that works well most of the time</li>
            <li>has kept my razor running great and hasn&#x27;t cost me much at all.</li>
            <li>Better $ than W@LM@RT.  </li>
            <li>More like 25-30.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that Amazon sells it.</li>
            <li>This time went much better</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will continue to get easier each time I replace the cartridge.</li>
            <li>It might be OK for some faces but not mine.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more from this.</li>
            <li>i like my shaver &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>When I bought my razor three or four years ago it was top of the line.</li>
            <li>this product worthwhile?</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;ve cleaned (and simultaneously charged) my razor if I take of the top foil so the blades are exposed, it always looks shiny and like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li>I love my razor</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased the Panasonic razer that takes these cartridges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad it was a match</li>
            <li>I doubt you could find a better Vortex Shaving system solution cartridge for shaver models ES8109S, ES8228S, ES8249S, ES-LA93-K,</li>
            <li>Of course if you want to pay more it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use these cartridges.</li>
            <li>It seems to do so, the shaver seems to work better with using this than it does without.</li>
            <li>but I have taken the safe stance on this one.</li>
            <li>but I am not going to buy any more either.  </li>
            <li>I cannot be sure</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the cleaning helps it do</li>
            <li>The HydraClean Cleaning Cartridge is really convenient, and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I am always satisfied with these orders.</li>
            <li>Just slot it in and press start :)</li>
            <li>Panasonic said I should have bought it from them to be sure I obtained the correct cartridge.  </li>
            <li>My husband used an old-style manual face razor for many years.</li>
            <li>Finally, knowing that I could return it if needed, I ordered what looked like the best Panasonic electric razor that Amazon sold, for him.</li>
            <li>I love the shave from this razor.</li>
            <li>Another plus most shavers smell after awhile with this cleaner</li>
            <li>and I think the shaver runs better than when cleaned with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Would like to see better price, but not a surprise as you have no alternatives to choose from...</li>
            <li>The cleaning cartridges are a better design than the Braun being water based rather than alcohol based.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Well, I see no reason to buy more.</li>
            <li>He loves it and still req more.</li>
            <li>love the razor.  </li>
            <li>Get more mileage out of a cartridge by dusting razor before inserting into Vortex system.</li>
            <li>I love subscribe and save as I never have to chase around locating these.  </li>
            <li>Just wish Canada had it more in stock.</li>
            <li>I must say that without the cartridge I had to put much more effort into cleaning the shaver</li>
            <li>But I guess that is how most things are.</li>
            <li>Depending on use, many could use the sink most of the week and the cleaner every 3 days or so.</li>
            <li>Not an option with most of the competition.</li>
            <li>Overall this shaver and the cartridges are the best.</li>
            <li>It seems like most of these reviews are more about the shaver than the product.</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>I LOVE HAVING THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Sure beats doing it by hand.  </li>
            <li>Have to keep cleaning out the drain-hole at the bottom of the cleaning unit (poultry lacer needle) and removing the &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; build-up that collects on top of the fibers at the oval opening of the cartridge.</li>
            <li>ok - The Braun cleaning system tended to work a bit better - but the Panasonic razors are better for me.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Used these many times before, works great, cleans very well</li>
            <li>Really love this shaver.</li>
            <li>My bathroom is attached to my bedroom and I need to make sure to remember to do this in the morning before I leave for work.</li>
            <li>I can see there is plenty of soap under the top, but it is clogged at the top with hair.</li>
            <li>The ES LA93 is simple the best electric razor out there</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ordered any more.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have the Vortex cleaning system before buying this item.  </li>
            <li>You get more than you pay for.</li>
            <li>This really does a great job of cleaning your shaver.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price and you can save even more if you purchase with the replacement inner blade and outer foil.  </li>
            <li>and now I don&#x27;t have to think about ordering more for a while.</li>
            <li>Continue to be pleased with this Panasonic cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>or there was more of the cleaning solution though.  </li>
            <li>be ordering more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;arrived</li>
            <li>The cartidge I received was as advertised, store quality, and at a much better price.</li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic Linear Razors for many years now.  </li>
            <li>I also find that the razor shaves better using the cleaning system than it did when I washed the razor with liquid soap.</li>
            <li>This is my third time purchasing these replacement cartridges and they work great!  </li>
            <li>I love the cleaning feature on my Panasonic ES8109 Vortex razor and this cleaning cartridge is at the heart of that system.</li>
            <li>This system is so much better</li>
            <li>so I want to be able to use it for more cycles than if I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>This forces the purchase of more these than I would otherwise need.  </li>
            <li>Lasts better than 120 days doing it that way.</li>
            <li>Works great, cleans the shaver very well.  </li>
            <li>I love this Vortex HydraClean system.</li>
            <li>I use a wet/dry electric shaver with shaving cream for a better feel and better shave.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product that complements a great razor.  </li>
            <li>All seemed more than acceptable.</li>
            <li>so I have no reservations about using these cartridges and will order more when these run out.</li>
            <li>The cartridge was ok while the unit lasted</li>
            <li>and I love the Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>Yes, they cost money, but they wash the Shaver better that I do.</li>
            <li>Much more affordable through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It even smells much better than the Panasonic cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>Cleans my shavers better than I do.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Bought the shaver here on Amazon, and love it.</li>
            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>Much better for the environment, I think.</li>
            <li>I may use them more now.</li>
            <li>Does a very good job of keeping my Panasonic razor clean and ready to go.</li>
            <li>Replacements are cheap and keep my shaver clean and in good working condition.</li>
            <li>It does keep the razor nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Keeps the razor nice and clean after each shave.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver you can just brush it clean with the brush that comes with the shaver and use some warm water if needed.</li>
            <li>Works like it is suppose to do and keeps my shaver nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice clean detergent refill for your panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>Seems like a pain to have to buy these to clean your razor, but I guess it can be a nice option.</li>
            <li>I have owned my L93 panasonic shaver for two years now and the cleaning system keeps them smelling nice and keep the razor clean.</li>

            <li>Razor is clean and feels good after being run through the charge / clean cycle.</li>
            <li>I use it in my razor cleaning system and the razor is very clean when I take it out of its holder in the morning.</li>
            <li>Keeps the shaver very clean.</li>
            <li>For a while there I was shaving in the shower and noticed that rinsing the shaver in warm water was not the best method, for I also had to make sure the leave it completely dried.</li>
            <li>For first 5-6 times it works good but after that its just a piece of sponge.</li>
            <li>Looks like Amazon is sending new product at great prices.</li>
            <li>Great product to make your razor just like new.  </li>
            <li>As always, these arrived nice and quick.</li>
            <li>Quality is outstanding, easy to use.</li>
            <li>They plug up easily and I never get more than 1 or 2 cleanings out of them.</li>
            <li>The Vortex HydraClean System does a fantastic job of cleaning and preparing the shaver for excellent daily shaving.</li>
            <li>My husband did extensive research before buying this new razor and is delighted with his results as he thinks it is the best shave he has ever gotten with an electric shaver....</li>

            <li>Good price and fast ship.</li>
            <li>Since you&#x27;re a captive customer, it&#x27;s good to know that the shaver system works.</li>
            <li>Bottom Line Up Front: Super easy and convenient and cleans the razor more thoroughly than I was ever able by hand&lt;br</li>
            <li>The thing I liked best about this product is that it came very quickly and it qualified for free super saver shipping, I was very satisfied with that, because last time I ordered it from Panasonic directly and took them forever to ship it, over a month.</li>
            <li>This product contributes to a perfectly clean razor each day that I use it, which has been more than 6 months.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easily startled.</li>
            <li>I just changed the cleaning cartridge for the 1st time and it was fairly easy.</li>

            <li>Easy to install solution.</li>
            <li>It is easy to install.</li>
            <li>It worked okay, but never got the razor totally clean.</li>
            <li>These are great for freshening up my PANASONIC ES LA93, simply rinse the surplus hairs off under the tap, place this in the charging unit and Bob&#x27;s your uncle :-)</li>
            <li>Easy removal and installation in the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li>The clean system by Brawn is better ..</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I wish the product was able to remove the used razor smell, but keep it clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li>I usually clean once a week and it seems to work OK</li>
            <li>Has a nice clean smooth smell to the shaver head after a clean and charge.</li>
            <li>Easy, low-maintenance cleaning process and the auto-ship subscription takes the thought out of remembering to order it.  </li>
            <li>But it is strong, and may bother some people.  </li>
            <li>If you own this razor these are essential for keeping it in good working order.</li>
            <li>Good, much easier to find vs in-store, and cheap.</li>
            <li>To clean most Panasonic shavers, first remove the outer foil and wash it under warm water (set it aside).</li>
            <li>Does a good job makes it easy to keep your shaver running like new.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, this Panasonic Shaver has been the best electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>But every once in a while I like to clean my Panasonic shaver with the HydraClean system which keeps it nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own the latest greatest most expensive model razor.</li>
            <li>This product seems to help me keep my new shaver in good condition.</li>
            <li>it cleans good and the the razor is as new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to look for this filter for my shaver, and I couldn&#x27;t fine it.</li>
            <li>I use them and my razor has been going fine for over two years now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that I will use the self cleaning function again, just the recharging protion will be fine.</li>
            <li>the job just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>-- these are just fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine on razor about three times a week.</li>
            <li>just ordered refills have been using the product for years now -- seems to work fine versus just washing the shaver off under the  faucet</li>
            <li>These cartridges work just fine -- for about a week.  </li>
            <li>another reviewer here stated it seems that the soap and water itself is fine, but over time the cartridge gets clogged up with hair particles.</li>
            <li>It also does a fine job of maintaining your razor.  </li>
            <li>Thsi product might be fine</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s just a quick tap after your shave, then once-a-week, do a more thorough job by placing the shaver in your HydraClean System, where it cleans, dries and recharges all-in-one.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>Panasonic Has the best shaver in the world, and these little hydraclean filter cartridges put the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>These seem to wear out very quickly but they do clean well.</li>

            <li>also just re-peated my order for another 3 pks price was fantastic</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to not have one available when the time comes for my husband to replace it.</li>
            <li>They do a great job of cleaning my shaver and 10 bucks for three is a steal considering they last for a couple months.</li>

            <li>I meant to purchase only a shaver, but Amazon recommended that it would go great with my shaver.  </li>
            <li>Then, lubricate your shaver with a light oil.</li>

            <li>Just after the cleaning, it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean the shaver manually.</li>
            <li>I hope it is a bit more economical</li>
            <li>Replacing these cartridges on a regular basis really keeps my razor performing at its best.  </li>
            <li>The Braun system is far superior.  </li>
            <li>It is convenient to clean your razor this way, but does not clean the best.</li>
            <li>my husband uses this to clean this shaver and it works fine.</li>

            <li>I bought this as a replacement for the Vortex cleaner cartridge to clean my Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li>Shaving every morning with a clean razor is quite a treat.</li>

            <li>These are the only choice if you got the complete shaving set from Panasonic, Buying the shaver, which by the way is excellent would suffice, since you can use it with water, and consequently can be thoroughly cleaned under the faucet stream of water.</li>
            <li>I used to try and clean all the intricate parts by hand using q-tips and paper towels.</li>
            <li>Each one lasts a year if you clean your shaver once a week.</li>
            <li>This is probably because I rinse the shaver after every use, so there isn&#x27;t maybe so much to clean.  </li>
            <li>This helps keep the razor clean in between cleanings with the cleaning system.</li>
            <li>These cost Panasonic virtually nothing to make, but they work at keeping your shaver clean.</li>

            <li>Have not used this product as of yet; thus can&#x27;t rest it but will do so after using it to clean the razor</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to clean my shaver again.  </li>
            <li>A hassle-free way to clean your Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Keeps my Panasonic shaver clean and functioning well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you need to replace these as often as Panasonic would like you to, but they do help ensure a clean and well-running razor.</li>
            <li>it keeps the shaver clean and lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>a clean</li>
            <li>Using the Vortex Cleaning system returned the electric shaver to the sweet smell of clean.</li>
            <li>This is a fine product and truly worth the price.</li>
            <li>It then wouldn&#x27;t properly clean my shaver until I replaced the cartridge, even though the cleaning solution was still two-thirds full.  </li>
            <li>The whole shaving system is easy to use and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>It was hard to spend alot for a razor but reviews had been basically pretty good so gave it a fly--and am very happy so far.  </li>
            <li>Overall I had a good experience.</li>
            <li>I can use this razor every day with no problems and keep it clean with a quick rinse.</li>
            <li>I feel is good enough with this Shaving system.</li>
            <li>I use the full clean/dry/charge mode once every 4-5 shaves or 15 days since I shave twice a week.</li>
            <li>I bought a years supply and am just about ready to order more.  </li>
            <li>Extra cleaning cartridges are a good thing to have.</li>
            <li>They say this cleaning agent has something to do with the sharpness of the razor, but the real review goes to the shaver itself more than the cleaning agent.  </li>
            <li>This was because the cartridge filter was full of hair clippings.  </li>
            <li>But once every couple of weeks, I do the full cleaning cycle on the shaver.  </li>
            <li>It continues to be a most satisfactory, reliable purchase as is our Panasonic electric self-cleaning shaver for which the refills are necessary and easy to install!</li>
            <li>Amazon has the right price and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I spent more than $ 10 for nothing!!</li>
            <li>great advantage over other brands is that it doesn&#x27;t use alcohol, rather a water-added substance that in the end leaves a pleasant scent (that you smell only if you put your nose right up to it).</li>
            <li>It keeps the shaver clean and fresh in conjuntion with the charging/cleaning dock.</li>
            <li>They leave my razor clean and smelling fresh after every cleaning.</li>
            <li>It does a barely adequate job</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Of course I wish I didn&#x27;t have to buy these, but Arc 4 is so good that it&#x27;s worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li>this quick I will.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also glad the cartridge fits so many different models.</li>
            <li>But these shavers are also really easy to clean under running water, so these are really a luxury.</li>
            <li>It prevents the filter from clogging as quick</li>
            <li>Excellent product and I have never had a problem with any I have bought over the last several years.</li>
            <li>So be sure to stock up and buy as many as possible</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t blame Amazon, it is Panasonic to blame because a quick online search will show that it is not just Amazon that is rasing the price on this.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought these cartridges for my Panasonic razor from other retailers, but Amazon has the best price by far.  </li>
            <li>When I first called Panasonic on this issue, they sent me a free replacement.</li>
            <li>It works great because I can clean it everyday if I want too.</li>
            <li>If you already use the cleaner, you know how much it helps to keep it clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love how it cleans because it looks like a brand new shaver every time.</li>
            <li>Easy to insert, and I think they are priced at a reasonable rate.</li>
            <li>I am still on the first one!</li>
            <li>This cleaning solution works fine, but you don&#x27;t really need it if you have the cleaning station for this razor.  </li>
            <li>You need this thing to keep your shaver clean and this is exactly what it does.</li>
            <li>Installed the first cartridge and now my razor doesn&#x27;t self clean anymore.  </li>
            <li>For the first 5 cleanings or so, it does clean the shaver well.  </li>
            <li>Every time I replace the cartridge around two-three months, my shaver feels and shaves clean like the first day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you clean out your shaver first then use the cleaning machine, this product works well to finish off the process.</li>
            <li>Works great especially with his sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Does a great job of foaming up the little bits of hair out of it that you don&#x27;t get out just taking it apart and brushing it out and running water in it when it runs.  </li>
            <li>This cleaner is the most effective and lowest cost alternative (other than soaking in rubbing alcohol) that I&#x27;m aware of for this shaver.</li>
            <li>These little cartridges do a great job of cleaning the head of your panasonic shaver .</li>
            <li>Although a little pricey, unless you enjoy holding ypur breath every morning, these are a good investment.</li>
            <li>The fact that I was offered these cartridges a few months after I had purchased the razor was great...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through a few cycles with the peroxide and it works great</li>
            <li>the the Braun system...cleans great and cheaper cartridges ..bought the unit for my son who has a heavy beard..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, cheap price.</li>
            <li>So far everything seems OK.</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution gives a distinct odor when you are cleaning the razor.  </li>
            <li>so I switched to Panasonic and thus far I have been pleased with the razor and the cleaner/charger system.</li>
            <li>and I get about a month worth of clearing</li>
            <li>This three pack is convenient and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have used my Hydraclean Shaving System for a while and always like the fresh smell of the system but NOT these Cartridges.  </li>
            <li>I do try to extend their life, and have had success in doubling effectiveness through judicious use.</li>
            <li>Now, I have almost a year&#x27;s worth of cleaner.</li>
            <li>cartridge that came with my shaver had the \\&quot;fresh smell\\&quot; that Panasonic advertises.</li>
            <li>I wonder if you can get fresh cartridges anymore.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>wow, it won&#x27;t take my comments without more words....</li>
            <li>Wish it has a aftershave smell added to it to make it seem fresh.</li>
            <li>Bought this product with 3 cartridges and it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Worth it if you like a &amp;#34;sanitized razor.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The cartridges last longer than advertised (kind of like changing your oil in your car every 3 months)...</li>
            <li>this is the only place that i can get these and keeps my electric razor nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>A nice thing is they don&#x27;t evaporate if the razor is out of the cleaning station such as when you travel unlike the alcohol based cleaners.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the effort to install and fill the reservoir.</li>
            <li>Good item, works as expected...</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but worth it</li>
            <li>Works well and is always fresh.</li>
            <li>But for $10 every 3 months, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to say this cleaner is a great idea because it really does clean the razor with little effort.</li>
            <li>The next time I bought the Panasonic shaver model that is exactly the same but without the added cost of a cleaning system and they are both just fine and work great.</li>
            <li>and I would say that makes me a pretty loyal customer.</li>
            <li>cleaning system has a fairly large reservoir that you fill with water, which is in turn run through the soap in these cartridges to clean your razor.</li>
            <li>Was looking for replacement cartridges and these were the right price and the same exact ones the store sells for so much more!</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is easy to use, and the cartridge is easy to install!Glad to have found them these were cheaper than local stores and did what they were supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I have read on other blogs that you can take Peroxide and use it instead of water when the cartridge is no longer good. -</li>
            <li>tHE PRICE IS RIGHT IOF</li>
            <li>Right stuff, right price, right seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type to always clean my shaver, and this makes it some much easier.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my razor clean and ready to use.</li>
            <li>AND IT DOES KEEP THE SHAVER CLEAN AND READY TO GO</li>
            <li>These cartridges do a great job of keeping your razor clean, however I have discovered that they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as they claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some reason the smell of cartridges are not fresh and good.</li>
            <li>- the razor head is just as clean, if not more clean, than with the soap, which always made it smell kind of mildewed.</li>
            <li>Genuine new cartridges for Panasonic Shaving system, all is OK.&lt;br /&gt;Three units in the box with paper instruction.</li>
            <li>if my routine of cleaning regularly and swapping out these cartridges each month is the reason I&#x27;ve had such great life out of my razors but &amp;#34;if the shoe fits...</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the Fast FREE Shipping with my Purchase of the Razor along with these cleanin cartridges.</li>
            <li>The cartridges are priced well compared to what I had been paying on my older Panasonic model and clean the razor well.  </li>
            <li>HydraClean doesn&#x27;t evaporate, makes it much more economical per cleaning, and only costs pennies per day in comparison.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken to shaving with water and shaving cream, and a quick rinse of the razor before placing it in the cleaner makes everything fast and convenient.</li>
            <li>I love having a clean dry shaver to use every morning.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for a clean, sanitary electric razor.</li>
            <li>Cost is very reasonable, under $3 per month if you sign up for a subscription with Amazon.</li>
            <li>And the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>And the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I do wish these lasted a little longer, but still good for what it is.</li>
            <li>Needed to keep my razor nice and clean, when changing these you can see how much is trapped in the sponge.</li>
            <li>Then, after it&#x27;s done foaming, I just run it under fast running water, then take the top off and run it a little more, then let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needing something to keep my new electric shaver clean.</li>
            <li>Keeps my shaver clean and running like new.  </li>
            <li>This stuff make your shaver smell new again when you clean it.</li>
            <li>I will buy from them again the next time I need more.</li>
            <li>wash mine with liquid soap most of the time, then every couple weeks run it through a run with these, so my cartridges last me for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Two things you should be aware of:  1.  </li>
            <li>Much better than traditional cleaning methods.</li>
            <li>and they perform exactly as you would expect them to.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for several years and have been pleased with results.</li>
            <li>When I can afford it, I will purchase a higher end Panasonic.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still on the first one that came with the shaver.  </li>
            <li>They arrived in a couple days after my order was placed and the first replacement has been working like a charm.  </li>
            <li>My first one didn&#x27;t have a cleaning system.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought the shaver I got the cleaning system with it.</li>
            <li>When the cartridges I bought recently are used up I will buy more.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does...&#x27;&#x27;CLEANS&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love the shaver, and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>I had tried an electric many years ago and couldn&#x27;t handle the pain of it ripping the hair out of my face, so I went back to a blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rinse my razor first,  </li>
            <li>I would rate this product a lot higher if the cartridges lasted longer.</li>
            <li>They worked exactly like I hoped that they would.</li>
            <li>Sure it might of been only 60 cents or so</li>
            <li>Those stores only seem to carry Gillette cleaners that are not compatible with my Panasonic shaver and sell each cartridge separately for about $10 or more.</li>
            <li>exactly what this thing does.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a Panasonic Vortex HydraClean shaving system.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>cartridges do exactly what they claim to.</li>
            <li>Overall this works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;* Pretty noisy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put my shaver through a cleaning cycle every day (more like once a week) but do rinse it under the faucet daily</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>Washing the razor with soap and water does the same thing though for no money :)</li>
            <li>Man, life would be so much easier if they did!  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what your cleaner needs.</li>
            <li>These are the exact ones that come with your machine.</li>
            <li>These are the replacement cartridges for my shaver (also purchased on amazon) and they work great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doing exactly what the specifications claim it should do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Theese are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>My first use gave me the closest shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>, the razor irritated a section of my neck for the first two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Great product last long</li>
            <li>If you can afford the razor, surely you can afford to take care of it properly.</li>
            <li>That cleans it pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These do exactly what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found them these were cheaper than local stores and did what they were supposed to do.</li>
            <li>My husband needed this to go with his shaving set, I found it for a reasonable price and in stock!</li>
            <li>These are exactly like the cleaner cartridges that came with my Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>mean you get this great feeling without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li>when you clean the razor under water to remove clippings, and then use the formula, I found I can easily get 60 days out of a single cartridge.</li>
            <li>so I thought they were the right thing for my husband&#x27;s razor, they weren&#x27;t, so I really can&#x27;t rate them, but I have to to get them out of my cue...</li>
            <li>This one works for sure but didn&#x27;t like the scent very much (smells like a very hard/strong soap).But, definitely convenient than washing the shaver myself.</li>
            <li>Decent price, great delivery as usual.</li>
            <li>(the scruffy look might be more appealing than having hair all over your shirt!)&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I did find you can \\&quot;pretend\\&quot; to replace this filter at least once (just put same filter back in), and have it clean effectively (save a bit of $$).</li>
            <li>The product works very well but is not outstanding (more solution and better cleaning is needed).</li>
            <li>All I have to doe is put in the new cartridge and clean my mechanism and everything is ready to go.</li>
            <li>No need to clean it the old way.</li>
            <li>I clean the heads manually and then run it through the cleaning cycle to completely sterilize the head twice per week.  </li>
            <li>When I first got my razor, I was shaving dry which works fine, but means that water level in your cleaner dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is pretty darn effective given the amount of dark stubble clippings that accumulate in the cartridge by the time you replace it.</li>
            <li>I keep my razor pretty clean with just liquid soap and running it under the water, however when using with the cleaning solution cartridge it does seem to make it work a little better as though it also lubes the blades.</li>
            <li>Now that I know that they are here and can be bought, I&#x27;ll certainly be getting a whole lot more when I run out of my current supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was a great deal as I used to have to purchase through Panasonic directly which was a bit more expensive</li>
            <li>I run my Panasonic shaver through the full cleaning cycle just once weekly -- it&#x27;s all you need and saves on buying these cartridges too frequently.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just remove old cartridge and pop in a new one.</li>
            <li>I generally take the razor apart and clean the pieces under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works fine and seems to last pretty well.</li>
            <li>The 3 pack comes with clear illustrated instructions for a quick and efficient installation.</li>
            <li>Because it is a dry powder that water is pushed through, it clogs at the top.</li>
            <li>This is a good cleaning cartridge and does last a long time with the Panasonic Razor.</li>
            <li>I love the 3 pack of these because I don&#x27;t use the cleaning cycle every single time I shave.</li>
            <li>I rinse my shaver in the sink before putting it back on the charger to clean so one cartridge will last me about 2 months and keep the shaver clean and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice detergent because it has so little scent and is NOT alcohol-based.</li>
            <li>instead, just rinse your Panasonic shaver in a saucer of warm water and a little hydrogen peroxide for 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>This does a pretty decent job of cleaning my electric shaver and is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Amazon sends you an email alerting you it&#x27;s coming, and you can decide at that point if you really need another box of these or not, based on your usage.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well, although pricey because you need to replace it often if you use it rather than cleaning your shaver with water.</li>
            <li>The Braun cleaning mechanism is much much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very thorough and effortless cleaning and lubrication of razor head.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I always rinse my razor and screen after shaving so putting it through a cleaning cycle doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t change this cartridge very often, perhaps once every 6 months.</li>
            <li>you buy a Chevy Geo, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to spend much money maintaining it.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s very mis-leading.</li>
            <li>How can you tell if they really do anything?</li>
            <li>the whole system onley lasts about 3 months.  </li>
            <li>It haves much closer and quicker than the Braun.  </li>
            <li>I always use a 3 or 4 blade Schick or Gillette, and  this shaver is very comparable.</li>
            <li>Not too much to write for this one.....</li>
            <li>The cleaning accomplished by the Vortex system can be accomplished without cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>and you really cannot go without these being changed.</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>Thanks to Prime shipping</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Vortex shaves really close.  </li>
            <li>Works very well cleaning the razor.</li>
            <li>My husband says shave is much smoother after cleaning.</li>
            <li>its been almost couple months and still on the 1st cartridge and cleaning very well still.</li>
            <li>nothing to really rate on.</li>
            <li>* Cleans the razor really well.</li>
            <li>or it gets very stinky.</li>
            <li>(after 17 to 21 cleanings, the red light comes on).</li>
            <li>But, that adds time I do not have, and the whole point was that it was supposed to be you just drop in</li>
            <li>Nothing to complain about, seems to do its job, reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t really have a choice in the matter, do you?</li>
            <li>Cleaning product works reasonable well, but</li>
            <li>Then the red light comes on.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and will purchase again!</li>
            <li>On my unit the red light goes on after just one to two weeks of use (even though there is still over 75% of the water in the reservoir).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suspect that the life of this filter really depends on the thickness and quantity of hairs that you shave off.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic site charges too much for shipping.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered enough for free shipping on Amazon</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you can buy a whole years needs at one time and be done with it.</li>
            <li>I purchased these by accident, but the person I gave them to really likes them.  </li>
            <li>Very satified.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>And so I figured what the heck why not give Amazon a shot since they have been straight with me for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To obtain absolute certainty I sniffed all three cartridges.</li>
            <li>He has a sniffer of absolute sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Shipped very well  the unit works very good&lt;br /&gt;Unit</li>
            <li>(Don&#x27;t get grossed out - he has a beard, so he doesn&#x27;t use this much anyway).  </li>
            <li>Without this cleaner I really don&#x27;t think I could use the razor</li>
            <li>The price for these cleaning cartridges have really dropped in price.</li>
            <li>Works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product makes the cleaning chore so much easier.</li>
            <li>There are 3 in the box, so the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>This cartridge is required  - much like an inkjet printer needs an ink cartridge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like my Panasonic shaver and this cleaning solution</li>
            <li>It only took one suspicious usage for his eyes to brighten and see his total amazement at how effective the electric razor is.</li>
            <li>Formerly a Braun shaver user, and liked their cleaning cartridges - they would last for 30 uses.  </li>
            <li>I gave it as part of a larger present and they really liked it.</li>
            <li>It is also a piece of plastic which happens to fit perfectly into the base of this shaver (for which it was specifically designed).  </li>
            <li>I use my panasonic auto clean charger every 2 days, these little filter packs do a fine job of cleaning my shaver..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure how best to review this product because there&#x27;s not much to say: You snap the thing in place once every month or so and then swap it out for a new one when the red light comes on.</li>
            <li>As one that has decided a blade was just not cutting it anymore due to constant irritation, I have to say this one does a nice job of keeping me smooth enough for the wife, but not so close as to burn my face.</li>
            <li>One is only as good as the other.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many other Shaver manufacturer&#x27;s, Panasonic HydraClean cartridges do not use alcohol.  </li>
            <li>The wet/dry is really nice and the first time I tried a wet shave, I actually got razor burn.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think they do any better of a job cleaning the razor than just putting it under hot water with a little liquid soap.  </li>
            <li>The original cartridge order I receive back in February, 2012 had a date code on the bottom of 90724 (7/24/2009).</li>
            <li>The entire process takes about 60 seconds, so I do not see a reason to buy cleaning cartridges when I can clean my shaver just as well by hand.    </li>
            <li>I think I will just use regular tap water and soap to clean from now on.</li>
            <li>Have to occasionally go in with a Q tip and clean the build up of crud</li>
            <li>The blades will be washed in clean water every time, unlike the hairy oily bath which the second week of cartridge use will give.</li>
            <li>Technically you don&#x27;t even need these cartridges since you can just use liquid soap to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li>These replacement cartridges work well, are cheaper (and smaller footprint) than the Braun Clean &amp; Renew cartridges I used to use with a Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic system does not evaporate, and you only use up its life when you actually clean the razor.  </li>
            <li>The plan is for me to have a three-pack shipped to me every three months.ate, and you only use up its life when you actually clean the razor.  </li>
            <li>You should still replace the cartridge when the water reservoir runs out, as it needs the solution to clean properly.  </li>
            <li>If you clean your razor every day these will last about a month.  </li>
            <li>I have to pull it out and push it back in again to get it to clean the razor.</li>
            <li>but I know the solution cartridges add some lubrication, so I run the clean cycle occasionally.</li>
            <li>May be they are very old and stayed in their warehouse for years and kind of dried out since there is no expiration date on them</li>
            <li>I had to take the first of the 3 in the package out early because I moved and packed this in my checked luggage.</li>
            <li>THAT is how easy it is, and when it&#x27;s clean it is CLEAN and LUBRICATED and not one hair is left in the Shaver and all buildups of scum</li>
            <li>however, I&#x27;ve worn a full beard for many years and only use my Panasonic Vortex shaver on my neck so my experience is hardly typical.</li>
            <li>When you wash your Panasonic Shaver with this cleaning system it will look ilke brand new!</li>
            <li>After cleaned by the vortex system, it feels like a new razor!  </li>
            <li>Surely, the razor does OK on the face but the big problem is that it does not shave closely on the neck or jaw, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>I have found that if you pop the head of the shaver off after  shaving give it a quick rence the cartridge will last longer Just and Idea.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a way on cleaning the main compartment.</li>
            <li>Although the life of these things are really around 2 weeks if you use them daily, they do make the razor fresh.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more of these to make my razor last.</li>
            <li>I like how quick and simple it is to change the cartridges</li>
            <li>A decent product, of which there is a need.</li>
            <li>I know this particular razor can be cleaned with liquid soap and water but why would anyone do so.  </li>
            <li>My husband has an older Panasonic electric shaving system with a recharging mechanism that cleans the shaver while it charges.  </li>
            <li>In fact I am on my 3rd and most recent model.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use just pull the two plastic tabs off and insert into the base station and your good to go.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I stretch the cartridge out as long as I can and use it every two to three days when the razor doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good or the battery is down to 30% or so.</li>
            <li>They do a good job of cleaning but just don&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li>This detergent/filtering system works extremely well to present a clean, comfortable shaver each morning.</li>
            <li>Basically, you do have to replace these things, if you don&#x27;t your razor will start to stink to high heaven.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend both Amazon and the Panasonic electric Shaver</li>
            <li>The price seems high for what you get.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone needing a soap replacement.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend purchasing at time Shaver was purchased.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying these replacement cartridges from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Panasonic Hydraclean system.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Panasonic Hydraclean system.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended by me.</li>
            <li>Maybe if they sold some that contained a high concentration of alcohol or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are easy to change - last for a reasonable amount of shaves and are not combustible like the ones that held alcohol in my last shaver.  </li>
            <li>I needed some more cleaner solution refills for my shaver product and found this on amazon for a little bit cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li>They were 3 years OLD!!</li>
            <li>Wish they lasted longer and the soap cleaned a little better.</li>
            <li>The HydraClean unit could be a little more robust.</li>
            <li>I wish they had a little more fragrance</li>
            <li>Purchased some from a local &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; store and they were so old, didn&#x27;t clean at all.</li>
            <li>I enjoy wet shaving with a double-edged razor, shaving soap, badger hair brush, etc.</li>
            <li>great shaver, lousy cleaning system.</li>
            <li>but it just runs better after I put it through a cycle with these every few months.  </li>
            <li>I am of the opinion that spending a few bucks each month to keep it in tip top shape is the reason.</li>
            <li>As soon as you open the seal on the cartridge, its useful life starts evaporating away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless these have some magical lubricating and life-preserving capability (of the blade, not me), I have found them to be a waste.  </li>
            <li>I get a better cleaning by putting a few drops of SoftSoap on the foil and just rinsing the wet-dry shaver under the faucet.</li>
            <li>But these are limited to something like 30-40 cycles after which the cartridge will not function even if it is entirely clean.  </li>
            <li>- Easy to install  - Actually cleans my device properly    </li>
            <li>Some reviewers say that are good, but I notice that a review by MAX, as well as several other complainers are fairly recent buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, these little cartridges do exactly what they claim to do: clean Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li>I barely ever have to shave, so I only clean it once</li>
            <li>It continues to leave hair bits inside the head, and it is not as effective as simply turning on the machine and rinsing the head under running water and a little bit of soap.</li>
            <li>HAVE TO USE A NEW ONE</li>
            <li>so I just change the cartridge when I flush out and add new water to the reservoir.</li>
            <li>Makes me electric shaver operate like new.</li>
            <li>I have used this cleaner since I received my new shaver and it works just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Shaver looks and smells brand new every morning and shaves as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>You stick a new Cartridge in 2)</li>
            <li>Feels like I have a new razor after using the cartridges.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE 3/9/2012 I just got a new box of these from DRUGSTORE.COM.</li>
            <li>This solution makes your Panasonic razor work like new.  </li>
            <li>Buy all three together and you will restore your razor to like new performance.</li>
            <li>Keeps my old razor running like new !</li>
            <li>but as soon as I empty it, replace the filter and put it in clean mode..</li>
            <li>You can choose to clean the blades with just ordinary soap &amp; water, which Panasonic says is an alternative, but I don&#x27;t recommend it unless you have to, such as when traveling, as you won&#x27;t be lubricating them and you allow the finely machined blades to be vunerable to whatever damage may befall them.</li>
            <li>These cartridges work just as expected and keep the razor clean.  </li>
            <li>If you was the turbo option with dishwashing liquid , in warm water, then do the cleaning in your bin, the cartridge should last months, depending on how heavy of beard you have.    </li>
            <li>and I inevitably find myself with a red light and no replacement cartridge.</li>
            <li>By rinsing off excess hairs the cartridges last considerably longer and leave the shaver fresh and sparkling.</li>
            <li>Put the cartridge back in and enjoy another 2+ weeks of daily use.  </li>
            <li>That this is possible is a credit to the cartridges, rather than a strike against them, as that kind of flexibility is not available using Braun cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these because the are cheaper and last much longer than the refills for my braun.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic cleaning system works pretty well - not as speedy as the Braun system, but it has some key advantages.</li>
            <li>The first ones I got with the razor only worked for about 15 shaves</li>
            <li>My son has had the exact same thing happen to his.</li>
            <li>Regular cleaning with the system made my original blades last 18 months.</li>
            <li>, especially I did not consumed the first canister that came with razor.</li>
            <li>If you use the cartridge for the full and recommended 30 days of use, you will also see pink bacteria and mold growing on the lip of the cartridge</li>
            <li>I clean my razor after every other use and I change out this product monthly.</li>
            <li>razor always stays clean and sharp.</li>
            <li>I got mine for less plus free shipping.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re supposed to last for a month or so, but they sure don&#x27;t last that long for me.  </li>
            <li>Then I lightly blot away the water droplets on the shaver with a microfiber towel and put the shaver in the charger in the dry mode only.</li>
            <li>Once the status light comes on, take out the cartridge, and rinse it a little under running water.  </li>
            <li>current solution to extend the life of the cartridges is to actually remove the top of the razor after each use and shake out all the loose hairs into the sink.</li>
            <li>Although the cleaning system impressed me, I was rather annoyed to find that the status light glowed after only 2 weeks of daily use, way less than the expected 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Other than that quick delivery -----no complaints.</li>
            <li>Then, simply hold down the power button until the unit starts oscillating at a special, fast frequency.</li>
            <li>Clear installation instructions.</li>
            <li>Must have for Panasonic Hydra Clear Systems.</li>
            <li>I have to shut the door, as it is quite loud.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally the cleaning cycle takes about 1 to 1.5 hours to complete.  </li>
            <li>This is definately a step up from my old es8043, although both seem bullet proof.     </li>
            <li>I found that there was some very slimey mold growing in the chamber along with the soap, water and excess facial hair that is removed during the cleaning process.</li>
            <li>It is perhaps old stock.</li>
            <li>and I hope that they fixed this problem.</li>
            <li>These cartridges are much cheaper than the cartridges I had to buy when I owned a similar Braun system.</li>
            <li>Panasonic recommends changing them every month, but I can usually last a bit longer without my shave suffering much.</li>
            <li>The Braun one did last a real 30 cleanings.</li>
            <li>The Braun cleaning stand is also sensitive to being moved, as the liquid can spill out of the cartridge.  </li>
            <li>The Braun cleaning stand is also sensitive to being moved, as the liquid can spill out of the cartridge.  </li>
            <li>.. wOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO TAKE THE SHAVER CLEANING CHORE TO THE NEXT LEVEL.</li>
            <li>No waste if not needed.</li>
            <li>These are conveniently packaged in groups of three so that you have several refills ready to go.</li>
            <li>When I purchased my Panasonic razor, I read lots of negative reviews on the cleaner mechanism, mostly concerning the cost of the cartridges.</li>
            <li>I could stretch the 3-pack to about 9 months before I needed to re-order with my old ES-8249 shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pre-rinse the razor before putting in charger to make these last much longer.</li>
            <li>You just put the shaver in the machine and at the next day it will be ready to use.</li>
            <li>They are quite expensive compared to this but had a fresh scent and better cleaned feeling.</li>
            <li>do as recommended by the manufacturer for self cleaning, where you run a line of liquid soap across the top of the razor, drop water drop by drop slowly around it</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and each cartridge seems to be fine lasting a month.  </li>
            <li>The cartridges arrived quickly and worked well but didn&#x27;t appear to last as long as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have not followed the other reviewer&#x27;s suggestion of cleaning out the cartridge with running water and then trying to use it again, but I plan to do so once the red light turns on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, Amazon apparently is selling some very, very old packages of the shaving solution cartridges.</li>
            <li>I find myself using the little brush and some alcohol to quickly clean it...</li>
            <li>They keep the head and foil fresh and sharp since it helps remove the hardness build up.</li>
            <li>but in all honesty it will last much much longer if you simply give the shaver a quick 5 sec rinse under the tap before plugging it into the cleaning dock.</li>
            <li>USED IT ONCE TO CLEAN SHAVER AND IT DRIED OUT,</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t tend to clean my shaver after every use, I use soap and water after every shave, so I can spread out buying a package every few months.</li>
            <li>This particular product on Amazon comes with 3 cartridges for the same price.</li>
            <li>At only $5 each, or only $0.17 per day, this is an absolute no-brainer!</li>
            <li>I got replacement cartridges for my razor hoping that it would help the shaving process in the morning, but I&#x27;m not really sure it does much more then simple water running through it.</li>
            <li>These puppies last me about 9 months anyways since I use liquid soap to clean it every other day.</li>
            <li>If, on the other hand, you buy a Porsche, you&#x27;ll likely treat it like your special baby.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty and works 100% as expected.</li>
            <li>I put off buying new cartridges for months, but finally caved.</li>
            <li>Same as the one that came with the new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I bought a new razor last November which included the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These came brand new in the box and individually wrapped inside.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this shaver system for over a year now and the blades are still sharp and the cleaner is still working as well as the first day it was used.</li>
            <li>Major Update 9/11/2012</li>
            <li>I use these because there&#x27;s really no other option for my Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li>Ever since Braun came out with their \\&quot;clean and charge\\&quot; system, it seems that razor manufacturers have found ways to make razors maintain themselves with very little effort on the user&#x27;s part.  </li>
            <li>Incidentally, I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries these because, as others have noted, they&#x27;re very hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>but I also cheat a little and usually clean my razor under water when I&#x27;m done shaving and only run it through the system every 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li>The difference between using a little liquid soap and water to clean your Panasonic razor and using the Panasonic charger-cleaner became quite obvious when I was traveling with just the razor and cord on an extended holiday.  </li>
            <li>This system keeps my shaver&#x27;s foil and blades clean and slick.  </li>
            <li>Less toxic for the environment, less weight and cost to ship, easier to dispose of, and bottom line, do a better job of cleaning the shaver because of the built in filtration system in the cleaning cartridge.  </li>
            <li>These cartridges are hard for find in stores, so I was relieved to see that they were available to order through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Cleanes very well, mine last for at least 6 weeks as I clean the blades daily myself after each use.</li>
            <li>You cannot compare any other brand as none other will fit.</li>
            <li>Proper packaging and prompt delivery complete the deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 60 years old and am on my third Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li>Nice idea but expensive for consumer.</li>
            <li>It would be fine if these cartridges worked as advertised, but $3.33 for a week of cleaning is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what we needed for half the price.</li>
            <li>I have found they last about the same no matter if you clean your razor every day or every few days.  </li>
            <li>I must respond to those: You can use other cleaning agents, but they really don&#x27;t work well-</li>
            <li>Take it from an experienced electric shaver user, don&#x27;t waste your money on the HydraClean shaving system or on the expensive cartridges.</li>
            <li>Each one has lasted at least ten years, as they should because they &#x27;aint cheap.</li>
            <li>Most disturbingly, the solution leaves my shaver smelling like old towel (mildew) after every wash.  </li>
            <li>only gripes are: 1) Kind of expensive for what they are, and 2)</li>
            <li>It keeps my shaver working like new every single time.</li>
            <li>The only products you can say that for are other shaving solution cartridges designed specifically for other shaving systems which, let&#x27;s face it, probably fit equally as well.  </li>
            <li>I have a new electric shave and want it to last a long time.</li>
            <li>It takes a few extra seconds but still saves time versus having to clean and dry the razor manually.</li>
            <li>The cartridge does the job, but really, given the ingredients, it is not essential (other soaps/solutions would do the trick as well without a dedicated system, as explained by Panasonic themselves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t realize each cartridge last for about 6 months ,,,,,,,so I now have about 10 years worth,,LOL,, when the razor is dead &amp; buried I will still have 5 years worth left of cartridges.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t clean my Panasonic razor often using the base - most of the time I rinse it under the faucet -</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a way to use some type of common household cleaner or solvent rather than having to periodically buy a captive cartridge at whatever high price the choose to charge.</li>
            <li>And if you live in an area where the water is hard, I recommend that you not use water straight from the tap.  </li>
            <li>And if you live in an area where the water is hard, I recommend that you not use water straight from the tap.  </li>
            <li>The subject cartridges do the job very well and last about a month each.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m in the market for a new electric shaver, I&#x27;ll look at models other than Panasonic, as I don&#x27;t want to deal with this nonsense again.</li>

            <li> The Panasonic Shaving System does a good job of cleaning the razor.  </li>
            <li> Over the years, I have had one razor that I loved.</li>
            <li> I change this cartridge once a month and it does a good job of cleaning and lubricating my Panasonic razor.  </li>
            <li> I notice, every month when I change it, that it&#x27;s fairly loaded with chaving hair clippings.</li>
            <li> I get a darn good shave with my electric.</li>
            <li> Good product but manufacturer claims each cartridge lasts appx.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good but close.</li>
            <li> Shaves good in shower..</li>
            <li> but razor is good.</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> Good price and prompt delivery.  </li>

            <li> Good price for what you get.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning system works good but noisy--</li>
            <li> Works good but kinda on the pricey side.  </li>
            <li> Good Value on time delivery.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Would it not be great if your car can wash itself, change its oil, and refill its own gas tank?  </li>
            <li> in good time too</li>
            <li> what can you say about something you use once a month guess it good</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic makes really good shavers.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> does a good job</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say these are as good as shaving cartridges get.  </li>
            <li> The price is exceptional as well.</li>
            <li> It works great in the shower, and is very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> It is very pleasant to have a clean razor when I need to shave.</li>
            <li> Its function is just what I needed, when it is received I am very satisfied, I will also recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased and will use it again.</li>
            <li> The solution is refreshing and smells great, believe me, you wouldn&#x27;t want to shave your face if you had run out of them.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic system uses a very sophisticated process to do this.  </li>
            <li> hey i love this stuff and it works great  </li>
            <li> Works great to keep my shaver in top condition.</li>
            <li> You bought a $200 shaver but can&#x27;t afford $10 every six months to keep it nice and in good working condition?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Filter is very good... but not all that accessible if you wanted to purchase it someplace else..</li>
            <li> As for charging...I haven&#x27;t recharged in almost a full month, so battery life is very good.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> cleaned the head perfectly and does exactly what it is supposed to</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I am perfectly satisfied!</li>
            <li> Could not ask for any thing better!</li>
            <li> How magical!</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to remove and install from the Panasonic washer device.</li>
            <li> Could use a more pleasant fragrance however.</li>
            <li> and they are a great value and easy install.</li>
            <li> So for me, it&#x27;s not a ripoff since in addition to my own cleaning, using these</li>
            <li> If you own the Panasonic ES-93K razor, use the cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> Nice that they are inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no secret that Panasonic arguably makes the best electric shavers on the market (some Braun users would argue that point though I&#x27;ve owned Brauns</li>
            <li> The price is good and even better using the auto ship program.</li>
            <li> I own both the Braun and the Panasonic self cleaning shavers.  </li>
            <li> Run the oscillating shaver blades under warm water for 10-30 seconds</li>
            <li> I signed up for the auto-delivery program and it&#x27;s nice getting a supply of these periodically.  </li>
            <li> This cleaning cartridge is a no-brainer if you own a Panasonic Vortex shaver.</li>
            <li> I also liked that it came in a 3-pack.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I own the ES8078 and used the cartridges for a while.  </li>
            <li> either way, they&#x27;re effective and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> After a set time, warm air circulated around the razor heads to speed up drying time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a self-cleaning shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;These cartridges are effective at cleaning the Panasonic shavers they were designed to complement.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic made a really nice job when engineered this cartridge series.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take my word for it, if you own a Panasonic shaving system which requires this cartridge - I&#x27;d say give it a try.  </li>
            <li> These refills are great at keeping my husbands Razer so clean.</li>
            <li> Great stuff right here!</li>
            <li> it does it job very nicely and keeps my razor clean as a whistle.</li>
            <li> The price for these cartridges is the best that I have for new cartridges from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Very easy to swap out.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install with the included directions.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install and replace.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, and very easy to swap out.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast,much to my delight, and the product was exactly the item I was looking for -at a fair price!</li>
            <li> Fit right into the cleaner/charger perfectly.</li>
            <li> it works very good, i put it into the vortex system and it works very well</li>
            <li> This product is a good fit with the cleaning system of panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with these is of my own making--I tend to forget to order more of them</li>
            <li> I just started using this shaver and so far very impressed and</li>
            <li> Good cartridges and cheap.</li>
            <li> They are great for the money and worth it.</li>
            <li> this makes for a more effective, closer shave.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years with great success.  </li>
            <li> these are great, and the price is right...</li>
            <li> I can easily say that the HydraClean process saves me a lot of work each week!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend not buying this system or cartriges!</li>
            <li> Original replacement at good price.</li>
            <li> my razor is always nice and clean and ready to work, and the best part is that I was able to setup a subscription for these puppys</li>
            <li> To be honest, I really don&#x27;t know what else to say but that these just work great</li>
            <li> Good Product, keeps razor clean.</li>
            <li> sparkling clean and leaves my shaver smelling good in the process..</li>
            <li> The product was a great price and shipping was very very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> This is great if you find yourself using the shaver immediately after drying, as you can avoid that alcohol burning sensation upon first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great to have exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> The cartrdiges are very cheap, as another reviewer said, it costs max.</li>
            <li> The water of the cleaner should be changed more often then this filter is changed.</li>
            <li> I love the unit itself</li>
            <li> Then be sure to use the drying function on cleaning station as I think this helps prevent corrosion on the blades.</li>
            <li> Glad I went for the HydraClean package as it cleans much better than I ever could.</li>
            <li> This one agrees with my husband and he is satisfied with the cartidges and their price.</li>
            <li> that works well most of the time</li>
            <li> has kept my razor running great and hasn&#x27;t cost me much at all.</li>
            <li> Better $ than W@LM@RT.  </li>
            <li> More like 25-30.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that Amazon sells it.</li>
            <li> This time went much better</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will continue to get easier each time I replace the cartridge.</li>
            <li> It might be OK for some faces but not mine.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more from this.</li>
            <li> i like my shaver &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> When I bought my razor three or four years ago it was top of the line.</li>
            <li> this product worthwhile?</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve cleaned (and simultaneously charged) my razor if I take of the top foil so the blades are exposed, it always looks shiny and like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li> I love my razor</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased the Panasonic razer that takes these cartridges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad it was a match</li>
            <li> I doubt you could find a better Vortex Shaving system solution cartridge for shaver models ES8109S, ES8228S, ES8249S, ES-LA93-K,</li>
            <li> Of course if you want to pay more it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use these cartridges.</li>
            <li> It seems to do so, the shaver seems to work better with using this than it does without.</li>
            <li> but I have taken the safe stance on this one.</li>
            <li> but I am not going to buy any more either.  </li>
            <li> I cannot be sure</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the cleaning helps it do</li>
            <li> The HydraClean Cleaning Cartridge is really convenient, and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I am always satisfied with these orders.</li>
            <li> Just slot it in and press start :)</li>
            <li> Panasonic said I should have bought it from them to be sure I obtained the correct cartridge.  </li>
            <li> My husband used an old-style manual face razor for many years.</li>
            <li> Finally, knowing that I could return it if needed, I ordered what looked like the best Panasonic electric razor that Amazon sold, for him.</li>
            <li> I love the shave from this razor.</li>
            <li> Another plus most shavers smell after awhile with this cleaner</li>
            <li> and I think the shaver runs better than when cleaned with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Would like to see better price, but not a surprise as you have no alternatives to choose from...</li>
            <li> The cleaning cartridges are a better design than the Braun being water based rather than alcohol based.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Well, I see no reason to buy more.</li>
            <li> He loves it and still req more.</li>
            <li> love the razor.  </li>
            <li> Get more mileage out of a cartridge by dusting razor before inserting into Vortex system.</li>
            <li> I love subscribe and save as I never have to chase around locating these.  </li>
            <li> Just wish Canada had it more in stock.</li>
            <li> I must say that without the cartridge I had to put much more effort into cleaning the shaver</li>
            <li> But I guess that is how most things are.</li>
            <li> Depending on use, many could use the sink most of the week and the cleaner every 3 days or so.</li>
            <li> Not an option with most of the competition.</li>
            <li> Overall this shaver and the cartridges are the best.</li>
            <li> It seems like most of these reviews are more about the shaver than the product.</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HAVING THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Sure beats doing it by hand.  </li>
            <li> Have to keep cleaning out the drain-hole at the bottom of the cleaning unit (poultry lacer needle) and removing the &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; build-up that collects on top of the fibers at the oval opening of the cartridge.</li>
            <li> ok - The Braun cleaning system tended to work a bit better - but the Panasonic razors are better for me.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Used these many times before, works great, cleans very well</li>
            <li> Really love this shaver.</li>
            <li> My bathroom is attached to my bedroom and I need to make sure to remember to do this in the morning before I leave for work.</li>
            <li> I can see there is plenty of soap under the top, but it is clogged at the top with hair.</li>
            <li> The ES LA93 is simple the best electric razor out there</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ordered any more.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you have the Vortex cleaning system before buying this item.  </li>
            <li> You get more than you pay for.</li>
            <li> This really does a great job of cleaning your shaver.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price and you can save even more if you purchase with the replacement inner blade and outer foil.  </li>
            <li> and now I don&#x27;t have to think about ordering more for a while.</li>
            <li> Continue to be pleased with this Panasonic cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> or there was more of the cleaning solution though.  </li>
            <li> be ordering more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;arrived</li>
            <li> The cartidge I received was as advertised, store quality, and at a much better price.</li>
            <li> I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic Linear Razors for many years now.  </li>
            <li> I also find that the razor shaves better using the cleaning system than it did when I washed the razor with liquid soap.</li>
            <li> This is my third time purchasing these replacement cartridges and they work great!  </li>
            <li> I love the cleaning feature on my Panasonic ES8109 Vortex razor and this cleaning cartridge is at the heart of that system.</li>
            <li> This system is so much better</li>
            <li> so I want to be able to use it for more cycles than if I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This forces the purchase of more these than I would otherwise need.  </li>
            <li> Lasts better than 120 days doing it that way.</li>
            <li> Works great, cleans the shaver very well.  </li>
            <li> I love this Vortex HydraClean system.</li>
            <li> I use a wet/dry electric shaver with shaving cream for a better feel and better shave.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product that complements a great razor.  </li>
            <li> All seemed more than acceptable.</li>
            <li> so I have no reservations about using these cartridges and will order more when these run out.</li>
            <li> The cartridge was ok while the unit lasted</li>
            <li> and I love the Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Yes, they cost money, but they wash the Shaver better that I do.</li>
            <li> Much more affordable through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It even smells much better than the Panasonic cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Cleans my shavers better than I do.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Bought the shaver here on Amazon, and love it.</li>
            <li> I really love it</li>
            <li> Much better for the environment, I think.</li>
            <li> I may use them more now.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job of keeping my Panasonic razor clean and ready to go.</li>
            <li> Replacements are cheap and keep my shaver clean and in good working condition.</li>
            <li> It does keep the razor nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Keeps the razor nice and clean after each shave.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver you can just brush it clean with the brush that comes with the shaver and use some warm water if needed.</li>
            <li> Works like it is suppose to do and keeps my shaver nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice clean detergent refill for your panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Seems like a pain to have to buy these to clean your razor, but I guess it can be a nice option.</li>
            <li> I have owned my L93 panasonic shaver for two years now and the cleaning system keeps them smelling nice and keep the razor clean.</li>
            <li> When used at recommended intervals it keeps the shaver nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> Great system, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A great product.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Razor is clean and feels good after being run through the charge / clean cycle.</li>
            <li> I use it in my razor cleaning system and the razor is very clean when I take it out of its holder in the morning.</li>
            <li> Keeps the shaver very clean.</li>
            <li> For a while there I was shaving in the shower and noticed that rinsing the shaver in warm water was not the best method, for I also had to make sure the leave it completely dried.</li>
            <li> For first 5-6 times it works good but after that its just a piece of sponge.</li>
            <li> Looks like Amazon is sending new product at great prices.</li>
            <li> Great product to make your razor just like new.  </li>
            <li> As always, these arrived nice and quick.</li>
            <li> Quality is outstanding, easy to use.</li>
            <li> They plug up easily and I never get more than 1 or 2 cleanings out of them.</li>
            <li> The Vortex HydraClean System does a fantastic job of cleaning and preparing the shaver for excellent daily shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband did extensive research before buying this new razor and is delighted with his results as he thinks it is the best shave he has ever gotten with an electric shaver....</li>
            <li> a clean, close shave - this is your unit!</li>
            <li> These things clean my razor!</li>
            <li> Overall very good value.</li>
            <li> This does a nice job of keeping your razor fresh.  </li>
            <li> cleaning system does get the razor a bit cleaner than just washing with water (or liquid soap and water, as noted in the manual), adds lubrication and a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast ship.</li>
            <li> Since you&#x27;re a captive customer, it&#x27;s good to know that the shaver system works.</li>
            <li> Bottom Line Up Front: Super easy and convenient and cleans the razor more thoroughly than I was ever able by hand&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thing I liked best about this product is that it came very quickly and it qualified for free super saver shipping, I was very satisfied with that, because last time I ordered it from Panasonic directly and took them forever to ship it, over a month.</li>
            <li> This product contributes to a perfectly clean razor each day that I use it, which has been more than 6 months.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easily startled.</li>
            <li> I just changed the cleaning cartridge for the 1st time and it was fairly easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, cleans the shaver well.</li>
            <li> Easy to change out.     </li>
            <li> Easy to install and no maintenance required.</li>
            <li> Easy to change also.</li>
            <li> The system is easy to use and these SEEM to work well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and easy to replace when used up.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is easy to use, and the cartridge is easy to install.</li>
            <li> Easy to install solution.</li>
            <li> It is easy to install.</li>
            <li> It worked okay, but never got the razor totally clean.</li>
            <li> These are great for freshening up my PANASONIC ES LA93, simply rinse the surplus hairs off under the tap, place this in the charging unit and Bob&#x27;s your uncle :-)</li>
            <li> Easy removal and installation in the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> The clean system by Brawn is better ..</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I wish the product was able to remove the used razor smell, but keep it clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li> I usually clean once a week and it seems to work OK</li>
            <li> Has a nice clean smooth smell to the shaver head after a clean and charge.</li>
            <li> Easy, low-maintenance cleaning process and the auto-ship subscription takes the thought out of remembering to order it.  </li>
            <li> But it is strong, and may bother some people.  </li>
            <li> If you own this razor these are essential for keeping it in good working order.</li>
            <li> Good, much easier to find vs in-store, and cheap.</li>
            <li> To clean most Panasonic shavers, first remove the outer foil and wash it under warm water (set it aside).</li>
            <li> Does a good job makes it easy to keep your shaver running like new.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, this Panasonic Shaver has been the best electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> But every once in a while I like to clean my Panasonic shaver with the HydraClean system which keeps it nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own the latest greatest most expensive model razor.</li>
            <li> This product seems to help me keep my new shaver in good condition.</li>
            <li> it cleans good and the the razor is as new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to look for this filter for my shaver, and I couldn&#x27;t fine it.</li>
            <li> I use them and my razor has been going fine for over two years now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I will use the self cleaning function again, just the recharging protion will be fine.</li>
            <li> the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> -- these are just fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine on razor about three times a week.</li>
            <li> just ordered refills have been using the product for years now -- seems to work fine versus just washing the shaver off under the  faucet</li>
            <li> These cartridges work just fine -- for about a week.  </li>
            <li> another reviewer here stated it seems that the soap and water itself is fine, but over time the cartridge gets clogged up with hair particles.</li>
            <li> It also does a fine job of maintaining your razor.  </li>
            <li> Thsi product might be fine</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s just a quick tap after your shave, then once-a-week, do a more thorough job by placing the shaver in your HydraClean System, where it cleans, dries and recharges all-in-one.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Panasonic Has the best shaver in the world, and these little hydraclean filter cartridges put the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> These seem to wear out very quickly but they do clean well.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the cleaning function of my razor.</li>
            <li> Order two packs and get free shipping.</li>

            <li> This razor is light years ahead of the Braun.  </li>

            <li> Once again the product that I needed was available on subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li> Its cheap, and i can use it for almost two month</li>
            <li> great product, purchased at the same time  of my panny electric shaver</li>
            <li> also just re-peated my order for another 3 pks price was fantastic</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to not have one available when the time comes for my husband to replace it.</li>
            <li> They do a great job of cleaning my shaver and 10 bucks for three is a steal considering they last for a couple months.</li>
            <li> These are genuine Panasonic and the price from Amazon can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> I purchase them for lowest price, cheap shipping.  </li>
            <li> The fit and work well because they are manufactured by Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone a couple of months without using it and found my shaver was lagging with a smooth cut.</li>
            <li> These cartridges work great on the two Panasonic shavers I currently use.  </li>
            <li> I meant to purchase only a shaver, but Amazon recommended that it would go great with my shaver.  </li>
            <li> Then, lubricate your shaver with a light oil.</li>
            <li> Free replacement shipment.</li>

            <li> It fits precisely in the cleaning unit making the changing process a smooth experience.</li>
            <li> Just after the cleaning, it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean the shaver manually.</li>
            <li> I hope it is a bit more economical</li>
            <li> Replacing these cartridges on a regular basis really keeps my razor performing at its best.  </li>
            <li> The Braun system is far superior.  </li>
            <li> It is convenient to clean your razor this way, but does not clean the best.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this to clean this shaver and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon since the store I bought this razor doesn&#x27;t sell the replacements!!!  </li>
            <li> I enjoy having a clean razor, and these do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy on the face (with shaving cream), a close shave, and quick.  </li>
            <li> They arrived quickly, they are easy to install</li>
            <li> It keeps the razor, a major expenditure in good working order.</li>
            <li> very very good..value for money would reccommend to anyone who owns a panasonic elictric shaver cant get better than this</li>
            <li> It produces a very fresh and clean razor and meets its stated purpose.</li>
            <li> I thing holding razor  under running hot water for 1 minute is faster,cheaper and better</li>
            <li> My original one that came with lasted a while</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this product broke my shaver.  </li>
            <li> These are original accessories.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic razer is really a great one and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Let me say that the cleaning system does exactly what it claims to be able to do.  </li>
            <li> Performed like the original.</li>
            <li> EVERY TIME i CLEAN THE SHAVER.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are needed to clean and lubricate the shaver.</li>
            <li> If you have the shaver, you will need to clean it.</li>
            <li> drawback is that the cartridges really don&#x27;t clean all that well.  </li>
            <li> I had to clean it every now and then</li>
            <li> This is the manufacturer&#x27;s product meant to clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is supposed to clean and lubricate the shaver.</li>
            <li> The additional 15% discount sure makes a nice overall deal.  </li>
            <li> Clean it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and free.</li>
            <li> These keep the shaver clean.  </li>
            <li> If you can afford the minute to clean your shaver yourself, spend your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> You CLEAN your Vortex.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the Vortex cleaner cartridge to clean my Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li> Shaving every morning with a clean razor is quite a treat.</li>
            <li> But they do keep you electric razor really clean.</li>
            <li> and I was changing the Braun clean and renews every 30 days.</li>
            <li> My razor is always clean, and I don&#x27;t have to spend any time doing it.</li>
            <li> you have to buy these replacements for the shaving machine, they have the gel inside and shaving goes super smooth with this.</li>
            <li> If you like your shaver and want to keep it clean like when you bought it then you need to keep using the cleaner system.</li>
            <li> These cleaning cartridges disinfect and clean the shaver head.  </li>
            <li> Since this product is to clean the Wet/Dry Shaver I use, I just clean mine off in the shower.</li>
            <li> These are the only choice if you got the complete shaving set from Panasonic, Buying the shaver, which by the way is excellent would suffice, since you can use it with water, and consequently can be thoroughly cleaned under the faucet stream of water.</li>
            <li> I used to try and clean all the intricate parts by hand using q-tips and paper towels.</li>
            <li> Each one lasts a year if you clean your shaver once a week.</li>
            <li> This is probably because I rinse the shaver after every use, so there isn&#x27;t maybe so much to clean.  </li>

            <li> Works well keeping my Panasonic shaver clean.</li>
            <li> Have not used this product as of yet; thus can&#x27;t rest it but will do so after using it to clean the razor</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to clean my shaver again.  </li>
            <li> A hassle-free way to clean your Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Keeps my Panasonic shaver clean and functioning well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you need to replace these as often as Panasonic would like you to, but they do help ensure a clean and well-running razor.</li>
            <li> it keeps the shaver clean and lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> a clean</li>
            <li> Using the Vortex Cleaning system returned the electric shaver to the sweet smell of clean.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product and truly worth the price.</li>
            <li> It then wouldn&#x27;t properly clean my shaver until I replaced the cartridge, even though the cleaning solution was still two-thirds full.  </li>
            <li> The whole shaving system is easy to use and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> It was hard to spend alot for a razor but reviews had been basically pretty good so gave it a fly--and am very happy so far.  </li>
            <li> Overall I had a good experience.</li>
            <li> I can use this razor every day with no problems and keep it clean with a quick rinse.</li>
            <li> I feel is good enough with this Shaving system.</li>
            <li> I use the full clean/dry/charge mode once every 4-5 shaves or 15 days since I shave twice a week.</li>
            <li> I bought a years supply and am just about ready to order more.  </li>
            <li> Extra cleaning cartridges are a good thing to have.</li>
            <li> They say this cleaning agent has something to do with the sharpness of the razor, but the real review goes to the shaver itself more than the cleaning agent.  </li>
            <li> This was because the cartridge filter was full of hair clippings.  </li>
            <li> But once every couple of weeks, I do the full cleaning cycle on the shaver.  </li>
            <li> It continues to be a most satisfactory, reliable purchase as is our Panasonic electric self-cleaning shaver for which the refills are necessary and easy to install!</li>
            <li> Amazon has the right price and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I spent more than $ 10 for nothing!!</li>
            <li> great advantage over other brands is that it doesn&#x27;t use alcohol, rather a water-added substance that in the end leaves a pleasant scent (that you smell only if you put your nose right up to it).</li>
            <li> It keeps the shaver clean and fresh in conjuntion with the charging/cleaning dock.</li>
            <li> They leave my razor clean and smelling fresh after every cleaning.</li>
            <li> It does a barely adequate job</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Of course I wish I didn&#x27;t have to buy these, but Arc 4 is so good that it&#x27;s worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> this quick I will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also glad the cartridge fits so many different models.</li>
            <li> But these shavers are also really easy to clean under running water, so these are really a luxury.</li>
            <li> It prevents the filter from clogging as quick</li>
            <li> Excellent product and I have never had a problem with any I have bought over the last several years.</li>
            <li> So be sure to stock up and buy as many as possible</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blame Amazon, it is Panasonic to blame because a quick online search will show that it is not just Amazon that is rasing the price on this.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these cartridges for my Panasonic razor from other retailers, but Amazon has the best price by far.  </li>
            <li> When I first called Panasonic on this issue, they sent me a free replacement.</li>
            <li> It works great because I can clean it everyday if I want too.</li>
            <li> If you already use the cleaner, you know how much it helps to keep it clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love how it cleans because it looks like a brand new shaver every time.</li>
            <li> Easy to insert, and I think they are priced at a reasonable rate.</li>
            <li> I am still on the first one!</li>
            <li> This cleaning solution works fine, but you don&#x27;t really need it if you have the cleaning station for this razor.  </li>
            <li> You need this thing to keep your shaver clean and this is exactly what it does.</li>
            <li> Installed the first cartridge and now my razor doesn&#x27;t self clean anymore.  </li>
            <li> For the first 5 cleanings or so, it does clean the shaver well.  </li>
            <li> Every time I replace the cartridge around two-three months, my shaver feels and shaves clean like the first day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you clean out your shaver first then use the cleaning machine, this product works well to finish off the process.</li>
            <li> Works great especially with his sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Does a great job of foaming up the little bits of hair out of it that you don&#x27;t get out just taking it apart and brushing it out and running water in it when it runs.  </li>
            <li> This cleaner is the most effective and lowest cost alternative (other than soaking in rubbing alcohol) that I&#x27;m aware of for this shaver.</li>
            <li> These little cartridges do a great job of cleaning the head of your panasonic shaver .</li>
            <li> Although a little pricey, unless you enjoy holding ypur breath every morning, these are a good investment.</li>
            <li> The fact that I was offered these cartridges a few months after I had purchased the razor was great...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few cycles with the peroxide and it works great</li>
            <li> the the Braun system...cleans great and cheaper cartridges ..bought the unit for my son who has a heavy beard..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, cheap price.</li>
            <li> So far everything seems OK.</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution gives a distinct odor when you are cleaning the razor.  </li>
            <li> so I switched to Panasonic and thus far I have been pleased with the razor and the cleaner/charger system.</li>
            <li> and I get about a month worth of clearing</li>
            <li> This three pack is convenient and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used my Hydraclean Shaving System for a while and always like the fresh smell of the system but NOT these Cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I do try to extend their life, and have had success in doubling effectiveness through judicious use.</li>
            <li> Now, I have almost a year&#x27;s worth of cleaner.</li>
            <li> cartridge that came with my shaver had the \\&quot;fresh smell\\&quot; that Panasonic advertises.</li>
            <li> I wonder if you can get fresh cartridges anymore.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> wow, it won&#x27;t take my comments without more words....</li>
            <li> Wish it has a aftershave smell added to it to make it seem fresh.</li>
            <li> Bought this product with 3 cartridges and it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Worth it if you like a &amp;#34;sanitized razor.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The cartridges last longer than advertised (kind of like changing your oil in your car every 3 months)...</li>
            <li> this is the only place that i can get these and keeps my electric razor nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> A nice thing is they don&#x27;t evaporate if the razor is out of the cleaning station such as when you travel unlike the alcohol based cleaners.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the effort to install and fill the reservoir.</li>
            <li> Good item, works as expected...</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but worth it</li>
            <li> Works well and is always fresh.</li>
            <li> But for $10 every 3 months, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say this cleaner is a great idea because it really does clean the razor with little effort.</li>
            <li> The next time I bought the Panasonic shaver model that is exactly the same but without the added cost of a cleaning system and they are both just fine and work great.</li>
            <li> and I would say that makes me a pretty loyal customer.</li>
            <li> cleaning system has a fairly large reservoir that you fill with water, which is in turn run through the soap in these cartridges to clean your razor.</li>
            <li> Was looking for replacement cartridges and these were the right price and the same exact ones the store sells for so much more!</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is easy to use, and the cartridge is easy to install!Glad to have found them these were cheaper than local stores and did what they were supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have read on other blogs that you can take Peroxide and use it instead of water when the cartridge is no longer good. -</li>
            <li> tHE PRICE IS RIGHT IOF</li>
            <li> Right stuff, right price, right seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type to always clean my shaver, and this makes it some much easier.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my razor clean and ready to use.</li>
            <li> AND IT DOES KEEP THE SHAVER CLEAN AND READY TO GO</li>
            <li> These cartridges do a great job of keeping your razor clean, however I have discovered that they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as they claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason the smell of cartridges are not fresh and good.</li>
            <li> - the razor head is just as clean, if not more clean, than with the soap, which always made it smell kind of mildewed.</li>
            <li> Genuine new cartridges for Panasonic Shaving system, all is OK.&lt;br /&gt;Three units in the box with paper instruction.</li>
            <li> if my routine of cleaning regularly and swapping out these cartridges each month is the reason I&#x27;ve had such great life out of my razors but &amp;#34;if the shoe fits...</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for the Fast FREE Shipping with my Purchase of the Razor along with these cleanin cartridges.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are priced well compared to what I had been paying on my older Panasonic model and clean the razor well.  </li>
            <li> HydraClean doesn&#x27;t evaporate, makes it much more economical per cleaning, and only costs pennies per day in comparison.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to shaving with water and shaving cream, and a quick rinse of the razor before placing it in the cleaner makes everything fast and convenient.</li>
            <li> I love having a clean dry shaver to use every morning.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for a clean, sanitary electric razor.</li>
            <li> Cost is very reasonable, under $3 per month if you sign up for a subscription with Amazon.</li>
            <li> And the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> And the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I do wish these lasted a little longer, but still good for what it is.</li>
            <li> Needed to keep my razor nice and clean, when changing these you can see how much is trapped in the sponge.</li>
            <li> Then, after it&#x27;s done foaming, I just run it under fast running water, then take the top off and run it a little more, then let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needing something to keep my new electric shaver clean.</li>
            <li> Keeps my shaver clean and running like new.  </li>
            <li> This stuff make your shaver smell new again when you clean it.</li>
            <li> I will buy from them again the next time I need more.</li>
            <li> wash mine with liquid soap most of the time, then every couple weeks run it through a run with these, so my cartridges last me for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Two things you should be aware of:  1.  </li>
            <li> Much better than traditional cleaning methods.</li>
            <li> and they perform exactly as you would expect them to.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for several years and have been pleased with results.</li>
            <li> When I can afford it, I will purchase a higher end Panasonic.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still on the first one that came with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> They arrived in a couple days after my order was placed and the first replacement has been working like a charm.  </li>
            <li> My first one didn&#x27;t have a cleaning system.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought the shaver I got the cleaning system with it.</li>
            <li> When the cartridges I bought recently are used up I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does...&#x27;&#x27;CLEANS&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love the shaver, and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> I had tried an electric many years ago and couldn&#x27;t handle the pain of it ripping the hair out of my face, so I went back to a blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rinse my razor first,  </li>
            <li> I would rate this product a lot higher if the cartridges lasted longer.</li>
            <li> They worked exactly like I hoped that they would.</li>
            <li> Sure it might of been only 60 cents or so</li>
            <li> Those stores only seem to carry Gillette cleaners that are not compatible with my Panasonic shaver and sell each cartridge separately for about $10 or more.</li>
            <li> exactly what this thing does.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a Panasonic Vortex HydraClean shaving system.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> cartridges do exactly what they claim to.</li>
            <li> Overall this works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;* Pretty noisy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put my shaver through a cleaning cycle every day (more like once a week) but do rinse it under the faucet daily</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> Washing the razor with soap and water does the same thing though for no money :)</li>
            <li> Man, life would be so much easier if they did!  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what your cleaner needs.</li>
            <li> These are the exact ones that come with your machine.</li>
            <li> These are the replacement cartridges for my shaver (also purchased on amazon) and they work great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing exactly what the specifications claim it should do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Theese are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> My first use gave me the closest shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> , the razor irritated a section of my neck for the first two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Great product last long</li>
            <li> If you can afford the razor, surely you can afford to take care of it properly.</li>
            <li> That cleans it pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These do exactly what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found them these were cheaper than local stores and did what they were supposed to do.</li>
            <li> My husband needed this to go with his shaving set, I found it for a reasonable price and in stock!</li>
            <li> These are exactly like the cleaner cartridges that came with my Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> mean you get this great feeling without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li> when you clean the razor under water to remove clippings, and then use the formula, I found I can easily get 60 days out of a single cartridge.</li>
            <li> so I thought they were the right thing for my husband&#x27;s razor, they weren&#x27;t, so I really can&#x27;t rate them, but I have to to get them out of my cue...</li>
            <li> This one works for sure but didn&#x27;t like the scent very much (smells like a very hard/strong soap).But, definitely convenient than washing the shaver myself.</li>
            <li> Decent price, great delivery as usual.</li>
            <li> (the scruffy look might be more appealing than having hair all over your shirt!)&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I did find you can \\&quot;pretend\\&quot; to replace this filter at least once (just put same filter back in), and have it clean effectively (save a bit of $$).</li>
            <li> The product works very well but is not outstanding (more solution and better cleaning is needed).</li>
            <li> All I have to doe is put in the new cartridge and clean my mechanism and everything is ready to go.</li>
            <li> No need to clean it the old way.</li>
            <li> I clean the heads manually and then run it through the cleaning cycle to completely sterilize the head twice per week.  </li>
            <li> When I first got my razor, I was shaving dry which works fine, but means that water level in your cleaner dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is pretty darn effective given the amount of dark stubble clippings that accumulate in the cartridge by the time you replace it.</li>
            <li> I keep my razor pretty clean with just liquid soap and running it under the water, however when using with the cleaning solution cartridge it does seem to make it work a little better as though it also lubes the blades.</li>
            <li> Now that I know that they are here and can be bought, I&#x27;ll certainly be getting a whole lot more when I run out of my current supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was a great deal as I used to have to purchase through Panasonic directly which was a bit more expensive</li>
            <li> I run my Panasonic shaver through the full cleaning cycle just once weekly -- it&#x27;s all you need and saves on buying these cartridges too frequently.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just remove old cartridge and pop in a new one.</li>
            <li> I generally take the razor apart and clean the pieces under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works fine and seems to last pretty well.</li>
            <li> The 3 pack comes with clear illustrated instructions for a quick and efficient installation.</li>
            <li> Because it is a dry powder that water is pushed through, it clogs at the top.</li>
            <li> This is a good cleaning cartridge and does last a long time with the Panasonic Razor.</li>
            <li> I love the 3 pack of these because I don&#x27;t use the cleaning cycle every single time I shave.</li>
            <li> I rinse my shaver in the sink before putting it back on the charger to clean so one cartridge will last me about 2 months and keep the shaver clean and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice detergent because it has so little scent and is NOT alcohol-based.</li>
            <li> instead, just rinse your Panasonic shaver in a saucer of warm water and a little hydrogen peroxide for 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> This does a pretty decent job of cleaning my electric shaver and is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Amazon sends you an email alerting you it&#x27;s coming, and you can decide at that point if you really need another box of these or not, based on your usage.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well, although pricey because you need to replace it often if you use it rather than cleaning your shaver with water.</li>
            <li> The Braun cleaning mechanism is much much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very thorough and effortless cleaning and lubrication of razor head.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I always rinse my razor and screen after shaving so putting it through a cleaning cycle doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t change this cartridge very often, perhaps once every 6 months.</li>
            <li> you buy a Chevy Geo, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to spend much money maintaining it.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s very mis-leading.</li>
            <li> How can you tell if they really do anything?</li>
            <li> the whole system onley lasts about 3 months.  </li>
            <li> It haves much closer and quicker than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I always use a 3 or 4 blade Schick or Gillette, and  this shaver is very comparable.</li>
            <li> Not too much to write for this one.....</li>
            <li> The cleaning accomplished by the Vortex system can be accomplished without cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> and you really cannot go without these being changed.</li>
            <li> and I really like it</li>
            <li> Thanks to Prime shipping</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Vortex shaves really close.  </li>
            <li> Works very well cleaning the razor.</li>
            <li> My husband says shave is much smoother after cleaning.</li>
            <li> its been almost couple months and still on the 1st cartridge and cleaning very well still.</li>
            <li> nothing to really rate on.</li>
            <li> * Cleans the razor really well.</li>
            <li> or it gets very stinky.</li>
            <li> (after 17 to 21 cleanings, the red light comes on).</li>
            <li> But, that adds time I do not have, and the whole point was that it was supposed to be you just drop in</li>
            <li> Nothing to complain about, seems to do its job, reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t really have a choice in the matter, do you?</li>
            <li> Cleaning product works reasonable well, but</li>
            <li> Then the red light comes on.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> On my unit the red light goes on after just one to two weeks of use (even though there is still over 75% of the water in the reservoir).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suspect that the life of this filter really depends on the thickness and quantity of hairs that you shave off.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic site charges too much for shipping.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered enough for free shipping on Amazon</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can buy a whole years needs at one time and be done with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these by accident, but the person I gave them to really likes them.  </li>
            <li> Very satified.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> And so I figured what the heck why not give Amazon a shot since they have been straight with me for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To obtain absolute certainty I sniffed all three cartridges.</li>
            <li> He has a sniffer of absolute sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Shipped very well  the unit works very good&lt;br /&gt;Unit</li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t get grossed out - he has a beard, so he doesn&#x27;t use this much anyway).  </li>
            <li> Without this cleaner I really don&#x27;t think I could use the razor</li>
            <li> The price for these cleaning cartridges have really dropped in price.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This product makes the cleaning chore so much easier.</li>
            <li> There are 3 in the box, so the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This cartridge is required  - much like an inkjet printer needs an ink cartridge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like my Panasonic shaver and this cleaning solution</li>
            <li> It only took one suspicious usage for his eyes to brighten and see his total amazement at how effective the electric razor is.</li>
            <li> Formerly a Braun shaver user, and liked their cleaning cartridges - they would last for 30 uses.  </li>
            <li> I gave it as part of a larger present and they really liked it.</li>
            <li> It is also a piece of plastic which happens to fit perfectly into the base of this shaver (for which it was specifically designed).  </li>
            <li> I use my panasonic auto clean charger every 2 days, these little filter packs do a fine job of cleaning my shaver..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how best to review this product because there&#x27;s not much to say: You snap the thing in place once every month or so and then swap it out for a new one when the red light comes on.</li>
            <li> As one that has decided a blade was just not cutting it anymore due to constant irritation, I have to say this one does a nice job of keeping me smooth enough for the wife, but not so close as to burn my face.</li>
            <li> One is only as good as the other.  </li>
            <li> Unlike many other Shaver manufacturer&#x27;s, Panasonic HydraClean cartridges do not use alcohol.  </li>
            <li> The wet/dry is really nice and the first time I tried a wet shave, I actually got razor burn.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think they do any better of a job cleaning the razor than just putting it under hot water with a little liquid soap.  </li>
            <li> The original cartridge order I receive back in February, 2012 had a date code on the bottom of 90724 (7/24/2009).</li>
            <li> The entire process takes about 60 seconds, so I do not see a reason to buy cleaning cartridges when I can clean my shaver just as well by hand.    </li>
            <li> I think I will just use regular tap water and soap to clean from now on.</li>
            <li> Have to occasionally go in with a Q tip and clean the build up of crud</li>
            <li> The blades will be washed in clean water every time, unlike the hairy oily bath which the second week of cartridge use will give.</li>
            <li> Technically you don&#x27;t even need these cartridges since you can just use liquid soap to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li> These replacement cartridges work well, are cheaper (and smaller footprint) than the Braun Clean &amp; Renew cartridges I used to use with a Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic system does not evaporate, and you only use up its life when you actually clean the razor.  </li>
            <li> The plan is for me to have a three-pack shipped to me every three months.ate, and you only use up its life when you actually clean the razor.  </li>
            <li> You should still replace the cartridge when the water reservoir runs out, as it needs the solution to clean properly.  </li>
            <li> If you clean your razor every day these will last about a month.  </li>
            <li> I have to pull it out and push it back in again to get it to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> but I know the solution cartridges add some lubrication, so I run the clean cycle occasionally.</li>
            <li> May be they are very old and stayed in their warehouse for years and kind of dried out since there is no expiration date on them</li>
            <li> I had to take the first of the 3 in the package out early because I moved and packed this in my checked luggage.</li>
            <li> THAT is how easy it is, and when it&#x27;s clean it is CLEAN and LUBRICATED and not one hair is left in the Shaver and all buildups of scum</li>
            <li> however, I&#x27;ve worn a full beard for many years and only use my Panasonic Vortex shaver on my neck so my experience is hardly typical.</li>
            <li> When you wash your Panasonic Shaver with this cleaning system it will look ilke brand new!</li>
            <li> After cleaned by the vortex system, it feels like a new razor!  </li>
            <li> Surely, the razor does OK on the face but the big problem is that it does not shave closely on the neck or jaw, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I have found that if you pop the head of the shaver off after  shaving give it a quick rence the cartridge will last longer Just and Idea.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a way on cleaning the main compartment.</li>
            <li> Although the life of these things are really around 2 weeks if you use them daily, they do make the razor fresh.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more of these to make my razor last.</li>
            <li> I like how quick and simple it is to change the cartridges</li>
            <li> A decent product, of which there is a need.</li>
            <li> I know this particular razor can be cleaned with liquid soap and water but why would anyone do so.  </li>
            <li> My husband has an older Panasonic electric shaving system with a recharging mechanism that cleans the shaver while it charges.  </li>
            <li> In fact I am on my 3rd and most recent model.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use just pull the two plastic tabs off and insert into the base station and your good to go.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I stretch the cartridge out as long as I can and use it every two to three days when the razor doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good or the battery is down to 30% or so.</li>
            <li> They do a good job of cleaning but just don&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> This detergent/filtering system works extremely well to present a clean, comfortable shaver each morning.</li>
            <li> Basically, you do have to replace these things, if you don&#x27;t your razor will start to stink to high heaven.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend both Amazon and the Panasonic electric Shaver</li>
            <li> The price seems high for what you get.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone needing a soap replacement.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend purchasing at time Shaver was purchased.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying these replacement cartridges from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Panasonic Hydraclean system.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Panasonic Hydraclean system.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended by me.</li>
            <li> Maybe if they sold some that contained a high concentration of alcohol or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are easy to change - last for a reasonable amount of shaves and are not combustible like the ones that held alcohol in my last shaver.  </li>
            <li> I needed some more cleaner solution refills for my shaver product and found this on amazon for a little bit cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> They were 3 years OLD!!</li>
            <li> Wish they lasted longer and the soap cleaned a little better.</li>
            <li> The HydraClean unit could be a little more robust.</li>
            <li> I wish they had a little more fragrance</li>
            <li> Purchased some from a local &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; store and they were so old, didn&#x27;t clean at all.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wet shaving with a double-edged razor, shaving soap, badger hair brush, etc.</li>
            <li> great shaver, lousy cleaning system.</li>
            <li> but it just runs better after I put it through a cycle with these every few months.  </li>
            <li> I am of the opinion that spending a few bucks each month to keep it in tip top shape is the reason.</li>
            <li> As soon as you open the seal on the cartridge, its useful life starts evaporating away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless these have some magical lubricating and life-preserving capability (of the blade, not me), I have found them to be a waste.  </li>
            <li> I get a better cleaning by putting a few drops of SoftSoap on the foil and just rinsing the wet-dry shaver under the faucet.</li>
            <li> But these are limited to something like 30-40 cycles after which the cartridge will not function even if it is entirely clean.  </li>
            <li> - Easy to install  - Actually cleans my device properly    </li>
            <li> Some reviewers say that are good, but I notice that a review by MAX, as well as several other complainers are fairly recent buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, these little cartridges do exactly what they claim to do: clean Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> I barely ever have to shave, so I only clean it once</li>
            <li> It continues to leave hair bits inside the head, and it is not as effective as simply turning on the machine and rinsing the head under running water and a little bit of soap.</li>
            <li> HAVE TO USE A NEW ONE</li>
            <li> so I just change the cartridge when I flush out and add new water to the reservoir.</li>
            <li> Makes me electric shaver operate like new.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleaner since I received my new shaver and it works just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Shaver looks and smells brand new every morning and shaves as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> You stick a new Cartridge in 2)</li>
            <li> Feels like I have a new razor after using the cartridges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE 3/9/2012 I just got a new box of these from DRUGSTORE.COM.</li>
            <li> This solution makes your Panasonic razor work like new.  </li>
            <li> Buy all three together and you will restore your razor to like new performance.</li>
            <li> Keeps my old razor running like new !</li>
            <li> but as soon as I empty it, replace the filter and put it in clean mode..</li>
            <li> You can choose to clean the blades with just ordinary soap &amp; water, which Panasonic says is an alternative, but I don&#x27;t recommend it unless you have to, such as when traveling, as you won&#x27;t be lubricating them and you allow the finely machined blades to be vunerable to whatever damage may befall them.</li>
            <li> These cartridges work just as expected and keep the razor clean.  </li>
            <li> If you was the turbo option with dishwashing liquid , in warm water, then do the cleaning in your bin, the cartridge should last months, depending on how heavy of beard you have.    </li>
            <li> and I inevitably find myself with a red light and no replacement cartridge.</li>
            <li> By rinsing off excess hairs the cartridges last considerably longer and leave the shaver fresh and sparkling.</li>
            <li> Put the cartridge back in and enjoy another 2+ weeks of daily use.  </li>
            <li> That this is possible is a credit to the cartridges, rather than a strike against them, as that kind of flexibility is not available using Braun cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these because the are cheaper and last much longer than the refills for my braun.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic cleaning system works pretty well - not as speedy as the Braun system, but it has some key advantages.</li>
            <li> The first ones I got with the razor only worked for about 15 shaves</li>
            <li> My son has had the exact same thing happen to his.</li>
            <li> Regular cleaning with the system made my original blades last 18 months.</li>
            <li> , especially I did not consumed the first canister that came with razor.</li>
            <li> If you use the cartridge for the full and recommended 30 days of use, you will also see pink bacteria and mold growing on the lip of the cartridge</li>
            <li> I clean my razor after every other use and I change out this product monthly.</li>
            <li> razor always stays clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> I got mine for less plus free shipping.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re supposed to last for a month or so, but they sure don&#x27;t last that long for me.  </li>
            <li> Then I lightly blot away the water droplets on the shaver with a microfiber towel and put the shaver in the charger in the dry mode only.</li>
            <li> Once the status light comes on, take out the cartridge, and rinse it a little under running water.  </li>
            <li> current solution to extend the life of the cartridges is to actually remove the top of the razor after each use and shake out all the loose hairs into the sink.</li>
            <li> Although the cleaning system impressed me, I was rather annoyed to find that the status light glowed after only 2 weeks of daily use, way less than the expected 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Other than that quick delivery -----no complaints.</li>
            <li> Then, simply hold down the power button until the unit starts oscillating at a special, fast frequency.</li>
            <li> Clear installation instructions.</li>
            <li> Must have for Panasonic Hydra Clear Systems.</li>
            <li> I have to shut the door, as it is quite loud.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally the cleaning cycle takes about 1 to 1.5 hours to complete.  </li>
            <li> This is definately a step up from my old es8043, although both seem bullet proof.     </li>
            <li> I found that there was some very slimey mold growing in the chamber along with the soap, water and excess facial hair that is removed during the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> It is perhaps old stock.</li>
            <li> and I hope that they fixed this problem.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are much cheaper than the cartridges I had to buy when I owned a similar Braun system.</li>
            <li> Panasonic recommends changing them every month, but I can usually last a bit longer without my shave suffering much.</li>
            <li> The Braun one did last a real 30 cleanings.</li>
            <li> The Braun cleaning stand is also sensitive to being moved, as the liquid can spill out of the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> The Braun cleaning stand is also sensitive to being moved, as the liquid can spill out of the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> .. wOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO TAKE THE SHAVER CLEANING CHORE TO THE NEXT LEVEL.</li>
            <li> No waste if not needed.</li>
            <li> These are conveniently packaged in groups of three so that you have several refills ready to go.</li>
            <li> When I purchased my Panasonic razor, I read lots of negative reviews on the cleaner mechanism, mostly concerning the cost of the cartridges.</li>
            <li> I could stretch the 3-pack to about 9 months before I needed to re-order with my old ES-8249 shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pre-rinse the razor before putting in charger to make these last much longer.</li>
            <li> You just put the shaver in the machine and at the next day it will be ready to use.</li>
            <li> They are quite expensive compared to this but had a fresh scent and better cleaned feeling.</li>
            <li> do as recommended by the manufacturer for self cleaning, where you run a line of liquid soap across the top of the razor, drop water drop by drop slowly around it</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and each cartridge seems to be fine lasting a month.  </li>
            <li> The cartridges arrived quickly and worked well but didn&#x27;t appear to last as long as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have not followed the other reviewer&#x27;s suggestion of cleaning out the cartridge with running water and then trying to use it again, but I plan to do so once the red light turns on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , Amazon apparently is selling some very, very old packages of the shaving solution cartridges.</li>
            <li> I find myself using the little brush and some alcohol to quickly clean it...</li>
            <li> They keep the head and foil fresh and sharp since it helps remove the hardness build up.</li>
            <li> but in all honesty it will last much much longer if you simply give the shaver a quick 5 sec rinse under the tap before plugging it into the cleaning dock.</li>
            <li> USED IT ONCE TO CLEAN SHAVER AND IT DRIED OUT,</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t tend to clean my shaver after every use, I use soap and water after every shave, so I can spread out buying a package every few months.</li>
            <li> This particular product on Amazon comes with 3 cartridges for the same price.</li>
            <li> At only $5 each, or only $0.17 per day, this is an absolute no-brainer!</li>
            <li> I got replacement cartridges for my razor hoping that it would help the shaving process in the morning, but I&#x27;m not really sure it does much more then simple water running through it.</li>
            <li> These puppies last me about 9 months anyways since I use liquid soap to clean it every other day.</li>
            <li> If, on the other hand, you buy a Porsche, you&#x27;ll likely treat it like your special baby.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and works 100% as expected.</li>
            <li> I put off buying new cartridges for months, but finally caved.</li>
            <li> Same as the one that came with the new shaver.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new razor last November which included the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These came brand new in the box and individually wrapped inside.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this shaver system for over a year now and the blades are still sharp and the cleaner is still working as well as the first day it was used.</li>
            <li> Major Update 9/11/2012</li>
            <li> I use these because there&#x27;s really no other option for my Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li> Ever since Braun came out with their \\&quot;clean and charge\\&quot; system, it seems that razor manufacturers have found ways to make razors maintain themselves with very little effort on the user&#x27;s part.  </li>
            <li> Incidentally, I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries these because, as others have noted, they&#x27;re very hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> but I also cheat a little and usually clean my razor under water when I&#x27;m done shaving and only run it through the system every 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> The difference between using a little liquid soap and water to clean your Panasonic razor and using the Panasonic charger-cleaner became quite obvious when I was traveling with just the razor and cord on an extended holiday.  </li>
            <li> This system keeps my shaver&#x27;s foil and blades clean and slick.  </li>
            <li> Less toxic for the environment, less weight and cost to ship, easier to dispose of, and bottom line, do a better job of cleaning the shaver because of the built in filtration system in the cleaning cartridge.  </li>
            <li> These cartridges are hard for find in stores, so I was relieved to see that they were available to order through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Cleanes very well, mine last for at least 6 weeks as I clean the blades daily myself after each use.</li>
            <li> You cannot compare any other brand as none other will fit.</li>
            <li> Proper packaging and prompt delivery complete the deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 60 years old and am on my third Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> Nice idea but expensive for consumer.</li>
            <li> It would be fine if these cartridges worked as advertised, but $3.33 for a week of cleaning is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we needed for half the price.</li>
            <li> I have found they last about the same no matter if you clean your razor every day or every few days.  </li>
            <li> I must respond to those: You can use other cleaning agents, but they really don&#x27;t work well-</li>
            <li> Take it from an experienced electric shaver user, don&#x27;t waste your money on the HydraClean shaving system or on the expensive cartridges.</li>
            <li> Each one has lasted at least ten years, as they should because they &#x27;aint cheap.</li>
            <li> Most disturbingly, the solution leaves my shaver smelling like old towel (mildew) after every wash.  </li>
            <li> only gripes are: 1) Kind of expensive for what they are, and 2)</li>
            <li> It keeps my shaver working like new every single time.</li>
            <li> The only products you can say that for are other shaving solution cartridges designed specifically for other shaving systems which, let&#x27;s face it, probably fit equally as well.  </li>
            <li> I have a new electric shave and want it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> It takes a few extra seconds but still saves time versus having to clean and dry the razor manually.</li>
            <li> The cartridge does the job, but really, given the ingredients, it is not essential (other soaps/solutions would do the trick as well without a dedicated system, as explained by Panasonic themselves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize each cartridge last for about 6 months ,,,,,,,so I now have about 10 years worth,,LOL,, when the razor is dead &amp; buried I will still have 5 years worth left of cartridges.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t clean my Panasonic razor often using the base - most of the time I rinse it under the faucet -</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a way to use some type of common household cleaner or solvent rather than having to periodically buy a captive cartridge at whatever high price the choose to charge.</li>
            <li> And if you live in an area where the water is hard, I recommend that you not use water straight from the tap.  </li>
            <li> And if you live in an area where the water is hard, I recommend that you not use water straight from the tap.  </li>
            <li> The subject cartridges do the job very well and last about a month each.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in the market for a new electric shaver, I&#x27;ll look at models other than Panasonic, as I don&#x27;t want to deal with this nonsense again.</li>
            <li> They can last much longer if you use the cleaner every other day and rinse off in the sink the other days.</li>
            <li> Where a &amp;#34;Clean and Renew&amp;#34; cartridge will simply &amp;#34;elapse&amp;#34; after a month and read &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34;, even if it has never been used, you can use your Panasonic cartridge for as long as you please, allowing you to get a couple of extra uses out of it before moving on to the next cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> After your first included cartridge is &#x27;used up&#x27; (the soap only lasts a few weeks before it gets smelly), just fill empty out the reservoir and fill it with hydrogen peroxide (which you can get at the drugstore for a dollar or two a bottle).</li>
            <li> just got a NEW shipment and need to clarify my previous, one star rating.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you replace the water in the tank as well, or you make your new, clean filters dirty by using old, dirty water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you just put the shaver in the cleaner, it does not last 30 cleanings, at least for me - and that is consistent</li>
            <li> /&gt;Filters don&#x27;t last long enough</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that the cartridges last much longer if you simply put a little liquid soap over the foil after each shave, turn on the turbo mode (press the shaver&#x27;s ON button for 3-5 seconds), allow it to run for 20 secs then rinse the foil &amp; shaver blades under tap water (this is per the instruction manual).</li>
            <li> According to the handbook thing that comes with the shaver, you can use the same cartridge for a long time if you just use soapy water to rinse your shaver before you put it in the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> Works well but doesn&#x27;t  last as long as the company says it should.</li>
            <li> The filters work as advertised, but really don&#x27;t last long before clogging up.  </li>
            <li> These cartridges don&#x27;t last anywhere nearly as long as asserted in the promotional materials.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know yet how long it will last</li>
            <li> These are a necessity for my husband&#x27;s Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver, but as long as used properly, the shaver lasts forever.</li>
            <li> The cleaning unit did not last long.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re inexpensive, last seasonably long, and let YOU decide when to discard them.  </li>
            <li> the solution last twice as long.</li>
            <li> I have a normal beard, nothing heavy.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time, they aren&#x27;t terribly expensive, and they are extremely easy to install and replace.</li>
            <li> It is like having a new shaver everyday.</li>
            <li> My beard isn&#x27;t very heavy but still have to get rid of the grey stubble--shaves very close--the battery seems to last a long time--went almost 3 weeks b4</li>
            <li> If you rinse the shaver before popping it in for a cleaning these cartridges last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> These work well, but they don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I have always avoided using their cleaning system because of all the reviewer comments about how costly the cleaning cartridges are because they do not last very long.  </li>
            <li> For that much money, they ought to last at least 1-2 months</li>
            <li> It cleans very well the blades, which is necessary at least every 30 days.</li>
            <li> So, assume you will get less time unless you clean the shaver 1st or you have slow beard growth.</li>
            <li> Now I can rub toilet paper all over my visage &amp; there taint a dingle to be found.</li>
            <li> The Cleaning system is SO idiot-proof, I am positive that those who made negative reviews, MUST have botched up the process somehow</li>
            <li> I usually wash mine with soft soap a couple times a week, and only use the dryer on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> If you have a holder with a lid it will help (obviously) with the loose blade.  </li>
            <li> A little cheaper than buying them direct from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Less frequent use such as every other day prolongs it.  </li>
            <li> What you may NOT know is that this is available with Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34;...meaning you can save some bank AND eliminate the issue of running out at the wrong time.  </li>
            <li> If you remove the cartridge you will see that it has a filter material in the top which acts to capture the hairs from the dirty water.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews that gave negative reports on the staleness and foul odor of the Amazon inventory of these cartridges I was very reluctant to order them.</li>
            <li> However the razor shaves so well that  this minor point doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I signed up for Subscribe &amp; Save to get the discount I will need replacements as long as I have my Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s used these for as long as he has had his razor and we have not had any problems with them.</li>
            <li> charging takes a while and the cleaning process is too long.</li>
            <li> I noticed that when I replaced the cartridge that the old one had trapped a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> One of the biggest selling points for the Panasonic razor was that these cartridges were a lot cheaper than norelco&#x27;s or remmington&#x27;s, and from what i read from the other reviews beforehand, they last about just as long.</li>
            <li> I see several reviewers have suggested the idea of stretching the cartridge life by washing the razor under the tap every other day.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers are correct about the low humming noise while charging, drying or cleaning.</li>
            <li> What makes them a 4-star product are their comparative advantages over significantly more expensive cartridges designed by other manufacturers for other shaving systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can only get no more that half that much before they show to be empty.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it because I shave dry 99% of the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously, I would tap out my razor after every shave, rinse it out about once a week with water, and then sterilize it before setting it out to dry.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Braun series, which has an alcohol based cleaning solution premixed in the container, this is a dry solution that you add water to via a basin in the cleaning machine.</li>
            <li> Do they wash, dry, and fold themselves?  </li>
            <li> On the remaining six days, I rinse it under running tap water and then set the unit to just Dry and Charge.</li>
            <li> Although I still tap out my razer after each shave to extend the life of the cartridge, and empty and refill the water reservoir after each cleaning cycle to save on wear &amp; tear, it&#x27;s considerably easier to just drove my shaver in the HydraClean, press a button and walk away for a few hours than doing everything I used to do before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m no razor-maintenance expert, but the shave following use of the cleaning system seems smoother, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with a fresh scent from the razor either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced any foul smell whatsoever and the cartridges last much longer (4-5 months).</li>
            <li> I use a new fusion hard blade sometimes, but this is close, and over the long run, a money saver.    </li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver cleaner works for  limited time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to a conventional razor.</li>
            <li> Is the cleaning cartridge necessary and are there less expensive ways to clean your shaver?</li>
            <li> Rinse again and repeat this process until no more clippings come out and the water is clear.  </li>
            <li> I put them in when the light turns red on my razor&#x27;s cleaning base and when I take the old one out it has a bunch of hair all over it, so I presume it&#x27;s doing something.</li>
            <li> These cartridges contain cleaners, cutting blade lubricants and a filter, to keep your shaver blades clean and in proper condition.</li>
            <li> so I only need to buy them once per year; so a little too long to use subscribe &amp; save with them.</li>
            <li> These little cartridges may be small, however, they are fully equipped and capable to do battle with whatever your shaver has gotten itself into.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver if you are serious about</li>
            <li> The three-packs are really economical and no more expensive than the blades that I was purchasing for my old razor.</li>
            <li> It is as close as a hand razor and can be used wet or dry!</li>
            <li> I did discover that if the red light is on and the base loses power (either due to a power failure or due to being unplugged), the red light will go out and the cleaning cycle will then operate.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I cannot seem to find replacement blades or cleaning cartridges locally.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried these before, so I will need to see how the cleaning systems works out over the next few months.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> Not much of a review to write for this product.</li>
            <li> and i eventually broke it cuz i was too rough with it when i cleaned it.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this product except that it works well with the Panasonic razor.  </li>
            <li> I followed this recommendation initially, finding that the filter became quite discolored with trapped beard cuttings by the end of one month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the second day, I can say that, during the drying cycle, the entire bathroom gets this stale, \\&quot;old soapy\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> Seems as though I would replace the Braun cleaner, use it that week, leave for a week, and come home to an empty system.</li>
            <li> These cartridges look like something Panasonic added to their charger/washer in order to make a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> I purchased one on eBay, only to have it break within a few months.</li>
            <li> Just be careful and don&#x27;t tip it over.</li>
            <li> You can empty out the tank every time you replace the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> You can empty out the tank every time you replace the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> finally got round to ordering these after some time.</li>
            <li> It is so simple and the razor is so well cleaned and dried.</li>
            <li> Putting a wet razor in the cleaner solves that problem too.</li>
            <li> Product arrived and works as expected.</li>
            <li> It would be extremely annoying if I had to search for a specific type and then probably pay more since it wasn&#x27;t standardized.</li>
            <li> They are very simple to install in the cleaning base; they last a month or so, are solidly constructed and they work very well.</li>
            <li> As an extremely practical person, I never thought I would submit to an automated cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> AS MY OTHER FACTORY PURCHASED CLEANSING UNITS HAVE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one last past three weeks.  </li>
            <li> Then you did something other than the setup process I mentioned here.</li>
            <li> replace the cartridge once every other month, because I shave every other time using some body wash.  </li>
            <li> I found that manual soap &amp; rinse cleanings do the same thing, so I&#x27;m not sure why I still buy these cartridges....</li>
            <li> The Panasonic WES035P is a solid detergent block with a small filter.  </li>
            <li> There is no higher level of testing known to man</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other</li>
            <li> It does however last longer than that if you rinse it by hand and only use the base station / cartridge to clean it every few days.</li>
            <li> (I just get my hands wet and hold my fingers pointing down so water drips), and let it foam up.  </li>
            <li> I have found a simple way to extend the life of the cartridges - note that it&#x27;s a little messy but</li>
            <li> Some reviews claim there&#x27;s an odd smell instead of the slightly-lemon scent that&#x27;s expected.  </li>
            <li> There was a period of two years where I did NOT have any packs, and my Panasonic Shaver was very difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> The filters are hard to find locally at Target, etc.</li>
            <li> After using a new cleaning cartridge, the performance of my shaver dramaticly increased.</li>
            <li> When i bought this one, it only came with 1 cleaning cartridge but it lasted a while... then got too icky looking</li>
            <li> Not worth fussing with a return</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the HydraClean packs are slightly expensive for the functionality they offer, I find that Amazon&#x27;s discount, combined with the 15% off bonus offered for a subscription makes the value proposition much</li>
            <li> I only use it once a week though and not every day because I don&#x27;t have a thick beard</li>
            <li> They leave it looking and feeling like new, and completely disinfected to prevent ugly razor burn or infections.      </li>
            <li> Amazon makes it much easier, quicker, and less expensive to order these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to do that because I don&#x27;t like rinsing the hair down the drain lest it eventually clog.    </li>
            <li> A week or so after buying it the cleaning unit broke down.</li>
            <li> The razor is inserted upside down in the cleaning stand, by the way.  </li>
            <li> It drys in less than h1/2&lt;br /&gt;Goldie</li>
            <li> a month maybe less.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was slightly less anyone else that had it.</li>
            <li> , since it is water based, there&#x27;s less packaging - the detergent is concentrated, and mixes with the water.</li>
            <li> No more do you have to spend lots of time with a small brush and spray, cleaning out the individual cutter blades.</li>
            <li> I got these replacement Cleaning Packs in less than a week after ordering.</li>
            <li> not real sure  </li>
            <li> The last shipment I received were dried up and were not effective.  </li>
            <li> However, one hidden expense is these cleaning cartridges.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a hidden expense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now gone through 3 charging bases, all breaking in less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> Still, if you&#x27;re stingy with replacing it you can get maybe 1.5 to 2 months out of a cartridge which means you&#x27;ll be blowing a bit less than a Ulysses S. Grant each year on this shaving system.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give it anything less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The cleaning unit is bulky, the cartridges expensive, and the system highly ineffective.</li>
            <li> Less plastic waste that gets chucked into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little cartridge is basically soap for your Panasonic Vortex Electric Razor.  </li>
            <li> a little pricy, but sometimes you just have to bite the bullet..</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be ordering them for a little while.</li>
            <li> These will last me four to six months at least!</li>
            <li> Tough to find these refill cartridges anywhere else, and totally  not possible at these prices!</li>
            <li> this does NOT fit this razor</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> (few months, I don&#x27;t shave every day).  </li>
            <li> Why pay shipping when you don&#x27;t have to, and can receive these every few months at an additional 15% discount.  </li>
            <li> Mailed me expired product which explains why it was dried out and of no use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> After trying to refill the cartridge manually (a messy mistake)</li>
            <li> Replacement cartridge leaks and does not fit.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly heavy beard growth and shave every day.  </li>
            <li> Cleans my razor without me having to waste my time with it.</li>
            <li> Buying these cartridges is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need these cleaning cartridges Take the shaver head off and flush the foil and blades under hot running water, reassemble and automatically fan dry in the shaver base.</li>
            <li> You can try cartridges designed for other shaving systems, but may find the lack of compatibility frustrating after 36 or 37 tries.</li>
            <li> A necessary evil if you don&#x27;t want to clean it every day.</li>
            <li> A plus for these shaver cartridges is that they work with just plain tap water; no alcohol-type chemicals are used here.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe that after buying a new razor it would be difficult to find the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these cartridges for a few years and they&#x27;ve worked well in the past.  </li>
            <li> Besides, the price has dropped on them in the past few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can get quite filthy quickly, so it needs to be watched for.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m surprised at how dirty the water/cleaning cartridge gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure what this does, but it bitches like a mo-fo when its out.</li>
            <li> and I still have to take a blade to shave my neck and jaw to the usual smoothness.    </li>
            <li> No more mold for this guy.</li>
            <li> still not sure that you need the cleaning of the heads; but did notice that the shaver seemed to shave smoother and closer.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say about cleaning cartridges for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> The cleaning stand has a small, removable water tank.  </li>
            <li> These usually sale online for $9.99.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else one would want from a product of this</li>
            <li> haven&#x27; t used it yet, but is just like the cartridges i hae used for my razor in the past, so there is not reason these should not work</li>
            <li> A way that i&#x27;ve found to make them last longer is to wash your razor about once per day with regular hand soap and washing with water, and then drying it with the base (without cleaning), but then using the cleaning mode about once every week or two.</li>
            <li> I suspect that these are either very old or maybe a bad batch.</li>
            <li> These are getting really hard to find in the stores, and they&#x27;re cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Everywhere in Canada this item is hard to get.  </li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Hard to believe.  </li>
            <li> This cleaning cartridge is so hard to find except for online.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to write about the cleaning cartridge without mentioning the Hydraclean system.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic makes the shaver and the cartridges so their is not much that can go wrong.</li>
            <li> but the Panasonics I&#x27;ve bought have cost AT LEAST $250.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that the slimey mold would affect my skin in a negative way</li>
            <li> have seen some negative reviews of this item, and of the shaver.</li>
            <li> However, since the shaver is a wet/dry shaver, I found that washing the shaver head and the cutting blades after each use and before inserting the shaver into the \\&quot;base station\\&quot; allows me to extend the life of each cartridge to at least two months, making the economics much more favorable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like the razor and the self cleaning system, but as I expected the price of the cartridges keeps going up and up and up.  </li>
            <li> I mean, what else do you need?</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the stale water is pretty nasty when it comes time to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After my skin adjusted, however, no more irritation!</li>
            <li> I only need to use the cleaning cycle once a week to keep any unpleasant smell away, so one cartridge lasts a couple of months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to talk about this product in detail because it is very simple.</li>
            <li> I previously used the Braun cleaning/charging system and the batteries in the razor failed prematurely.</li>
            <li> Looks like a \\&quot;crap shoot\\&quot; as to whether you will get fresh ones, or these stale ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WAY less expensive than buying locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This solution seems a little bit too expensive for me, since one can make one from water and soap, according to the shaver&#x27;s instructions.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic WES035P Vortex is not nearly as good as the reviewers say it is.  </li>
            <li> but the bottom line they are not good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using distilled water in the cleaning base eliminates the white residue from hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li> When I got the razor and set up the cleaner/charger it was a little bit awkward to install the cartridge.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid to try again.</li>
            <li> Then while standing over a sink, blow into the little hole at the end of the cartridge and you&#x27;ll see the clippings and dirty water come out.  </li>
            <li> However, this a poor technique of cleaning the Panasonic shaver head.  </li>
            <li> Not a great value.  </li>
            <li> The detergent leaves behind a film of lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they do work as advertised, but there&#x27;s at least one cheaper, as-effective method of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I encountered no problem with adverse odors, as stated in other reviews-----maybe they just were the victims of a spoiled (bad) batch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much extra benefit the auto-clean function of the base station provides, compared with just washing the shaver head and cutting blades under the tap, but I suppose the detergent in the cartridge contributes to a cleaner result.</li>
            <li> Although I was initially skeptical about the value of Panasonic HydraClean charging base, after owning and using one for over a year now, I&#x27;ve been solidly sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This meant that the cutting blades went dull before their time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to say with 100% certainty but the evidence is that it is.</li>
            <li> The cartridge is expensive but it works just like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> absurd</li>
            <li> like it ill be NEVER AGAIN to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Bought shaver for my ill husband.  </li>
            <li> It does what it says, I don&#x27;t use it after every shave as that would be expensive</li>
            <li> For this reason, the cartridges reviewed here are useless</li>
            <li> expensive add-on to the cost of the razor.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> It is useless because you need the Vortex cleaning system which my shaver doesn&#x27;t need.  </li>
            <li> I think it is just an expensive gimmick.</li>
            <li> I am unable to find these cartridges in town</li>
            <li> These cartridges worked as described and weren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> The problem is that the HydraClean Shaving System, aka the charger base has a known defect which causes premature failure.</li>
            <li> I tried to go without buying this replacement filter... but my electric razor got so dirty (got hair all over me as I would shave)...</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t recommend trying to stretch the cartridge life by cutting the power.    </li>
            <li> But the package I just received from Amazon almost stinks.</li>
            <li> Also the cleaning unit itself seems to get dirty and requires separate cleaning.</li>
            <li> Recommend cleaning the bay were the razor sits in between cartridges, mine was dirty.</li>
            <li> While the base continues to charge, the problem that both of us have encountered is that the base in which you place the shaver has a tendency to leak after just a few months of use.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say, though, that I am disappointed with the HydraClean Shaving System.</li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s warranty repair procedure was impossible to deal with</li>
            <li> I tend to refill sporadically depending on how bad I see the condition of cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No wonder they had a bad odor to them.</li>
            <li> So I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Did Amazon acquire a bad batch?</li>
            <li> If you have a panasonic shaver with a cleaning base you are stuck buying these.  </li>
            <li> They work well in my Panasonic cleaning base.</li>
            <li> And I have the cleaning/recharging base.</li>
            <li> These compact cartridges combine a filter and detergent and are inserted in the Panasonic shaver \\&quot;base station\\&quot; to effect automatic cleaning of the shaver.</li>
            <li> when the charger base itself no longer works.</li>
            <li> In The Cleaning Charger Base</li>
            <li> The razor&#x27;s base keeps telling me I need to replace the cartridge after having just replaced it.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.</li>
            <li> It would have to be the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Panasonic makes the shaver and the cartridges so their is not much that can go wrong. I&#x27;ve had my shaver for a couple years now and always used these cartridges. I&#x27;ve not had to replace anything in the shaver yet.</li>
            <li> Great replacement filters and a great price too. I will buy from them again the next time I need more.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> met all my needs and expectations</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried these before, so I will need to see how the cleaning systems works out over the next few months. So far everything seems OK.</li>
            <li> This does a pretty decent job of cleaning my electric shaver and is very convenient.  If you have a panasonic shaver with a cleaning base you are stuck buying these.  It is what it is...</li>
            <li> A great filter, that works great with my razor.  The water of the cleaner should be changed more often then this filter is changed.</li>
            <li> USED IT ONCE TO CLEAN SHAVER AND IT DRIED OUT, HAVE TO USE A NEW ONE EVERY TIME i CLEAN THE SHAVER.</li>
            <li> Its function is just what I needed, when it is received I am very satisfied, I will also recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this, you probably already have a Panasonic shaving system that uses this.  So you likely know how it works.  What you may NOT know is that this is available with Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34;...meaning you can save some bank AND eliminate the issue of running out at the wrong time.  Amazon sends you an email alerting you it&#x27;s coming, and you can decide at that point if you really need another box of these or not, based on your usage.  Great system, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These seem to wear out very quickly but they do clean well. I love the unit itself I just wish the cartridges would last longer.</li>
            <li> This cleaning solution works fine, but you don&#x27;t really need it if you have the cleaning station for this razor.  You can wash the razor very simply using liquid soap and water as explained in the shaver manual.  Then be sure to use the drying function on cleaning station as I think this helps prevent corrosion on the blades.</li>
            <li> These are great for refilling considering the price and quantity. I tend to refill sporadically depending on how bad I see the condition of cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t tend to clean my shaver after every use, I use soap and water after every shave, so I can spread out buying a package every few months. I love how it cleans because it looks like a brand new shaver every time. Glad I went for the HydraClean package as it cleans much better than I ever could.</li>
            <li> I received the cartridges in two days. They work well in my Panasonic cleaning base. I enjoy using the cleaning function of my razor.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, although pricey because you need to replace it often if you use it rather than cleaning your shaver with water.</li>
            <li> This does a nice job of keeping your razor fresh.  I use it every other day and each cartridge seems to be fine lasting a month.  If you rinse of your razor after use you won&#x27;t need to worry about clogging the cleaning device and filling up the cartridge with clippings, thus everything should work smoother and last longer.</li>
            <li> As an extremely practical person, I never thought I would submit to an automated cleaning system.  This product contributes to a perfectly clean razor each day that I use it, which has been more than 6 months.  This detergent/filtering system works extremely well to present a clean, comfortable shaver each morning.</li>
            <li> Even the most expensive of shavers can tear up your face if it&#x27;s just not meant for you. This one agrees with my husband and he is satisfied with the cartidges and their price.</li>
            <li> I can see why some reviewers talk about doing something else, that this is a ripoff.  And to a degree I agree, if you used this all the time, then you&#x27;re wasting money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash mine with liquid soap most of the time, then every couple weeks run it through a run with these, so my cartridges last me for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do as recommended by the manufacturer for self cleaning, where you run a line of liquid soap across the top of the razor, drop water drop by drop slowly around it (I just get my hands wet and hold my fingers pointing down so water drips), and let it foam up.  Does a great job of foaming up the little bits of hair out of it that you don&#x27;t get out just taking it apart and brushing it out and running water in it when it runs.  Then, after it&#x27;s done foaming, I just run it under fast running water, then take the top off and run it a little more, then let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that works well most of the time but it just runs better after I put it through a cycle with these every few months.  So for me, it&#x27;s not a ripoff since in addition to my own cleaning, using these has kept my razor running great and hasn&#x27;t cost me much at all.</li>
            <li> Before using the Panasonic WES035P Vortex Shaving System Solution Cartridge my Panasonic razor shaved beautifully, but I had to hold my breath while clearing the stubble from my face. Over the weeks the combination of sweat and whiskers led to a rancid odor that made me consider going back to shaving cream and a safety razor. Using the Vortex Cleaning system returned the electric shaver to the sweet smell of clean. If you own the Panasonic ES-93K razor, use the cleaning cartridges. Although a little pricey, unless you enjoy holding ypur breath every morning, these are a good investment.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these.  The refills are OEM and work perfectly.  They last about 30 days each, so don&#x27;t let your supply run out.  Wish they lasted longer or could be reused.</li>
            <li> These cartridges plug into the base/charging station and cleans/sanitizes the shaving heads.  It says you can use it for 30 cleanings or 60 days. To extend the life, I turn on the razor, and put the head into the stream from the tap.  I&#x27;d say that takes out 90 percent of the shavings from the head.  That being said, I&#x27;m surprised at how dirty the water/cleaning cartridge gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering with the Subscribe and Save makes them cheaper, and if I find I get them too often, I&#x27;ll temporary stop the orders.</li>
            <li> bought as a bundle to the Panasonic ES8243A shaver ( it was shown as an add on)... this does NOT fit this razor</li>
            <li> I like this razor.  I never get as close a shave as with a blade, but this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve found.  I recommend it to others.  I especially like the self cleaning function.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the right price and free shipping.  Better $ than W@LM@RT.  Does a good job cleaning and lubricating the razor.</li>
            <li> My review is abased on the cartridge that came with shaver &amp; since it does it&#x27;s job, I gather these will also.</li>
            <li> They work as described.  This is my second replacement set since owning the Panasonic E-whateverthemodelnumberis razor.  A cleaning always leaves my razor smelling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the cleaning process frightens the cat, but that is neither the cleaning station nor the cleaning cartridge&#x27;s fault.  It&#x27;s a cat.  They&#x27;re easily startled.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Shaving System does a good job of cleaning the razor.  Two things you should be aware of:  1.  The cleaning solution gives a distinct odor when you are cleaning the razor.  It is not offensive.  But it is strong, and may bother some people.  2.  The cleaning mechanism makes a lot of noise when you are cleaning the razor.  I have to shut the door, as it is quite loud.  The Braun cleaning mechanism is much much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally the cleaning cycle takes about 1 to 1.5 hours to complete.  So it can make quite a racket of noise for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of not cleaning and changing the cartridge enough. This meant that the cutting blades went dull before their time. Tip: Order two packs and get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  The design is proper and so it works properly.  Proper packaging and prompt delivery complete the deal.</li>
            <li> This item is not intended to work with the Panasonic model ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry shaver, even though it was grouped together on the website as often purchased together.</li>
            <li> Very thorough and effortless cleaning and lubrication of razor head.  Very satisfied with the razor.  Gives the best shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll need it for your cleaner. Eventually. According to the handbook thing that comes with the shaver, you can use the same cartridge for a long time if you just use soapy water to rinse your shaver before you put it in the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have had one razor that I loved. When that one died, I tried others. My son did a lot of research and he and my daughter bought me a Panasonic razor for Christmas. It works great! It works great because I can clean it everyday if I want too. And boy, do I want to.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 packs of these because of the price and convenience.  They arrived in a timely fashion and because I ordered three, there was no shipping charge!</li>
            <li> Basically, you do have to replace these things, if you don&#x27;t your razor will start to stink to high heaven. I keep my razor pretty clean with just liquid soap and running it under the water, however when using with the cleaning solution cartridge it does seem to make it work a little better as though it also lubes the blades. I stretch the cartridge out as long as I can and use it every two to three days when the razor doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good or the battery is down to 30% or so. I change it out when it starts to smell.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are needed to clean and lubricate the shaver. I could not find them cheaper anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This product is a good fit with the cleaning system of panasonic shavers. For first 5-6 times it works good but after that its just a piece of sponge.</li>
            <li> Not much of a review to write for this product. If you have the shaver, you will need to clean it. This product works.</li>
            <li> Unlike many other Shaver manufacturer&#x27;s, Panasonic HydraClean cartridges do not use alcohol.  This is great if you find yourself using the shaver immediately after drying, as you can avoid that alcohol burning sensation upon first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawback is that the cartridges really don&#x27;t clean all that well.  Most disturbingly, the solution leaves my shaver smelling like old towel (mildew) after every wash.  If you use the cartridge for the full and recommended 30 days of use, you will also see pink bacteria and mold growing on the lip of the cartridge opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only buy these cartridges because they&#x27;re necessary to use with the cleaning station.  But mitigate these drawbacks by rinsing my shaver under soap and water before and after every cleaning cycle.  Frankly, you shouldn&#x27;t have to do that if this cleaning system was designed correctly to begin with.</li>
            <li> This works great!  I&#x27;m the type to always clean my shaver, and this makes it some much easier.  This little cartridge is basically soap for your Panasonic Vortex Electric Razor.  These are getting really hard to find in the stores, and they&#x27;re cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product works well, it just doesn&#x27;t last the 45 days.  More like 25-30.  It does keep the razor nice and clean. Much better than traditional cleaning methods.</li>
            <li> This system tend to clog cleaner .drain after 3-4 uses. It also gives razor an Oder. I thing holding razor  under running hot water for 1 minute is faster,cheaper and better It drys in less than h1/2&lt;br /&gt;Goldie</li>
            <li> I bought the ES8434A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver and Amazon suggested that I by this article even though I didn&#x27;t need it!! I spent more than $ 10 for nothing!!</li>
            <li> Great price and quick shipping. Thank You for carrying this, my wife brought me razor for Christmas gift last year and cannot find these in any local stores!</li>
            <li> What can I say but it does it job very nicely and keeps my razor clean as a whistle. Nice</li>
            <li> To be honest, I really don&#x27;t know what else to say but that these just work great and they perform exactly as you would expect them to.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for several years and have been pleased with results. Will purchase again in the future. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to look for this filter for my shaver, and I couldn&#x27;t fine it. I&#x27;m glad that Amazon sells it. The filter fits perfectly and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I ordered a years supply of this product last Sunday March 31st.  I received the supply on Thursday by today March 4th.  The product was a great price and shipping was very very reasonable.  I will by again from AJ Wholesale in the future.</li>
            <li> I use this in the Panasonic cleaning stand about every 2 weeks, when the shaver needs recharging.  Depending on how you read the instructions, this one cartridge can last almost a year (based on 30 uses).  Panasonic seems to wish you would use it daily and replace it every month.  That seems like over kill and is wasteful.</li>
            <li> I just changed the cleaning cartridge for the 1st time and it was fairly easy. When I got the razor and set up the cleaner/charger it was a little bit awkward to install the cartridge. This time went much better and I&#x27;m sure it will continue to get easier each time I replace the cartridge. The cartridge lasted approx 30 days as promised. The cleaning/drying/charging cycle is a bit lengthy but this isn&#x27;t a problem for me. I previously used the Braun cleaning/charging system and the batteries in the razor failed prematurely. Braun&#x27;s warranty repair procedure was impossible to deal with so I switched to Panasonic and thus far I have been pleased with the razor and the cleaner/charger system.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS FROM THE FACTORY FOR THE VARIOUS PANASONIC ELECTRIC SHAVERS THAT USE THE HYDRACLEAN CLEANING SYSTEM. IT WAS FCTORY SEALED AND HAS WORKED AS MY OTHER FACTORY PURCHASED CLEANSING UNITS HAVE.</li>
            <li> I change this cartridge once a month and it does a good job of cleaning and lubricating my Panasonic razor.  I actually think it would last longer than a month but I find you run out of water in the reservoir by the end of a month so I just change the cartridge when I flush out and add new water to the reservoir.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure what this does, but it bitches like a mo-fo when its out.</li>
            <li> Made to fit the Panasonic charger, cleaner.  Easy to use, cleans the shaver well. Low wattage, inexpensive to operate.  Clear installation instructions.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic WES035P Vortex is not nearly as good as the reviewers say it is.  Surely, the razor does OK on the face but the big problem is that it does not shave closely on the neck or jaw, wet or dry.  It does a barely adequate job and I still have to take a blade to shave my neck and jaw to the usual smoothness.    I have a normal beard, nothing heavy.  The noise factor is not a problem    Do not buy this razor based upon the reviews.  It might be OK for some faces but not mine.  When I can afford it, I will purchase a higher end Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I tried to go without buying this replacement filter... but my electric razor got so dirty (got hair all over me as I would shave)... but as soon as I empty it, replace the filter and put it in clean mode.. whalla, no hair flying about when I shave! (the scruffy look might be more appealing than having hair all over your shirt!)&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I did find you can \\&quot;pretend\\&quot; to replace this filter at least once (just put same filter back in), and have it clean effectively (save a bit of $$).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it because I shave dry 99% of the time. I wish I had not bought this as part of the purchase package.</li>
            <li> I bought this three pack but I&#x27;m still on the first one that came with the shaver.  If you rinse the shaver before popping it in for a cleaning these cartridges last a very long time.  Nice that they are inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are hard for find in stores, so I was relieved to see that they were available to order through Amazon.  They arrived in a couple days after my order was placed and the first replacement has been working like a charm.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more from this.</li>
            <li> I always rinse my razor and screen after shaving so putting it through a cleaning cycle doesn&#x27;t really do much. I don&#x27;t change this cartridge very often, perhaps once every 6 months. I put the razor through a cleaning cycle every week but don&#x27;t think it gets any cleaner than just rinsing it after each use.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the panasonic nano 8109s a while ago. This is definately a step up from my old es8043, although both seem bullet proof.     If you was the turbo option with dishwashing liquid , in warm water, then do the cleaning in your bin, the cartridge should last months, depending on how heavy of beard you have.    I use a new fusion hard blade sometimes, but this is close, and over the long run, a money saver.    Easy to change out.     Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and no maintenance required.Mixes with water and cleans razor very good.Tabs that need to be removed for operation of the unit is easy to remove and they come off clean.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd panasonic shaver. My first one didn&#x27;t have a cleaning system. I had to clean it every now and then myself and i eventually broke it cuz i was too rough with it when i cleaned it. When i bought this one, it only came with 1 cleaning cartridge but it lasted a while... then got too icky looking so i bought these replacements. It cleans great . &amp; smells great after the self-cleaning .. i like my shaver &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always shave with my Panasonic electric razor. I enjoy wet shaving with a double-edged razor, shaving soap, badger hair brush, etc. but I don&#x27;t always have the time and I prefer to use my Panasonic when I travel. It&#x27;s no secret that Panasonic arguably makes the best electric shavers on the market (some Braun users would argue that point though I&#x27;ve owned Brauns and I prefer Panasonice Wet/Dry razors). I don&#x27;t own the latest greatest most expensive model razor. When I bought my razor three or four years ago it was top of the line. In any event, these razors are not inexpensive and I&#x27;m a stickler on taking care of them. I clean my razor after every other use and I change out this product monthly. I change the foil every six months and the blades, once a year. All the products are available through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this product worthwhile? It&#x27;s difficult to say with 100% certainty but the evidence is that it is. I notice, every month when I change it, that it&#x27;s fairly loaded with chaving hair clippings. After I&#x27;ve cleaned (and simultaneously charged) my razor if I take of the top foil so the blades are exposed, it always looks shiny and like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 60 years old and am on my third Panasonic razor. Each one has lasted at least ten years, as they should because they &#x27;aint cheap. I don&#x27;t know for sure if my routine of cleaning regularly and swapping out these cartridges each month is the reason I&#x27;ve had such great life out of my razors but &amp;#34;if the shoe fits...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy a Chevy Geo, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to spend much money maintaining it. If, on the other hand, you buy a Porsche, you&#x27;ll likely treat it like your special baby.  A cheap Norelco or Remington is one thing but the Panasonics I&#x27;ve bought have cost AT LEAST $250. I get a darn good shave with my electric. I am of the opinion that spending a few bucks each month to keep it in tip top shape is the reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these cartridges for my Panasonic razor from other retailers, but Amazon has the best price by far.  I love my razor and I take meticulous care of it.  These cartridges a key part of that process.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find abetter price anywhere.</li>
            <li> the product is great and the transaction for replacment cartridges was prompt.  wonderful experience.  would highly recommend both Amazon and the Panasonic electric Shaver</li>
            <li> Good product but manufacturer claims each cartridge lasts appx. 1 month.  I&#x27;ve never had one last past three weeks.  Big Panasonic fan but that&#x27;s very mis-leading.</li>
            <li> These refills are great at keeping my husbands Razer so clean.No need to clean it the old way.So glad I purchased the Panasonic razer that takes these cartridges.Easy to change also.</li>
            <li> They work great and I get about a month worth of clearing</li>
            <li> This was just what my razor needed.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything for this razor at any store.  I&#x27;m just glad it was a match and it wasn&#x27;t a waste of money.  I barely ever have to shave, so I only clean it once a month maybe less.  Great to have exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> How can you tell if they really do anything? I use them and my razor has been going fine for over two years now. The system is easy to use and these SEEM to work well. I will keep using them.</li>
            <li> I have this model shaver and my cartridges look nothing at all like this picture.  I need replacements for the wes035p but cant find them anywhere.</li>
            <li> This is the manufacturer&#x27;s product meant to clean the shaver.  It works perfectly.  Keeps the razor nice and clean after each shave.</li>
            <li> This is the best [[ASIN:B000BF1396 Panasonic WES035P Vortex HydraClean Shaving System Solution Cartridges for Men&#x27;s Shaver (ES8109S, ES8228S, ES8249S, ES-LA93-K, ES-LV81-K) (Pack of 3)]] available for Panasonic shavers that it supports. I doubt you could find a better Vortex Shaving system solution cartridge for shaver models ES8109S, ES8228S, ES8249S, ES-LA93-K, ES-LV81-K anywhere.  Of course I never use it. Since it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver you can just brush it clean with the brush that comes with the shaver and use some warm water if needed. The first time I bought the shaver I got the cleaning system with it. The next time I bought the Panasonic shaver model that is exactly the same but without the added cost of a cleaning system and they are both just fine and work great. Of course if you want to pay more it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use these cartridges. I bought 3 boxes and they last and last because I never use them. The cleaner system unit just takes up space so I keep it packed away.</li>
            <li> The shaver and cleaning system work well. I have used them daily for 5 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The refills worked. They shipped the next day. Overall I had a good experience. The price seems high for what you get.  Amazon was slightly less anyone else that had it.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to clean and lubricate the shaver. It seems to do so, the shaver seems to work better with using this than it does without.</li>
            <li> the whole system onley lasts about 3 months.  great shaver, lousy cleaning system.</li>
            <li> This razor is light years ahead of the Braun.  It haves much closer and quicker than the Braun.  I have owned two Brauns.  It is easy to clean and is waterproof.</li>
            <li> I have used the Braun&#x27;s cleaning system/shaver units before. They are quite expensive compared to this but had a fresh scent and better cleaned feeling. This one works for sure but didn&#x27;t like the scent very much (smells like a very hard/strong soap).But, definitely convenient than washing the shaver myself.</li>
            <li> Once again the product that I needed was available on subscribe and save.  The additional 15% discount sure makes a nice overall deal.  The Hydraclean system requires to be changed every 30 days or so.  It keeps the razor, a major expenditure in good working order.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I will use the self cleaning function again, just the recharging protion will be fine. I found that there was some very slimey mold growing in the chamber along with the soap, water and excess facial hair that is removed during the cleaning process. I don&#x27;t think that the slimey mold would affect my skin in a negative way but I have taken the safe stance on this one. I followed the directions as to when to change the cartridges and the mold came back a second time. No more mold for this guy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and I find it very good. I use it in my razor cleaning system and the razor is very clean when I take it out of its holder in the morning. It is easy to use and easy to replace when used up. It is very pleasant to have a clean razor when I need to shave. When the cartridges I bought recently are used up I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun shaver for several years until I was given this shaver as a gift. It is remarkable! I have used it for about a month and it works perfectly. It is like having a new shaver everyday. I highly recommend this shaver if you are serious about a clean, close shave - this is your unit!</li>
            <li> Great shaver. I always use a 3 or 4 blade Schick or Gillette, and  this shaver is very comparable. Not quite as good but close. A great  product.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we needed for half the price. Couldn&#x27;t find these at local store so checked here and woohoo</li>
            <li> these are great, and the price is right... my razor is always nice and clean and ready to work, and the best part is that I was able to setup a subscription for these puppys</li>
            <li> my husband and bro in law both like this product. Shaves good in shower..I think this is just the replacement cartridge but razor is good.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for over 3 years. Works well but doesn&#x27;t  last as long as the company says it should. This despite shaking the whiskers out before cleaning the razor. However the razor shaves so well that  this minor point doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Clean it. This is what you need to make your razor sanitary. This three pack is convenient and worth the money.</li>
            <li> we have used this product before, it&#x27;s just a replacement cartridge for Panasonic razor. One cartridge is gonna last probably about a month, depending on how ofter you&#x27;re using your razor. The thing I liked best about this product is that it came very quickly and it qualified for free super saver shipping, I was very satisfied with that, because last time I ordered it from Panasonic directly and took them forever to ship it, over a month.</li>
            <li> Makes me electric shaver operate like new. These are a must. I will definately buy again when i need replacements.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com sells these Panasonic electric razor cleaning cartriges for the best price anywhere. Shipping was quick and free. A good buy.</li>
            <li> I have used my Hydraclean Shaving System for a while and always like the fresh smell of the system but NOT these Cartridges.  For some reason the smell of cartridges are not fresh and good. I did not send them back but I am not going to buy any more either.  May be they are very old and stayed in their warehouse for years and kind of dried out since there is no expiration date on them I cannot be sure but the bottom line they are not good.  I may try to call amazon any way and write a follow-up</li>
            <li> The Panasonic cleaning system works pretty well - not as speedy as the Braun system, but it has some key advantages. Since the system uses water, you won&#x27;t have to deal with evaporation loss. Plus, as others have noted, you can use the cleaning base a couple times per week and greatly extend the life of the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since it is water based, there&#x27;s less packaging - the detergent is concentrated, and mixes with the water. Less plastic waste that gets chucked into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system does get the razor a bit cleaner than just washing with water (or liquid soap and water, as noted in the manual), adds lubrication and a nice fresh scent. I&#x27;ve found that using distilled water in the cleaning base eliminates the white residue from hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on sale occasionally, so watch the price and stock up on the price dips.</li>
            <li> Its cheap, and i can use it for almost two month</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for one year. The Cleaning Cartridge and Filter work well! I have found that if you pop the head of the shaver off after  shaving give it a quick rence the cartridge will last longer Just and Idea.</li>
            <li> As one that has decided a blade was just not cutting it anymore due to constant irritation, I have to say this one does a nice job of keeping me smooth enough for the wife, but not so close as to burn my face. The wet/dry is really nice and the first time I tried a wet shave, I actually got razor burn. I can use this razor every day with no problems and keep it clean with a quick rinse. As for charging...I haven&#x27;t recharged in almost a full month, so battery life is very good. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this product except that it works well with the Panasonic razor.  This razor is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;m sure the cleaning helps it do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Pros:  - Easy to install  - Actually cleans my device properly    Cons:  - Could be cheaper</li>
            <li> The HydraClean Cleaning Cartridge is really convenient, and does a great job. No more do you have to spend lots of time with a small brush and spray, cleaning out the individual cutter blades. Now, it&#x27;s just a quick tap after your shave, then once-a-week, do a more thorough job by placing the shaver in your HydraClean System, where it cleans, dries and recharges all-in-one. An excellent choice for your shaving needs.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement cartridge for the Panasonic shaver cleaning system. I like that my shaver is cleaned automatically every time I use it. The cleaning system is easy to use, and the cartridge is easy to install. Cost is very reasonable, under $3 per month if you sign up for a subscription with Amazon.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner and does what it is supposed to do.  Not earth shattering.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased replacement cleaning cartridges from this supplier.  Good price and prompt delivery.  I am always satisfied with these orders.</li>
            <li> Fantastic seller and excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes cleaning the heads such a breeze. Just slot it in and press start :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Cartridge is supposed to last around 1 month but in all honesty it will last much much longer if you simply give the shaver a quick 5 sec rinse under the tap before plugging it into the cleaning dock. You&#x27;d then get atleast 2 months out of the one cartridge.</li>
            <li> very good price for replacement solution cartridges. fits perfectly into my panasonic cleaning system. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I signed up for the automatic shipping of this item. It arrived on time in good condition. It is the correct refill cartridge for the shaving system I bought my husband. He still likes the cleaning system. The price is good and even better using the auto ship program.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item thinking it was the same as the one supplied with my shaver.  It is perhaps old stock. Panasonic said I should have bought it from them to be sure I obtained the correct cartridge.  Not worth fussing with a return so I hope it does not ruin the Panasonic shaver cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> My husband used an old-style manual face razor for many years. His hands began to shake and he was nicking his face. He declined my suggestion to try an electric razor. Finally, knowing that I could return it if needed, I ordered what looked like the best Panasonic electric razor that Amazon sold, for him. It only took one suspicious usage for his eyes to brighten and see his total amazement at how effective the electric razor is. He thanked me profusely for this wonderful product. It&#x27;s been 2 years and he loves the razor and uses it religiously. These replacement cartridges come in handy to keep it functioning perfectly.</li>
            <li> These work well, but they don&#x27;t last very long.  For that much money, they ought to last at least 1-2 months</li>
            <li> Not too much to write for this one.....Does exactly what it says it does...&#x27;&#x27;CLEANS&#x27;&#x27; LoL....This is a good cleaning cartridge and does last a long time with the Panasonic Razor. Thanks Amazon for the Fast FREE Shipping with my Purchase of the Razor along with these cleanin cartridges.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job just fine. It can get quite filthy quickly, so it needs to be watched for.</li>
            <li> These things work well, and are a necessity for your Panny razor. I do try to extend their life, and have had success in doubling effectiveness through judicious use. Only if they were cheaper would I give these cartridges a 5-star review.</li>
            <li> An essential part of the Panasonic Vortex shaver cleaning station. Returns razor to \\&quot;AS NEW\\&quot; condition after each use. A product well-worth using!</li>
            <li> The first ones I got with the razor only worked for about 15 shaves and I hope that they fixed this problem. I sent the razor etc back as directed I love the shave from this razor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think the cleaning unit is necessary.  Washing under the tap with soap I feel is good enough with this Shaving system.</li>
            <li> These keep the shaver clean.  Panasonic does it with filtered water while the shaver is recharging.  The filters are hard to find locally at Target, etc. so I purchased from Amazon.  Good price and fast delivery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still not sure that you need the cleaning of the heads; but did notice that the shaver seemed to shave smoother and closer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how best to review this product because there&#x27;s not much to say: You snap the thing in place once every month or so and then swap it out for a new one when the red light comes on. The cleaning system is pretty darn effective given the amount of dark stubble clippings that accumulate in the cartridge by the time you replace it. My biggest problem with these is of my own making--I tend to forget to order more of them and I inevitably find myself with a red light and no replacement cartridge. I did discover that if the red light is on and the base loses power (either due to a power failure or due to being unplugged), the red light will go out and the cleaning cycle will then operate. But the base will then clog and the water won&#x27;t drain (thankfully, it&#x27;s easy to clean it out after this happens). So I don&#x27;t recommend trying to stretch the cartridge life by cutting the power.    I see several reviewers have suggested the idea of stretching the cartridge life by washing the razor under the tap every other day. I don&#x27;t like to do that because I don&#x27;t like rinsing the hair down the drain lest it eventually clog.    Incidentally, I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries these because, as others have noted, they&#x27;re very hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth refill order we have made.  It continues to be a most satisfactory, reliable purchase as is our Panasonic electric self-cleaning shaver for which the refills are necessary and easy to install!</li>
            <li> Filter is very good... but not all that accessible if you wanted to purchase it someplace else..</li>
            <li> I love the shaver, and use it daily.  Every week I start the wash function and am amazed at how the solution cartridges release the cleaning fluid and returns it to the cartridge. Easy to insert, and I think they are priced at a reasonable rate.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleaner since I received my new shaver and it works just as advertised.  I change it once a week and I NEVER have any facial problems.  Another plus most shavers smell after awhile with this cleaner I never have that happen.</li>
            <li> Product works as it should and I think the shaver runs better than when cleaned with soap and water.  Would like to see better price, but not a surprise as you have no alternatives to choose from...</li>
            <li> Very good product............ Highly recommend this to anyone needing a soap replacement.</li>
            <li> I own both the Braun and the Panasonic self cleaning shavers.  The Panasonic works best for me.  The cleaning cartridges are a better design than the Braun being water based rather than alcohol based.  Less toxic for the environment, less weight and cost to ship, easier to dispose of, and bottom line, do a better job of cleaning the shaver because of the built in filtration system in the cleaning cartridge.  Shaver looks and smells brand new every morning and shaves as close as a blade.  Well done Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this item after Amazon offered it at a great price.  I had tried an electric many years ago and couldn&#x27;t handle the pain of it ripping the hair out of my face, so I went back to a blade.&lt;br /&gt;So I was a little afraid to try again. I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It works great in the shower, and is very comfortable to use.  The only complaint I have is that I cannot seem to find replacement blades or cleaning cartridges locally.  Not a big deal.</li>
            <li> So, these little cartridges do exactly what they claim to do: clean Panasonic shavers. They last a long time, they aren&#x27;t terribly expensive, and they are extremely easy to install and replace. So, why 4 stars instead of 5? Well, I see no reason to buy more. The cleaning accomplished by the Vortex system can be accomplished without cleaning cartridges. To clean most Panasonic shavers, first remove the outer foil and wash it under warm water (set it aside). Then, simply hold down the power button until the unit starts oscillating at a special, fast frequency. Run the oscillating shaver blades under warm water for 10-30 seconds and you&#x27;re set. The entire process takes about 60 seconds, so I do not see a reason to buy cleaning cartridges when I can clean my shaver just as well by hand.    Again, if you like the convenience of an automatic cleaning system, these cartridges are great. If you can afford the minute to clean your shaver yourself, spend your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> A great product.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this shaver system for over a year now and the blades are still sharp and the cleaner is still working as well as the first day it was used. No problems from this system. Very happy with it and it&#x27;s results!</li>
            <li> Good price,  cleans my razor,  I rinse my razor first,  gives me extra mileage out of these</li>
            <li> Got this as part of my fathers xmas gift. He loves it and still req more. I would def buy again.</li>
            <li> great product.  love the razor.  when you clean the razor under water to remove clippings, and then use the formula, I found I can easily get 60 days out of a single cartridge.</li>
            <li> I ordered the item, I blinked and it was there. I just started using this shaver and so far very impressed and the cleaning product seems to be great.</li>
            <li> I got these replacement Cleaning Packs in less than a week after ordering. I bought 3 packs at 9.99 apiece. I am still on the first one! My Panasonic Vortex Electric Shaver is the best quality shaver I&#x27;ve ever had - And I have the cleaning/recharging base. I only had 2 cartridges when I got the shaver, and ran out after 3 months. Now, I have almost a year&#x27;s worth of cleaner. These cleaning packs keep the shaver in pristine condition, they remove all the excess hair and water stains. Now that I know that they are here and can be bought, I&#x27;ll certainly be getting a whole lot more when I run out of my current supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some negative reviews of this item, and of the shaver. I must respond to those: You can use other cleaning agents, but they really don&#x27;t work well- There was a period of two years where I did NOT have any packs, and my Panasonic Shaver was very difficult to clean. The day I got these packs, I used them and my Vortex Shaver SHINED. The Cleaning system is SO idiot-proof, I am positive that those who made negative reviews, MUST have botched up the process somehow: 1) You stick a new Cartridge in 2) You fill the water tank up to the point specified in the storage area. 3) You CLEAN your Vortex. THAT is how easy it is, and when it&#x27;s clean it is CLEAN and LUBRICATED and not one hair is left in the Shaver and all buildups of scum are GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is not working for you as well as that? Then you did something other than the setup process I mentioned here.</li>
            <li> Does a good job makes it easy to keep your shaver running like new.  Get more mileage out of a cartridge by dusting razor before inserting into Vortex system.</li>
            <li> Started using the shaver for this and grabbed these cleaning cartridges at a very good price.  These are going for $16 at BB.</li>
            <li> Although I was initially skeptical about the value of Panasonic HydraClean charging base, after owning and using one for over a year now, I&#x27;ve been solidly sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I would tap out my razor after every shave, rinse it out about once a week with water, and then sterilize it before setting it out to dry. I can easily say that the HydraClean process saves me a lot of work each week! Although I still tap out my razer after each shave to extend the life of the cartridge, and empty and refill the water reservoir after each cleaning cycle to save on wear &amp; tear, it&#x27;s considerably easier to just drove my shaver in the HydraClean, press a button and walk away for a few hours than doing everything I used to do before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the HydraClean packs are slightly expensive for the functionality they offer, I find that Amazon&#x27;s discount, combined with the 15% off bonus offered for a subscription makes the value proposition much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I use this with the [[ASIN:B0021AG0Z6 Panasonic ES8249S Arc IV Nanotech Vortex Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Silver]] (which I have also found to be an excellent product).</li>
            <li> The title says it all.  The cartridge is expensive but it works just like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I love subscribe and save as I never have to chase around locating these.  The price is exceptional as well.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Did not like it being shipped by USP.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast ship.</li>
            <li> great product, purchased at the same time  of my panny electric shaver also just re-peated my order for another 3 pks price was fantastic</li>
            <li> The cartridges arrived quickly and worked well but didn&#x27;t appear to last as long as advertised. I would recommend these to anyone who needs the cartridges for the Panasonic cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Happy. Would highly recommend purchasing at time Shaver was purchased. Easy to install solution. Works very well.</li>
            <li> I signed up for the auto-delivery program and it&#x27;s nice getting a supply of these periodically.  They work well and the Amazon price is as good as I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> A necessary evil if you don&#x27;t want to clean it every day. A little cheaper than buying them direct from Panasonic. Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it completes the cleaning system of my Vortex. It works well and comes at a great price.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe that after buying a new razor it would be difficult to find the cleaning solution.  Everywhere I go, this item is out of stock.  Everywhere in Canada this item is hard to get.  I was happy to see it here on amazon at a good price.  You can buy enough here to save money and they last for months.  Just wish Canada had it more in stock.</li>
            <li> Good Product, keeps razor clean. Of course I wish I didn&#x27;t have to buy these, but Arc 4 is so good that it&#x27;s worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, works as designed.</li>
            <li> This cleaning cartridge is a no-brainer if you own a Panasonic Vortex shaver. These cartridges contain cleaners, cutting blade lubricants and a filter, to keep your shaver blades clean and in proper condition. They are very simple to install in the cleaning base; they last a month or so, are solidly constructed and they work very well. A plus for these shaver cartridges is that they work with just plain tap water; no alcohol-type chemicals are used here. You can choose to clean the blades with just ordinary soap &amp; water, which Panasonic says is an alternative, but I don&#x27;t recommend it unless you have to, such as when traveling, as you won&#x27;t be lubricating them and you allow the finely machined blades to be vunerable to whatever damage may befall them. This is a fine product and truly worth the price.</li>
            <li> Easy on the face (with shaving cream), a close shave, and quick.  Beats my Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li> The entire shaver cleaning system as well as the replaceable cartriges are junk.  They leak all over the countertop and I don&#x27;t think they do any better of a job cleaning the razor than just putting it under hot water with a little liquid soap.  I strongly recommend not buying this system or cartriges!</li>
            <li> I would rate this product a lot higher if the cartridges lasted longer. They claim that they last about a month with daily use but I can only get no more that half that much before they show to be empty. They do a good job of cleaning but just don&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my son and he loves it. he forgot to tell me he use the last cartridge and i ordered and we received it in 2 days</li>
            <li> This item works great with my Panasonic ES7056.  This cleaner is no gimmick.  It keeps my shaver working like new every single time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A great advantage over other brands is that it doesn&#x27;t use alcohol, rather a water-added substance that in the end leaves a pleasant scent (that you smell only if you put your nose right up to it). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Does what it promises...  and at 10 bucks for 3 cartriges?  It&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> The Vortex HydraClean System does a fantastic job of cleaning and preparing the shaver for excellent daily shaving. This is the best shaver and cleaning system I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Used regularly, product works as advertised.  Feels like I have a new razor after using the cartridges.</li>
            <li> Good cartridges and cheap. They worked exactly like I hoped that they would. They are great for the money and worth it.</li>
            <li> I needed some more cleaner solution refills for my shaver product and found this on amazon for a little bit cheaper than in the stores. Sure it might of been only 60 cents or so but that is still money saved. I also liked that it came in a 3-pack.</li>
            <li> Panasonic Has the best shaver in the world, and these little hydraclean filter cartridges put the icing on the cake. I use my panasonic auto clean charger every 2 days, these little filter packs do a fine job of cleaning my shaver.. sparkling clean and leaves my shaver smelling good in the process.. I use about one per month, a bargan and relieves my of the chore of cleaning my shaver every day. &lt;br /&gt;Thanks Panasonic</li>
            <li> Does what they are suppose to do.  I signed up for Subscribe &amp; Save to get the discount I will need replacements as long as I have my Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> For months I&#x27;ve searched for these cartridges in stores like Wal-Mart and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Those stores only seem to carry Gillette cleaners that are not compatible with my Panasonic shaver and sell each cartridge separately for about $10 or more. This particular product on Amazon comes with 3 cartridges for the same price. My Panasonic charging and cleaning station was quite overdue for a replacement cartridge and I did not remember how to properly install it. The 3 pack comes with clear illustrated instructions for a quick and efficient installation. I would highly recommend buying these replacement cartridges from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are priced well compared to what I had been paying on my older Panasonic model and clean the razor well.  No issues from me!</li>
            <li> These compact cartridges combine a filter and detergent and are inserted in the Panasonic shaver \\&quot;base station\\&quot; to effect automatic cleaning of the shaver. The manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation is to change the cartridge monthly. I followed this recommendation initially, finding that the filter became quite discolored with trapped beard cuttings by the end of one month. However, since the shaver is a wet/dry shaver, I found that washing the shaver head and the cutting blades after each use and before inserting the shaver into the \\&quot;base station\\&quot; allows me to extend the life of each cartridge to at least two months, making the economics much more favorable. I&#x27;m not sure how much extra benefit the auto-clean function of the base station provides, compared with just washing the shaver head and cutting blades under the tap, but I suppose the detergent in the cartridge contributes to a cleaner result.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the cleaning dock without these so I like them by default.</li>
            <li> Sold as a group of three when I put the electric shaver in my cart. The problem is I don&#x27;t have the cleaning system to put the cartridges into.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal as I used to have to purchase through Panasonic directly which was a bit more expensive and you really cannot go without these being changed.</li>
            <li> I generally take the razor apart and clean the pieces under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not real sure  exactly what this thing does.</li>
            <li> I have the [[ASIN:B000WIF2SU Panasonic Vortex Nano HydraClean System II - Silver]] shaver and these replacement cartridges are just what the doctor ordered.    My original one that came with lasted a while (few months, I don&#x27;t shave every day).  They leave it looking and feeling like new, and completely disinfected to prevent ugly razor burn or infections.      Works great, and the subscription option is neat.  Why pay shipping when you don&#x27;t have to, and can receive these every few months at an additional 15% discount.  Thanks Amazon since the store I bought this razor doesn&#x27;t sell the replacements!!!  absurd</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the Vortex cleaner cartridge to clean my Panasonic shaver.  However, this a poor technique of cleaning the Panasonic shaver head.  It continues to leave hair bits inside the head, and it is not as effective as simply turning on the machine and rinsing the head under running water and a little bit of soap.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have used this product for years and I really like it, I think you will to.</li>
            <li> The fact that I was offered these cartridges a few months after I had purchased the razor was great...linking that offer worked well, and the product performs well too.</li>
            <li> your mileage will vary on if you do any pre cleaning under running water but all in all I do like the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> what is there to say it&#x27;s a refill for a great shaver... It cleans it great!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a Panasonic Vortex HydraClean shaving system. I think this cleaning cartridge is very good. The system cleans my shaver very good and the cleaner that is used in this package seems to do a great job. I have only had this system for about a month,so I haven&#x27;t had to change the cartridge yet. I am very pleased with this product and happy to have purchased this  shaving system.I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
            <li> A week or so after buying it the cleaning unit broke down. Panasonic had me send it to Texas for repair. I called Texas twice to find out when they would return it and all you get is an answering machine that NEVER returns your calls. I have always   like Panasonic until now and it looks like it ill be NEVER AGAIN to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I mean, what else do you need? You need this thing to keep your shaver clean and this is exactly what it does. I must say that without the cartridge I had to put much more effort into cleaning the shaver so now I stocked up on them so that it does not bother me again.</li>
            <li> Cleanes very well, mine last for at least 6 weeks as I clean the blades daily myself after each use.</li>
            <li> Major Update 9/11/2012&lt;br /&gt;I just got a NEW shipment and need to clarify my previous, one star rating. The original cartridge order I receive back in February, 2012 had a date code on the bottom of 90724 (7/24/2009). They were 3 years OLD!! No wonder they had a bad odor to them. The ones I got from Drugstore.com a month later were dated 7/7/2011 (10707). And the ones I just got from Amazon this month are dated 5/29/2012 (20529)!! So I got a bad batch. Looks like Amazon is sending new product at great prices. Can&#x27;t beat the deal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridge that came with my shaver had the \\&quot;fresh smell\\&quot; that Panasonic advertises. But the package I just received from Amazon almost stinks. I notice that the box does not have the newer shavers listed, the ES-LV93 or the ES-LV81. I suspect that these are either very old or maybe a bad batch. Some reviewers say that are good, but I notice that a review by MAX, as well as several other complainers are fairly recent buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the second day, I can say that, during the drying cycle, the entire bathroom gets this stale, \\&quot;old soapy\\&quot; smell. (No, it&#x27;s not me, it&#x27;s the cartridge) These are horrible. Max returned his \\&quot;stinky\\&quot; cartridges and the replacement ones that he got also stink. I see a pattern here. Did Amazon acquire a bad batch? There are no markings on the box indicating lots, expiration dates, etc. Looks like a \\&quot;crap shoot\\&quot; as to whether you will get fresh ones, or these stale ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered from drugstore.com and cancelled my recurring order with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/9/2012 I just got a new box of these from DRUGSTORE.COM. Wonder of wonders, the box is a bit different. Still no expiration date! But the \\&quot;Fits Models\\&quot; has 4 additional models listed. ES7109, ES8109, ES8249, and ES-LA93!! Also, the list if ingredients has grown. Sodium nitrite has been added. I have no idea if that affects the products smell or freshness. Both boxes listed \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; as an ingredient. Oh, and the instruction sheet has added Brazil as a country/language and has grown by 2 pages as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Amazon apparently is selling some very, very old packages of the shaving solution cartridges. Maybe not all of them, but the ones MAX and I got are \\&quot;stinky\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered just as it was described. It was shipped on time and I am already using the product regularly. This product is hard to find in stores but if i can continue to order it for this price and get it this quick I will.</li>
            <li> Have used replacements from here since getting the razor- very happy with the self cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this product broke my shaver.  Installed the first cartridge and now my razor doesn&#x27;t self clean anymore.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this to clean this shaver and it works fine. He&#x27;s used these for as long as he has had his razor and we have not had any problems with them.</li>
            <li> Was looking for replacement cartridges and these were the right price and the same exact ones the store sells for so much more! Fits and does the trick! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good price for what you get.  Wish they lasted longer and the soap cleaned a little better. But I guess that is how most things are.</li>
            <li> Factory cartridge to work with my Panasonic shaver.  I have found they last about the same no matter if you clean your razor every day or every few days.  Very easy to swap out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these cartridges for a few years and they&#x27;ve worked well in the past.  The last shipment I received were dried up and were not effective.  I wonder if you can get fresh cartridges anymore.  This purchase was a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Some reviews claim there&#x27;s an odd smell instead of the slightly-lemon scent that&#x27;s expected.  Not a problem here -- these are just fine.  They definitely make a difference versus the period of time when I was out of the refills and was rinsing the razor myself.  Granted, I&#x27;m no razor-maintenance expert, but the shave following use of the cleaning system seems smoother, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with a fresh scent from the razor either.  Thanks to Prime shipping, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to &#x27;stock up&#x27; either - order as needed.  Decent price, great delivery as usual.</li>
            <li> Replacing these cartridges on a regular basis really keeps my razor performing at its best.  The three-packs are really economical and no more expensive than the blades that I was purchasing for my old razor.</li>
            <li> The filters work as advertised, but really don&#x27;t last long before clogging up.  I think I will just use regular tap water and soap to clean from now on.</li>
            <li> Shaving every morning with a clean razor is quite a treat. These cartidges (used by the [[ASIN:B000PJXS0K Panasonic ES8077 Linear Shaver with Vortex Hydraclean System]]) mean you get this great feeling without spending a lot of money. At only $5 each, or only $0.17 per day, this is an absolute no-brainer! Keep a box on hand so you never have to do without!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Vortex shaves really close.  However, one hidden expense is these cleaning cartridges.  But they do keep you electric razor really clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a spare for the electric shaver.  I don&#x27;t like to not have one available when the time comes for my husband to replace it.</li>
            <li> We all purchased the shaver knowing we would need these so I don&#x27;t know why some are complaining of the price. It wasn&#x27;t a hidden expense. You knew the information up front and could make a decision as to the annual expenses this would incure. Besides, the price has dropped on them in the past few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cartridges themselves, there are no generics on the market. They are priced cheaper than the Braun cartriges I had been using. They are also not an alcohol based cleaner and therefore does not evaporate like the competitions. They can last much longer if you use the cleaner every other day and rinse off in the sink the other days. Depending on use, many could use the sink most of the week and the cleaner every 3 days or so. Not an option with most of the competition. This extends the Panasonic cartridges life well beyond the alcohol based systems. I am on the road out of state 2 weeks of every month and I was changing the Braun clean and renews every 30 days. Seems as though I would replace the Braun cleaner, use it that week, leave for a week, and come home to an empty system. Not anymore. HydraClean doesn&#x27;t evaporate, makes it much more economical per cleaning, and only costs pennies per day in comparison.</li>
            <li> Panasonic WES035P Vortex HydraClean System for Men&#x27;s Shaver (ES8109S,...Works very well cleaning the razor. My husband says shave is much smoother after cleaning.</li>
            <li> I bought these cartridges as replacements for the Vortex HdydraClean module that is part of my Panasonic ES8109 Electric Shaver. These cartridges are much cheaper than the cartridges I had to buy when I owned a similar Braun system. Hands down, this Panasonic Shaver has been the best electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I bought my shaver ES8109 in March 2011 and extremely happy (separate review for the shaver). I agree with other reviewers that the cartridges last much longer if you simply put a little liquid soap over the foil after each shave, turn on the turbo mode (press the shaver&#x27;s ON button for 3-5 seconds), allow it to run for 20 secs then rinse the foil &amp; shaver blades under tap water (this is per the instruction manual). Then I lightly blot away the water droplets on the shaver with a microfiber towel and put the shaver in the charger in the dry mode only. I use the full clean/dry/charge mode once every 4-5 shaves or 15 days since I shave twice a week. I&#x27;ve not experienced any foul smell whatsoever and the cartridges last much longer (4-5 months). Other reviewers are correct about the low humming noise while charging, drying or cleaning. Doesn&#x27;t bother me, as I leave for work after shaving. The cartrdiges are very cheap, as another reviewer said, it costs max. about $0.10 per day...in my case $0.03/day! Overall this shaver and the cartridges are the best.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying this product again from Amazon. The Panasonic Vortesx HydraClean Shaving System solution cartridge is an excellent way to maintain my shaver and protect my face.</li>
            <li> Great price. I have had the Panasonic shaving system for several years now. Still working. Cleans and keeps my razor going.</li>
            <li> Works, but doesn&#x27;t get everything from the shaver head.  Have to occasionally go in with a Q tip and clean the build up of crud</li>
            <li> Never had an issue with the cleanliness of my razor when using the Vortex cartridges.  Cheaper than Braun cleaning cartridges also.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, make the switch.</li>
            <li> It is easy to install. I cannot tell if the solution inside is up to par. Try it it works.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement and fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It seems like most of these reviews are more about the shaver than the product. Is the cleaning cartridge necessary and are there less expensive ways to clean your shaver? Maybe, maybe not. But don&#x27;t give the cartridges a lower rating based on that. I put off buying new cartridges for months, but finally caved. Boy am I glad I did. My shave improved infinitely immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges do exactly what they claim to. They do a great job of cleaning my shaver and 10 bucks for three is a steal considering they last for a couple months. Panasonic recommends changing them every month, but I can usually last a bit longer without my shave suffering much. I&#x27;m also glad the cartridge fits so many different models. It would be extremely annoying if I had to search for a specific type and then probably pay more since it wasn&#x27;t standardized. But for $10? I definitely can&#x27;t complain. I don&#x27;t understand why people are complaining about the price and product life. You bought a $200 shaver but can&#x27;t afford $10 every six months to keep it nice and in good working condition?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, mini-rant over. Overall this works great and lasts a long time. Definitely worth it for the price. Very easy to install with the included directions. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year, and this was my second purchase to cover another year.  My razor is always clean, and I don&#x27;t have to spend any time doing it.</li>
            <li> I bought Panasonic Shaver before Christmas to give to my son.  It calls for these cartridges and he says the they are great!!</li>
            <li> These cartridges look like something Panasonic added to their charger/washer in order to make a few extra bucks. I decided to try an alternative: hydrogen peroxide.    After your first included cartridge is &#x27;used up&#x27; (the soap only lasts a few weeks before it gets smelly), just fill empty out the reservoir and fill it with hydrogen peroxide (which you can get at the drugstore for a dollar or two a bottle). I&#x27;ve gone through a few cycles with the peroxide and it works great - the razor head is just as clean, if not more clean, than with the soap, which always made it smell kind of mildewed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HAVING THIS PRODUCT AS IT PROLONGS THE USE OF MY RAZOR BLADES IN THE ELECTRIC RAZOR. (PANASONIC)</li>
            <li> For all Panasonic razors with Vortex cleaning system, these refills are unavoidable. It makes sense to have some on stock...</li>
            <li> you have to buy these replacements for the shaving machine, they have the gel inside and shaving goes super smooth with this.</li>
            <li> Keeps my razor clean and ready to use. I would recommended this product to all that has this type of razor</li>
            <li> Works fine on razor about three times a week. Sure beats doing it by hand.  TR</li>
            <li> Works perfect,  delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Have to keep cleaning out the drain-hole at the bottom of the cleaning unit (poultry lacer needle) and removing the &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; build-up that collects on top of the fibers at the oval opening of the cartridge. The HydraClean unit could be a little more robust.</li>
            <li> Genuine new cartridges for Panasonic Shaving system, all is OK.&lt;br /&gt;Three units in the box with paper instruction. Made in Thailand.</li>
            <li> Its a 3 pack and i use it once a week on the weekends... its been almost couple months and still on the 1st cartridge and cleaning very well still.</li>
            <li> Have a Panasonic LV-81 shaver.  Formerly a Braun shaver user, and liked their cleaning cartridges - they would last for 30 uses.  I recorded my use of several of these things, and over a year, each one will only last about 6 cleanings.  Called Panasonic about it, and they have no similar complaints.  Hard to believe.  For the first 5 cleanings or so, it does clean the shaver well.  But these shavers are also really easy to clean under running water, so these are really a luxury.</li>
            <li> If you have Panasonic&#x27;s razors - then this is the integrated cleaning system you are stuck with. Unlike the Braun series, which has an alcohol based cleaning solution premixed in the container, this is a dry solution that you add water to via a basin in the cleaning machine. Overall - it works ok - The Braun cleaning system tended to work a bit better - but the Panasonic razors are better for me. Use Amazon subscription service to get the best price.</li>
            <li> Works like it is suppose to do and keeps my shaver nice and clean.  I bought a years supply and am just about ready to order more.  If you like your shaver and want to keep it clean like when you bought it then you need to keep using the cleaner system.</li>
            <li> The Braun system is far superior.  These cartridges don&#x27;t last anywhere nearly as long as asserted in the promotional materials.</li>
            <li> It is convenient to clean your razor this way, but does not clean the best. Also the cleaning unit itself seems to get dirty and requires separate cleaning.</li>
            <li> a little pricy, but sometimes you just have to bite the bullet.. wow, it won&#x27;t take my comments without more words....</li>
            <li> Replacement cartridges for the razor, I had no issues. Recommend cleaning the bay were the razor sits in between cartridges, mine was dirty. It prevents the filter from clogging as quick</li>
            <li> Every product is trying to become an annuity income stream for the manufacturer. You don&#x27;t need these cleaning cartridges Take the shaver head off and flush the foil and blades under hot running water, reassemble and automatically fan dry in the shaver base. The blades will be washed in clean water every time, unlike the hairy oily bath which the second week of cartridge use will give.</li>
            <li> My hubby has not tried this one yet. But if it cleans like it shaves. This product would have to be good too!</li>
            <li> Bought shaver for my ill husband.  He would not let me use it on his face.  Therefore, I started using it.  Love it.</li>
            <li> These are genuine Panasonic and the price from Amazon can&#x27;t be beat.  Excellent product and I have never had a problem with any I have bought over the last several years.</li>
            <li> Still a one star. Product shipped, which was ordered May 2014, expired in September 2013. Mailed me expired product which explains why it was dried out and of no use.</li>
            <li> These are original accessories.  I purchase them for lowest price, cheap shipping.  The fit and work well because they are manufactured by Panasonic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a soap cartridge..nothing to really rate on. Wish it has a aftershave smell added to it to make it seem fresh.</li>
            <li> These cleaning cartridges disinfect and clean the shaver head.  The product works very well but is not outstanding (more solution and better cleaning is needed).</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is easy to use, and the cartridge is easy to install!Glad to have found them these were cheaper than local stores and did what they were supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The subject cartridges do the job very well and last about a month each. Very easy to install and replace.</li>
            <li> This product worked to perfection. I&#x27;ve gone a couple of months without using it and found my shaver was lagging with a smooth cut. After using a new cleaning cartridge, the performance of my shaver dramaticly increased. I&#x27;m very pleased and will use it again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  I own the ES8078 and used the cartridges for a while.  Until I figured out that you will get a 10,000,000 x cleaner razor ( that foul odor that never seems to go away) and  10,000,000 cleaner shave if you simply remove the blade and place both the blade and the razor in your dishwasher.  If you have a holder with a lid it will help (obviously) with the loose blade.  But try it!!  I have had the closest shave since I purchased the razor, AND it doesn&#x27;t smell anymore!!</li>
            <li> Keeps the shaver very clean. There is residue from the daily shaving cream. It also makes the blades last longer</li>
            <li> Used these many times before, works great, cleans very well</li>
            <li> Razor is clean and feels good after being run through the charge / clean cycle. I do wish these lasted a little longer, but still good for what it is.</li>
            <li> Since this product is to clean the Wet/Dry Shaver I use, I just clean mine off in the shower.</li>
            <li> Same as the one that came with the new shaver.  I would have preferred a way to use some type of common household cleaner or solvent rather than having to periodically buy a captive cartridge at whatever high price the choose to charge.</li>
            <li> it works with the Panasonic system and there is no choice of cartridges to use. You cannot compare any other brand as none other will fit. you are stuck using these whether they work or not.</li>
            <li> It does what it says, I don&#x27;t use it after every shave as that would be expensive and I think unneeded!</li>
            <li> When you wash your Panasonic Shaver with this cleaning system it will look ilke brand new! Must have for Panasonic Hydra Clear Systems.</li>
            <li> These are the only choice if you got the complete shaving set from Panasonic, Buying the shaver, which by the way is excellent would suffice, since you can use it with water, and consequently can be thoroughly cleaned under the faucet stream of water.</li>
            <li> It was hard to spend alot for a razor but reviews had been basically pretty good so gave it a fly--and am very happy so far.  My beard isn&#x27;t very heavy but still have to get rid of the grey stubble--shaves very close--the battery seems to last a long time--went almost 3 weeks b4 I figured it should get charged.  Cleaning system works good but noisy--haven&#x27;t used it in the shower---yet</li>
            <li> Bought this product with 3 cartridges and it was worth the buy. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  The price was great and set up on automatic order to save even more money!  Really love this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a nice clean detergent refill for your panasonic shaver. If you already use the cleaner, you know how much it helps to keep it clean and smooth. It&#x27;s a nice detergent because it has so little scent and is NOT alcohol-based.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to remove and install from the Panasonic washer device. Highly recommended for a clean, sanitary electric razor.</li>
            <li> Bottom Line Up Front: Super easy and convenient and cleans the razor more thoroughly than I was ever able by hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;* Super easy to use just pull the two plastic tabs off and insert into the base station and your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;* Cleans the razor really well. I used to try and clean all the intricate parts by hand using q-tips and paper towels. I do not recommend this method. It worked okay, but never got the razor totally clean. These cartridges do just that.&lt;br /&gt;* Cartridge supposedly will make your blades and foils (mesh cover) last longer. Will update with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;* The cartridge would definitely not last an entire month (as advertised) if you shave and use the cleaning function daily. It does however last longer than that if you rinse it by hand and only use the base station / cartridge to clean it every few days. I have been using the same cartridge for almost two months using this method.&lt;br /&gt;* Pretty noisy. My bathroom is attached to my bedroom and I need to make sure to remember to do this in the morning before I leave for work. No way could I sleep with that thing running.</li>
            <li> If you own this razor these are essential for keeping it in good working order. They have to be replaced every two months or so or it gets very stinky. Easy to use, just remove old cartridge and pop in a new one.</li>
            <li> Needed to keep my razor nice and clean, when changing these you can see how much is trapped in the sponge. Wish there was a way on cleaning the main compartment.</li>
            <li> The solution cartridges came in a pack of 3. Each one lasts a year if you clean your shaver once a week. It does a great job cleaning the shaver</li>
            <li> however, I&#x27;ve worn a full beard for many years and only use my Panasonic Vortex shaver on my neck so my experience is hardly typical. Like others here I don&#x27;t put my shaver through a cleaning cycle every day (more like once a week) but do rinse it under the faucet daily and I find that a set of cartridges lasts me about a year that way. Going to try the dishwasher trick that someone else here recommended.</li>
            <li> If you just put the shaver in the cleaner, it does not last 30 cleanings, at least for me - and that is consistent (after 17 to 21 cleanings, the red light comes on). I suppose if I took the extra time to pre-clean before cleaning, then it would last longer. But, that adds time I do not have, and the whole point was that it was supposed to be you just drop in and it cleans. The Braun one did last a real 30 cleanings. The problem seems to be the way the cleaner works. Because it is a dry powder that water is pushed through, it clogs at the top. I can see there is plenty of soap under the top, but it is clogged at the top with hair. So, assume you will get less time unless you clean the shaver 1st or you have slow beard growth.</li>
            <li> I replace these every couple months when I think of it because I&#x27;ve yet to see an indicator go off telling me I should do so.  This is probably because I rinse the shaver after every use, so there isn&#x27;t maybe so much to clean.  Nothing to complain about, seems to do its job, reasonable price.  Hurrah!</li>
            <li> These are great for freshening up my PANASONIC ES LA93, simply rinse the surplus hairs off under the tap, place this in the charging unit and Bob&#x27;s your uncle :-) By rinsing off excess hairs the cartridges last considerably longer and leave the shaver fresh and sparkling. this makes for a more effective, closer shave. The ES LA93 is simple the best electric razor out there</li>
            <li> These cartridges are great, do what they are supposed to do, and are shipped conveniently to me via the Subscribe and Save program.  I enjoy having a clean razor, and these do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replace the cartridge once every other month, because I shave every other time using some body wash.  This helps keep the razor clean in between cleanings with the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> A necessity - I like that they work well - but you don&#x27;t really have a choice in the matter, do you? You are locked into buying this specific cartridge.</li>
            <li> Great package of cleaning solution. 3 replacement cartirdges gives me plenty of cleaner.</li>
            <li> After trying to refill the cartridge manually (a messy mistake) I decided to buy these instead. One cartridge lasts me about 4 months so I only need to buy them once per year; so a little too long to use subscribe &amp; save with them. However, this has been working great so I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> This cartridge set was received promptly and is a great accessory to my Panasonic electric shaver. It keeps the shaver clean and fresh in conjuntion with the charging/cleaning dock.</li>
            <li> Works good but kinda on the pricey side.  I haven&#x27;t ordered any more.  Just used liquid soap in the sink.</li>
            <li> These cartridges work great on the two Panasonic shavers I currently use.  Easy removal and installation in the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> Replacement cartridge leaks and does not fit.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say about cleaning cartridges for an electric razor. I put them in when the light turns red on my razor&#x27;s cleaning base and when I take the old one out it has a bunch of hair all over it, so I presume it&#x27;s doing something. I haven&#x27;t had any noticeable issues with these cartridges out of the dozens I have gone through.</li>
            <li> just ordered refills have been using the product for years now -- seems to work fine versus just washing the shaver off under the  faucet</li>
            <li> These cost Panasonic virtually nothing to make, but they work at keeping your shaver clean. The problem is that the HydraClean Shaving System, aka the charger base has a known defect which causes premature failure. For this reason, the cartridges reviewed here are useless when the charger base itself no longer works. I&#x27;ve now gone through 3 charging bases, all breaking in less than 6 months. My son has had the exact same thing happen to his. While the base continues to charge, the problem that both of us have encountered is that the base in which you place the shaver has a tendency to leak after just a few months of use. When I first called Panasonic on this issue, they sent me a free replacement. When I called them for a third replacement, they refused to do so. I purchased one on eBay, only to have it break within a few months. Now that I&#x27;m in the market for a new electric shaver, I&#x27;ll look at models other than Panasonic, as I don&#x27;t want to deal with this nonsense again.</li>
            <li> Shipping should be free.&lt;br /&gt;Messy when filter needs to be changed.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy that type razor again.&lt;br /&gt;Filters don&#x27;t last long enough</li>
            <li> Good Value on time delivery.</li>
            <li> Cleaning product works reasonable well, but expensive add-on to the cost of the razor.</li>
            <li> As always, these arrived nice and quick. The HydraClean system is awesome, and so easy to use! If you&#x27;re looking for a great razor at a great price, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed. The clean system by Brawn is better .. n my opinion. it lasts longer and does not have a funky smell.</li>
            <li> This cleaning cartridge is so hard to find except for online. The shipping was fast,much to my delight, and the product was exactly the item I was looking for -at a fair price! Love it!</li>
            <li> I meant to purchase only a shaver, but Amazon recommended that it would go great with my shaver.  It is useless because you need the Vortex cleaning system which my shaver doesn&#x27;t need.  So this item is useless to me and it would cost me more to return it than to just keep and throw it away.  Make sure you have the Vortex cleaning system before buying this item.  This is a 1 star because of Amazon&#x27;s mistake in recommending it.</li>
            <li> Although the life of these things are really around 2 weeks if you use them daily, they do make the razor fresh.  Worth it if you like a &amp;#34;sanitized razor.&amp;#34;  Washing the razor with soap and water does the same thing though for no money :)</li>
            <li> These cartridges work just fine -- for about a week.  Then the red light comes on.  They&#x27;re supposed to last for a month or so, but they sure don&#x27;t last that long for me.  I wish I&#x27;d bought the razor alone and forgotten about the cleaning system.  It would be fine if these cartridges worked as advertised, but $3.33 for a week of cleaning is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I use these because there&#x27;s really no other option for my Panasonic Shaver. You can make them last a bit longer by cleaning the hair out of the shaver before putting it in the stand for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Technically you don&#x27;t even need these cartridges since you can just use liquid soap to clean the blades.  But every once in a while I like to clean my Panasonic shaver with the HydraClean system which keeps it nice and fresh.  At $7.95 per 3 pack(using Amazon subscription), I&#x27;m sold.  These puppies last me about 9 months anyways since I use liquid soap to clean it every other day.</li>
            <li> Extra cleaning cartridges are a good thing to have.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand that the shaver was over $300 and then have to buy this cleaner every 3 months. Nice idea but expensive for consumer.</li>
            <li> These are great to use and also a great price. The Panasonic razer is really a great one and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This solution seems a little bit too expensive for me, since one can make one from water and soap, according to the shaver&#x27;s instructions.</li>
            <li> The product is great. You get more than you pay for. Quality is outstanding, easy to use. Just be careful and don&#x27;t tip it over.</li>
            <li> This keeps my Panasonic electric shaver clean.</li>
            <li> replacements... works like a champ</li>
            <li> It goes with the shaver above</li>
            <li> buen producto, justo lo que necesitaba para mi maquina de afeitar</li>
            <li> Works well with my Panasonic Shaver Cleaning System. Replacements are cheap and keep my shaver clean and in good working condition.</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacement cartridges for my razor as the factory ones were used up. They leave my razor clean and smelling fresh after every cleaning. Would highly recommend and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I only need to use the cleaning cycle once a week to keep any unpleasant smell away, so one cartridge lasts a couple of months. This cleaner is the most effective and lowest cost alternative (other than soaking in rubbing alcohol) that I&#x27;m aware of for this shaver.</li>
            <li> These little cartridges may be small, however, they are fully equipped and capable to do battle with whatever your shaver has gotten itself into. The solution is refreshing and smells great, believe me, you wouldn&#x27;t want to shave your face if you had run out of them. So be sure to stock up and buy as many as possible you wouldn&#x27;t want to go without.</li>
            <li> The cartridge is the same as bought in the store, only cheaper.  The cartridge works like it is supposed to.  Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with them, and they do the job.</li>
            <li> They say this cleaning agent has something to do with the sharpness of the razor, but the real review goes to the shaver itself more than the cleaning agent.  This is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It is as close as a hand razor and can be used wet or dry!</li>
            <li> Delivered and works as promised.</li>
            <li> This really does a great job of cleaning your shaver. I use it on my Panasonic LV-81K and it cleans perfectly. I only use it once a week though and not every day because I don&#x27;t have a thick beard so I will brush the clippings out with a brush once a week also. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> These cartridges do a great job of keeping your razor clean, however I have discovered that they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as they claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system has a fairly large reservoir that you fill with water, which is in turn run through the soap in these cartridges to clean your razor. On my unit the red light goes on after just one to two weeks of use (even though there is still over 75% of the water in the reservoir).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer here stated it seems that the soap and water itself is fine, but over time the cartridge gets clogged up with hair particles. If you remove the cartridge you will see that it has a filter material in the top which acts to capture the hairs from the dirty water. I suspect that the life of this filter really depends on the thickness and quantity of hairs that you shave off. I have not followed the other reviewer&#x27;s suggestion of cleaning out the cartridge with running water and then trying to use it again, but I plan to do so once the red light turns on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current solution to extend the life of the cartridges is to actually remove the top of the razor after each use and shake out all the loose hairs into the sink. This minimizes the number of hairs that are actually getting into the cleaning cartridge. It takes a few extra seconds but still saves time versus having to clean and dry the razor manually.</li>
            <li> These replacement cartridges work well, are cheaper (and smaller footprint) than the Braun Clean &amp; Renew cartridges I used to use with a Braun shaver. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the stale water is pretty nasty when it comes time to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I found that manual soap &amp; rinse cleanings do the same thing, so I&#x27;m not sure why I still buy these cartridges....either way, they&#x27;re effective and inexpensive. I dump the stubble before starting an automatic cleaning.</li>
            <li> This solution makes your Panasonic razor work like new.  Amazon has the best price and you can save even more if you purchase with the replacement inner blade and outer foil.  Buy all three together and you will restore your razor to like new performance.</li>
            <li> My husband is thrilled to get his favorite razor back in working condition.</li>
            <li> Not a great value.  instead, just rinse your Panasonic shaver in a saucer of warm water and a little hydrogen peroxide for 20 seconds.  It is a wet/dry shaver after all.  Then, lubricate your shaver with a light oil.</li>
            <li> I knew when I bought this self cleaning razor that Panasonic would continuously gank me on the cleaning cartridges.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like the razor and the self cleaning system, but as I expected the price of the cartridges keeps going up and up and up.  I don&#x27;t blame Amazon, it is Panasonic to blame because a quick online search will show that it is not just Amazon that is rasing the price on this.  Still, if you&#x27;re stingy with replacing it you can get maybe 1.5 to 2 months out of a cartridge which means you&#x27;ll be blowing a bit less than a Ulysses S. Grant each year on this shaving system. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Still, with all that said, I&#x27;m ordering my semi-anual refill today... cha-ching.</li>
            <li> I have looked around for this product and can&#x27;t find it.  The Panasonic site charges too much for shipping.  Just ordered enough for free shipping on Amazon and now I don&#x27;t have to think about ordering more for a while.</li>
            <li> Vortex HydraClean Cartridge cleans my shaver great and I recommend this product. One cartridge last through alot of cleanings, which I like.</li>
            <li> As I said in my review of the razor, this is just a great razor and cleaning system.  I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year.  The cartridges last longer than advertised (kind of like changing your oil in your car every 3 months)...but I also cheat a little and usually clean my razor under water when I&#x27;m done shaving and only run it through the system every 2-3 days.  Easy to use.  Great system.  The price / availability is the best on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Would it not be great if your car can wash itself, change its oil, and refill its own gas tank?  How about your clothes?  Do they wash, dry, and fold themselves?  Man, life would be so much easier if they did!  This is one area where electric razors are ahead of cars.  Ever since Braun came out with their \\&quot;clean and charge\\&quot; system, it seems that razor manufacturers have found ways to make razors maintain themselves with very little effort on the user&#x27;s part.  Panasonic&#x27;s system is called Hydraclean.  This review is about the cleaning cartridge for the Panasonic Hydraclean system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to write about the cleaning cartridge without mentioning the Hydraclean system.  After all, together they make up the cleaning system.  One is only as good as the other.  Let me say that the cleaning system does exactly what it claims to be able to do.  It cleans, lubricates, dries, and recharges the electric razor automatically.  The Panasonic system uses a very sophisticated process to do this.  Instead of simply pumping  liquid cleaning fluid from the cartridge to the razor stand, this Panasonic uses a solid detergent.  The Panasonic WES035P is a solid detergent block with a small filter.  The cleaning stand has a small, removable water tank.  The cleaning system dissolves the detergent with the water, and then the water is pumped upwards to the razor.  The razor is inserted upside down in the cleaning stand, by the way.  At that point, the razor is cycled on and off.  The liquid mixture washes away debris and captures them in the filter.  After a set time, warm air circulated around the razor heads to speed up drying time.  The detergent leaves behind a film of lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun system uses an alcohol-based liquid.  It also does a fine job of maintaining your razor.  However, the alcohol has a tendency to evaporate, whether you use it or not.  As soon as you open the seal on the cartridge, its useful life starts evaporating away.  The Panasonic system does not evaporate, and you only use up its life when you actually clean the razor.  So the Panasonic system does have its advantages over the Braun.  The Braun cleaning stand is also sensitive to being moved, as the liquid can spill out of the cartridge.  The Panasonic system is less-susceptible to that, since the cleaner is in solid form and the water tank is capped.  However, you do have to change out the water in the tank.  You can empty out the tank every time you replace the cartridge.  And if you live in an area where the water is hard, I recommend that you not use water straight from the tap.  You might want to buy a gallon of distilled water to refill your tank, which should last for over a year if you change out your cartridge each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Panasonic Hydraclean system.  It makes maintaining your razor a breeze.  It does not get easier than this.  The solid detergent that comes in the cartridges do have advantages over alcohol-based cleaners.  And the price is very reasonable.  I \\&quot;subscribe\\&quot; here at Amazon.  The plan is for me to have a three-pack shipped to me every three months.ate, and you only use up its life when you actually clean the razor.

            <li> THe product was delivered aheaad of schedule and in great shape. Fit right into the cleaner/charger perfectly.</li>
            <li> These little cartridges do a great job of cleaning the head of your panasonic shaver . Get some and always have a great smelling shaver.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what your cleaner needs. I like the fact that you can buy a whole years needs at one time and be done with it. These are the exact ones that come with your machine.</li>
            <li> You can feel and even smell the difference this cleaning solution does for your blades on your electric shaver and face.</li>
            <li> Continue to be pleased with this Panasonic cleaning system.  I&#x27;ve used it for over four years now.  Highly recommended by me.</li>
            <li> These are the replacement cartridges for my shaver (also purchased on amazon) and they work great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> This item does what it is suppose to do.  I wish it was stronger or there was more of the cleaning solution though.  I wish the product was able to remove the used razor smell, but keep it clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li> A must have for keeping your Vortex Razor clean and performing at the highest quality. Use the razor to not only shave my face but entire head also. Regular cleaning with the system made my original blades last 18 months. A must to have an d keep on hand to change regularly.</li>
            <li> Although the cleaning system impressed me, I was rather annoyed to find that the status light glowed after only 2 weeks of daily use, way less than the expected 4 weeks.  It then wouldn&#x27;t properly clean my shaver until I replaced the cartridge, even though the cleaning solution was still two-thirds full.  This was because the cartridge filter was full of hair clippings.  I have found a simple way to extend the life of the cartridges - note that it&#x27;s a little messy but no problem if you stand over a sink.  Once the status light comes on, take out the cartridge, and rinse it a little under running water.  Then while standing over a sink, blow into the little hole at the end of the cartridge and you&#x27;ll see the clippings and dirty water come out.  Rinse again and repeat this process until no more clippings come out and the water is clear.  Put the cartridge back in and enjoy another 2+ weeks of daily use.  You should still replace the cartridge when the water reservoir runs out, as it needs the solution to clean properly.  Hope this helps everyone!</li>
            <li> hey i love this stuff and it works great  and the best its way cheaper than in any store  and a lot of store dont even hv itin stock  amazon way to go</li>
            <li> What it does is turn your whiskers into ash. I don&#x27;t know yet how long it will last but I have been using it about every four or five times after shaving. Just remember to take it apart and wash the ashes out. Free replacement shipment.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and there were no defects that I could see. I gave it as part of a larger present and they really liked it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these by accident, but the person I gave them to really likes them.  Seems like a pain to have to buy these to clean your razor, but I guess it can be a nice option.</li>
            <li> I run my Panasonic shaver through the full cleaning cycle just once weekly -- it&#x27;s all you need and saves on buying these cartridges too frequently. On the remaining six days, I rinse it under running tap water and then set the unit to just Dry and Charge.</li>
            <li> finally got round to ordering these after some time. cleaned the head perfectly and does exactly what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;will be ordering more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;arrived in good time too</li>
            <li> The cartidge I received was as advertised, store quality, and at a much better price. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I have owned my L93 panasonic shaver for two years now and the cleaning system keeps them smelling nice and keep the razor clean.</li>
            <li> Repeat purchase.Works well. Very satified.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic Linear Razors for many years now.  I have always avoided using their cleaning system because of all the reviewer comments about how costly the cleaning cartridges are because they do not last very long.  I bought a new razor last November which included the cleaning system.  I have continued my practice of rising the razor after every use - I have a fairly heavy beard growth and shave every day.  I have not had to change the cleaning cartridge in 4 months.  They seem to last forever.  I also find that the razor shaves better using the cleaning system than it did when I washed the razor with liquid soap.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Works very well. It&#x27;s doing exactly what the specifications claim it should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great price, great value.</li>
            <li> Since you&#x27;re a captive customer, it&#x27;s good to know that the shaver system works. It&#x27;s also great to know that the automatic renewal system works.</li>
            <li> what can you say about something you use once a month guess it good does the job about all can say</li>
            <li> It cleans very well the blades, which is necessary at least every 30 days. I use it since I bought Panasonic electric razor. It is specifically done for Panasonic razors.</li>
            <li> tHE PRICE IS RIGHT IOF YOU SUBSCRIBE AND IT DOES KEEP THE SHAVER CLEAN AND READY TO GO.. wOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO TAKE THE SHAVER CLEANING CHORE TO THE NEXT LEVEL.</li>
            <li> One of the biggest selling points for the Panasonic razor was that these cartridges were a lot cheaper than norelco&#x27;s or remmington&#x27;s, and from what i read from the other reviews beforehand, they last about just as long. A way that i&#x27;ve found to make them last longer is to wash your razor about once per day with regular hand soap and washing with water, and then drying it with the base (without cleaning), but then using the cleaning mode about once every week or two. razor always stays clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> I needing something to keep my new electric shaver clean. I have a new electric shave and want it to last a long time. This product seems to help me keep my new shaver in good condition.</li>
            <li> Good value for the buck!!!</li>
            <li> Great product to make your razor just like new.  Love it! Will definitely be buying more of these to make my razor last.</li>
            <li> Each filter last me about 60 days.  I did make the mistake once of not pulling the plastic sticker off the port.</li>
            <li> Good, much easier to find vs in-store, and cheap.</li>
            <li> This product always works.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep my shaver in top condition. I like how quick and simple it is to change the cartridges</li>
            <li> works great this is the only place that i can get these and keeps my electric razor nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> The difference between using a little liquid soap and water to clean your Panasonic razor and using the Panasonic charger-cleaner became quite obvious when I was traveling with just the razor and cord on an extended holiday.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get the razor back in the machine once I got home.</li>
            <li> Work like you expect.</li>
            <li> They Just Work, &amp; A Lot Cheaper Here On Amazon. They Fit In The Cleaning Charger Base Perfectly That&#x27;s All I Can Say. Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess-free fire and forget cleaning system.  I use it every week or after  7 sessions. I just change the water and switch it on</li>
            <li> I like that I can use this feature as needed. No waste if not needed. Could use a more pleasant fragrance however.</li>
            <li> Theese are exactly what I was looking for.  I can never find them locally.  at lease they last a while.</li>
            <li> Love the Panasonic shaver, and this is the best deal I have found for the cartridges.  Would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got replacement cartridges for my razor hoping that it would help the shaving process in the morning, but I&#x27;m not really sure it does much more then simple water running through it.</li>
            <li> Works well for keeping my Blades clean</li>
            <li> Very good produst. works great.  Cleans my razor without me having to waste my time with it. All I have to doe is put in the new cartridge and clean my mechanism and everything is ready to go.</li>
            <li> Just like advertised, OEM cleaning solution. Keeps my shaver clean and running like new.  I like that it was a 3 pack.</li>
            <li> This is my third time purchasing these replacement cartridges and they work great!  Every time I replace the cartridge around two-three months, my shaver feels and shaves clean like the first day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend these replacement cartridges any day.</li>
            <li> Excellent cartridges that work great with the Panasonic ES-LV81-K. The only issue is that my cleaning system says it has been used up after 5 uses, but I pull it out and then push it back in and continue to use it. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, and very easy to swap out.  The whole shaving system is easy to use and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> I have used them sinse purchasing a panasonic razor with cleaning system. It helps keep the razor clean as well as giving a clean shave. The price for these cartridges is the best that I have for new cartridges from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Whitehead</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning feature on my Panasonic ES8109 Vortex razor and this cleaning cartridge is at the heart of that system. These are conveniently packaged in groups of three so that you have several refills ready to go. If you take the foil off of the razor and rinse it under water before putting it in the cradle and running the cleaning system, it helps prolong the life of these cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li> These usually sale online for $9.99. I got mine for less plus free shipping. These are a necessity for my husband&#x27;s Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver, but as long as used properly, the shaver lasts forever. Perfection!</li>
            <li> Silky smooth soap. My face feels like a baby&#x27;s butt. Is there anything that shaver soap can&#x27;t do? Now I can rub toilet paper all over my visage &amp; there taint a dingle to be found. Thank you Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This system is so much better the the Braun system...cleans great and cheaper cartridges ..bought the unit for my son who has a heavy beard..shaves the closest compared to the Brauns</li>
            <li> You need these if you want to use the cleaning feature of the recharging station.  They are simple to use and replace.  My only gripe is they seem to have been fitted with a chip that counts their uses.  I always rinse my razor before I put it into the cleaning device so I want to be able to use it for more cycles than if I didn&#x27;t.  But these are limited to something like 30-40 cycles after which the cartridge will not function even if it is entirely clean.  This forces the purchase of more these than I would otherwise need.  It&#x27;s not a big expense, but still I don&#x27;t like being dictated to about how to use things I buy.  That said, the razor and cleaning system allows the most options of any on the market and is the best razor/charging station combo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Necessary if you use the Panasonic cleaning station and works as advertised.  Not the easiest to change/install but that is the station design not the cleaning solution.  If you clean your razor every day these will last about a month.  Less frequent use such as every other day prolongs it.  A nice thing is they don&#x27;t evaporate if the razor is out of the cleaning station such as when you travel unlike the alcohol based cleaners. (i.e. Braun)</li>
            <li> This OEM part is perfect ! Clean the razor blade after shaving..</li>
            <li> Very happy with these, they fit perfectly and work great.</li>
            <li> Tough to find these refill cartridges anywhere else, and totally  not possible at these prices! I am perfectly satisfied! Perfectly!!</li>
            <li> very very good..value for money would reccommend to anyone who owns a panasonic elictric shaver cant get better than this</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than stated.  I clean the heads manually and then run it through the cleaning cycle to completely sterilize the head twice per week.  Lasts better than 120 days doing it that way.</li>
            <li> Works great, cleans the shaver very well.  And it last for about 3 months.  I love this Vortex HydraClean system.</li>
            <li> Cartridge is a replacement for one that I have used.  It does a good job of cleaning the shaver.  I use a wet/dry electric shaver with shaving cream for a better feel and better shave.  I usually clean once a week and it seems to work OK</li>
            <li> Really like this product that complements a great razor.  It is so simple and the razor is so well cleaned and dried.</li>
            <li> Panasonic makes really good shavers. The cleaning system works as advertised so no complaints. Can&#x27;t give it anything less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Use this product because without it my shaver cleaner won&#x27;t work.  If you clean out your shaver first then use the cleaning machine, this product works well to finish off the process.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews that gave negative reports on the staleness and foul odor of the Amazon inventory of these cartridges I was very reluctant to order them. However, I could not find any locally. Some of the online sites such as Walmart online have this product but there is a shipping charge unless sent to the store where there is no charege for shipping. There is a cost for gasoline to get to the store and back. And so I figured what the heck why not give Amazon a shot since they have been straight with me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges arrived today and I gave them a thorough sniff test. To obtain absolute certainty I sniffed all three cartridges. All seemed more than acceptable. I then made the ultimate test. I took a cartridge and held it under the snout of Max, my Doberman. He has a sniffer of absolute sensitivity. He indicated that he found no problem with the cartridge from Amazon. There is no higher level of testing known to man so I have no reservations about using these cartridges and will order more when these run out.</li>
            <li> The vortex system has to be the best razor cleaning system that I have used.  After cleaned by the vortex system, it feels like a new razor!  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. My first use gave me the closest shave I have ever had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One caveat, the razor irritated a section of my neck for the first two weeks of use. After my skin adjusted, however, no more irritation!</li>
            <li> Very good for my shaver...</li>
            <li> The cleaning unit did not last long. I even used distilled water in it. The cartridge was ok while the unit lasted and I love the Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this along with the replacement blade and foil fold for my Panasonic shaver.  I find myself using the little brush and some alcohol to quickly clean it...but that&#x27;s just me.  Thsi product might be fine but I just haven&#x27;t bothered to use it.</li>
            <li> Yes, they cost money, but they wash the Shaver better that I do. For a while there I was shaving in the shower and noticed that rinsing the shaver in warm water was not the best method, for I also had to make sure the leave it completely dried. With this product and the cleaning system by Panasonic all the guess work takes second place. 4 Stars.</li>
            <li> This system keeps my shaver&#x27;s foil and blades clean and slick.  Worth the effort to install and fill the reservoir.</li>
            <li> Good item, works as expected...</li>
            <li> Much more affordable through Amazon.  Works with my husband&#x27;s Panasonic &amp;#34;Darth Vador&amp;#34; razor.  I appreciate that we can order through Subscribe and Save to save money and for the convenience factor.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize each cartridge last for about 6 months ,,,,,,,so I now have about 10 years worth,,LOL,, when the razor is dead &amp; buried I will still have 5 years worth left of cartridges. Other than that quick delivery -----no complaints.</li>
            <li> This cleans perfectly and easily.  Get them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my brother.  Good price.</li>
            <li> A decent product, of which there is a need. The Stores do not seem to carry this item, so you have to hunt around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;honestly I wouldn&#x27;t buy the razor if I had to do it over.</li>
            <li> Great product last long</li>
            <li> These cartridges work just as expected and keep the razor clean.  They have to be changed monthly and yes I tried to get to go longer, but the unit quit working until I changed them.</li>
            <li> When I purchased my Panasonic razor, I read lots of negative reviews on the cleaner mechanism, mostly concerning the cost of the cartridges. I&#x27;ve got to say this cleaner is a great idea because it really does clean the razor with little effort. I&#x27;ve taken to shaving with water and shaving cream, and a quick rinse of the razor before placing it in the cleaner makes everything fast and convenient. When I first got my razor, I was shaving dry which works fine, but means that water level in your cleaner dissipates quickly. Putting a wet razor in the cleaner solves that problem too. I have this on subscribe and save so I never run out.</li>
            <li> I really like using these cartridges, but if you think about the cost over a year when you have to change this once a month, it can be a waste of money when you can use body wash and wash it also. but I like this product because you just drop the shaver in the cleaner device and push a button, saves alot of time.</li>
            <li> Works well keeping my Panasonic shaver clean.</li>
            <li> it works very good, i put it into the vortex system and it works very well i recomend this product</li>
            <li> does a good job but it is still overpriced. charging takes a while and the cleaning process is too long.</li>
            <li> When you spend $300+ for an electric shaver why not buy the proper cleaning solution for it.  I know this particular razor can be cleaned with liquid soap and water but why would anyone do so.  If you can afford the razor, surely you can afford to take care of it properly.</li>
            <li> An essential part of the Panasonic Vortex shaver cleaning station. Returns razor to &amp;#34;AS NEW&amp;#34; condition after each use. A product well-worth using!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a self-cleaning shaver but in reality I&#x27;ve gotten by with just pumping some Cetaphil soap on the blades and screens, and then running it in the shower.  That cleans it pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless these have some magical lubricating and life-preserving capability (of the blade, not me), I have found them to be a waste.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they do work as advertised, but there&#x27;s at least one cheaper, as-effective method of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I love the 3 pack of these because I don&#x27;t use the cleaning cycle every single time I shave. I could stretch the 3-pack to about 9 months before I needed to re-order with my old ES-8249 shaver. I just recently purchased the ES-LA93 and will update my usage of the cleaning cartridges when I go through them.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Dear Amazon Shopper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cartridges are effective at cleaning the Panasonic shavers they were designed to complement.  What makes them a 4-star product are their comparative advantages over significantly more expensive cartridges designed by other manufacturers for other shaving systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Braun &amp;#34;Clean and Renew&amp;#34; cartridges run $5-6 per cartridge, the Panasonic cartridges run just over $3 (and can dip under that when you subscribe-and-save).  Also, unlike the Braun cartridges, the Panasonic cartridges do not have an electronically-limited &amp;#34;timed life.&amp;#34;  Where a &amp;#34;Clean and Renew&amp;#34; cartridge will simply &amp;#34;elapse&amp;#34; after a month and read &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34;, even if it has never been used, you can use your Panasonic cartridge for as long as you please, allowing you to get a couple of extra uses out of it before moving on to the next cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer also indicated that these cartridges can be refilled with hydrogen peroxide and will continue to thrum along happily, cleaning your Panasonic razor.  That this is possible is a credit to the cartridges, rather than a strike against them, as that kind of flexibility is not available using Braun cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say these are as good as shaving cartridges get.  They&#x27;re inexpensive, last seasonably long, and let YOU decide when to discard them.  I&#x27;m not sure what else one would want from a product of this nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product as been a pleasant surprise. It produces a very fresh and clean razor and meets its stated purpose. I encountered no problem with adverse odors, as stated in other reviews-----maybe they just were the victims of a spoiled (bad) batch. I intend to reorder when my supply is depleted,</li>
            <li> Have not used this product as of yet; thus can&#x27;t rest it but will do so after using it to clean the razor</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my husband, because he needed replacements. They worked perfectly and were a great price. I like that he received 3 of them in this pack. This should last him for awhile.</li>
            <li> This stuff make your shaver smell new again when you clean it. A bit pricey, but worth it considering the improved smell of the shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been a Panasonic electric shaver user for over 20 years and I would say that makes me a pretty loyal customer. I am sorry to say, though, that I am disappointed with the HydraClean Shaving System. I think it is just an expensive gimmick. The cleaning unit is bulky, the cartridges expensive, and the system highly ineffective. I get a better cleaning by putting a few drops of SoftSoap on the foil and just rinsing the wet-dry shaver under the faucet. It even smells much better than the Panasonic cleaning solution. Take it from an experienced electric shaver user, don&#x27;t waste your money on the HydraClean shaving system or on the expensive cartridges.</li>
            <li> The best price and it arrived in just a couple of days.  Could not ask for any thing better! Hurray!</li>
            <li> I am unable to find these cartridges in town so I have to order online. Amazon had the best price and the shipper was very quick to get them to me. In an oversight I didn&#x27;t catch that there are three in the box and made my order quantity (2) so I won&#x27;t be ordering them for a little while. They arrived quickly, they are easy to install and I have no issues with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Shipped very well  the unit works very good&lt;br /&gt;Unit as described on the money works very good&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;rfriedman</li>
            <li> I really like these because the are cheaper and last much longer than the refills for my braun.  I wish they had a little more fragrance so I could give it 5 stars.  Overall very good value.</li>
            <li> What a find!  My husband has an older Panasonic electric shaving system with a recharging mechanism that cleans the shaver while it charges.  He&#x27;s been using it for several years now and we never knew you had to change the cartridge in the bottom of the machine.  We&#x27;ve just been cleaning out the water reservoir and rinsing the filter.  (Don&#x27;t get grossed out - he has a beard, so he doesn&#x27;t use this much anyway).  So, now that we&#x27;ve figured this out, I bought several boxes of 3 filters.  We should be good for a lifetime now!</li>
            <li> very good cleaner for the electric razor. it cleans good and the the razor is as new. very good price too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years with great success.  Destilled or deionized water works well.</li>
            <li> Performed like the original.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and they are a great value and easy install. great product and recommended.</li>
            <li> The price was very good and they arrived on time.  It&#x27;s very difficult to talk about this product in detail because it is very simple.</li>
            <li> I have used a Panasonic shaver and cleaning stand for years.  In fact I am on my 3rd and most recent model.  It seems everybody sells the shavers and stands but not the cleaning packs. Amazon makes it much easier, quicker, and less expensive to order these.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleaner eversince I have had my razor. Without this cleaner I really don&#x27;t think I could use the razor It is priceless to me and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other</li>
            <li> Great filter for the shaver</li>
            <li> WAY less expensive than buying locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre-rinse the razor before putting in charger to make these last much longer. About to order again!</li>
            <li> Right stuff, right price, right seller.</li>
            <li> Panasonic made a really nice job when engineered this cartridge series. It&#x27;s pretty and works 100% as expected. It fits precisely in the cleaning unit making the changing process a smooth experience. I totally recommend it and, if there&#x27;s a cons it would be it&#x27;s pricey.</li>
            <li> ]Just like always, these cartridges do not disappoint. They are name brand and make my razor work perfectly. Just after the cleaning, it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> Keeps my old razor running like new !</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to clean my shaver again.  I usually wash mine with soft soap a couple times a week, and only use the dryer on a regular basis.  But once every couple of weeks, I do the full cleaning cycle on the shaver.  This way, I extend the life of these cleaning cartridges a bit.  Just make sure you replace the water in the tank as well, or you make your new, clean filters dirty by using old, dirty water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These came brand new in the box and individually wrapped inside.</li>
            <li> Definite Must Have with the Panasonic 8000 Series for Self Cleaning.  They keep the head and foil fresh and sharp since it helps remove the hardness build up.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get any easier to use. Just pop it in and fill with water. Cleans my shavers better than I do. Has a nice clean smooth smell to the shaver head after a clean and charge.</li>
            <li> A hassle-free way to clean your Panasonic.</li>
            <li> A-ok and the only place you can find these</li>
            <li> great item ....great price pleasure doing business with</li>
            <li> Keeps my Panasonic shaver clean and functioning well.</li>
            <li> Works well and is always fresh. Purchased some from a local &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; store and they were so old, didn&#x27;t clean at all.</li>
            <li> The price for these cleaning cartridges have really dropped in price. They are finally a fordable now. I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> Easy, low-maintenance cleaning process and the auto-ship subscription takes the thought out of remembering to order it.  It&#x27;s a no-brainer for an owner of this shaver.</li>
            <li> These do exactly what they are supposed to do. I rinse my shaver in the sink before putting it back on the charger to clean so one cartridge will last me about 2 months and keep the shaver clean and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me. It&#x27;s doing excatly what the specifications claim it should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great price great value.</li>
            <li> These cartridges worked as described and weren&#x27;t expensive. Glad to have found them these were cheaper than local stores and did what they were supposed to do. I will purchase these again.</li>
            <li> My husband needed this to go with his shaving set, I found it for a reasonable price and in stock! Thanks</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver cleaner works for  limited time.  Buying these cartridges is a waste of money.  If you want an automatic cleaner for your shaver, buy another brand.  If you want the Panasonic shaver, buy it without the cleaning station.  It is easy to clean the shaver manually.</li>
            <li> Does what they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job of keeping my Panasonic razor clean and ready to go.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system cleans efficiently but it&#x27;s a shame about the actual Panasonic razor. It would have to be the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> delivered on time. great price. haven&#x27; t used it yet, but is just like the cartridges i hae used for my razor in the past, so there is not reason these should not work</li>
            <li> Have had the accompanying shaver and cleaning unit  for a year. Love them. Product arrived and works as expected. NO COMPLAINTS HERE!</li>
            <li> These were recommended so I thought they were the right thing for my husband&#x27;s razor, they weren&#x27;t, so I really can&#x27;t rate them, but I have to to get them out of my cue...sorry</li>
            <li> Works fine and seems to last pretty well. I had to take the first of the 3 in the package out early because I moved and packed this in my checked luggage.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are for cleaning the Panasonic Vortex shaving system.  They plug up easily and I never get more than 1 or 2 cleanings out of them.</li>
            <li> Couldnt find these anywhere in my area. Bought the shaver here on Amazon, and love it. Great value here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I replace it once in a month it perfectly cleans the razors and foils</li>
            <li> These are exactly like the cleaner cartridges that came with my Panasonic shaver. No surprises there. They do a great job of cleaning the blade system in my shaver, and leave a pleasant scent to boot!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripes are: 1) Kind of expensive for what they are, and 2) I wish they had an option for sterilization. Maybe if they sold some that contained a high concentration of alcohol or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, if you&#x27;re reading this review, you&#x27;re probably going to buy these fella&#x27;s...and I see no reason that you shouldn&#x27;t. Cheers!!</li>
            <li> This is the only cleaner you need for the panosonic electric shaver.  It works great and you got to have it.</li>
            <li> We use this cleaner all the time in our Panasonic electric shaver.  When used at recommended intervals it keeps the shaver nice and clean.  We order from Amazon all the time when we run out.</li>
            <li> Husband loves his shaver. This product makes the cleaning chore so much easier. Makes a necessary job faster and neater.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this Panasonic razor, I had a Braun. The cleaning system on the Braun lasted about one month to six weeks per cartridge. The Panasonic cartridge is at four weeks and counting so we will see how it stacks up. Otherwise, all is well and I find the razor a very pleasant upgrade to my Braun experience.</li>
            <li> Works.  There are 3 in the box, so the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This cartridge is required  - much like an inkjet printer needs an ink cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like my Panasonic shaver and this cleaning solution maintains it well.  I have read on other blogs that you can take Peroxide and use it instead of water when the cartridge is no longer good. - But for $10 every 3 months, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband did extensive research before buying this new razor and is delighted with his results as he thinks it is the best shave he has ever gotten with an electric shaver....</li>
            <li> The razor&#x27;s base keeps telling me I need to replace the cartridge after having just replaced it. I have to pull it out and push it back in again to get it to clean the razor. I&#x27;m going back to a conventional razor.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, cheap price. Well worth it</li>
            <li> very awesome !! I really love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t clean my Panasonic razor often using the base - most of the time I rinse it under the faucet - but I know the solution cartridges add some lubrication, so I run the clean cycle occasionally. I noticed that when I replaced the cartridge that the old one had trapped a lot of hair. I don&#x27;t think you need to replace these as often as Panasonic would like you to, but they do help ensure a clean and well-running razor.</li>
            <li> This cartridge is not only the cartridge required by the manufacturer, without which the shaver&#x27;s cleaning system won&#x27;t work.  It is also a piece of plastic which happens to fit perfectly into the base of this shaver (for which it was specifically designed).  The only products you can say that for are other shaving solution cartridges designed specifically for other shaving systems which, let&#x27;s face it, probably fit equally as well.  Don&#x27;t take my word for it, if you own a Panasonic shaving system which requires this cartridge - I&#x27;d say give it a try.  You can try cartridges designed for other shaving systems, but may find the lack of compatibility frustrating after 36 or 37 tries.</li>
            <li> fits so perfectly and easily</li>
            <li> it keeps the shaver clean and lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;its a delight to us a clean shaver.&lt;br /&gt;meets all my expectations. great</li>
            <li> OEM.  And they work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not that I know anything about the product, but my fella loved it!  Works great especially with his sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> These are required for the type of shaver I have.  They are easy to change - last for a reasonable amount of shaves and are not combustible like the ones that held alcohol in my last shaver.  Much better for the environment, I think.</li>
            <li> Great product cheaper then best buy</li>
            <li> Original replacement at good price. I will order again when the time comes for another replacement. It is made by Panasonic. I rinse my shaver head in water before using the hydraclean so the solution last twice as long.</li>
            <li> When my order it I thought think it one piece after it arrival grandmother 3 pieces in a box and this very wonderful at an excellent price, especially I did not consumed the first canister that came with razor.</li>
            <li> The cartridge does the job, but really, given the ingredients, it is not essential (other soaps/solutions would do the trick as well without a dedicated system, as explained by Panasonic themselves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I have given 3 instead of 4 stars is because while it cleans well, unlike the Braun solution, it does not make the foil &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; for the purpose of sliding across the face (different ingredients).</li>
            <li> Great deal for 1 and you get 3.  These will last me four to six months at least! Great stuff right here!</li>
            <li> These things clean my razor! How magical!</li>
            <li> Panasonic WES035P Vortex HydraClean Shaving System Solution Cartridges for..., are very good at cleaning my Panasonic shaver.  I love having a clean dry shaver to use every morning.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I just replaced the blades and screen on my Panasonic shaver.  I had been out of these for a while.  Glad Amazon had these at a very good price.  I may use them more now.</li>
            <li> I hope it is a bit more economical</li>
            <li> This cleaning system is great. You just put the shaver in the machine and at the next day it will be ready to use.</li>
