    <ol>

            <li>It is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Your mileage may vary on this product, so I wish you the best.</li>
            <li>To the best of my knowledge, it will not permanently stain your brush.</li>
            <li>feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the size of the tube, this is the perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very nice and the quality of the shaving foam is the best.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell.  </li>
            <li>This a really great.</li>
            <li>Happy Shaving.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I experienced this as well.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant floral smell that disappears</li>
            <li>, it is pleasant but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Of all the shave creams I&#x27;ve tried, Geo F. Trumper is among the best and the violet soft shave cream seems to be the best of the Trumper brand.</li>
            <li>Good Shaving cream,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the cream itself is good.</li>
            <li>The quality of this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this product as I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about Geo F. Trumper creams.</li>
            <li>B00837YY18 Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New Formulation]] (an excellent soap)</li>
            <li>The smell was quite nice and not to strong.</li>
            <li>Will buy many times again.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and love</li>
            <li>This is my son&#x27;s favorite shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>He told me that it was his favorite.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000A3WWI0 Proraso Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol Shaving Cream 150 ml.]],  cheaper than Geo F Trumper and more in quantity and in my opinion  quality.</li>
            <li>We guys have to start treating ourselves better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The use of this product works best with a shaving brush and a tube key.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite scent</li>
            <li>This works even better to remove soap and cream residue and it will leave your bristles feeling softer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube that this comes in</li>
            <li>It was creamier, more cushion-y and produced more lather.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is great for sensitive skin in the fact the fragrance is not too strong.</li>
            <li>The violet scent isn&#x27;t too strong and disappears rapidly after rinsing.</li>
            <li>the lather itself is so nice, that after my first shave, I immediately jumped on amazon to buy the lime version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The idea is accurate.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is important to note as some have reported that the violet coloring in this cream has stained their brush.</li>
            <li>This illustrates an important point to travelers.</li>
            <li>The glycerin in this cream makes it far superior to shaving soaps that come in jars.  </li>
            <li>, I was really excited for a change.</li>
            <li>After using nearly two dozen different shave creams, soaps, gels, foams this one is still one of best.</li>
            <li>It performs better than all 4 of my Taylor of Old Bond Street creams and provides more protection than my Truefitt &amp; Hill cream.</li>
            <li>It makes it such a pleasant experience when you get out the shower and use this in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I find that i have to use a good bit more of the cream than I need to use with other products (like Truefitt &amp; Hill).  </li>
            <li>When you lather, it&#x27;s not going to be the same bright purple color.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this shave cream is nice.</li>
            <li>It has a mild floral scent to it without being too perfumey or feminine.</li>
            <li>But to be honest, the scent is addictive.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me, most scented shaving creams tend to irritate my skin and cause a burning sensation while shaving.</li>
            <li>I guess it had more to do with the fact that no one else to my knowledge offers this scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is also nice; Certainly nothing like the overpowering \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; stuff that we are fed via commercials, but something much more subtle and interesting.  </li>
            <li>far as performance goes, I find it to be up there with other good performers, but honestly I&#x27;m not the best judge of performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a good substitute because it costs slightly less, but the lack of lather is a deal breaker for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent was wonderful, the color very vibrant but alas it fell flat where it mattered the most.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to describe the scent, but the great thing is it&#x27;s not overpowering and</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s all I have for this review, comment if you have further questions :)</li>
            <li>When I punctured the foil seal to use it for the first time, cream immediately oozed out everywhere.</li>
            <li>If using some type of brush, whether badger or boar hair, you only need a pea size amount to produce a lather good enough for two to three</li>
            <li>If shaving on a daily basis and using a good brush, I&#x27;ve gotten a tube like this to last almost three months.</li>
            <li>I have been using shaving creams for about 2 years and thought that I would give this one a try since the brand is pretty highly rated.  </li>
            <li>He is a very picky person where items like this are concerned.  </li>
            <li>The cream seemed to lather up really well in the bowl.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>very close shave-worth the price</li>
            <li>All of Trumper&#x27;s ingredients are listed on their website but ingredients should really be listed on all tubes as well so that consumers can readily decide for themselves whether they want to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The glycerin in the cream leaves your face feeling more hydrated than with other brands of shaving</li>
            <li>It is caused by tiny amounts of leftover cream residue gradually building up, drying on the bristles and returning to its original violet color.</li>
            <li>The scent is floral but light, it doesn&#x27;t stick around long after washing up.</li>
            <li>It give me a better shave and a closer shaving with a lot less irritation.</li>
            <li>My second favorite scent is Sandlewood, but I don&#x27;t seem to get the same set up as I do with the Violet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While my Proraso green is refreshing and invigorating, the Trumper is very comforting and luxurious.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is a little more drier than Trumpers Limes, Coconut, and Almond.  </li>
            <li>This still gives you a semi-slick shave, although you may have to add a little more water to your mix.  </li>
            <li>B001L6X522 Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shaving Cream in a Bowl [Health and Beauty]]] and the difference was very noticeable.</li>
            <li>This shave cream lathers extremely well producing a soft, smooth, protective lather.</li>
            <li>Once anything presses into the tube, it will not retain its original shape the way other creams in plastic tubes would.</li>
            <li>With Proraso, I could produce lather for at least two passes easily but this one needed a little more helping of cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The 75g tube is a convenient size for travel and this shave cream may be lathered with a brush or by hand directly onto the face if you happen to leave your brush at home.</li>
            <li>far as the shave, it is heavenly.  </li>
            <li>Then my cream trifecta will be complete.</li>
            <li>far as the fragrance goes, my wife says it reminds her of lavender, but I disagree.</li>
            <li>I admit I was apprehensive at first to try Trumper&#x27;s Violet, not because of the color, but because some reviewers have mentioned it&#x27;s on the dry side.  </li>
            <li>This created some problems during shipping as the tube came delivered with the top half crushed in.</li>
            <li>Two years ago I began wet shaving and this is the first (non drug store) shaving cream I bought.</li>
            <li>With a badger hair brush it lathers up easily and goes on thick.</li>
            <li>My razor was skipping and adding salt to the injury, it dried up quickly too.</li>
            <li>The GFT Violet is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>burn in sensitive areas, especially in the neck</li>
            <li>You need only about an amount equivalent to a single kernel of unpopped corn, and it generates enough lather, if not too much lather, for one shave.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have Proraso for a refreshing shave, Trumper for a luxurious shave, and Jack Black for a slick</li>
            <li>Trumper&#x27;s Violet shaving cream produces a rich, thick lather that won&#x27;t dry out on your face.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll have Proraso for a refreshing shave, Trumper for a luxurious shave, and Jack Black for a slick</li>
            <li> Trumper&#x27;s Violet shaving cream produces a rich, thick lather that won&#x27;t dry out on your face.</li>
            <li> Sorry that I cannot give any detailed information other than the smell, but he recommends it highly.</li>
            <li> The lather feels soft and pillow-like as if each bubble is a tiny little cushion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting for a jar of Jack Black shave cream, which I hope will be very slick and smooth.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream definitely helps in terms of reducing nicks and cuts, and definitely helps in leaving my face far less inflamed than other creams that you can find at the pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> And while not unpleasant, the scent is a little dull.</li>
            <li> This tube last a long times!!!!</li>
            <li> But compared to other products that I have tried, it simply does not lather up as well.  </li>
            <li> After shaving with the Trumper cream, rinse your face, pat dry and apply an after shave of choice.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is the price is slightly premium also.</li>
            <li> Those dry one&#x27;s skin due to the soap.  </li>
            <li> If left alone for a few minutes after mixing, the cream regains some of its violet color as it starts to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lather is thick and one tube is enough to last you about a year.</li>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t seem to lubricate as well as other creams I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard this brand is listed as one of the top 3 creams in the world, so to my surprise, we were both disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It still is a little dry, which made me dock half a star.</li>
            <li> I use Jack Black Aloe Vera or other alcohol-free products like Obsession or Baxter of California.    </li>
            <li> Also the scent reminds me of something I might find in my grandmother&#x27;s medicine cabinet, which made dock another half star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, there is just something bland about this one that doesn&#x27;t leave me wanting it in my rotation often.</li>
            <li> With this cream, I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m less prone to razor</li>

            <li> Will buy many times again. The fragrance is very nice and the quality of the shaving foam is the best.</li>
            <li> This shave cream lathers extremely well producing a soft, smooth, protective lather. The 75g tube is a convenient size for travel and this shave cream may be lathered with a brush or by hand directly onto the face if you happen to leave your brush at home. The violet scent isn&#x27;t too strong and disappears rapidly after rinsing. Of all the shave creams I&#x27;ve tried, Geo F. Trumper is among the best and the violet soft shave cream seems to be the best of the Trumper brand.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and love</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put of by the word \\&quot;Violet\\&quot; in the name of this shaving cream.  It has a pleasant floral smell that disappears when one rinses, post-shave.    The cream can be used by hand, but is designed to be used with a shaving brush - the idea being that working a lather up with a brush will make one&#x27;s whiskers stand up and result in a closer shave.  The idea is accurate.    Apply two small stripes of cream to either side of your beard and lather up with a hot brush and away you go.      The glycerin in this cream makes it far superior to shaving soaps that come in jars.  Those dry one&#x27;s skin due to the soap.  After shaving with the Trumper cream, rinse your face, pat dry and apply an after shave of choice.  I use Jack Black Aloe Vera or other alcohol-free products like Obsession or Baxter of California.    While seemingly expensive at around twenty bucks a tube, 75g will last six months once you get the proportion of cream to water down.  My second favorite scent is Sandlewood, but I don&#x27;t seem to get the same set up as I do with the Violet.</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite shaving cream.  It has a great smell.  He is a very picky person where items like this are concerned.  I asked his wife what to get him for Christmas and she suggested this.  He told me that it was his favorite.  Sorry that I cannot give any detailed information other than the smell, but he recommends it highly.</li>
            <li> After using nearly two dozen different shave creams, soaps, gels, foams this one is still one of best. With a badger hair brush it lathers up easily and goes on thick. Only downside is the price is slightly premium also.</li>
            <li> Good Shaving cream, but I prefer:  [[ASIN:B000A3WWI0 Proraso Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol Shaving Cream 150 ml.]],  cheaper than Geo F Trumper and more in quantity and in my opinion  quality.</li>
            <li> This a really great. It give me a better shave and a closer shaving with a lot less irritation. This tube last a long times!!!!</li>
            <li> I admit I was apprehensive at first to try Trumper&#x27;s Violet, not because of the color, but because some reviewers have mentioned it&#x27;s on the dry side.  It is a little more drier than Trumpers Limes, Coconut, and Almond.  But to be honest, the scent is addictive.  It truly smells like Violets.  Even if you&#x27;re a manly man you can appreciate the smell.  Don&#x27;t worry about the purple coloring.  When you lather, it&#x27;s not going to be the same bright purple color.  The color fades when lathering this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shave, it is heavenly.  This still gives you a semi-slick shave, although you may have to add a little more water to your mix.  I don&#x27;t have any issues with this cream in regards to razor bumps or razor burn.  Again, the smell is wonderful in my opinion.  It makes it such a pleasant experience when you get out the shower and use this in the morning.  We guys have to start treating ourselves better.  Ladies have no problem pampering themselves, so why shouldn&#x27;t we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has done its job and protects as you shave.  Try using Trumpers Limes Skin Food as both a pre and post shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving Gentlemen!</li>
            <li> Two years ago I began wet shaving and this is the first (non drug store) shaving cream I bought. Don&#x27;t be put off by the price. The quality of this product is amazing. The scent is floral but light, it doesn&#x27;t stick around long after washing up. The glycerin in the cream leaves your face feeling more hydrated than with other brands of shaving creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The use of this product works best with a shaving brush and a tube key.</li>
            <li> Wow, this shave cream is nice. Buy it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my Proraso green is refreshing and invigorating, the Trumper is very comforting and luxurious. The lather feels soft and pillow-like as if each bubble is a tiny little cushion. You can just feel the difference as soon as you lather your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still is a little dry, which made me dock half a star. Also the scent reminds me of something I might find in my grandmother&#x27;s medicine cabinet, which made dock another half star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the lather itself is so nice, that after my first shave, I immediately jumped on amazon to buy the lime version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting for a jar of Jack Black shave cream, which I hope will be very slick and smooth. Then my cream trifecta will be complete. I&#x27;ll have Proraso for a refreshing shave, Trumper for a luxurious shave, and Jack Black for a slick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But back to Trumper... Buy it now. It is awesome. This is a brand you MUST have in your rotation.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. You need only about an amount equivalent to a single kernel of unpopped corn, and it generates enough lather, if not too much lather, for one shave.   This shaving cream definitely helps in terms of reducing nicks and cuts, and definitely helps in leaving my face far less inflamed than other creams that you can find at the pharmacy.  A tube has lasted me six months. The smell is also nice; Certainly nothing like the overpowering \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; stuff that we are fed via commercials, but something much more subtle and interesting.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product as I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about Geo F. Trumper creams. The smell was quite nice and not to strong. The cream seemed to lather up really well in the bowl. The issue I had was the shave itself. This cream didn&#x27;t seem to lubricate as well as other creams I use. I had a lot of tugging and irritation from this cream. My wife used it on her legs and also reported the same issues. I&#x27;ve heard this brand is listed as one of the top 3 creams in the world, so to my surprise, we were both disappointed. Your mileage may vary on this product, so I wish you the best. Happy Shaving.</li>
            <li> The two violet scents I know of for shaving creams are this one and Razorock&#x27;s Napoleon&#x27;s Violet. The razorock violet is a terrible smell, I absolutely hate it. The GFT Violet is the complete opposite. It&#x27;s my favorite scent and I&#x27;ve tried lots of scents so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance goes, I find it to be up there with other good performers, but honestly I&#x27;m not the best judge of performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I have for this review, comment if you have further questions :)</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving cream. Its one I like to use it in my regular rotation. It lives up to the reputation of the Geo.F. Trumper name.</li>
            <li> I have been using shaving creams for about 2 years and thought that I would give this one a try since the brand is pretty highly rated.  I like the smell, it is pleasant but not overpowering.  But compared to other products that I have tried, it simply does not lather up as well.  I find that i have to use a good bit more of the cream than I need to use with other products (like Truefitt &amp; Hill).  I was hoping this would be a good substitute because it costs slightly less, but the lack of lather is a deal breaker for me.  (And it is still on the expensive side...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> very close shave-worth the price</li>
            <li> Trumper&#x27;s Violet shaving cream produces a rich, thick lather that won&#x27;t dry out on your face. It has a mild floral scent to it without being too perfumey or feminine. The color of the cream is also violet in color but turns white when mixed. If left alone for a few minutes after mixing, the cream regains some of its violet color as it starts to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is important to note as some have reported that the violet coloring in this cream has stained their brush. To the best of my knowledge, it will not permanently stain your brush. However, after a few uses you may notice that your bristles do have a violet tint to them. I experienced this as well. This is not caused by the coloring in the cream dyeing the bristles. It is caused by tiny amounts of leftover cream residue gradually building up, drying on the bristles and returning to its original violet color. This problem can be solved by simply cleaning the brush with liquid soap and water. You may also want to consider periodically soaking your brush in a vinegar/water solution. This works even better to remove soap and cream residue and it will leave your bristles feeling softer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube that this comes in is one of those metallic foil tubes which I was unaware of. This created some problems during shipping as the tube came delivered with the top half crushed in. When I punctured the foil seal to use it for the first time, cream immediately oozed out everywhere. This illustrates an important point to travelers. Once anything presses into the tube, it will not retain its original shape the way other creams in plastic tubes would. Instead, it causes pressure to stay built up inside until the next time you open it. Therefore, this tube is certainly not ideal for travel and would have to be packed inside of a hard case.  Also, these foil tubes don&#x27;t list ingredients on the back the way Trumper&#x27;s plastic tubes do.  All of Trumper&#x27;s creams contain parabens in them.  The jury is still out on parabens but some people choose to avoid them. All of Trumper&#x27;s ingredients are listed on their website but ingredients should really be listed on all tubes as well so that consumers can readily decide for themselves whether they want to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the cream itself is good. It performs better than all 4 of my Taylor of Old Bond Street creams and provides more protection than my Truefitt &amp; Hill cream. The lather is thick and one tube is enough to last you about a year. However, there is just something bland about this one that doesn&#x27;t leave me wanting it in my rotation often. And while not unpleasant, the scent is a little dull. I can also see how the coloring of the bristles might be off-putting to some and the foil tube with its unlisted ingredients is a little unfortunate.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is great for sensitive skin in the fact the fragrance is not too strong. If you have sensitive skin like me, most scented shaving creams tend to irritate my skin and cause a burning sensation while shaving. If using some type of brush, whether badger or boar hair, you only need a pea size amount to produce a lather good enough for two to three passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about this is the amount of lather and the cushion it provides. With this cream, I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m less prone to razor burn in sensitive areas, especially in the neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the fragrance goes, my wife says it reminds her of lavender, but I disagree. It&#x27;s really hard to describe the scent, but the great thing is it&#x27;s not overpowering and feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the size of the tube, this is the perfect size for traveling. I find the tubs to be rather bulky, but not this. If shaving on a daily basis and using a good brush, I&#x27;ve gotten a tube like this to last almost three months.</li>
            <li> After using [[ASIN:B00837YY18 Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New Formulation]] (an excellent soap), I was really excited for a change. I went through couple of reviews and finally settled for Trumper&#x27;s Violet. I guess it had more to do with the fact that no one else to my knowledge offers this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was wonderful, the color very vibrant but alas it fell flat where it mattered the most. The lather felt watery and took quite a bit to work up. My razor was skipping and adding salt to the injury, it dried up quickly too. With Proraso, I could produce lather for at least two passes easily but this one needed a little more helping of cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried various blades and varying amount of water but the result was never satisfactory. Disappointed, I ordered [[ASIN:B001L6X522 Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shaving Cream in a Bowl [Health and Beauty]]] and the difference was very noticeable. It was creamier, more cushion-y and produced more lather. May be I got unlucky and got a dud.</li>
