            <li>Great price!</li>
            <li>Snapple isn&#x27;t made from the the best stuff on earth this is.</li>

            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>I chewed for 15 years and in my opinion this is a great substitute.</li>
            <li>using to help wean off smokeless tobacco - a great tool.</li>
            <li>This stuff has great flavor.</li>
            <li>So a log of beaver to one tin and u good.  </li>

            <li>This is going to be as good as it gets.</li>

            <li>Great product -- quickly delivered again!</li>
            <li>lets be honest, if you chew and are use to chew..</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my own fault for giving up on myself.  </li>
            <li>He asked me to buy him some more cans, so glad I found it on amazon!</li>
            <li>He liked the taste and it damn sure smelled better then Copenhagen.</li>
            <li>I have chewed for more than 20 years and I can admit that this is not at all a great alternative to good old fashioned chew.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>It makes for a better choice compared to using tobacco.</li>
            <li>Though it is refreshing.</li>
            <li>I dipped mint flavored snuff and was able to transition off with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>a creating an incredibly convincing product.</li>
            <li>I gave most of it away.</li>
            <li>30 year dipper of snuff and really loved it but really wanted to quit.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product, and the folks over at Oregon Mint Snuff Co. have done a phenomenal job</li>
            <li>It it extremely fine cut.</li>
            <li>I would say this mint snuff would fall under the category of &#x60;fine cut&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Too fine of a cut.</li>
            <li>Ok so I just received my Beaver chew in the mail, delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>He really liked this stuff and it helped so much with his cravings to have something in his lip like he&#x27;d been doing for 13 years.</li>
            <li>I needed the patches and the gum but was able to stop dipping from the first day I used this product.</li>
            <li>in zip lock mix put back in tin and good.  </li>
            <li>This is true, they are not.</li>
            <li>It has good moisture like regular snuff.</li>
            <li>It actually makes it easier to get a good pinch.</li>
            <li>this product is a true blessing to help.</li>
            <li>first of all this is very fine cut and gritty with some kind of sticky substance sprayed on it (probably to make it stick together ) which i don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>It actually tastes pretty good.</li>
            <li>It has a good taste, and generally recreates the experience of using real snuff.</li>
            <li>Nothing worth buying.</li>
            <li>In my case, the mental addiction and the habitual part of it is more challenging to overcome.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend this product as an indispensable tool in your quit.</li>
            <li>I bought it to get them off real chewing grizzly and it worked!</li>
            <li>Just the feel of having that round can in pocket makes me feel more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Then I add two large dips of Kodia....</li>
            <li>best price per can by far and bst fake snuff.</li>
            <li>It really helps my cravings.</li>
            <li>kinda makes me want real dip again</li>
            <li>My addiction was more mental.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t need 6 cans.</li>
            <li>It looks like the real thing.</li>
            <li>It feels like the real thing when in use.</li>
            <li>I choose to spit because it helps me feel like I&#x27;m dipping the real thing.</li>
            <li>Ok so I tried it and it makes a mess in your mouth, tastes good, lasts long, but my only problem with it is it doesn&#x27;t stay packed in your lip</li>
            <li>It is much more &#x60;gummy&#x27; than real snuff - which is neither good nor bad in my opinion.</li>
            <li>(again mainly it&#x27;s a texture thing to me)</li>
            <li>The chew has a nice flavor, and it lasts for a long long time.</li>
            <li>and after a week i could tell the cut back on tobacco in my system when i tried my normal stuff straight.</li>
            <li>Started mixing 50% snuff and 50% beaver and after each can, cut it a little bit more until there was only the beaver mint.  </li>
            <li>All natural mint chew.</li>
            <li>It has been several months since I have quit real tobacco.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to quit this will help keep your mouth busy.</li>
            <li>This a just walked away from it since I was completely off the nicotine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However they are VERY close, and I would say, as close a possible.</li>
            <li>It creates quite a bit of saliva which surprised me.</li>
            <li>Product was fresh and arrived before expected delivery date!</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff straight which is much harder for me (because of the texture) which suits the purpose for the time being but don&#x27;t see myself using it straight on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Recently had a shipping snafu (only one of the many times I&#x27;ve ordered from them) and they handled it promptly, humbly and generously.</li>
            <li>When I first put a dip in, I got immediate relief - which shows me that my addiction is 75% mental.</li>
            <li>I will say again however, that this is not EXACTLY like the real thing simply because it is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>GReat like all other fake dip sticky.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the same, of course, but he has said he is getting used to it and uses it frequently.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s not the same, of course, but he has said he is getting used to it and uses it frequently.</li>
            <li> what i found myself doing was mixing a can of this stuff with a can of normal chew to cut down the tobacco amount</li>
            <li> Once you try this you will realize that this addiction is not only physical, but mental.</li>
            <li> It does start tasting like tea leaves if u let it sit to long.</li>
            <li> I am not using any other nicotine supplement such a patches or gum, and I am doing</li>
            <li> This is overly priced and very dry.</li>
            <li> Gets all over your mouth and teeth much worse than normal dip.</li>
            <li> However the main negative is the weak flavor, only slightly minty.</li>
            <li> However I have learned from previous failed attempts that eventually even the nicotine patch has to come off and physical withdrawal symptoms in the long run are inevitable.</li>
            <li> so the big question is have i stopped &amp;#34;the hard stuff&amp;#34;?  </li>
            <li> Although it is a work in progress, it is working as I have gone from 5 cans of chew a week down to 2.</li>
            <li> It was not very good I ended up reordering mint in the pouches I only use very little out of one</li>
            <li> I will save the rest if I get the urge, but it&#x27;s not very enjoyable.</li>
            <li> i read a few reviews and decided to try &#x27;beaver chew&#x27; for the mint flavor and the moist texture (and the name).</li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have noticed a common trend in product reviews for smokeless tobacco alternatives; namely, disappointment in that these non-tobacco alternatives are not like the real thing.</li>
            <li> He had tries golden eagle in the past and he said it was like card board and nasty.</li>
            <li> This Mints snuff is sticky hard and gets every where.</li>
            <li> Not a good substitute for chewing tobacco.</li>
            <li> Consistency not good</li>
            <li> Terrible, extremely dry and little taste, A waste of Money.</li>
            <li> Was hard, chunky and uncomfortable to chew</li>
            <li> This taste like crap it doesn&#x27;t even taste like mint there is no point in buying this its a waste of your money and time</li>
            <li> and it got everywhere sadly</li>
            <li> Impossible to pack into your lip.</li>
            <li> and that wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> can worst stuff I ever tried.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Terrible, extremely dry and little taste, A waste of Money.</li>
            <li> Perfect, my aunt loved it!</li>
            <li> I give it five stars for what it says it is.  All natural mint chew. I have chewed for more than 20 years and I can admit that this is not at all a great alternative to good old fashioned chew. It has been several months since I have quit real tobacco. I used this product in conjunction with the patch and gum just to satisfy that oral itch. I bought six cans months ago and have 1 can left to date and haven&#x27;t used tobacco or this product since.  If you&#x27;re trying to quit this will help keep your mouth busy. I needed the patches and the gum but was able to stop dipping from the first day I used this product.</li>
            <li> my husband has been chewing for 25 years and this has helped him stop. no tobacco for over 2 months now.. thank you</li>
            <li> GReat like all other fake dip sticky.  What I do is take lid off put paper towl over open can and let it sit for a week.  Then I add two large dips of Kodia.... in zip lock mix put back in tin and good.  So a log of beaver to one tin and u good.  I have done this for a year and might stop the last step but we will c.  best price per can by far and bst fake snuff.</li>
            <li> i bought this brand for my boyfriend who is trying to quit using the mint skoal. i read a few reviews and decided to try &#x27;beaver chew&#x27; for the mint flavor and the moist texture (and the name). Michael likes it! it&#x27;s not the same, of course, but he has said he is getting used to it and uses it frequently. I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Seems like they altered the formula just a tad,it&#x27;s easier to get out and tastes great!&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work,thx.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I stopped chewing last year. I chewed for 15 years and in my opinion this is a great substitute. It really helps my cravings.</li>
            <li> I bought this and my friends and I LOVE it. I bought it to get them off real chewing grizzly and it worked! I even use it all the time! I will last a while too!</li>
            <li> using to help wean off smokeless tobacco - a great tool. good flavor but stickier than tobacco so can be messy.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using for some time and very happy with the product. Recently had a shipping snafu (only one of the many times I&#x27;ve ordered from them) and they handled it promptly, humbly and generously. Pleasure doing business with Oregon Mint Snuff Co.</li>
            <li> This has a good flavor and a good mouth feel.  It makes for a better choice compared to using tobacco.</li>
            <li> lets be honest, if you chew and are use to chew..this ain&#x27;t the same thing.  first of all this is very fine cut and gritty with some kind of sticky substance sprayed on it (probably to make it stick together ) which i don&#x27;t like. and of course you are not going to get the same effect as tobacco chew but the point is to break or substitute for  the oral fixation which i like. what i found myself doing was mixing a can of this stuff with a can of normal chew to cut down the tobacco amount and that wasn&#x27;t too bad (again mainly it&#x27;s a texture thing to me) and after a week i could tell the cut back on tobacco in my system when i tried my normal stuff straight. I have used this stuff straight which is much harder for me (because of the texture) which suits the purpose for the time being but don&#x27;t see myself using it straight on a regular basis. so the big question is have i stopped &amp;#34;the hard stuff&amp;#34;?  no, but it&#x27;s my own fault for giving up on myself.  I still mix it and if i stick to it i don&#x27;t see a problem quitting after 20 years.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used tobacco in over a year. Great placebos!!!!</li>
            <li> Gets all over your mouth and teeth much worse than normal dip. Impossible to pack into your lip. Though it is refreshing.</li>
            <li> 30 year dipper of snuff and really loved it but really wanted to quit.  I dipped mint flavored snuff and was able to transition off with this stuff.  Started mixing 50% snuff and 50% beaver and after each can, cut it a little bit more until there was only the beaver mint.  This a just walked away from it since I was completely off the nicotine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The chew has a nice flavor, and it lasts for a long long time. Will buy agian it satisfies the cravings.</li>
            <li> Not a good substitute for chewing tobacco. Consistency not good, you end up with mint in all over your mouth</li>
            <li> Was not that impressed.  The product was way to sticky, after I grabbed a pinch my fingers would be covered in it.  The product did not hold together well in the lip. However the main negative is the weak flavor, only slightly minty.</li>
            <li> Great product -- quickly delivered again!</li>
            <li> Ok so I just received my Beaver chew in the mail, delivery was quick. Ok so I tried it and it makes a mess in your mouth, tastes good, lasts long, but my only problem with it is it doesn&#x27;t stay packed in your lip well it gets all around your mouth and in your teeth.  Overall I think it&#x27;s crappy and won&#x27;t buy it again kinda makes me want real dip again</li>
            <li> There is no &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; substitute for tobacco. My addiction was more mental. I have only finished one can since I have quit (5weeks). The flavor lasts maybe ten minutes. It it extremely fine cut. I really didn&#x27;t need 6 cans. I will save the rest if I get the urge, but it&#x27;s not very enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something to substitute my dip. This is overly priced and very dry. Nothing worth buying.</li>
            <li> Was hard, chunky and uncomfortable to chew</li>
            <li> Like it a lot,mint flavor is May favorite,like Jack&#x27;s mint</li>
            <li> This stuff has great flavor. My dad loves this stuff! Great price!</li>
            <li> I saw this at a health-food store &amp; bought it on a whim for my boyfriend to help him quit chewing tobacco. I didn&#x27;t expect him to like it, but he said it&#x27;s \\&quot;not bad\\&quot; &amp; chews it daily to help with his cravings. He asked me to buy him some more cans, so glad I found it on amazon!</li>
            <li> It was not very good I ended up reordering mint in the pouches I only use very little out of one can worst stuff I ever tried.</li>
            <li> This taste like crap it doesn&#x27;t even taste like mint there is no point in buying this its a waste of your money and time</li>
            <li> Snapple isn&#x27;t made from the the best stuff on earth this is.</li>
            <li> The product tasted alot different than I thought. I received the product on time and the transaction went smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Just wasn&#x27;t a customer / product match.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend to help him quit chewing. He had tries golden eagle in the past and he said it was like card board and nasty. He really liked this stuff and it helped so much with his cravings to have something in his lip like he&#x27;d been doing for 13 years. He liked the taste and it damn sure smelled better then Copenhagen. It does start tasting like tea leaves if u let it sit to long. He just mixes it back up and it&#x27;s minty again. This made all the difference in him being successful in quitting!</li>
            <li> Many who are plagued with nicotine addiction - specifically those who prefer smokeless tobacco - will find this product to be instrumental in having a successful quit. I have noticed a common trend in product reviews for smokeless tobacco alternatives; namely, disappointment in that these non-tobacco alternatives are not like the real thing. This is true, they are not. However they are VERY close, and I would say, as close a possible. We tobacco addicts are going to have to come to grips with the fact that we cannot have our cake and eat it too.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this product provided me with immense relief from my cravings. Once you try this you will realize that this addiction is not only physical, but mental. In my case, the mental addiction and the habitual part of it is more challenging to overcome. This product has provided relief on both of those fronts. I am not using any other nicotine supplement such a patches or gum, and I am doing okay. I imagine if you combined this with patches you would not have any problems at all. However I have learned from previous failed attempts that eventually even the nicotine patch has to come off and physical withdrawal symptoms in the long run are inevitable. Sometimes you just have to bit the bullet.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very good quality. It has good moisture like regular snuff. It looks like the real thing. It is much more &#x60;gummy&#x27; than real snuff - which is neither good nor bad in my opinion. It actually makes it easier to get a good pinch. I would say this mint snuff would fall under the category of &#x60;fine cut&#x27;. It feels like the real thing when in use. It creates quite a bit of saliva which surprised me. You can spit if you choose to or you can swallow it. It actually tastes pretty good. I choose to spit because it helps me feel like I&#x27;m dipping the real thing. When I first put a dip in, I got immediate relief - which shows me that my addiction is 75% mental. This will definitely help you. Overall, this is a great product, and the folks over at Oregon Mint Snuff Co. have done a phenomenal job a creating an incredibly convincing product. I will say again however, that this is not EXACTLY like the real thing simply because it is not the real thing. This is going to be as good as it gets. It has a good taste, and generally recreates the experience of using real snuff. Just the feel of having that round can in pocket makes me feel more comfortable. So I highly recommend this product as an indispensable tool in your quit. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Product was fresh and arrived before expected delivery date!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re quitting or have just quit chewing or dipping Tobacco this product is a true blessing to help.</li>
            <li> Too fine of a cut. I used it for a few weeks and it got everywhere sadly, excellent flavor, if they made pouches I would use them every day!</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year chewer and figured it was time to quit. This stuff has awesome flavor and works great to keep my lip busy while I work on the quitting part. Although it is a work in progress, it is working as I have gone from 5 cans of chew a week down to 2. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This Mints snuff is sticky hard and gets every where. I gave most of it away. I do not recommend this product.</li>
