            <li>I decided to try this now, and it is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>The smell is incredible.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice texture and a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great after I wash it</li>
            <li>Great product from a great seller.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve been really happy using these.</li>
            <li>husband has disgustingly beautiful, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Very glad for this product, thank you.</li>
            <li>I was able to style my hair and go out without being embarrassed!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Amazing,</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Really nice for cleansing my wavy/ curly hair without over drying.</li>
            <li>This was a nice transition.</li>
            <li>It lathers really nicely, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product.</li>
            <li>and I do have some color in places so it was even nice on that.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice also.</li>
            <li>After three shampoos and conditionings, my hair is so nice</li>
            <li>Clean hair and a great way to appeal to the senses makes this a beneficial shampoo.</li>
            <li>well my hair just looks and feels better.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well, appears to be alcohol and sulfate free while being effective.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>So excited to find a shampoo and conditioner that work!</li>
            <li>but in case it does: my hair strands are fine</li>
            <li>I always switched around on products (L&#x27;oreal Sulfate Free, Dove).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sulfate &amp; paraban free</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fantastic to</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a unpleasant smell, just strong.</li>
            <li>This shampoo just doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel or look clean.</li>
            <li>My hair was snarly and i felt like it didn&#x27;t clean my hair.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, I found it doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li>I most certainly will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>This crème is the best for thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because my scalf is so healthy thanks to this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m moving away from super sudsy shampoo.</li>
            <li>A very good thing in a small package.</li>
            <li>I wash it at night and let it air dry, then in the morning, all I have to do is brush it and it looks shiny and feels silky with a good amount of volume.</li>
            <li>This product has a fragrance I enjoy, but does not moisturize my hair as much</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth trying if you can find a deal on it.</li>
            <li>My scalp is not totally itch free, but it is sooooo much better.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes feel that other moisturizing shampoos don&#x27;t do a good job of lathering or cleaning, and you have to use a ton of product.</li>
            <li>After purchasing both the shampoo and the conditioner, I went home and tried them as directed right away.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and so super soft.</li>
            <li>super straight.  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used it I have lost virtually no hair.  </li>
            <li>I have recently switched to organix products and I love the ones I have.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong, however, I find the smell fades pretty quick.</li>
            <li>It has that certain salon-y smell, which I really do love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not buy the conditioner with it, I just use my L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Total Repair 5 conditioner in the ends, though I could really go without when using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and my hair really looks great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, while shampooing there is a smell, but it smells like argan oil, which I expected and actually enjoyed.</li>
            <li>Even my hairdresser commented on how much I was losing.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s gentle on color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using both currently, it has brought a healthy shine to my hair, my hair feels soft and</li>
            <li>I noticed it makes his hair extra soft and shiny. :-)</li>
            <li>spotted the Moroccan Argan Crème shampoo and conditioner at Walgreens and decided to give it a go because I do love other Organix products.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price at all when you only use it every 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li>I love the deep conditioner of this line, but the shampoo and regular conditioner</li>
            <li>The price is right at Walmart and their selection is big too!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product several times, just be sure the shampoo was the culprit of my limp, dirty-looking hair.  </li>
            <li>Strong scent and over moisturizes for my thick medium length hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine going back to my old shampoo ever again!?  </li>
            <li>My hair is very long, naturally wavy, normal texture, and not color treated.</li>
            <li>First off, use this shampoo and conditioner duo only if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li>recommend this for anyone with normal to dry hair.</li>
            <li>I was shocked at how nice my hair was after one use!  </li>

            <li> For when your hair is frizzy...</li>
            <li> I dye my hair A LOT. I generally have to put a lot of crap in my hair to keep it healthy looking thanks to all the abuse I&#x27;ve done to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I spotted the Moroccan Argan Crème shampoo and conditioner at Walgreens and decided to give it a go because I do love other Organix products. First off, use this shampoo and conditioner duo only if you have dry hair. If you don&#x27;t have dry hair, just go with the shampoo, pass on the conditioner. I&#x27;m using both currently, it has brought a healthy shine to my hair, my hair feels soft and well my hair just looks and feels better. The smell is a little strong, however, I find the smell fades pretty quick. It&#x27;s not a unpleasant smell, just strong. Honestly, I&#x27;ve been really happy using these. I don&#x27;t have to load up my hair with all this extra crap (leave in conditioners, hair oils, etc.),I don&#x27;t need to brush my hair (which I hate doing!) and my hair really looks great.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has disgustingly beautiful, healthy hair. He&#x27;s started using the shampoo and he loves the smell. I noticed it makes his hair extra soft and shiny. :-)</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times, just be sure the shampoo was the culprit of my limp, dirty-looking hair.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type (curly and thick) but this is awful for me.  I love the deep conditioner of this line, but the shampoo and regular conditioner I would never buy again.  This shampoo just doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel or look clean.</li>
            <li> Ive tried different kinds of organic shampoo, (A couple kinds of Kiss my face, Natures Gate, and another one from my local organic store I can&#x27;t remember the name of) but none worked for my hair. It was like it wasn&#x27;t made for long thick hair. My hair was snarly and i felt like it didn&#x27;t clean my hair. I decided to try this now, and it is AWESOME! Definitely made for long thick hair! So excited to find a shampoo and conditioner that work! I thought i was going to have to go back regular shampoo and conditioner. Very glad for this product, thank you. Try the conditioner too. It&#x27;s Amazing, No more snarl&#x27;s! yay!</li>
            <li> Since my hair is dry and frizzy, I have been looking for product to moisturize and assist in taming it.  This product has a fragrance I enjoy, but does not moisturize my hair as much I though it would.</li>
            <li> Really nice for cleansing my wavy/ curly hair without over drying. I&#x27;m moving away from super sudsy shampoo. This was a nice transition.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is hard to find. In one week I must have went to 5 stores and they didnt have.  This shampoo is luxurious and, for me, I dont feel like I need to use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice texture and a wonderful scent. It moisturizes well, appears to be alcohol and sulfate free while being effective. Clean hair and a great way to appeal to the senses makes this a beneficial shampoo. A very good thing in a small package.</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo for $3.99 at a discount retailer, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. This shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and so super soft. I did not buy the conditioner with it, I just use my L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Total Repair 5 conditioner in the ends, though I could really go without when using this shampoo. I wash it at night and let it air dry, then in the morning, all I have to do is brush it and it looks shiny and feels silky with a good amount of volume. My hair is very long, naturally wavy, normal texture, and not color treated. I have been using ultra moisturizing products in it formulated for color treated, dry, coarse hair for years and feel that is the reason my hair can be air dried and still look like I spent time styling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is cloudy looking, like if you were to mix shampoo and conditioner together. It lathers really nicely, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product. I sometimes feel that other moisturizing shampoos don&#x27;t do a good job of lathering or cleaning, and you have to use a ton of product. I always shampoo twice no matter what shampoo I&#x27;m using, so I would recommend doing that if you feel that this (or any) moisturizing shampoo isn&#x27;t doing a sufficient job of getting your hair feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice an off-putting smell at all. Yes, while shampooing there is a smell, but it smells like argan oil, which I expected and actually enjoyed. Afterward, my hair smells like I just came from the salon. It has that certain salon-y smell, which I really do love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone with normal to dry hair. Even if it&#x27;s not your daily shampoo and you just put it in rotation (maybe for days when you shower twice or after swimming in the summer), it&#x27;s worth trying if you can find a deal on it. If your hair gets oily within hours of washing it, I would not recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, medium length, don&#x27;t overly blow dry or dye my hair -- I&#x27;m not sure why this product is getting such crazy good reviews, it didn&#x27;t impress me and definitely didn&#x27;t moisturize.  It did add some shine to my hair, but that&#x27;s truly about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 and my hair is colored, shoulder length and wavy.  As colored hair tends to be, mine was rather dry on the ends.  I always switched around on products (L&#x27;oreal Sulfate Free, Dove).  I started using Pantene Ice (shampoo &amp; conditioner) last summer and realized that I was losing ALOT of hair.  I equated it to menopause &amp; stress.  Even my hairdresser commented on how much I was losing.  After 7 months (I don&#x27;t go in for cuts often) she asked what I was using then warned me to never, ever use Pantene.  She told me they use the same ingredients as floor cleaner &amp; that&#x27;s what was wrong.  So I researched and decided to try this.  I will NEVER use another product.  Oh my gosh!!!  From the first time I used it I have lost virtually no hair.  The smell is incredible.  It makes my hair soft &amp; shiny.  The lather feels so luxurious from the oil but it never weighs my hair down.  It&#x27;s sulfate &amp; paraban free so it&#x27;s gentle on color and there is no animal testing.  I buy mine at Walmart &amp; it&#x27;s like $5.67 or so.  Not a bad price at all when you only use it every 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I found it doesn&#x27;t clean well. My scalp itches or flakes a little, even shortly after shampooing. I&#x27;ve tried varying the quantity applied, increasing the rinsing time, etc.--made no difference. I don&#x27;t know why this would make any difference but in case it does: my hair strands are fine but I have a moderate number of them, color treated, and moderately oily.</li>
            <li> This crème is the best for thick, curly hair.  It cleans without stripping and make my hair feel luxurious!  The conditioner gets the tangles out well.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fantastic to me.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of my hairs don&#x27;t disappear anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Because my scalf is so healthy thanks to this item.</li>
            <li> I love it.  My hair feels great after I wash it and I do have some color in places so it was even nice on that.  I most certainly will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have recently switched to organix products and I love the ones I have. It smells nice also.</li>
            <li> Great product from a great seller.</li>
            <li> Strong scent and over moisturizes for my thick medium length hair. Won&#x27;t buy this one again. I&#x27;ll stick to the other products from Organix.</li>
            <li> My hair was out of control dry and frizzy.  My head was out of control itching from the dryness too.  I was embarrassed to go out in public.  I accidentally came across this after a sales person told me to try Argan oil for my problem.  After purchasing both the shampoo and the conditioner, I went home and tried them as directed right away.  I was shocked at how nice my hair was after one use!  I was able to style my hair and go out without being embarrassed!  After three shampoos and conditionings, my hair is so nice I can&#x27;t imagine going back to my old shampoo ever again!?  The price is right at Walmart and their selection is big too!  My scalp is not totally itch free, but it is sooooo much better.  I have thin hair super straight.  I recommend this product to anyone with dry hair and scalp.  It works!!</li>
