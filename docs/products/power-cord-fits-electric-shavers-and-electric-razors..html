            <li>Good fit.</li>
            <li>seems to be as good as the original cord.</li>
            <li>good Item, I found the original</li>
            <li>IT FITS AND WORKS FINE!</li>
            <li>Maybe the end needs to be more flexible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It fit nice and snug, no falling out during use.</li>
            <li>This might be why some reviewers had problems with this cord fitting their Remington shavers.</li>
            <li>I have an ancient norelco two head razor that I love and has been working forever</li>
            <li>This one replaced it perfectly and I&#x27;m back in business.</li>
            <li>excellent replacement for the cord left in the wilds of Tennessee.</li>
            <li>bought for my norelco shaver fit perfectly but but razor completely died on me so wont be using it anytime soon</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to buy a whole new razor; but this fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Ordering was easy.</li>
            <li>does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>This works fine</li>
            <li>When I received the cord it charged up my unit just fine.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why it fits also easily in the original travel bag.</li>
            <li>I am sure this product works well and does the job well, probably worth the $4.00 but be warned if you are buying this for the Braun 6 in 1 Cruzer, it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Advertised to fit No record shaver</li>
            <li>it said it would fit.</li>
            <li>The cord fit my 1970 Norelco and it runs well.</li>
            <li>The cord was said to fit my razor.</li>
            <li>Seems to fit and work.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit my girlfriends razor.</li>
            <li>it would but didn&#x27;t the holes don&#x27;t fit in the lots</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>All and all I returned it on priciple, but it probably cost me more to do it than the charger was worth.  </li>
            <li>Braun has a special sized hole and even after attempting to trim the plastic housing to fit, it doesn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li>Works just like the original, and is snug the way the original cord was . . .</li>
            <li>though the description read fits most razors and showed the exact picture</li>
            <li>This new cord has a nice snug fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it, just what I was looking for it also fit my norelco shaver thank you so much again</li>
            <li>Since this old Norelco shaver still shaves great, while my new Norelco Arcitec doesn&#x27;t shave worth beans, I was delighted to find this new cord for it.</li>
            <li>I have a norelco razor and it seems to fit exactly like the original plug in..</li>
            <li>It fit an older electric razor just fine.</li>
            <li>Sure beats buying a new razor when the old one has worked like a champ for many years.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t return because it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a straight, not spiral, replacement cord like my original.</li>
            <li>It is also very flexible like the original cable.</li>
            <li>(As my 1982 shaver&#x27;s in storage right now, can&#x27;t give you model number.)</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Was just as expected, will work well good quality and very durable.</li>
            <li>Teh delivery was very fast</li>
            <li>A very unsatisfactory experience!</li>
            <li>You know how it is ;-)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to give the prudict any stars because I didn&#x27;t actually get to use it , but I am sure it is worth atleast an average rating as it is generically stating it fits electric razors, but it doesn&#x27;t fit mine xD</li>
            <li>I was so thankful that it was this easy to find one that would fit and actually work without having to buy it and return it several times.  </li>
            <li>So i have to keep writting haha.</li>
            <li>When my 1995 shaver cord started falling out of shaver socket during use, I tried that cord in my older shaver.</li>
            <li>My husband had an older model Norelco and lost the cord.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t expect more from a razor cord that cost little and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>works fine but the plug in connection is hard and has kind of a loose fit and tends to slip out when pulled slightly.</li>
            <li>Somehow when I moved, I lost the cord to my brand new Norelco.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how my grandson managed to lose his power cord to the new razor</li>
            <li>For the last several years, the original cord on my old Remington 6M2L-1 ladies shaver has been falling off/disconnecting from shaver during use.</li>
            <li>Works well on my old and new norelco shavers.</li>
            <li>Tested each of the two power cord I ordered and the fit was tight.</li>
            <li>(For me, it&#x27;s no problem because I plan to use my old 1995 cord for the 1982 shaver.)</li>
            <li>I only wish I&#x27;d ordered it a whole lot sooner.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco Reflex Plus 6423 LC  lives on to shave again.</li>
            <li>The cord on my 40 year old Norelco Women&#x27;s razor with manicure &amp; facial attachments shorted out.  </li>
            <li>apparently the 1982 shavers have slightly larger connection posts where the cord plugs in.</li>

            <li> Even though I could not find my 6615X listed, the pic looked exactly like the one I left behind in a hotel.</li>
            <li> This cord was inexpensive with no high shipping charges and it works well.</li>
            <li> When I lost my razor charger cord, I figured I would not find a replacement, since the razor is at least 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> As this new cord I purchased fits snug in my 1995 shaver, it possibly could be difficult to plug into the 1982 shaver.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I took a chance and ordered this cord.  </li>
            <li> But as the 1995 shaver gave an even closer shave than the other, I continued using it--while holding onto the cord to keep it from disconnecting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Broke down in 3 weeks just by itself, now it&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li> but I am not going to mess it with</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say about this product other than it is as it was described and it arrived within the time given.  </li>
            <li> It did not fit my shaver</li>
            <li> The cord did not fit the razor.  </li>
            <li> I even paid for expedited shipping for a product that does not fit the razor</li>
            <li> IT DID NOT FIT MY RAZOR</li>
            <li> It did not fit my norelco electric razor.</li>
            <li> This item did not fit my razor.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product did not fit my shaver.</li>
            <li> It would be helpful to list all the shavers it fits or does not fit</li>
            <li> I am not sure why</li>
            <li> My product was so old, they didn&#x27;t have it in their data base.  </li>
            <li> A tad scary buying from description that doesn&#x27;t include number of my 3612 Braun Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> so I tossed it; as too expensive to return it.</li>
            <li> does not work with my shaver made the wrong choice it told me</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It did not fit my shaver and I had to return it at a cost almost exceeding the price of the product.  A very unsatisfactory experience!</li>
            <li> Advertised to fit No record shaver but it didn&#x27;t fitl</li>
            <li> Perfect fits Remington R-91. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Works well on my old and new norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> seems to be as good as the original cord. does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> The cord did not fit the razor.  I tried to return it, but it wasn&#x27;t accepted.  I even paid for expedited shipping for a product that does not fit the razor it said it would fit.</li>
            <li> I bought it twice. Maybe the end needs to be more flexible. Good to know that exists.</li>
            <li> Does what its meant to do</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say about this product other than it is as it was described and it arrived within the time given.  It fitted into my shaver and works well.</li>
            <li> This cord fits my Norelco Speedshaver SC7830 that I think was made in the 1940s or 1950s. Since this old Norelco shaver still shaves great, while my new Norelco Arcitec doesn&#x27;t shave worth beans, I was delighted to find this new cord for it.</li>
            <li> The cord on my 40 year old Norelco Women&#x27;s razor with manicure &amp; facial attachments shorted out.  I checked with Norelco for a replacement cord.  My product was so old, they didn&#x27;t have it in their data base.  Based on other reviews, I took a chance and ordered this cord.  It came in a couple of days and fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a straight, not spiral, replacement cord like my original. But Remington discontinued them.  At this low price, decided to order this cord. I&#x27;m glad I did. The cord works great and the spiral isn&#x27;t as bad as I&#x27;d thought! For the last several years, the original cord on my old Remington 6M2L-1 ladies shaver has been falling off/disconnecting from shaver during use. This new cord has a nice snug fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted, as some people say there are some Remington shavers this cord doesn&#x27;t fit: I purchased my 6M2L-1 in 1995, after the cord entirely stopped working on a nearly identical Remington I bought in 1982 and was unable to find a replacement cord. (As my 1982 shaver&#x27;s in storage right now, can&#x27;t give you model number.) When my 1995 shaver cord started falling out of shaver socket during use, I tried that cord in my older shaver. It fit nice and snug, no falling out during use. But as the 1995 shaver gave an even closer shave than the other, I continued using it--while holding onto the cord to keep it from disconnecting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So apparently the 1982 shavers have slightly larger connection posts where the cord plugs in. As this new cord I purchased fits snug in my 1995 shaver, it possibly could be difficult to plug into the 1982 shaver. (For me, it&#x27;s no problem because I plan to use my old 1995 cord for the 1982 shaver.) This might be why some reviewers had problems with this cord fitting their Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> IT DID NOT FIT MY RAZOR AS INDICATED</li>
            <li> The cord fit my 1970 Norelco and it runs well. Teh delivery was very fast and I don&#x27;t think you could ask anything else.</li>
            <li> Somehow when I moved, I lost the cord to my brand new Norelco. I bought this cord and have been very happy with it. Charges perfectly, and fits snugly in the razor.</li>
            <li> Not compatible with Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> I have an ancient norelco two head razor that I love and has been working forever (~45 years!) The cord shorted out. This one replaced it perfectly and I&#x27;m back in business.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy. This works fine, the quality is good and it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do. I only wish I&#x27;d ordered it a whole lot sooner.</li>
            <li> A tad scary buying from description that doesn&#x27;t include number of my 3612 Braun Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;BUT IT FITS AND WORKS FINE!</li>
            <li> yes is just rite thank</li>
            <li> The works great. Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> The cord was said to fit my razor. It did not. I just did not do enough research. My fault.</li>
            <li> Seems to fit and work.  Can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;I love&amp;#34; such a utilitarin item, but no issues.</li>
            <li> I am sure this product works well and does the job well, probably worth the $4.00 but be warned if you are buying this for the Braun 6 in 1 Cruzer, it doesn&#x27;t fit. Braun has a special sized hole and even after attempting to trim the plastic housing to fit, it doesn&#x27;t charge. I am not sure why but I am not going to mess it with I am going to buy a new trimmer. I don&#x27;t want to give the prudict any stars because I didn&#x27;t actually get to use it , but I am sure it is worth atleast an average rating as it is generically stating it fits electric razors, but it doesn&#x27;t fit mine xD</li>
            <li> Ordering was easy. Arrived in good condition. Tested each of the two power cord I ordered and the fit was tight. Thank You</li>
            <li> It did not fit my norelco electric razor.</li>
            <li> Works just like the original, and is snug the way the original cord was . . . excellent replacement for the cord left in the wilds of Tennessee.</li>
            <li> great product had no problems with the product i would recommend to my friends and family 5 stars thank you</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement cord!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work in my Braun so I tossed it; as too expensive to return it.</li>
            <li> Good service and nice product that fit my shaver perfectly. Arrive at my house just in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> When I lost my razor charger cord, I figured I would not find a replacement, since the razor is at least 10 years old.  This cord was inexpensive with no high shipping charges and it works well.</li>
            <li> Broke down in 3 weeks just by itself, now it&#x27;s not working. I hope someone from customer services reaches me about this.</li>
            <li> This cord works great and was nice and cheap. Shipping was super fast. It is just what I needed to get shaving again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit my girlfriends razor. Sent it back, &amp; I will be sending back the second wire too ASAP.</li>
            <li> Good fit. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> It does its work, i have a philips norelco 6900 series and it&#x27;s working. So i have to keep writting haha.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how my grandson managed to lose his power cord to the new razor I bought him but he did.  I was so thankful that it was this easy to find one that would fit and actually work without having to buy it and return it several times.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This item did not fit my razor.&lt;br /&gt;Even though the description read fits most razors and showed the exact picture&lt;br /&gt;of the razor I have.</li>
            <li> I love it, just what I was looking for it also fit my norelco shaver thank you so much again</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. My husband had an older model Norelco and lost the cord. I thought I would have to buy a whole new razor; but this fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Perfect it fits my Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li> does not work with my shaver made the wrong choice it told me it would but didn&#x27;t the holes don&#x27;t fit in the lots</li>
            <li> ... with my BRAUN shaver as prommized.  It is also very flexible like the original cable. That&#x27;s why it fits also easily in the original travel bag.</li>
            <li> good Item, I found the original so now I have a spare, Murphy&#x27;s Law! You know how it is ;-)</li>
            <li> It fit an older electric razor just fine.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this as a replacement charger for his existing shaver.  He researched it and it said it would work for his Phillips shaver.  It didn&#x27;t fit.  We did return it but there was a charge for return shipping plus we paid for the shipping to us which was the same as the cost of the charger.  All and all I returned it on priciple, but it probably cost me more to do it than the charger was worth.  I didn&#x27;t come ahead on that one.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It fits. It works. My old Norelco Reflex Plus 6423 LC  lives on to shave again. I couldn&#x27;t expect more from a razor cord that cost little and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> works fine but the plug in connection is hard and has kind of a loose fit and tends to slip out when pulled slightly.</li>
            <li> works great! I have a norelco razor and it seems to fit exactly like the original plug in.. no complaints</li>
            <li> Was just as expected, will work well good quality and very durable. (Thank You) Jack, Karen and family Arvada Colorado</li>
            <li> Even though I could not find my 6615X listed, the pic looked exactly like the one I left behind in a hotel. When I received the cord it charged up my unit just fine. Sure beats buying a new razor when the old one has worked like a champ for many years.</li>
            <li> This product did not fit my shaver. It would be helpful to list all the shavers it fits or does not fit so one can know weather it will work on your shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t return because it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost.</li>
            <li> bought for my norelco shaver fit perfectly but but razor completely died on me so wont be using it anytime soon but excellent sevice and delivery from company</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase when traveling to Spain with the family. Each one of us has a cellphone, mac and ipods, so this set of 6 plug adapters was awesome to have. Good purchase and reliable seller. I recommend this seller to anyone. Thank You.</li>
