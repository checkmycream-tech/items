            <li>If you&#x27;re feeling a little sketchy about this, these brush heads do work perfectly with my [[ASIN:</li>

            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>

            <li> Came as advertised.  Wished these things were cheaper.  Reminds me of print cartridges.  Work well, but you pay way more for them in the long run than the unit itself.  A racket.  However, product wise, these shipped as advertised and worked well.</li>
            <li> Now, that I know which replacement heads to order, we will continue to order these replacement heads. They last anywhere from 2- 6 months before needing to be changed. I could never go back to manual brushing. These are great.</li>
            <li> Very pleased to find the exact brush heads we needed for our Sonicare system.  As they continue to come out with new models, it gets harder to find the brush heads you need.  Very, Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> Fits perfect as the original heads.</li>
            <li> The brushes are first quality and came quickly in a very nice reusable pouch.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them and will purchase them again when I run out. Glad to save some money through this offer!</li>
            <li> I really like these replacement head for my Sonicare.  Cleans so deep.  Great results.  I will always use Amazon.com to replace my brush heads.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, great price!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product as advertised</li>
            <li> A very good buy.  I&#x27;ve used these brush heads for many years and I was happy to find them for a good price</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Packaged properly and product is working perfectly with my Sonicare toothbrush.  My teeth have never been cleaner.</li>

            <li> Nothing better in this category than the original replacement heads.  They last longer and they do not wake up the neighbors.</li>
            <li> I started out liking it but the first one crapped out after 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Here are six more words okay?</li>

            <li> this price is great, very good, excellent price for a 3-pack.  How silly that you need more words to submit this.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re feeling a little sketchy about this, these brush heads do work perfectly with my [[ASIN:B000HHANVW Philips HX3351/02 Sonicare Xtreme e3000 Power Toothbrush]], and the bonus travel case comes in pretty handy for storage (it can hold two brush heads). Really, the only difference I&#x27;ve noticed between these and the ones you buy from the retail boxes at the grocery store is that these bristles are green while the ones from the store have white and blue bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am statisfied with my purchase as this listing offers the best deal for these brushes on Amazon. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more from this listing as long as the prices stay low.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain. Works perfect.  I like the carry bag which is soft an easier to travel with. Prior to this I had the hard carry case that was rather bulky in my suitcase.</li>

            <li> This is the toothbrush my dentist recommends.</li>
            <li> Had great difficulty finding these replacement brushes. Will definitely reorder when necessary.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Had trouble finding the right product to use but when I finally did it was just what I needed.</li>

            <li> Shipped quickly and the price is about half.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> Best quality replacement heads on amazon! I&#x27;m never buying from Philips again!</li>
            <li> Came right away and was exactly as pictured. I already have the base and I just needed some replacement heads. This is the best toothbrush ever! Cleans really nicely!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to buy this product in a 3-pack cost effective too.</li>
