            <li>However, this wash is amazing.</li>
            <li>We both agreed, this product is effective at any age.</li>
            <li>It also has a wonderful scent and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend you eat your cleanser, but it&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t taste all chemically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not harsh just perfect.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t looked better.  </li>
            <li>I love the SUKI line of products.  </li>
            <li>I use this cleanser daily and am so happy with it!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d swear my skin looks much better after using this for awhile.</li>
            <li>This is, hands-down, one of my all-time favorite exfoliating cleansers.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s on the pricey end</li>
            <li>and IT&#x27;S IMPORTANT!</li>
            <li>so not for everyone, but for those who are looking for more, this is your answer.</li>
            <li>I received many compliments.</li>
            <li>and I returned the Algenist (too pricey) and ordered more Suki products.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE Suki products -</li>
            <li>but I have been using for about five months now and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, I&#x27;m in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST Facial Exfoliate Foaming Cleanser I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I truly love SUKI&#x27;S.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The lemon smell is so refreshing in the morning</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the exfoliation it provides.</li>
            <li>It took me two weeks to get better from hives, and I am still taking Benadryl to make sure that all the hives are gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve accidentally gotten some onto my mouth before, and I have to say, it does taste pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I already have pretty good skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean and overall is a great product with good ingredients.</li>
            <li>Once you have mixed some of the Exfoliate with some water on your face it nicely foams up and makes it a very nice scrub.</li>
            <li>It cleans your skin very nicely and makes it feel very soft.</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle exfoliate but effective.</li>
            <li>I already have clear smooth skin and was just looking for a product to keep it nice and clean....seems to do the job!</li>
            <li>I even got a little in my mouth and it was delicious!  </li>
            <li>I find this product most useful when I get home from work during the night period; you can literally feel the difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gritting when you put it on your water-soaked hand and eventually, after rubbing on your face, turns in to a rich and creamy concoction.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and refreshed after using this scrub</li>
            <li>This has clean ingredients - which is a plus</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel wonderfully clean.  </li>
            <li>My daughter tried it and exclaimed how clean her skin felt.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Hope you like it as much as I do :)</li>
            <li>of course, I immediately ordered the full size set of these items.  </li>
            <li>AND you can use it at as a sweet lip exfoliant as well.</li>
            <li>I called Suki, Inc to verify if it should be full</li>
            <li>And the fact that it&#x27;s all natural is really nice -</li>
            <li>The Suki&#x27;s scrub smells very nice and is not really drying.</li>
            <li>I love sampling new products, but very rarely do I find something better than my old standby products--however, I did spring for this scrub/cleanser.    </li>
            <li>The sugar gives a great scrub and leaves you feeling clean, soft, not dry and lemony.</li>
            <li>It is natural, does a good job of ex-foliating and leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It also smells WONDERFUL--and while I wouldn&#x27;t eat it on purpose, I can report that a little got in my mouth one morning, and it was nice and sweet.  :)</li>
            <li>The only thing better would be a body scrub version!</li>
            <li>After doing some research on diet changes and using more natural products on my face and body I started to try Suki&#x27;s line of skin care products</li>
            <li>Some worked better than others, but none of them really helped all that much.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, I love natural products, and that&#x27;s why I tried this, but the results trump ANYTHING I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li>Who knew that sugar and rice could make such a great natural cleanser?</li>
            <li>Ingredients worth $3.00 MAX.</li>
            <li>My mom immediately noticed and I gave her a week&#x27;s worth of Suki face to try.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of lemongrass, and it&#x27;s really nice first thing in the morning when I stumble out of bed and get ready for work.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so clean and soft !!!  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it after shaving or on shaving days, but every other day this gives an amazing clean slate in regards to your face.</li>
            <li>It also lasts for a pretty long time, which is nice considering the price tag.  </li>
            <li>She is a lifelong Shiseido addict; imagine my surprise when she asked for more Suki!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is the product organic, it smells deliciously refreshing</li>
            <li>I probably use this more than than suggested probably 3 or 4 x a week.. works well to cleanse since I only use oils on my skin (jojoba, apricot, avocado as mosturizers, olive oil for makeup removal).</li>
            <li>smells great, gentle enough for almost daily use, reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to try a gentle daily scrubby cleanser and love it.</li>
            <li>the product is good, however I feel a film on my face after using and not sure what it is</li>
            <li>and I have recommended it to a few people who also fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>In which case, it is pretty decently priced given the quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy/foamy</li>
            <li>its been problematic my whole life - very severe eczema, cystic acne, etc.  </li>
            <li>I had real issues with my skin.</li>
            <li>It really helps to wake me up.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li>really...</li>
            <li>Love Suki&#x27;s products - I am in my early 30s and still get acne quite regularly.  </li>
            <li>When I try new products I do not really notice a difference, but with this product my face is even clearer and more radiant.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed too big of a change in the oiliness, but I don&#x27;t use the full suki line, either.  </li>
            <li>It scrubs really well without being too harsh or rough on my skin, and afterwards it feels extremely smooth, very clean, and that nice tight feeling.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of the price, wish it was cheaper, as I run through this fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I chose this product for the high reviews.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it really helped to clear my skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few in my time but this one is truly srumptious :).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hours later, my skin was still fresh, soft and NOT OILY!</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t use it everyday, more like every 2-3 days, because of how well it exfoliates - I don&#x27;t want to overdo it and stress my skin!  </li>
            <li>Use the size of a dime or less, add a little water, gently apply and wash off - that easy - noticeable improvement immediately - and over time, skin feels and looks more firm and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I can go all day, blotting only once or twice, with fresh, soft, non-oily skin and my makeup looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and refreshed without being dry or tight, and lightly moisturized after using the balancing day</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much, so I think it will last a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rare we both agree on one product because our Asian skin types are different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, I normally have quite sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>So far though its working miracles!</li>
            <li>You can mix it with a little water in your hand if you just want to use it as a cleanser, but I think if is fine to use every day as an exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a women in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin -</li>
            <li>I definitely didn&#x27;t have that problem, and if you do, I&#x27;d suggest that you don&#x27;t judge the whole line by it.  </li>
            <li>wow I have been using this cleaners for about two years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22, and an aspiring Sports Business professional.</li>
            <li>Several enlarged oil glands on my forehead, which a dermatologist said would have to be professionally removed (which would leave scabs for a couple of weeks) and would then most likely come back later, are now diminishing by themselves.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but well worth whatever you have to do to get that money!</li>
            <li>I love the creamy foam of Origins, but once the weather settled into the fall, my skin felt tight and dry.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it has a rich lathering foam like that of a high end product like Clarin&#x27;s and smells divine.</li>
            <li>I see that some prior reviews say that the scrubbing action is zilch, and that the exfoliating beads just disappear and don&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not cheap, but they are so worth it.  </li>
            <li>Granted, my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive OR dry--I would perhaps hesitate before recommending this product to people with very dry and/or sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li>Did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen decreased breakouts, more even skin, and just overall it leaves you feeling refreshed/radiant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half Asian with oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li>If you have acne-prone skin, yes, you will most likely have a few small breakouts.</li>

            <li> Who knew that sugar and rice could make such a great natural cleanser?</li>
            <li> Ingredients worth $3.00 MAX.</li>
            <li> My mom immediately noticed and I gave her a week&#x27;s worth of Suki face to try.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of lemongrass, and it&#x27;s really nice first thing in the morning when I stumble out of bed and get ready for work.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin so clean and soft !!!  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it after shaving or on shaving days, but every other day this gives an amazing clean slate in regards to your face.</li>
            <li> It also lasts for a pretty long time, which is nice considering the price tag.  </li>
            <li> She is a lifelong Shiseido addict; imagine my surprise when she asked for more Suki!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is the product organic, it smells deliciously refreshing</li>
            <li> I probably use this more than than suggested probably 3 or 4 x a week.. works well to cleanse since I only use oils on my skin (jojoba, apricot, avocado as mosturizers, olive oil for makeup removal).</li>
            <li> smells great, gentle enough for almost daily use, reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to try a gentle daily scrubby cleanser and love it.</li>
            <li> the product is good, however I feel a film on my face after using and not sure what it is</li>
            <li> and I have recommended it to a few people who also fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> In which case, it is pretty decently priced given the quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy/foamy</li>
            <li> its been problematic my whole life - very severe eczema, cystic acne, etc.  </li>
            <li> I had real issues with my skin.</li>
            <li> It really helps to wake me up.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li> really...</li>
            <li> Love Suki&#x27;s products - I am in my early 30s and still get acne quite regularly.  </li>
            <li> When I try new products I do not really notice a difference, but with this product my face is even clearer and more radiant.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed too big of a change in the oiliness, but I don&#x27;t use the full suki line, either.  </li>
            <li> It scrubs really well without being too harsh or rough on my skin, and afterwards it feels extremely smooth, very clean, and that nice tight feeling.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of the price, wish it was cheaper, as I run through this fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I chose this product for the high reviews.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it really helped to clear my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few in my time but this one is truly srumptious :).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hours later, my skin was still fresh, soft and NOT OILY!</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t use it everyday, more like every 2-3 days, because of how well it exfoliates - I don&#x27;t want to overdo it and stress my skin!  </li>
            <li> Use the size of a dime or less, add a little water, gently apply and wash off - that easy - noticeable improvement immediately - and over time, skin feels and looks more firm and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I can go all day, blotting only once or twice, with fresh, soft, non-oily skin and my makeup looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face felt clean and refreshed without being dry or tight, and lightly moisturized after using the balancing day</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much, so I think it will last a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rare we both agree on one product because our Asian skin types are different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, I normally have quite sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> So far though its working miracles!</li>
            <li> You can mix it with a little water in your hand if you just want to use it as a cleanser, but I think if is fine to use every day as an exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a women in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin -</li>
            <li> I definitely didn&#x27;t have that problem, and if you do, I&#x27;d suggest that you don&#x27;t judge the whole line by it.  </li>
            <li> wow I have been using this cleaners for about two years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22, and an aspiring Sports Business professional.</li>
            <li> Several enlarged oil glands on my forehead, which a dermatologist said would have to be professionally removed (which would leave scabs for a couple of weeks) and would then most likely come back later, are now diminishing by themselves.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but well worth whatever you have to do to get that money!</li>
            <li> I love the creamy foam of Origins, but once the weather settled into the fall, my skin felt tight and dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it has a rich lathering foam like that of a high end product like Clarin&#x27;s and smells divine.</li>
            <li> I see that some prior reviews say that the scrubbing action is zilch, and that the exfoliating beads just disappear and don&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not cheap, but they are so worth it.  </li>
            <li> Granted, my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive OR dry--I would perhaps hesitate before recommending this product to people with very dry and/or sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li> Did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen decreased breakouts, more even skin, and just overall it leaves you feeling refreshed/radiant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Asian with oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li> If you have acne-prone skin, yes, you will most likely have a few small breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap grocery store brands, to expensive department store brands, to exclusive salon lines (both natural and conventional skin care lines) with little success.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling very clean--I was actually a little worried that it would dry out my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Some have disappeared entirely and others have gotten a lot smaller and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I was also aware that the lemongrass could be irritating, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> I admit I have been swayed by typical drugstore cleansers, but recently switched to Origins Cheeks and Balance in an effort to be kinder to my skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have struggled with my extremely oily, congested &amp; blemish prone skin all of my life (I&#x27;m 44).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard people have similar small breakout out as Retin-A (non cystic type).</li>
            <li> and you only need a small amount .  </li>
            <li> Being a guy, I was skeptical at first, using a product like this.</li>
            <li> Not your average drug-store cleanser...</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY NOT WORTH $32.95.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s after less than a week of using the Suki products.  </li>
            <li> Even with just the little samples that I received, I could tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while, I can see that my skin texture is also beginning to improve.  </li>
            <li> The little &amp;#34;scrubbers&amp;#34; just melt into the foam.  </li>
            <li> Just started buying on Amazon and was a little weary</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> Give it a few days.</li>
            <li> It was unsealed and 1/3 to maybe even 1/2 was missing.  </li>
            <li> At least 1/4 of contents MISSING!</li>
            <li> MISLEADING &amp; DISHONEST REVIEWS.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love Suki&#x27;s products - I am in my early 30s and still get acne quite regularly.  After doing some research on diet changes and using more natural products on my face and body I started to try Suki&#x27;s line of skin care products and I absolutely love them.  My face feels so clean and refreshed after using this scrub and it hasn&#x27;t looked better.  pair it with suki&#x27;s mosturizers and you will be good to go.  Only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of the price, wish it was cheaper, as I run through this fairly quickly.  Would definately reccomend!</li>
            <li> This has clean ingredients - which is a plus but it&#x27;s a tad expensive. Rice powder and sugar mixture is really amazing for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I get the monthly beauty sample box from Birchbox, and this was included for April.  I love sampling new products, but very rarely do I find something better than my old standby products--however, I did spring for this scrub/cleanser.    I&#x27;ve been using it every morning for about two weeks.  It&#x27;s very creamy/foamy and I like how the sugar crystals eventually dissolve.  It leaves my face feeling very clean--I was actually a little worried that it would dry out my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t.  I was also aware that the lemongrass could be irritating, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.  Granted, my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive OR dry--I would perhaps hesitate before recommending this product to people with very dry and/or sensitive skin.     It also smells WONDERFUL--and while I wouldn&#x27;t eat it on purpose, I can report that a little got in my mouth one morning, and it was nice and sweet.  :)</li>
            <li> I love the SUKI line of products.  I use this cleanser (as a facial cleanser) with my rotating cleansing brush system.   Great improvement in my skin. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser daily and am so happy with it! It is the best exfoliator I have ever used and I have recommended it to a few people who also fell in love with it! Hope you like it as much as I do :)</li>
            <li> This review is for the entire Suki for oily skin system (Exfoliate Foaming Cleanser, Balancing Toner, Balancing Day Lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled with my extremely oily, congested &amp; blemish prone skin all of my life (I&#x27;m 44).  I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap grocery store brands, to expensive department store brands, to exclusive salon lines (both natural and conventional skin care lines) with little success.  Some worked better than others, but none of them really helped all that much.  I was still so oily an hour after cleansing and putting on my makeup that my face would be shining like a beacon and my makeup would be melting off.  I went through package after package of oil blotting tissues every day trying to stem the tide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Suki.  Even with just the little samples that I received, I could tell the difference.  My face felt clean and refreshed without being dry or tight, and lightly moisturized after using the balancing day lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours later, my skin was still fresh, soft and NOT OILY! My makeup stayed in place.  of course, I immediately ordered the full size set of these items.  They&#x27;re not cheap, but they are so worth it.  I can go all day, blotting only once or twice, with fresh, soft, non-oily skin and my makeup looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while, I can see that my skin texture is also beginning to improve.  Several enlarged oil glands on my forehead, which a dermatologist said would have to be professionally removed (which would leave scabs for a couple of weeks) and would then most likely come back later, are now diminishing by themselves.  Some have disappeared entirely and others have gotten a lot smaller and less noticeable.  And that&#x27;s after less than a week of using the Suki products.  I have had no blemishes since I started using this system daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing line of products.  I will be a devoted user for life!  If you have troubled, congested, oily skin, do yourself and favor and get the sample set of this line and give it a try.  It&#x27;s a miracle!et the sample set of this line and give it a try.  It&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel wonderfully clean.  This is the second time I have purchased this product.  My daughter tried it and exclaimed how clean her skin felt.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This skincare line is AMAZING. A little pricey, but well worth whatever you have to do to get that money! LOL. Seriously, I love natural products, and that&#x27;s why I tried this, but the results trump ANYTHING I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;m officially hooked for life. Thank you a million times over, Suki!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I normally have quite sensitive skin.. this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and I use it daily... I guess it all depends on the person.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It leaves your skin so clean and soft !!!  I would recomend this product !!  It is excellent !!</li>
            <li> I bought this to try a gentle daily scrubby cleanser and love it. It leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped and I&#x27;d swear my skin looks much better after using this for awhile. This will definitely be a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> This is, hands-down, one of my all-time favorite exfoliating cleansers. Not only is the product organic, it smells deliciously refreshing AND you can use it at as a sweet lip exfoliant as well. Sure, it&#x27;s on the pricey end but I&#x27;ve found a little bit goes a long way. The only thing better would be a body scrub version!</li>
            <li> I take my skincare routine seriously - I&#x27;m a women in my early 40&#x27;s and IT&#x27;S IMPORTANT! A little goes a long way, it has a rich lathering foam like that of a high end product like Clarin&#x27;s and smells divine. Did not dry out my skin. The sugar gives a great scrub and leaves you feeling clean, soft, not dry and lemony.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! It has already done wonders for my skin and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week. I&#x27;ve seen decreased breakouts, more even skin, and just overall it leaves you feeling refreshed/radiant. Who knew that sugar and rice could make such a great natural cleanser? You don&#x27;t need to use very much, so I think it will last a while. In which case, it is pretty decently priced given the quality. Not your average drug-store cleanser... so not for everyone, but for those who are looking for more, this is your answer.</li>
            <li> At least 1/4 of contents MISSING! DEFINITELY NOT WORTH $32.95. MISLEADING &amp; DISHONEST REVIEWS. Ingredients worth $3.00 MAX. CanNOT feel scrub! $8 scrubs MUCH BETTER! VERY DISAPPOINTED, since I relied on reviews, apparently by people who do NOT know quality or friends of manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Ive only have this for about a week or so. So far though its working miracles! my face feels great even if i skip a day in between washing it! Would definitely buy again, probably will!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 40 and my mom is approaching 65. It&#x27;s very rare we both agree on one product because our Asian skin types are different. I&#x27;m half Asian with oily skin and large pores. I admit I have been swayed by typical drugstore cleansers, but recently switched to Origins Cheeks and Balance in an effort to be kinder to my skin. I love the creamy foam of Origins, but once the weather settled into the fall, my skin felt tight and dry. Even though I made the mistake of buying (and using) multiple beauty products at one time -- Suki face, Skin79 Crystal Gel and Algenist serum -- my skin has not &#x27;glowed&#x27; like this before! I received many compliments. My mom immediately noticed and I gave her a week&#x27;s worth of Suki face to try. She is a lifelong Shiseido addict; imagine my surprise when she asked for more Suki! We both agreed, this product is effective at any age. It smells like lemongrass, not Pledge! If you have acne-prone skin, yes, you will most likely have a few small breakouts. It&#x27;s simply your skin adjusting to the exfoliating process. I&#x27;ve heard people have similar small breakout out as Retin-A (non cystic type). Give it a few days. I gave my skin a break for a day before using the Crystal Gel and I returned the Algenist (too pricey) and ordered more Suki products.</li>
            <li> This cleanser does foam and you only need a small amount .  However, there is not a lot of scrubbing power behind it.  The little &amp;#34;scrubbers&amp;#34; just melt into the foam.  I think it is probably an effective cleanser, however if you want scrubbing power, get Burt&#x27;s Bees pomegranate scrub!  The Suki&#x27;s scrub smells very nice and is not really drying.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comment on the product as I&#x27;m returning it. It was unsealed and 1/3 to maybe even 1/2 was missing.  I called Suki, Inc to verify if it should be full and they told me it should be rather white.  If it were yellow then it had been opened and exposed to air!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the fault of the Amazon seller not Amazon, which has given me a refund and return label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on trying again and will post my comments on the quality of the product at that time.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle exfoliate but effective. I have been using it for several years. It also has a wonderful scent and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I chose this product for the high reviews. I already have clear smooth skin and was just looking for a product to keep it nice and clean....seems to do the job!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE Suki products - I have extremely sensitive skin - its been problematic my whole life - very severe eczema, cystic acne, etc.  This is a great product.  I use 1-2 x&#x27;s a week during the winter when my skin is drier and 4-5 times a wk in the summer when my skin is on the oily side.  smells great, gentle enough for almost daily use, reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve been using it for probably 8 years now.  Just started buying on Amazon and was a little weary but it arrived just perfect.</li>
            <li> I had real issues with my skin. I bought this product in conjunction with another and it really helped to clear my skin. It lasts about a month so it&#x27;s a little pricey but I have been using for about five months now and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is natural, does a good job of ex-foliating and leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> the product is good, however I feel a film on my face after using and not sure what it is so I have to use another cleanser after, it&#x27;s still good for exfoliating</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews said it was really good for oily skin.  I go through oil-blotting sheets like nobody&#x27;s business, so I&#x27;m always looking for something to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed too big of a change in the oiliness, but I don&#x27;t use the full suki line, either.  I&#x27;ve seen some reviewers say they&#x27;ve had really great results using the toner and lotion as well, so I&#x27;m going to try those and then come back to update my review.  Regardless, I&#x27;m in love with this product.  I see that some prior reviews say that the scrubbing action is zilch, and that the exfoliating beads just disappear and don&#x27;t do anything.  Perhaps they had a poor batch?  Because I have to say that I&#x27;ve been extremely impressed by how well it exfoliates.  It scrubs really well without being too harsh or rough on my skin, and afterwards it feels extremely smooth, very clean, and that nice tight feeling.  I actually don&#x27;t use it everyday, more like every 2-3 days, because of how well it exfoliates - I don&#x27;t want to overdo it and stress my skin!  It also lasts for a pretty long time, which is nice considering the price tag.  You don&#x27;t need very much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is wonderful.  I love the smell of lemongrass, and it&#x27;s really nice first thing in the morning when I stumble out of bed and get ready for work.  It really helps to wake me up.  And the fact that it&#x27;s all natural is really nice - I&#x27;ve accidentally gotten some onto my mouth before, and I have to say, it does taste pretty good.  I don&#x27;t recommend you eat your cleanser, but it&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t taste all chemically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that some reviewers have mentioned that when they opened the jar, there was only 1/3 or so of the product in there.  I definitely didn&#x27;t have that problem, and if you do, I&#x27;d suggest that you don&#x27;t judge the whole line by it.  Contact them, ask for an exchange, and give it another chance.  I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST Facial Exfoliate Foaming Cleanser I have ever purchased. I have tried a few in my time but this one is truly srumptious :). Once you have mixed some of the Exfoliate with some water on your face it nicely foams up and makes it a very nice scrub. Not harsh just perfect. It cleans your skin very nicely and makes it feel very soft. I truly love SUKI&#x27;S.</li>
            <li> I probably use this more than than suggested probably 3 or 4 x a week.. works well to cleanse since I only use oils on my skin (jojoba, apricot, avocado as mosturizers, olive oil for makeup removal). I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s gritting when you put it on your water-soaked hand and eventually, after rubbing on your face, turns in to a rich and creamy concoction.  I even got a little in my mouth and it was delicious!  really...you could eat this stuff.</li>
            <li> wow I have been using this cleaners for about two years I loveeeeee it. it has changed for skin tone my face is soo smooth glowing wonderful product must buy.</li>
            <li> This product is the best. I already have pretty good skin. When I try new products I do not really notice a difference, but with this product my face is even clearer and more radiant. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love using this facewash! It makes my face feel so clean and refreshed. The lemon smell is so refreshing in the morning and the way it foams up and the sugar dissolves is so awesome!! AMAZING Proguct!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the exfoliation it provides. You can mix it with a little water in your hand if you just want to use it as a cleanser, but I think if is fine to use every day as an exfoliating. It makes my skin feel clean and overall is a great product with good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Use the size of a dime or less, add a little water, gently apply and wash off - that easy - noticeable improvement immediately - and over time, skin feels and looks more firm and smooth.  Love the glass jar for product - no plastic - YEA!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22, and an aspiring Sports Business professional. Being a guy, I was skeptical at first, using a product like this. However, this wash is amazing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it after shaving or on shaving days, but every other day this gives an amazing clean slate in regards to your face. I find this product most useful when I get home from work during the night period; you can literally feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good product, if you are not allergic to it. After using it the third days, I got hives all over my body. It took me two weeks to get better from hives, and I am still taking Benadryl to make sure that all the hives are gone. I just threw the cleanser into the trash when I got hives.</li>
