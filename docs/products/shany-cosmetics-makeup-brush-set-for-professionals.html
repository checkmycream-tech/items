            <li>I am fairly neutral on this product.</li>

            <li>Does it get any better?!</li>

            <li>I absolutely feel more confident when wearing it!</li>
            <li>The fact that it has a strap for your waist makes it feel more fun!</li>
            <li>I am not super impressed with the pouch</li>
            <li>But I think Shany makes better if you are willing to spend a bit more.</li>
            <li>great for someone starting out.</li>
            <li>oh yeah, cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It is a complete set, good quality.</li>
            <li>First off thesebrushes are cruelty free meaning no animal were harmed in the making of this product, always important to look for!</li>
            <li>apron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also super affordable for quality brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it comes with so many different brushes and its very soft and nicely made.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes because they are soft and when i use it to apply my makeup or other people&#x27;s makeup, it looks so nice!</li>
            <li>This little kit is so cute and Handy.</li>
            <li>I loved the apron and how convenient it was to reach down for a brush when doing makeup for another person or yourself.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and easy to use to apply on makeup.  </li>
            <li>I only heard positive feedback with this so far and such a good variety of brushes :)</li>
            <li>and firstly they started shedding, a lot.</li>
            <li>it comes with 18 brushes which is more than enough.</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>This set is pretty much the price of the walmart brand with the quality of the high end stuff.</li>
            <li>The material that holds all of the brushes is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Makes my makeup classes so much easier and organized.</li>
            <li>The brushes are the same quality as their other brushes (which are good for what they are).</li>
            <li>I just use all the other brushes more.</li>
            <li>I have bought brushes from other competitors, but I really love this set.</li>
            <li>Only any good to lay down colour and apply concealer.</li>
            <li>The set of brushes are very soft and compatible!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not as nice as there other ones because it&#x27;s so simple.</li>
            <li>Wish there were more fluffy brushes for blending but for the price I will deal.</li>
            <li>, this is a steal since she gets a few more brushes that she considers as ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft to the skin.</li>
            <li>There are a few too many flat shader brushes, but I end up replacing that brush style the most often so no real complaints there!</li>
            <li>this was cheaper than the MAC set that I ordered and it shipped more quickly, but I was not impressed with the quality!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;hair\\&quot; of the brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re not as soft as I wish they were.</li>
            <li>I really like the brushes, the case is not really that well made, but for the price I have paid, I am satisfy, except some of the brushes were dyed and washes off...</li>
            <li>I recently used it to do all of my girlfriends&#x27; makeup before a party and they kept commenting on how professional it made me seem.</li>
            <li>( the ones in black, other then that, I really enjoy using this makeup set</li>
            <li>Very Soft eyeshadow brushes, but don&#x27;t pick up color as well as my rough ones.  </li>
            <li>Not saying this is a bad product, it is good.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this set two weeks ago. It is a complete set, good quality.Each brush has a number and the brochure explains the use for each set. Nice set.</li>
            <li> Okay, so my mom bought these because she liked them and thought they might be good. And when they came I thought so as well. Soooo I cleaned them up and firstly they started shedding, a lot. Then as I cleaned them dirt came out in great proportions and I was stunned. They are all plastic and the handles are as well, not only that but they are wobbly so if you&#x27;re going to pay 34$ for brushes I recommend the Costal Scents 24 piece, way better and prettier. So yeah. That was my opinion.</li>
            <li> I recently gifted this super affordable set to one of my MUA friends and she loved it. The brushes are soft yet firm and the apron is washable!!!</li>
            <li> I like my elf brand better</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and easy to use to apply on makeup.  The brushes are greatly made and the brush belt is durable and sturdy.  Its great for travel.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set, it&#x27;s perfect for when I do my friend&#x27;s makeup for weddings, dances, and events. I absolutely feel more confident when wearing it! The fact that it has a strap for your waist makes it feel more fun! Great brushes and great pouch</li>
            <li> These are real good brushes. They even had it at the recent imats in la. heard a lot about it. I only heard positive feedback with this so far and such a good variety of brushes :)</li>
            <li> The set of brushes are very soft and compatible! The material that holds all of the brushes is very sturdy. I recommend these brushes if you are going into the beauty industry!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a very good brush set! There are a few too many flat shader brushes, but I end up replacing that brush style the most often so no real complaints there! I love that they&#x27;re synthetic too.</li>
            <li> these are nice brushes. great pouch to put it in. great to use and lots of brushes to choose from. great for someone starting out.</li>
            <li> I am fairly neutral on this product. The brushes are the same quality as their other brushes (which are good for what they are). I am not super impressed with the pouch it comes it. It&#x27;s just not as nice as there other ones because it&#x27;s so simple. Not saying this is a bad product, it is good. But I think Shany makes better if you are willing to spend a bit more.</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes, the case is not really that well made, but for the price I have paid, I am satisfy, except some of the brushes were dyed and washes off...( the ones in black, other then that, I really enjoy using this makeup set</li>
            <li> Nice business! I&#x27;ll recommend!</li>
            <li> Total waste of money. The brush pulls out and feather things pull out on ur face while ur brushes ur face with it. Worse product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you Shany for being cruelty free! I have vegan friend who is into makeup but not into torturing animals for it, so I&#x27;ll definitely recommend this to her. The brushes were soft and hardly shed. I loved the apron and how convenient it was to reach down for a brush when doing makeup for another person or yourself. I recently used it to do all of my girlfriends&#x27; makeup before a party and they kept commenting on how professional it made me seem. This set is a wonderful complement to an collection!</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it ... HOWEVER .. There is no blending brush , but I already had one so it didn&#x27;t effect me. Very Soft eyeshadow brushes, but don&#x27;t pick up color as well as my rough ones.  still very useful ! I just use all the other brushes more.( Lip brush , angled brush etc. )</li>
            <li> I love the brushes because they are soft and when i use it to apply my makeup or other people&#x27;s makeup, it looks so nice! The handle is also very nice and since these brushes comes with the brush belt, that&#x27;s a plus for it&#x27;s price!! I recommend :D</li>
            <li> First off thesebrushes are cruelty free meaning no animal were harmed in the making of this product, always important to look for! Another greatly priced item from Shany and it comes with brush carrier, makes you feel pro! : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie... I totally feel like a pro when I use these brushes! Great quality, dense, soft brushes. Sturdy, sexy case. What more could you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... oh yeah, cruelty free. Does it get any better?!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;hair\\&quot; of the brushes are soft. Comes with an apron that is adjustable. A plus that they are against animal cruelty !!</li>
            <li> this was cheaper than the MAC set that I ordered and it shipped more quickly, but I was not impressed with the quality! it came in a stiff, wrinkled holder and the bristles are soft, but obviously synthetic. a few of the brushes bristles werecrushed and bent into bad shape from packaging</li>

            <li> Honest this is like the best gift idea to give someone who is starting out in the whole makeup world, and loves makeup. it comes with so many different brushes and its very soft and nicely made. it comes with 18 brushes which is more than enough.</li>
            <li> My wife says their good value - some of it&#x27;s crap and some is good, considering one of her good brushes is $20, this is a steal since she gets a few more brushes that she considers as ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: your wife/GF/significant other/whatever may not like your purchasing this stuff for them so your on your own buddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2 cents!</li>
            <li> brushes are very good. They are not like Mac but there okay I don&#x27;t give him a five star because I think it needs a better shadow blending brush and they&#x27;re not as soft as I wish they were.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the prices. There is a brush for every application and then some. The brushes are very soft to the skin. Nice apron case also.</li>
            <li> Bad brushes, no blending brushes. Only any good to lay down colour and apply concealer. Brushes shed excessively very disappointed</li>
            <li> This little kit is so cute and Handy. I just ADORE the makeup apron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also super affordable for quality brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two types of brushes, awesome high end brushes and cheap as dirt Literally walmart brand brushes. This set is pretty much the price of the walmart brand with the quality of the high end stuff. Definite must buy.</li>
            <li> First off I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that Shany Cosmetics is a cruelty free company. I try really hard to pay attention to where the makeup products I buy come from. Poor little animals don&#x27;t need to suffer for our beauty!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok now onto the brushes... I love the apron that comes with it and the brushes are all amazing quality! Who needs to pay an arm and an leg for high end brushes when these are amazing!</li>
            <li> I have bought brushes from other competitors, but I really love this set. It&#x27;s good quality, and a great variety for the price. Since then my friend saw it and has also ordered one for herself. I highly recommend it.</li>
