            <li>When I dropped her off, her friend remarked to her afterward that I smelled great.  </li>
            <li>However, once the EDT had had a chance to blend for 30 minutes or so, I found it quite attractive.</li>
            <li>use Burberry by Burberry for all occassions but it is great for the evening.</li>
            <li>A great scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great scent that lingers, but does not over power.  </li>
            <li>This one smells great</li>

            <li>Great size for a great price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great cologne at a GREAT price.  </li>
            <li>This is a great scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments!!</li>
            <li>My gal loves it very nice smelling for a man.</li>
            <li>Great price and my nephew loved receiving this for Christmas.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend fell in love with me because of this :D</li>
            <li>This cologne has a pleasant smell of apple, I could imagine this going well with an outdoor occasion like perhaps going to a park, beach..etc.</li>
            <li>,it smells pleasant and relaxing.</li>
            <li>Good notes of spice and wood, noticeable but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but for some people this is a good thing</li>
            <li>good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good price good product</li>
            <li>good presentation</li>
            <li>However, this cologne is fairly affordable compared to others, but my experience has been that affordability quite literally comes at a price.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a gift for my boyfriend, and he loved it.</li>
            <li>It smells good....</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled good on me</li>
            <li>this stuff smells so good i have to smell myself again and tell myself  i smell good.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is really good and for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>$52.00 for a 50ml bottle,luckily I had a 20% coupon so it chiseled a good chunk off the price.</li>
            <li>Is this a good every day or formal cologne?in</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fair to call Burberry neutral.</li>
            <li>I loved it, the wife did not.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>is very sexy for a man.</li>
            <li>i love it very nice cologne</li>
            <li>The bottle quality sub par and the smell over the top!</li>
            <li>All the ladies love it too!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend fell in love with the cologne years ago, and giving him another bottle is the gift that keeps on giving!</li>
            <li>ITS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing</li>
            <li>This product size is bigger than it looks, the best price to be found, and smells sooooo great.</li>
            <li>Good to wear for work not my favorite going out colgne</li>
            <li>She couldn&#x27;t keep her hands off me all night, and kept remarking that I smelled like some kind of sex god, not kidding.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many colonges before and even now but this one here is my all time favorite great job to the shipper</li>
            <li>Every time I run out of Burberry by Burberry for Men, I have to immediately buy some more because it smells so good.</li>
            <li>THIS BURBERRY FOR MEN ORIGINAL SCENT IS A GREAT SMELL.</li>
            <li>I cannot recall how many times a girl has commented, &amp;#34;You smell amazing.  </li>
            <li>many* years ago and instantly loving the scent on me.  </li>
            <li>It is a HUGE bottle and amazing deal for the price.</li>
            <li>This has has been a favorite of mine for years.  </li>
            <li>My wife gave me a Burberry&#x27;s gift set and it&#x27;s now become my favorite</li>
            <li>However, I have received more compliments on this scent than on any I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li>Ok so i had saw this in a store going for 65 bucks</li>
            <li>BEST INVESTMENT EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that it smells different on me depending on what i shower with.</li>
            <li>so for me its like gettting to colognes in one :]</li>
            <li>God I love Amazon.</li>
            <li>, glad I went with it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but this one is a timeless cologne the ladys love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is now my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>To me it is a more sophisticated scent</li>
            <li>i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran</li>
            <li>and you can be confident</li>
            <li>This is stronger than most</li>
            <li>Manly and beastly, I have never felt more lovely in all of my life.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best price I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>If you want to smell like a box of love that was shipped to the mayor of awesomeness, then you should smell like Burberry.</li>
            <li>It is authentic Burberry, so no need to worry.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance on my partner.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Its probably the favorite scent in my collection.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>It smells like God&#x27;s tears of laughter and love.</li>
            <li>Burberry is simply the best.</li>
            <li>No, I don&#x27;t work for Amazon, just a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>In closing there&#x27;s way too many colognes these days</li>
            <li>it seems like a safe scent for any occasion, winter, spring, i even wear it in the summer sometimes, for any event going on</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband after sampling many colognes when his favorite was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>but it sure helped a lot.</li>
            <li>A favorite of mine for my husband.  </li>
            <li>My fianc&amp;eacute; has been wearing this cologne for over 3 years and the scent still making me want him even more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if purchased at the mall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Was very pleased with Amazon&#x27;s price and the quick delivery time.</li>
            <li>This is a very good scent, it lasts a long time and is available here for a good price.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>BTW, I have Burberry Brit and Burberry Touch and both of those are pretty good</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good</li>
            <li>For the price and free shipping, I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li>My original cologne which i bought at sephora smelled great and lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it may go better with a classy look and it does seem to be a bit strong, but it definitely is a great scent.</li>
            <li>Even tho this cologne has been out for about 10 years, I really like it and have had others comment on how good I smell :</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m using it for special occasions, very important meetings and going out to dinner with my girl...</li>
            <li>No kidding, a woman in the grocery store came up to me out of the blue and said that I smelled good!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s refreshing to see an original scent come out of the woodwork.</li>
            <li>This was processed and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a dude with a strong character and born with elegance, then grab the box and get this perfum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too strong and citrusy.</li>
            <li>The product was new and in good conditions.</li>
            <li>I know some cheap colognes do that to me, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting this from burberry.</li>
            <li>I bought this product before I ever smelled it based only on user reviews and the reviews are correct, this is a great fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, this cologne is great if you buy it at a regular store.</li>
            <li>I got what I paid for -- cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need alot but your partner will enjoy being around you.</li>
            <li>my opinion an excellent everyday cologne</li>
            <li>Very nice male fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for the office, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nice classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>Unique scent</li>
            <li>so I was looking forward to the Burberry original</li>
            <li>I thought go to Amazon, I have gotten many deals there and hot</li>
            <li>I could buy TWO for almost the original price I paid for one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching drugstores, department stores and everywhere else for this deal on Burberry Original</li>
            <li>Not too strong but just right.</li>
            <li>I had never used or sampled this scent before but took a chance due to the nice reviews and the nice price from Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>be for I even think cool water</li>
            <li>It is warm and masculine but not abrasive.</li>
            <li>I love sweet smelling colognes but at the same time I wanna smell like a str8 up sexy man at times with no doubt on what I have on and thats</li>
            <li>The scent is a clean fresh earthy scent for those that are wondering.</li>
            <li>Not even mild, can&#x27;t even smell it.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a more realistic price paid coming from a warehouse rather than convenience of immediately acquiring it and mark-up in price from a store.</li>
            <li>What a great product i love Burberry i do recommend this product for anyone the price is much cheaper than store prices dont waste your time going to stores.</li>
            <li>Smells like a  bergomat a sweet woodsy pine needs, fresh woman delighting sc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved Burberry for a long time and always buy it for my husband.</li>
            <li>Burberry classic has a really great, specific smell and it is not over powering.</li>
            <li>I love trying new colognes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must in every man&#x27;s collection, or even if it&#x27;s the first one!</li>
            <li>cologne?it&#x27;s pretty choice!</li>
            <li>Clean and Crisp.</li>
            <li>I think its always better to spend some extra amount on Genuine perfumes at shopping malls rather then buying</li>
            <li>SOOOOOO WORTH IT</li>
            <li>I never feel embarrassed wearing it out like cheaper or tackier stuff, and women at the office occasionally remark it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>but I thought why not splurge, I am worth it.</li>
            <li>I thought I know I am worth it</li>
            <li>It still good, but not as expected.</li>
            <li>I think Burberry is more on the suave side on a date night or around the wife,the scent tries to be a smoother customer than something more muscular like Polo Original(green bottle with gold cap) or HUGO&#x27;s Boss Number One,last thing you want to do is set off your date&#x27;s allergies...</li>
            <li>, i wear it to work, seems like a timeless scent, if i had to describe this scent it would be a fresh soapy scent.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>As far as the scent goes, its a fresh, crisp and refreshing smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>just the right balance for my boyfriend&#x27;s chemistry.</li>
            <li>I have a keen nose and knew right away that this would be a winner when he tried it on in a store.  </li>
            <li>It i use irish spring soap it has a more minty scent, where as if i use old spice its a more musk- woody scent..</li>
            <li>The smell is classic and original</li>
            <li>Quickly I checked on my phone how much it would be on Amazon</li>
            <li>It has a soft scent but it holds strong throughout the day.</li>
            <li>loved how it smelled masculine, but didn&#x27;t have a smell similar to those scents that are associated with &amp;#34;manly men&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>First time ordering online.  </li>
            <li>the mint and honey are just beautifully mixed 1 of my top 20 in all the colognes I have I reach for this way</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was a bit taken aback ...</li>
            <li>And the best part, is it is one of the longest lasting EDTs I have used recently (including several from Polo, Ck, Kenneth Cole, ...)</li>
            <li>this stuff gets the women hot</li>
            <li>Well, i can tell you first hand</li>
            <li>but it last for 2 - 3 hours top; after that you cannot even tell you ever put it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend Burberry strictly as a cologne for everyone because tastes differ,but for a thirties price range cologne?it&#x27;s pretty choice!but for a thirties price range</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and gentle.</li>
            <li>my 3rd burberry i love it</li>
            <li>but good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I used to own Burberry Touch, which I really liked for a spring cologne but wanted something a little bit more long lasting.</li>
            <li>and I use it for nice dinners and dressy events and leave my Acqua Di Gio for bars and other functions.</li>
            <li>i like it coz its cheaper than other store and nice smell.</li>
            <li>really should have visited the mall or dealer to smell it first hand.</li>
            <li>what a great, deep, complex scent; sandalwood with citrus undertones, it hangs throughout the day without overwhelming as long as apply a reasonably light touch.  </li>
            <li>My husband has used this cologne for many years, and I love the subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>Hard to to describe the smell, however I have discoverd that I like colognes with sandalwood, which is a gently warm slightly sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>That said, I wore it last night on a first date, and as soon as I showed up my date remarked I smell fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting good scent.</li>
            <li>I just think it isn&#x27;t for a certain type of guy like me.</li>
            <li>Burberry is smooth to the nose and fragrant with a mild sweetness to it,it&#x27;s both masculine and floral in character at the same time.</li>
            <li>i really like from yahoo</li>
            <li>Really recommend this anyone that just needs one cologne.</li>
            <li>I really like this smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, refined, but still manly musky.  </li>
            <li>and I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>I had it in 3 days thanks.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li>i really like this burberry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about my fragrances</li>
            <li>My wife had picked this out about 2 years ago and always says how much she enjoys it when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>wife says thanks</li>
            <li>It came in a relatively fast manner brand-new.  </li>
            <li>really...</li>
            <li>Good fragrance and lingers for a long long time.</li>
            <li>I first became aware of this scent while shopping in an upscale major department store.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments with this scent than any other cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>This scent barely lasts on me at all (although surely others have had different experiences).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a more mature scent meant for an older adult, perhaps mid 20&#x27;s and up.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this after I smelled a sample in Esquire magazine, and is the first time I&#x27;ve bought a cologne without spraying it and trying it out first.  </li>
            <li>Burberry is classic &amp;#34;london&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>HaHa Do yourself a favor check with Amazon before going shopping for your everyday needs, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>$, Amazon&#x27;s price is highly competitive.</li>
            <li>but it would not be high on my list for any use during the summer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it probably goes well on certain races and men of mature age</li>
            <li>It smells a little spicy, but not in an overwhelming fashion.</li>
            <li>For now Burberry is the &#x27;what&#x27;s in&#x27; cologne of moderately priced colognes,but I can say for the dollar value it will be an instant classic of some pretty worthy well priced colognes such as Aspen and Lucky Number 6</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon and paid nearly twice as much as it&#x27;s advertised for here.</li>
            <li>,  shipping was fast and care  big thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very masculine cologne that would range from a older teenager to someone in there 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The main reason this only gets three stars is that Burberry has no real development throughout as many higher-quality colognes have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thought about switching it up on occasion, ya know, trying a new scent recommended by GQ</li>
            <li>Also on the bottle I see a sticker which is removed (could be a tester one) where as I ordered a new one for $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I still buy a new bottle of Burberry every time I run</li>
            <li>it last long and smells very sweet but still has a manly appeal 2 it.</li>
            <li>First of all I got this and cologne leaks from the spray cap and the smell is lil different than I had before and won&#x27;t stay on body for not even an hour .</li>
            <li>4 stars only because it doesn&#x27;t last as some other fragnances I have used in the past, still, it&#x27;s a great buy!!</li>
            <li>, you save near $30!</li>
            <li>I should rate it four stars because it really doesn&#x27;t wear long nor does it spread much</li>
            <li>Burberry is not heavy or overwhelming but rather a subtle woodsy scent that is gentle on the nose.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve purchased it many times in the past and it never gets old.</li>
            <li>This is a somewhat strong or heavy EDT</li>
            <li>&quot; Then I got to wake up next to numerous beautiful women who all mysteriously died tragically and ironically by various fictional super villains after each time followed by me using crazy gizmos and gadgets and my pimped out Astin Martin to chase and kill the villain&#x27;s right hand man, and then quoting the name of the movie right before or after I invoke justice on them in</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much one-note, and continues that way for however long it lasts.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a bad scent, but I don&#x27;t find it particularly interesting or inspiring.</li>
            <li>All in all, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m getting another one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also fast and proper services by amazon.</li>
            <li>.....perfect and masculine.</li>
            <li>Think modern, British, stability.</li>
            <li>Club\\&quot; not now that hes old and Fabio esque.</li>
            <li>I surprised him and bought it one day.  </li>
            <li>Very well priced, especially compared to perfume discount stores.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a fan of Ralph Lauren &amp;#34;Romance&amp;#34;, Christian Dior&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fahrenheit&amp;#34; or Giorgio Armani&#x27;s &amp;#34;Aqua Di Gio&amp;#34;, you will find Burberry appetizing.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap, synthetic, imitation to traditional bay rum.</li>
            <li>Masculine and yet a little bit sweet.</li>
            <li>Very few of the new colognes make you smell like a man should they smell really sweet and</li>
            <li>I would characterize this as more of a fall or winter scent due to the earthy, spicey, slightly musk smell.</li>
            <li>a cheesy ironic creative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morale of the story.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m interested in trying some of the other Burberry scents ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in trying the other Burberry varieties.</li>
            <li>and I only use two regularly -- Eau d&#x27;Issey by Issey Miyake is my main scent, but I do use Burberry sometimes on occassion</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the size when the item was delivered because I was expecting something smaller for the price.</li>
            <li>Apparently he likes it.</li>
            <li>she feels like doing things I can&#x27;t mention here 2 me, and since she feels tht way, other women will certainly feel like tht.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but by the end of the day I had come to really enjoy its subtle, spicy scent.</li>
            <li>not sure if it was the spice used but in a closed door meeting at work I noticed that I started to have the headache and also noticed people inching away from the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Burberry is a complex fragrance which is unlike many other fragrances on the market.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is present, but barely.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this cologne I learned very quickly not to buy it from a Kohl&#x27;s store ever again...</li>

            <li> When I dropped her off, her friend remarked to her afterward that I smelled great.  </li>
            <li> However, once the EDT had had a chance to blend for 30 minutes or so, I found it quite attractive.</li>
            <li> use Burberry by Burberry for all occassions but it is great for the evening.</li>
            <li> A great scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scent that lingers, but does not over power.  </li>

            <li> I get so many compliments!!</li>
            <li> My gal loves it very nice smelling for a man.</li>
            <li> Great price and my nephew loved receiving this for Christmas.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend fell in love with me because of this :D</li>
            <li> This cologne has a pleasant smell of apple, I could imagine this going well with an outdoor occasion like perhaps going to a park, beach..etc.</li>
            <li> ,it smells pleasant and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Good notes of spice and wood, noticeable but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> but for some people this is a good thing</li>
            <li> good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good price good product</li>
            <li> good presentation</li>
            <li> However, this cologne is fairly affordable compared to others, but my experience has been that affordability quite literally comes at a price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift for my boyfriend, and he loved it.</li>
            <li> It smells good....</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled good on me</li>
            <li> this stuff smells so good i have to smell myself again and tell myself  i smell good.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is really good and for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> $52.00 for a 50ml bottle,luckily I had a 20% coupon so it chiseled a good chunk off the price.</li>
            <li> Is this a good every day or formal cologne?in</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fair to call Burberry neutral.</li>
            <li> I loved it, the wife did not.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> is very sexy for a man.</li>
            <li> i love it very nice cologne</li>
            <li> The bottle quality sub par and the smell over the top!</li>
            <li> All the ladies love it too!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend fell in love with the cologne years ago, and giving him another bottle is the gift that keeps on giving!</li>
            <li> ITS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing</li>
            <li> This product size is bigger than it looks, the best price to be found, and smells sooooo great.</li>
            <li> Good to wear for work not my favorite going out colgne</li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t keep her hands off me all night, and kept remarking that I smelled like some kind of sex god, not kidding.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many colonges before and even now but this one here is my all time favorite great job to the shipper</li>
            <li> Every time I run out of Burberry by Burberry for Men, I have to immediately buy some more because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> THIS BURBERRY FOR MEN ORIGINAL SCENT IS A GREAT SMELL.</li>
            <li> I cannot recall how many times a girl has commented, &amp;#34;You smell amazing.  </li>
            <li> many* years ago and instantly loving the scent on me.  </li>
            <li> It is a HUGE bottle and amazing deal for the price.</li>
            <li> This has has been a favorite of mine for years.  </li>
            <li> My wife gave me a Burberry&#x27;s gift set and it&#x27;s now become my favorite</li>
            <li> However, I have received more compliments on this scent than on any I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li> Ok so i had saw this in a store going for 65 bucks</li>
            <li> BEST INVESTMENT EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that it smells different on me depending on what i shower with.</li>
            <li> so for me its like gettting to colognes in one :]</li>
            <li> God I love Amazon.</li>
            <li> , glad I went with it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but this one is a timeless cologne the ladys love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is now my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> To me it is a more sophisticated scent</li>
            <li> i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran</li>
            <li> and you can be confident</li>
            <li> This is stronger than most</li>
            <li> Manly and beastly, I have never felt more lovely in all of my life.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best price I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like a box of love that was shipped to the mayor of awesomeness, then you should smell like Burberry.</li>
            <li> It is authentic Burberry, so no need to worry.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance on my partner.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Its probably the favorite scent in my collection.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> It smells like God&#x27;s tears of laughter and love.</li>
            <li> Burberry is simply the best.</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t work for Amazon, just a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> In closing there&#x27;s way too many colognes these days</li>
            <li> it seems like a safe scent for any occasion, winter, spring, i even wear it in the summer sometimes, for any event going on</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after sampling many colognes when his favorite was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> but it sure helped a lot.</li>
            <li> A favorite of mine for my husband.  </li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; has been wearing this cologne for over 3 years and the scent still making me want him even more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if purchased at the mall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Was very pleased with Amazon&#x27;s price and the quick delivery time.</li>
            <li> This is a very good scent, it lasts a long time and is available here for a good price.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> BTW, I have Burberry Brit and Burberry Touch and both of those are pretty good</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good</li>
            <li> For the price and free shipping, I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li> My original cologne which i bought at sephora smelled great and lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it may go better with a classy look and it does seem to be a bit strong, but it definitely is a great scent.</li>
            <li> Even tho this cologne has been out for about 10 years, I really like it and have had others comment on how good I smell :</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m using it for special occasions, very important meetings and going out to dinner with my girl...</li>
            <li> No kidding, a woman in the grocery store came up to me out of the blue and said that I smelled good!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s refreshing to see an original scent come out of the woodwork.</li>
            <li> This was processed and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a dude with a strong character and born with elegance, then grab the box and get this perfum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too strong and citrusy.</li>
            <li> The product was new and in good conditions.</li>
            <li> I know some cheap colognes do that to me, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting this from burberry.</li>
            <li> I bought this product before I ever smelled it based only on user reviews and the reviews are correct, this is a great fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, this cologne is great if you buy it at a regular store.</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for -- cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need alot but your partner will enjoy being around you.</li>
            <li> my opinion an excellent everyday cologne</li>
            <li> Very nice male fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for the office, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nice classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Unique scent</li>
            <li> so I was looking forward to the Burberry original</li>
            <li> I thought go to Amazon, I have gotten many deals there and hot</li>
            <li> I could buy TWO for almost the original price I paid for one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching drugstores, department stores and everywhere else for this deal on Burberry Original</li>
            <li> Not too strong but just right.</li>
            <li> I had never used or sampled this scent before but took a chance due to the nice reviews and the nice price from Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> be for I even think cool water</li>
            <li> It is warm and masculine but not abrasive.</li>
            <li> I love sweet smelling colognes but at the same time I wanna smell like a str8 up sexy man at times with no doubt on what I have on and thats</li>
            <li> The scent is a clean fresh earthy scent for those that are wondering.</li>
            <li> Not even mild, can&#x27;t even smell it.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a more realistic price paid coming from a warehouse rather than convenience of immediately acquiring it and mark-up in price from a store.</li>
            <li> What a great product i love Burberry i do recommend this product for anyone the price is much cheaper than store prices dont waste your time going to stores.</li>
            <li> Smells like a  bergomat a sweet woodsy pine needs, fresh woman delighting sc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Burberry for a long time and always buy it for my husband.</li>
            <li> Burberry classic has a really great, specific smell and it is not over powering.</li>
            <li> I love trying new colognes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must in every man&#x27;s collection, or even if it&#x27;s the first one!</li>
            <li> cologne?it&#x27;s pretty choice!</li>
            <li> Clean and Crisp.</li>
            <li> I think its always better to spend some extra amount on Genuine perfumes at shopping malls rather then buying</li>
            <li> SOOOOOO WORTH IT</li>
            <li> I never feel embarrassed wearing it out like cheaper or tackier stuff, and women at the office occasionally remark it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> but I thought why not splurge, I am worth it.</li>
            <li> I thought I know I am worth it</li>
            <li> It still good, but not as expected.</li>
            <li> I think Burberry is more on the suave side on a date night or around the wife,the scent tries to be a smoother customer than something more muscular like Polo Original(green bottle with gold cap) or HUGO&#x27;s Boss Number One,last thing you want to do is set off your date&#x27;s allergies...</li>
            <li> , i wear it to work, seems like a timeless scent, if i had to describe this scent it would be a fresh soapy scent.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> As far as the scent goes, its a fresh, crisp and refreshing smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> just the right balance for my boyfriend&#x27;s chemistry.</li>
            <li> I have a keen nose and knew right away that this would be a winner when he tried it on in a store.  </li>
            <li> It i use irish spring soap it has a more minty scent, where as if i use old spice its a more musk- woody scent..</li>
            <li> The smell is classic and original</li>
            <li> Quickly I checked on my phone how much it would be on Amazon</li>
            <li> It has a soft scent but it holds strong throughout the day.</li>
            <li> loved how it smelled masculine, but didn&#x27;t have a smell similar to those scents that are associated with &amp;#34;manly men&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> First time ordering online.  </li>
            <li> the mint and honey are just beautifully mixed 1 of my top 20 in all the colognes I have I reach for this way</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was a bit taken aback ...</li>
            <li> And the best part, is it is one of the longest lasting EDTs I have used recently (including several from Polo, Ck, Kenneth Cole, ...)</li>
            <li> this stuff gets the women hot</li>
            <li> Well, i can tell you first hand</li>
            <li> but it last for 2 - 3 hours top; after that you cannot even tell you ever put it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend Burberry strictly as a cologne for everyone because tastes differ,but for a thirties price range cologne?it&#x27;s pretty choice!but for a thirties price range</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and gentle.</li>
            <li> my 3rd burberry i love it</li>
            <li> but good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I used to own Burberry Touch, which I really liked for a spring cologne but wanted something a little bit more long lasting.</li>
            <li> and I use it for nice dinners and dressy events and leave my Acqua Di Gio for bars and other functions.</li>
            <li> i like it coz its cheaper than other store and nice smell.</li>
            <li> really should have visited the mall or dealer to smell it first hand.</li>
            <li> what a great, deep, complex scent; sandalwood with citrus undertones, it hangs throughout the day without overwhelming as long as apply a reasonably light touch.  </li>
            <li> My husband has used this cologne for many years, and I love the subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> Hard to to describe the smell, however I have discoverd that I like colognes with sandalwood, which is a gently warm slightly sweet smell.  </li>
            <li> That said, I wore it last night on a first date, and as soon as I showed up my date remarked I smell fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting good scent.</li>
            <li> I just think it isn&#x27;t for a certain type of guy like me.</li>
            <li> Burberry is smooth to the nose and fragrant with a mild sweetness to it,it&#x27;s both masculine and floral in character at the same time.</li>
            <li> i really like from yahoo</li>
            <li> Really recommend this anyone that just needs one cologne.</li>
            <li> I really like this smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, refined, but still manly musky.  </li>
            <li> and I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> I had it in 3 days thanks.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> i really like this burberry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about my fragrances</li>
            <li> My wife had picked this out about 2 years ago and always says how much she enjoys it when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> wife says thanks</li>
            <li> It came in a relatively fast manner brand-new.  </li>
            <li> really...</li>
            <li> Good fragrance and lingers for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I first became aware of this scent while shopping in an upscale major department store.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments with this scent than any other cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This scent barely lasts on me at all (although surely others have had different experiences).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a more mature scent meant for an older adult, perhaps mid 20&#x27;s and up.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this after I smelled a sample in Esquire magazine, and is the first time I&#x27;ve bought a cologne without spraying it and trying it out first.  </li>
            <li> Burberry is classic &amp;#34;london&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> HaHa Do yourself a favor check with Amazon before going shopping for your everyday needs, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> $, Amazon&#x27;s price is highly competitive.</li>
            <li> but it would not be high on my list for any use during the summer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it probably goes well on certain races and men of mature age</li>
            <li> It smells a little spicy, but not in an overwhelming fashion.</li>
            <li> For now Burberry is the &#x27;what&#x27;s in&#x27; cologne of moderately priced colognes,but I can say for the dollar value it will be an instant classic of some pretty worthy well priced colognes such as Aspen and Lucky Number 6</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon and paid nearly twice as much as it&#x27;s advertised for here.</li>
            <li> ,  shipping was fast and care  big thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very masculine cologne that would range from a older teenager to someone in there 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The main reason this only gets three stars is that Burberry has no real development throughout as many higher-quality colognes have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thought about switching it up on occasion, ya know, trying a new scent recommended by GQ</li>
            <li> Also on the bottle I see a sticker which is removed (could be a tester one) where as I ordered a new one for $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I still buy a new bottle of Burberry every time I run</li>
            <li> it last long and smells very sweet but still has a manly appeal 2 it.</li>
            <li> First of all I got this and cologne leaks from the spray cap and the smell is lil different than I had before and won&#x27;t stay on body for not even an hour .</li>
            <li> 4 stars only because it doesn&#x27;t last as some other fragnances I have used in the past, still, it&#x27;s a great buy!!</li>
            <li> , you save near $30!</li>
            <li> I should rate it four stars because it really doesn&#x27;t wear long nor does it spread much</li>
            <li> Burberry is not heavy or overwhelming but rather a subtle woodsy scent that is gentle on the nose.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased it many times in the past and it never gets old.</li>
            <li> This is a somewhat strong or heavy EDT</li>
            <li> &quot; Then I got to wake up next to numerous beautiful women who all mysteriously died tragically and ironically by various fictional super villains after each time followed by me using crazy gizmos and gadgets and my pimped out Astin Martin to chase and kill the villain&#x27;s right hand man, and then quoting the name of the movie right before or after I invoke justice on them in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very much one-note, and continues that way for however long it lasts.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad scent, but I don&#x27;t find it particularly interesting or inspiring.</li>
            <li> All in all, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m getting another one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also fast and proper services by amazon.</li>
            <li> .....perfect and masculine.</li>
            <li> Think modern, British, stability.</li>
            <li> Club\\&quot; not now that hes old and Fabio esque.</li>
            <li> I surprised him and bought it one day.  </li>
            <li> Very well priced, especially compared to perfume discount stores.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a fan of Ralph Lauren &amp;#34;Romance&amp;#34;, Christian Dior&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fahrenheit&amp;#34; or Giorgio Armani&#x27;s &amp;#34;Aqua Di Gio&amp;#34;, you will find Burberry appetizing.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap, synthetic, imitation to traditional bay rum.</li>
            <li> Masculine and yet a little bit sweet.</li>
            <li> Very few of the new colognes make you smell like a man should they smell really sweet and</li>
            <li> I would characterize this as more of a fall or winter scent due to the earthy, spicey, slightly musk smell.</li>
            <li> a cheesy ironic creative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morale of the story.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m interested in trying some of the other Burberry scents ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in trying the other Burberry varieties.</li>
            <li> and I only use two regularly -- Eau d&#x27;Issey by Issey Miyake is my main scent, but I do use Burberry sometimes on occassion</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size when the item was delivered because I was expecting something smaller for the price.</li>
            <li> Apparently he likes it.</li>
            <li> she feels like doing things I can&#x27;t mention here 2 me, and since she feels tht way, other women will certainly feel like tht.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but by the end of the day I had come to really enjoy its subtle, spicy scent.</li>
            <li> not sure if it was the spice used but in a closed door meeting at work I noticed that I started to have the headache and also noticed people inching away from the strong smell.</li>
            <li> Burberry is a complex fragrance which is unlike many other fragrances on the market.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is present, but barely.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this cologne I learned very quickly not to buy it from a Kohl&#x27;s store ever again...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on the life span of Burberry,it&#x27;s your typical cologne depending on if applied immediately after a shower,if you&#x27;ve perspired a lot,or your skin is dry it can last 4 to 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like really woodsy cologne</li>
            <li> and I would try a new cologne everyday.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I found this large bottle at such a small price!</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a bit difficult to accurately describe a scent in words, if you&#x27;re looking for something that is different and will get noticed, give this a shot.</li>
            <li> but I quickly became tired of the scent.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t took so long to arrived at my house, what I appreciate.</li>
            <li> , however it holds and lasts a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> When people ask what I&#x27;m wearing I just smile and say its a secret.</li>
            <li> when first applied, that&#x27;s not a criticism as it does mean you can use less and your 3.3 oz will last longer, but because I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I was a bit</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s about the same price at other perfume/cologne stores).</li>
            <li> I might have just gotten a bad bottle, because others seems to have better experiences than I.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered sooner than expected and in mint condition.</li>
            <li> Its is total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get tired of it very soon.</li>
            <li> i looked around other stores in it</li>
            <li> OTHER REVIEWS</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> This is my go-to scent for the past several years.  </li>
            <li> The prices on Amazon are extremely competitive, and almost always cheaper than other online fragrance sites.</li>
            <li> Plunk down your money and give it a whirl.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cologne based on the previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> Burberry for Men has a complex scent suggesting that it&#x27;s expensive and complimentary to the man wearing it.  </li>
            <li> it is not original .</li>
            <li> when I reach  for this and a few</li>
            <li> but after a few months there was lil white flakes in the bottle WEIRD</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Im not sure why</li>
            <li> Burberry by Burberry is one of the very few that stood out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i look around at store it hard to find in this small town,  anyway it</li>
            <li> was always at least $55, so since iorder everything else</li>
            <li> , SUCKS THAT OTHERS HAD ISSUES</li>
            <li> It is probably least suited for daytime summer use.</li>
            <li> and I was not only disappointed</li>
            <li> the spray part of the bottle was broken</li>
            <li> and they become outdated so quickly,all stores need to do is take them off their shelves when something newer comes out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat skeptical about ordering fragrances online</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> The one I got was fake.</li>
            <li> something is wrong with these colognes.</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical of ordering cologne online but will continue to order online from now on.</li>
            <li> totally fake item never buy again</li>
            <li> : smells manly, goes well with relaxed or casual dress,</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for over 10 years and have NEVER once had a woman tell me it smelled bad.</li>
            <li> Bad bad bad and bad.</li>
            <li> think I got crap for the money.</li>
            <li> This is the worst Burberry perfume I ever got.</li>
            <li> All you need to know is the smell is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i love it very nice cologne can c my self wearin dis as an trade mark cologne rite tru the year will recomend it to odda&#x27;s as well</li>
            <li> This has has been a favorite of mine for years.  First time ordering online.  For the price and free shipping, I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  Sent and received promptly.  Will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> The product was new and in good conditions. It hasn&#x27;t took so long to arrived at my house, what I appreciate. I don&#x27;t have anything to complain about.</li>
            <li> I cannot recall how many times a girl has commented, &amp;#34;You smell amazing.  What is that you&#x27;re wearing???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burberry, Thank You!  I&#x27;ve thought about switching it up on occasion, ya know, trying a new scent recommended by GQ but I&#x27;d rather go with a proven winner.</li>
            <li> My wife gave me a Burberry&#x27;s gift set and it&#x27;s now become my favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon and paid nearly twice as much as it&#x27;s advertised for here. I know where I&#x27;ll be buying my Burberry&#x27;s from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different body chemistry so no cologne smells the same on everyone. However, I have received more compliments on this scent than on any I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li> This product size is bigger than it looks, the best price to be found, and smells sooooo great.</li>
            <li> Very nice male fragrance.  Burberry is not heavy or overwhelming but rather a subtle woodsy scent that is gentle on the nose.  Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent price.  You get a lot for your money.  Works Excellent as well. No problems.  Would buy this brand again</li>
            <li> Product was delivered sooner than expected and in mint condition. Very satisfied. I&#x27;m somewhat skeptical about ordering fragrances online but eventhough I&#x27;m not an expert on this topic, the product received seems to be 100% genuine.&lt;br /&gt;tony</li>
            <li> First of all I got this and cologne leaks from the spray cap and the smell is lil different than I had before and won&#x27;t stay on body for not even an hour . Also on the bottle I see a sticker which is removed (could be a tester one) where as I ordered a new one for $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I got crap for the money.</li>
            <li> I ordedred this perfume Burberry By Burberry For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces&lt;br /&gt;But to my surprize whenever I use this perume its fragrance will just vanish in two hours. This is the worst Burberry perfume I ever got.I think its always better to spend some extra amount on Genuine perfumes at shopping malls rather then buying FAKE/DUPLICATE perfumes from vendors at Amazon.com. Its is total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> Went strictly with amazonian reviews... Last time I will do that again with colognes. really should have visited the mall or dealer to smell it first hand. I used to own Burberry Touch, which I really liked for a spring cologne but wanted something a little bit more long lasting. I gave this a shot and I was not only disappointed but it gave me headaches every time i used it. I know some cheap colognes do that to me, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting this from burberry. The bottle quality sub par and the smell over the top! not sure if it was the spice used but in a closed door meeting at work I noticed that I started to have the headache and also noticed people inching away from the strong smell. And this is just from one spray to the chest under my shirt. I probably would put it up on craigslist for 10$.</li>
            <li> Great scent for the price.  Good to wear for work not my favorite going out colgne but good for everyday use.  Long lasting good scent.</li>
            <li> Ok so i had saw this in a store going for 65 bucks n i looked around other stores in it was always at least $55, so since iorder everything else i really like from yahoo i took a chance on this and...ITS AMAZING. Same scent- Same size, BUT i only payed 27 bucks with 5 dollar shipping it was 33dollars and some change. BEST INVESTMENT EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that it smells different on me depending on what i shower with. It i use irish spring soap it has a more minty scent, where as if i use old spice its a more musk- woody scent..so for me its like gettting to colognes in one :]&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product! Arrived on time in great shape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ OTHER REVIEWS SO I WAS WORRIED BUT SOOOOOO WORTH IT, SUCKS THAT OTHERS HAD ISSUES BUT MINE BUY TURNED OUT GREAT!</li>
            <li> Great perfume for men. Good fragrance and lingers for a long long time. Value for money.</li>
            <li> Saw this same bottle at Sephora for almost DOUBLE the price. God I love Amazon. Unique scent, glad I went with it. Masculine and yet a little bit sweet. I love it.</li>
            <li> Very few of the new colognes make you smell like a man should they smell really sweet and kinda like a female don&#x27;t get me wrong I love sweet smelling colognes but at the same time I wanna smell like a str8 up sexy man at times with no doubt on what I have on and thats when I reach  for this and a few other but this one is a timeless cologne the ladys love it the mint and honey are just beautifully mixed 1 of my top 20 in all the colognes I have I reach for this way be for I even think cool water</li>
            <li> This is a well-balanced cologne. Good notes of spice and wood, noticeable but not overpowering. I am a fan of Burberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this scent one day when I was wearing a jacket. The next day I was wearing the same jacket, but not the cologne. No kidding, a woman in the grocery store came up to me out of the blue and said that I smelled good!</li>
            <li> Burberry for men is the best, if you want your man to smell good this is the perfect cologne for him.</li>
            <li> Great value, my husband wears this all the time, it is a lot of product for the money. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Great cologne for the price! Not too strong but just right. All the ladies love it too! Really recommend this anyone that just needs one cologne.</li>
            <li> I really like this smell.  Hard to to describe the smell, however I have discoverd that I like colognes with sandalwood, which is a gently warm slightly sweet smell.  I should rate it four stars because it really doesn&#x27;t wear long nor does it spread much (people have to be close to smell it) but for some people this is a good thing so I won&#x27;t ding it.</li>
            <li> I like this scent.  It&#x27;s gentle, refined, but still manly musky.  I never feel embarrassed wearing it out like cheaper or tackier stuff, and women at the office occasionally remark it&#x27;s nice.  That said, I wore it last night on a first date, and as soon as I showed up my date remarked I smell fantastic.  She couldn&#x27;t keep her hands off me all night, and kept remarking that I smelled like some kind of sex god, not kidding.  When I dropped her off, her friend remarked to her afterward that I smelled great.  Proof is in the pudding.  Plunk down your money and give it a whirl.  Lasts all night too.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this after I smelled a sample in Esquire magazine, and is the first time I&#x27;ve bought a cologne without spraying it and trying it out first.  I was not disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my favorite cologne.  To me it is a more sophisticated scent and I use it for nice dinners and dressy events and leave my Acqua Di Gio for bars and other functions.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, it is a wonderful perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 31$, Amazon&#x27;s price is highly competitive.</li>
            <li> This perfum has 2 things I look for on perfumes: personality and elegance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a dude with a strong character and born with elegance, then grab the box and get this perfum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it for special occasions, very important meetings and going out to dinner with my girl...</li>
            <li> I had never used or sampled this scent before but took a chance due to the nice reviews and the nice price from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;  The first time I used it I was a bit taken aback ... but by the end of the day I had come to really enjoy its subtle, spicy scent. This is a somewhat strong or heavy EDT when first applied, that&#x27;s not a criticism as it does mean you can use less and your 3.3 oz will last longer, but because I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I was a bit overwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;  However, once the EDT had had a chance to blend for 30 minutes or so, I found it quite attractive. And the best part, is it is one of the longest lasting EDTs I have used recently (including several from Polo, Ck, Kenneth Cole, ...).&lt;br /&gt;  I would characterize this as more of a fall or winter scent due to the earthy, spicey, slightly musk smell. It is probably least suited for daytime summer use. But during fall or winter, you could use this day or night. I could see myself continuing to use it during wintery spring evenings (in Colorado, they last until mid-April) but it would not be high on my list for any use during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;  All in all, I was pleasantly surprised. This is a very good scent, it lasts a long time and is available here for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;  Now I&#x27;m interested in trying some of the other Burberry scents ...</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and almost everyone was favorable, so I took a chance and bought this without smelling it. Big mistake. BTW, I have Burberry Brit and Burberry Touch and both of those are pretty good so I was looking forward to the Burberry original and I really wanted to like it. It smells like a house at Christmas time. Think cinnamon, pumpkin pie, spiced apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to smell like that, give it a try. It is a cheap, synthetic, imitation to traditional bay rum.</li>
            <li> THIS BURBERRY FOR MEN ORIGINAL SCENT IS A GREAT SMELL. NOT ONLY DO I LIKE IT BUT MY LADY DOES TOO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many colonges before and even now but this one here is my all time favorite great job to the shipper I had it in 3 days thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product before I ever smelled it based only on user reviews and the reviews are correct, this is a great fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: smells manly, goes well with relaxed or casual dress, good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I wish I had bought two of these instead of one!!!!!!</li>
            <li> good price good product good presentation i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran and you can be confident</li>
            <li> One of my go to colognes when I need to impress and the scent doesn&#x27;t fade like others. This is stronger than most so you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> Burberry is not too floral, not too musky... just the right balance for my boyfriend&#x27;s chemistry. I was surprised by the size when the item was delivered because I was expecting something smaller for the price. I was shopping based on my budget. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> A hint of carboxylic heat, with a myriad of lavenders and donkey breath. Manly and beastly, I have never felt more lovely in all of my life.</li>
            <li> I remember trying Burberry For Men *many* years ago and instantly loving the scent on me.  I filed it in the back of my memory to purchase one day.  I should have done it earlier...what a great, deep, complex scent; sandalwood with citrus undertones, it hangs throughout the day without overwhelming as long as apply a reasonably light touch.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to scent for the past several years.  It smells a little spicy, but not in an overwhelming fashion.</li>
            <li> i really like this burberry. it last long and smells very sweet but still has a manly appeal 2 it.</li>
            <li> The one I got was fake. Smell only lasted 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Smells like a  bergomat a sweet woodsy pine needs, fresh woman delighting sc. Definately a smell for one woman if you have 2 they wont like it.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this cologne for many years, and I love the subtle scent.  I have ordered it through Amazon before.  The prices on Amazon are extremely competitive, and almost always cheaper than other online fragrance sites.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for over 10 years and have NEVER once had a woman tell me it smelled bad. EVERYONE always ask WHAT ARE YOU WEARING. I reply L.P.D, they ask LPD? i say Liquid PANTY DROPPER. this stuff gets the women hot im telling you guys BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Clean and Crisp. Defined and Smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Burberry by Burberry for all occassions but it is great for the evening. IT has woodsy notes that remind me of autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about my fragrances and I only use two regularly -- Eau d&#x27;Issey by Issey Miyake is my main scent, but I do use Burberry sometimes on occassion and I love it. Thats it.</li>
            <li> Burberry classic has a really great, specific smell and it is not over powering. One of the best colognes out there in $30-40 range. 4 stars only because it doesn&#x27;t last as some other fragnances I have used in the past, still, it&#x27;s a great buy!!</li>
            <li> I Luv this Burberry. Pple always comment anytime I wear it. My girlfriend almost made me stop wearing it cos she said anytime I wear it she feels like doing things I can&#x27;t mention here 2 me, and since she feels tht way, other women will certainly feel like tht.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting another one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also fast and proper services by amazon.</li>
            <li> I wear burberry because its the best. When people ask what I&#x27;m wearing I just smile and say its a secret. I want this scent all to myself!</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for my uncle, but now I want it (and I&#x27;m a woman). When I tried it, it lingered all day. A great scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne based on the previous reviews.  I must say...the reviews were spot on!  It&#x27;s a great scent that lingers, but does not over power.  I would suggest every man have this in their stockpile.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad scent, but I don&#x27;t find it particularly interesting or inspiring. However, this cologne is fairly affordable compared to others, but my experience has been that affordability quite literally comes at a price. This scent barely lasts on me at all (although surely others have had different experiences). The main reason this only gets three stars is that Burberry has no real development throughout as many higher-quality colognes have. It&#x27;s very much one-note, and continues that way for however long it lasts. The drydown smells the same as the application. It&#x27;s fine for the office, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> I was running out of this cologne so I decided to buy one on Amazon despite some of the reviews. Well, i can tell you first hand something is wrong with these colognes. My original cologne which i bought at sephora smelled great and lasted the whole day. This one smells great but it last for 2 - 3 hours top; after that you cannot even tell you ever put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this cologne is great if you buy it at a regular store. I will not be buying colognes at Amazon anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Burberry for a long time and always buy it for my husband. Decided to buy through Amazon this time, and was amazed at the low price. Definitely the best price I&#x27;ve seen. Great service, too.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like a box of love that was shipped to the mayor of awesomeness, then you should smell like Burberry.</li>
            <li> My gal loves it very nice smelling for a man. I would buy it again and again, sent is very sexy for a man.</li>
            <li> this was recommended by my son for his dad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was purchased as part of his christmas gift&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;he loves the scents our son uses</li>
            <li> Burberry for Men has a complex scent suggesting that it&#x27;s expensive and complimentary to the man wearing it.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get tired of it very soon. I&#x27;m interested in trying the other Burberry varieties.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift for my boyfriend, and he loved it. Great size for a great price. And smells so good!</li>
            <li> I bought the same thing at macy&#x27;s for about $73 and change (it&#x27;s about the same price at other perfume/cologne stores). Quickly I checked on my phone how much it would be on Amazon and I was amazed at the price difference, you save near $30! I returned the one from macy&#x27;s and bought it from here. It is authentic Burberry, so no need to worry. This is my second time buying and once it runs out in about 8 months, I&#x27;ll buy another from here.</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for -- cheap cologne. I&#x27;ll never do that again. All you need to know is the smell is horrible. Bad bad bad and bad. Please I beg you, don&#x27;t buy this piece of trash.</li>
            <li> Every time I run out of Burberry by Burberry for Men, I have to immediately buy some more because it smells so good. I&#x27;m constantly complemented by the smell. It&#x27;s a must in every man&#x27;s collection, or even if it&#x27;s the first one!</li>
            <li> My husband loves cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great cologne at a GREAT price.  Burberry is classic &amp;#34;london&amp;#34;.  Not too fruity or spicy.....perfect and masculine.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance on my partner. It is warm and masculine but not abrasive. We&#x27;ve purchased it many times in the past and it never gets old. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of this cologne I have bought for my husband. I love the smell. This was processed and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice classic fragrance. Think modern, British, stability. I have like all the Burberry line. This orginal and the London line are my favorites.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments!! Its probably the favorite scent in my collection. I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome. It&#x27;s definitely a more mature scent meant for an older adult, perhaps mid 20&#x27;s and up. As far as the scent goes, its a fresh, crisp and refreshing smell that lasts all day. Totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife had picked this out about 2 years ago and always says how much she enjoys it when I wear it.  I ran out and could not find any till I went to your site.&lt;br /&gt;My wife says thanks</li>
            <li> It smells good....I just think it isn&#x27;t for a certain type of guy like me. I thought it smelled good on me but I quickly became tired of the scent. It&#x27;s too strong and citrusy. I think it probably goes well on certain races and men of mature age but I&#x27;ll finish the bottle and switch over to Burberry Touch.</li>
            <li> Did a mistake buying this one. Not even mild, can&#x27;t even smell it. No difference with and without wearing this one. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> this stuff smells so good i have to smell myself again and tell myself  i smell good.  real  good usuage and scent that ain&#x27;t over powering, however it holds and lasts a long, long time.  one of those you gotta have things.</li>
            <li> I put on this stuff and it was like I had the attraction of Zeus. It will turn you from Bieber to Bond in two sprays. It smells like God&#x27;s tears of laughter and love. I had girls coming up to smell me at bars, literally. As soon as it touched my skin, it went up into my face and throughout my body and gave me the mustache of Tom Selleck, the suave of Austin Powers, and the abs of Brad Pitt, but when he was in \\&quot;Fight Club\\&quot; not now that hes old and Fabio esque. After I put this stuff on, I walked out into my garage and to my surprise my &#x27;96 Honda civic had turned into a silver &#x27;65 Astin Martin DB5 and the license plate said \\&quot;BNDJMSBND.\\&quot; Then I got to wake up next to numerous beautiful women who all mysteriously died tragically and ironically by various fictional super villains after each time followed by me using crazy gizmos and gadgets and my pimped out Astin Martin to chase and kill the villain&#x27;s right hand man, and then quoting the name of the movie right before or after I invoke justice on them in a cheesy ironic creative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morale of the story. This stuff makes you awesome.</li>
            <li> If heaven has a scent, then this would be it..I don&#x27;t want you to be overly enthused&lt;br /&gt;about it...I want it all for me!</li>
            <li> Even tho this cologne has been out for about 10 years, I really like it and have had others comment on how good I smell :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was very pleased with Amazon&#x27;s price and the quick delivery time.</li>
            <li> I ordered Burberry last week.  It came in a relatively fast manner brand-new.  It smells GREAT!  It has citrus notes but woodsy. I usually don&#x27;t like really woodsy cologne but this stuff took the cake. It&#x27;s a very masculine cologne that would range from a older teenager to someone in there 60&#x27;s.  This stuff is really good and for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. It is also TSA sized so you can get through the airport security.</li>
            <li> Burberry is simply the best. The scent is amazing and I always get complimnets. There is nothing like it. I have been using Burberry for years and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I first became aware of this scent while shopping in an upscale major department store. I was thrown back at the price but I thought why not splurge, I am worth it. When it was time to get a replacement I thought I know I am worth it but the price made me think twice. I thought go to Amazon, I have gotten many deals there and hot damn there it was and GUESS what? I could buy TWO for almost the original price I paid for one. The scent is a clean fresh earthy scent for those that are wondering. You don&#x27;t need alot but your partner will enjoy being around you. HaHa Do yourself a favor check with Amazon before going shopping for your everyday needs, you will be glad you did. No, I don&#x27;t work for Amazon, just a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a while ago, and although I&#x27;m still satisfied with what I got for the price, I am disappointed that this wasn&#x27;t exactly like the bottle I had received as a gift from a store a couple of years back. This bottle seems to be almost diluted, if not simply weaker. The fragrance is present, but barely. It still good, but not as expected. I might have just gotten a bad bottle, because others seems to have better experiences than I.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a pleasant smell of apple, I could imagine this going well with an outdoor occasion like perhaps going to a park, beach..etc. In my opinion it may go better with a classy look and it does seem to be a bit strong, but it definitely is a great scent.</li>
            <li> It was the correct item but the spray part of the bottle was broken I had to pour the liquid into another bottle</li>
            <li> Great price and my nephew loved receiving this for Christmas. Was a bit skeptical of ordering cologne online but will continue to order online from now on.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this cologne I learned very quickly not to buy it from a Kohl&#x27;s store ever again...$52.00 for a 50ml bottle,luckily I had a 20% coupon so it chiseled a good chunk off the price.So on that note my second bottle came from amazon,there&#x27;s the lack of nostalgia from getting it in a department store (as things used to be)but there&#x27;s a more realistic price paid coming from a warehouse rather than convenience of immediately acquiring it and mark-up in price from a store.For now Burberry is the &#x27;what&#x27;s in&#x27; cologne of moderately priced colognes,but I can say for the dollar value it will be an instant classic of some pretty worthy well priced colognes such as Aspen and Lucky Number 6 and it&#x27;s refreshing to see an original scent come out of the woodwork.It&#x27;s not a overpowering cologne like Drakkar Noir(which I find to be a cloying scent),neither can I call it spicy,woodsy,sportsy or soapy.Burberry is smooth to the nose and fragrant with a mild sweetness to it,it&#x27;s both masculine and floral in character at the same time.Is this a good every day or formal cologne?in my opinion an excellent everyday cologne,it smells pleasant and relaxing.I think Burberry is more on the suave side on a date night or around the wife,the scent tries to be a smoother customer than something more muscular like Polo Original(green bottle with gold cap) or HUGO&#x27;s Boss Number One,last thing you want to do is set off your date&#x27;s allergies...so it&#x27;s fair to call Burberry neutral.I can&#x27;t really comment on the life span of Burberry,it&#x27;s your typical cologne depending on if applied immediately after a shower,if you&#x27;ve perspired a lot,or your skin is dry it can last 4 to 8 hours.In closing there&#x27;s way too many colognes these days and they become outdated so quickly,all stores need to do is take them off their shelves when something newer comes out and they&#x27;re still made but they lose their popularity streak.I can&#x27;t recommend Burberry strictly as a cologne for everyone because tastes differ,but for a thirties price range cologne?it&#x27;s pretty choice!but for a thirties price range cologne?it&#x27;s pretty choice!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like insecticide, like RAID or something. Was not what I was expecting at all. I think I was mistaken for a different cologne. So I let my Dad have it. Apparently he likes it.</li>
            <li> I have an extensive mens cologne collection and i always find myself going to this scent it seems like a safe scent for any occasion, winter, spring, i even wear it in the summer sometimes, for any event going on, i wear it to work, seems like a timeless scent, if i had to describe this scent it would be a fresh soapy scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after sampling many colognes when his favorite was discontinued.  I have a keen nose and knew right away that this would be a winner when he tried it on in a store.  I surprised him and bought it one day.  He is very happy with it and so am I. *grin*</li>
            <li> Im not sure why but after a few months there was lil white flakes in the bottle WEIRD</li>
            <li> Burberry is a complex fragrance which is unlike many other fragrances on the market. Although it&#x27;s a bit difficult to accurately describe a scent in words, if you&#x27;re looking for something that is different and will get noticed, give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this several times for myself I&#x27;m on my 3 bottle now... This a great value best I have found.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend fell in love with me because of this :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really... but it sure helped a lot.</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes out there.  Will buy this until they stop making it.  We buy testers to save $</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I found this large bottle at such a small price! I&#x27;ve been searching drugstores, department stores and everywhere else for this deal on Burberry Original and I&#x27;m so happy I found it here! My boyfriend fell in love with the cologne years ago, and giving him another bottle is the gift that keeps on giving!</li>
            <li> What a great product i love Burberry i do recommend this product for anyone the price is much cheaper than store prices dont waste your time going to stores. The smell is classic and original</li>
            <li> I get more compliments with this scent than any other cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned. Men/women/random animals can&#x27;t resist this scent.</li>
            <li> A favorite of mine for my husband.  Smells great--subtle, not overpowering.  Very well priced, especially compared to perfume discount stores.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite fragrances. It has a soft scent but it holds strong throughout the day. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> i like it coz its cheaper than other store and nice smell. however, why the price of it change every day?</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good and It is similar to what I remembered. I give it a 7.5 out of five.</li>
            <li> I love trying new colognes. I once worked at a Macy&#x27;s during the holiday season and I would try a new cologne everyday. I must have tried over 50 different colognes during that time. Burberry by Burberry is one of the very few that stood out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved how it smelled masculine, but didn&#x27;t have a smell similar to those scents that are associated with &amp;#34;manly men&amp;#34;. The scent is fresh and gentle. Just one spray stays with you for the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s eight years later and I still buy a new bottle of Burberry every time I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a fan of Ralph Lauren &amp;#34;Romance&amp;#34;, Christian Dior&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fahrenheit&amp;#34; or Giorgio Armani&#x27;s &amp;#34;Aqua Di Gio&amp;#34;, you will find Burberry appetizing.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; has been wearing this cologne for over 3 years and the scent still making me want him even more. It is a HUGE bottle and amazing deal for the price. I only paid $30-35 I think and it would have been $100 I&#x27;m sure if purchased at the mall. I was worried it may be expired but it was in perfect condition!!</li>
            <li> i look around at store it hard to find in this small town,  anyway it my 3rd burberry i love it,  shipping was fast and care  big thanks!</li>
            <li> Ordered based on reviews. I loved it, the wife did not. Got to go with the wife&#x27;s decision on this one.</li>
            <li> it is not original . totally fake item never buy again</li>
