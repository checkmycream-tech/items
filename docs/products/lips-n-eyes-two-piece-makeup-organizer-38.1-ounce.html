            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The clock is a nice touch and helps her keep track of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice change of pace from always giving gift cards.  </li>
            <li>It is made out of very cheap plastic and kind of reminds me of a kaboodle I had as a child in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Perfect organizational caddy for my 12 yr old.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;(more slots, more width in each</li>
            <li>This is in my bedroom, so I took it out and put more lipsticks in the gap</li>
            <li>I really love this organizer.</li>
            <li>It has compartments, many of my lip sticks pencils get stuck in the lip our pencil compartments.</li>
            <li>Would love if it had a hinged lid.</li>
            <li>It  fits all my lipsticks that i wear and eyeliners, tools for grooming and more.</li>
            <li>It will stain, so place a paper towel on top so powders like blush and bronzers do not stain it.</li>
            <li>It does not look as cute as I thought it would look.</li>
            <li>I love this organizer.  </li>
            <li>I just love how I can separate my gloss, mascara, eye liner, and even compacts.</li>
            <li>I guess my bronzer is just HUGE and has to sit on top</li>
            <li>The clock is detachable which is cool!</li>
            <li>The girls really like to collect and have their make-up items on display and handy, while the moms, like me, love that the collection is orderly and &amp;#34;put in its place.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to finally have a makeup organizer.</li>
            <li>Overall - a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic</li>
            <li>The side pockets are a fabulous addition.</li>
            <li>These organizers are perfect for any age, but with a daughter, her friends, and seven nieces, I really like to have this unique item to give to teen girls as they begin adding make-up to their lives.  </li>
            <li>They each have their own particular spot</li>
            <li>I bought one of the original lips n eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have the original Lips N Eyes</li>
            <li>Fine product, but needed the back of it to look as good as the front</li>
            <li>It is also great that there is an option to hang each unit on the wall if counter or shelf space is limited in your bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Overall the product is still good, and works as described.</li>
            <li>very nice, but not worth the $40</li>
            <li>Great little set for my products.</li>
            <li>That really adds more space for large brushes and tall items.  </li>
            <li>Before this, all her makeup was on a large tray, this organizer has helped clean it all up into a neat, organized pile.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to see Lips-n-Eyes back on the market, newly redesigned with the added tray and now available through the convenience of Amazon!  </li>
            <li>It actually the most useful without the clock.</li>
            <li>I love the white color and think the organizational compartments are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product, have been looking for a while for a different type of product for my cosmetics, i have been using the plastic trays with dividers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has plenty of holes, compartments for even the most anal organizers - It would 5 stars if it was slightly larger.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I, in return, have received many compliments back from the girls AND their moms.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived 2 days after purchase and I am very impressed; however if you have extremely expensive taste and decided to get this be aware that is it plastic</li>
            <li>I wish it had more room for large flat things.</li>
            <li>There is so much room.</li>
            <li>and you may not like it too much.</li>
            <li>As if that wasn&#x27;t awesome enough... - See more at: [...]</li>
            <li>The clock is very loud!</li>
            <li>I keep a light cloth draped over it to prevent dust and such getting into it because it&#x27;s a bit tricky to clean the narrow compartments.  </li>
            <li>The clock&#x27;s ticking is quite loud!</li>
            <li>Price is too expensive for the product, but other than that very nice.</li>
            <li>Too bad it cost more money to send back than it is worth.</li>

            <li> The only problem is the little analog clock doesn&#x27;t work even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> The box has the color listed as white (that is what I purchased) but the color is cream almost pink not white.</li>

            <li> The color was marked as &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; in the listing, but I see now that in my order it is called &amp;#34;warm white&amp;#34; which explains the ugly beige(ish) color.</li>

            <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;m so happy to finally have a makeup organizer. It looks great on my bureau! I love the white color and think the organizational compartments are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the cons (otherwise I would have definitely given it 5 stars):&lt;br /&gt;- I wish it had more room for large flat things. I guess my bronzer is just HUGE and has to sit on top&lt;br /&gt;(more slots, more width in each slot)&lt;br /&gt;- The clock&#x27;s ticking is quite loud! This is in my bedroom, so I took it out and put more lipsticks in the gap</li>
            <li> Just as described! EXCEPT for the colour! I bought white hoping it would be like IKEA white furniture, but nope!  The colour that I got looks like IVORY (picture shown at product description). Probably they gave me the wrong one, I dont know~ Anyway, The item came with 1 battery and screws. The clock is detachable which is cool! Overall the product is still good, and works as described.</li>
            <li> Great little set for my products. Makes everything look neat and not out of place.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it!  Perfect organizational caddy for my 12 yr old.</li>
            <li> I really love this organizer. For YEARS my makeup has been in a makeup bag that I had to sift through EVERY SINGLE TIME I went to put on makeup. No more...now I just reach for whatever I need and it no longer takes me a half hour to do my makeup! My husband is VERY HAPPY about this! The only problem is the little analog clock doesn&#x27;t work even with new batteries. No worries....don&#x27;t need a clock anyway!</li>
            <li> It has compartments, many of my lip sticks pencils get stuck in the lip our pencil compartments. The clock is very loud! I took it out and used it as storage compartment. It actually the most useful without the clock. I use cause I don&#x27;t want feel I wasted my money, but if I could do it over I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the item.</li>
            <li> The color is definitely not white. The box has the color listed as white (that is what I purchased) but the color is cream almost pink not white. Also the battery that came in the clock is dead I replaced the battery thinking the one that came with it might just be dead but that is not the problem, the clock is broken and will not work. Not impressed with this item at all. Too bad it cost more money to send back than it is worth.</li>
            <li> A convenient way to corral my wayward cosmetics.  Feel a bit lighter-weight than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s held up well for several months.  You can pull out the middle section and store some bulkier or less-used items in the back.  I keep a light cloth draped over it to prevent dust and such getting into it because it&#x27;s a bit tricky to clean the narrow compartments.  Would love if it had a hinged lid.</li>
            <li> I love this organizer!  I bought one of the original lips n eyes.  Mine doesn&#x27;t have the pockets on the sides.  That really adds more space for large brushes and tall items.  I use mine everyday and miss it when I travel.</li>
            <li> i just finished placing all my cosmetics in their proper place on this organizer. I love this product, have been looking for a while for a different type of product for my cosmetics, i have been using the plastic trays with dividers. This one has room for all my stuff. It  fits all my lipsticks that i wear and eyeliners, tools for grooming and more. It will stain, so place a paper towel on top so powders like blush and bronzers do not stain it. It is a white plastic, has to parts. Looking at the picture the middle section slides out. If you do not want to use the side pieces, they are all one piece there. Also comes with screws to hang on the wall. The clock doesnt come with a battery. I like it for show. There is so much room. Great product, looks great in my bathroom. So organized, i do not have to look for things anymore. Very happy</li>
            <li> Slightly smaller than I expected but my wife loves it. Before this, all her makeup was on a large tray, this organizer has helped clean it all up into a neat, organized pile. The clock is a nice touch and helps her keep track of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has plenty of holes, compartments for even the most anal organizers - It would 5 stars if it was slightly larger. Overall - a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Price is too expensive for the product, but other than that very nice.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to see Lips-n-Eyes back on the market, newly redesigned with the added tray and now available through the convenience of Amazon!  I ordered two of these cosmetics organizers this time, one in white and one in ivory.  I am giving them again as gifts.  These organizers are perfect for any age, but with a daughter, her friends, and seven nieces, I really like to have this unique item to give to teen girls as they begin adding make-up to their lives.  It&#x27;s a nice change of pace from always giving gift cards.  My daughter and I, in return, have received many compliments back from the girls AND their moms.  The girls really like to collect and have their make-up items on display and handy, while the moms, like me, love that the collection is orderly and &amp;#34;put in its place.&amp;#34;  It is also great that there is an option to hang each unit on the wall if counter or shelf space is limited in your bathroom.  Thankfully, I&#x27;m already ahead with ideas for my holiday shopping this year!</li>
            <li> It is made out of very cheap plastic and kind of reminds me of a kaboodle I had as a child in the 90&#x27;s. The color was marked as &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; in the listing, but I see now that in my order it is called &amp;#34;warm white&amp;#34; which explains the ugly beige(ish) color. Overall it is flimsy and pretty ugly in person, but it does help keep my makeup somewhat organized. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I saw it in a store.</li>
            <li> Fine product, but needed the back of it to look as good as the front (I have an exposed shelf). Cheap plastic; didn&#x27;t suit my needs.</li>
            <li> I did not like it as much as I expected. But the materials are as advertised. I just think it was my bad choice. It does not look as cute as I thought it would look. I did not like it on my vanity in my room, so I will probably give it away.</li>
            <li> It keeps my make up organized. I just wish the clock came with a battery</li>
            <li> I have the original Lips N Eyes and I absolutely love it! No more mess on my bathroom counter. The side pockets are a fabulous addition.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Has just enough room for the things I needed it for.  Also looks very tidy on my counter. However if you have a lot of compact type items ,it might not be for you.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and very expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> very nice, but not worth the $40</li>
            <li> I love this organizer.  All of the compartments are conveniently placed, especially for eye-pencils, mascaras, brushes, lipsticks,etc.  This would make a great gift for makeup lovers!</li>
            <li> The Lips-n-Eyes organizer is ideal for beauty products to be neatly organized and separated for easier access. No need to dig or shuffle around with this organizer. I just love how I can separate my gloss, mascara, eye liner, and even compacts. They each have their own particular spot so I know where to look for each item and they do not even need to touch each other. As if that wasn&#x27;t awesome enough... - See more at: [...]</li>
            <li> Product arrived 2 days after purchase and I am very impressed; however if you have extremely expensive taste and decided to get this be aware that is it plastic and you may not like it too much. I like it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
