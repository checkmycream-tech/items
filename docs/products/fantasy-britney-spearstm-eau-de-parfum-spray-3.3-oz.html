            <li>I work at a consignment shop that&#x27;s geared for teens, so when this came in I just snickered because it&#x27;s Britney, and we all know how awesomely she&#x27;s doing these days...</li>

            <li>It has a warm tone to it.</li>
            <li>It kind of smells like cotton candy.</li>
            <li>Out of curiosity, I opened it and could not believe I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like cotton candy</li>
            <li>This smells so good and the packaging is so cute....</li>
            <li>The nice thing is you don&#x27;t need to douse yourself with it to get the effect.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it is sweet smelling, as another reviewer mentions, but it&#x27;s a pleasant sweetness.  </li>
            <li>&quot; The way it smells is just too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my mom and my sister and just like curious, they loved it, the packaging is so amazing its so nice, and the bottle is so adorable,but the best part is the scent its a sweet scent but yet not too sweet to give you</li>
            <li>and i am sure its going to be a hit</li>
            <li>and I must admit that I love it.</li>
            <li>I love perfumes that can turn heads &amp;</li>
            <li>I was walking through the fragrance section in Dillards looking for a great sweet but not headache sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li>I thought \\&quot;I&#x27;ll just see what it smells like, but surely I wont buy this one.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I also tried sevral more fragrances.</li>
            <li>I love the sweetness to it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a stronger, bolder and more exotic scent.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with both the bottle, and the scent instantaneously.</li>
            <li>Insanity\\&quot; and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I didnt find it too appealing.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle though and</li>
            <li>Then on the way out make sure to buy some, because you know you were smelling your wrist the whole time shopping and loved it :)</li>
            <li>Kind of sweet, sugary, but sensual with the hints of musk and vanilla.</li>
            <li>She has been showered many times with gifts and this was a special one.  </li>
            <li>ANd to add, the packaging for it is super cute.</li>
            <li>Its so sexy, and yet so fun.</li>
            <li>I am 40 and fell in love with this scent right away.  </li>
            <li>If you want fun and flirty, this is for you!</li>
            <li>I love both the perfumes and it&#x27;s nice to have 2 different scents to interchange b/c</li>
            <li>If you like sweet candy scents with a hint of sexiness, this one is for you.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>For the people it didn&#x27;t smell good on, everyone&#x27;s body chemistry  is different.</li>
            <li>I think I will buy a full sized bottle once my sample is gone.</li>
            <li>I left the mall with out any purfume, but i kept digging in my purse for that incredably good smell</li>
            <li>love Curious, and now I love Fantasy, too!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of Britney&#x27;s first perfume, Curious, but this one is great.</li>
            <li>I decided to order a sample size off of Ebay before buying the full monty - because the last perfume we both really liked was Sensi</li>
            <li>This perfume is just right for it addresses my love of sweet smells but blends it with just the right amount of mature sexiness.  </li>
            <li>I think Fantasy smells a lot like this cotton candy spray I had in elementary school.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be appropriate for preteens, but not grown women, then again, should I be surprised?</li>
            <li>My mother,who is 75, never mentions my perfume, noticed it right away and kept asking me about it.  </li>
            <li>gone bad (if that&#x27;s even possible); except nothing near perfect to that delicious candy.</li>
            <li>It is a sweet scent, but not so much that it will give you a headache.....</li>
            <li>I am the type of person that cant wear many purfumes unless they are the cheap fruitty body sprays that dont last because I am sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>, I was attracted to the pretty bottle first and tried some on.</li>
            <li>this is such a fabulous scent!</li>
            <li>I first smelled this perfume on a strip in a magazine.</li>
            <li>Better luck with the 3rd one.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it on, the cashier at Target said, \\&quot;Mmmm...</li>
            <li>The base note of vanilla lingers throughout making FANTASY a truly delicious classic in the making - Angel light!!</li>
            <li>The only reason to buy it is the bottle, besides that, use a strong shampoo and you have her parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky about perfumes, but I bought this one the day after I smelled the sample.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I still really like it.  </li>
            <li>Typically I go for more classic scents like Chanel or really light natural ones (like from Origins), so this branching out for me.</li>
            <li>Curious smells way better than this one.</li>
            <li>First let me say I&#x27;m not a teeny bopper Britney fan,so this is coming from a 33 yr old perfume addict!</li>
            <li>As I am getting older(24)I have been feeling the urge to have a more sophisticated individual smell but all the expensive purfumes I have tried were too strong and gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of sweet perfumes but now that I&#x27;m in my mid twenties</li>
            <li>I prefer Curious, which smells youthful and light, but</li>
            <li>I love the bottle, and have already bought a few bottles for friends of mine as well.</li>
            <li>This may not be the scent for a professional woman, but there are enough of those light, barely there scents for them.</li>
            <li>when the lady told me it was britney&#x27;s new perfume</li>
            <li>I had actually planned on buying this perfume even before testing it, for I was so pleased with Curious.</li>
            <li>But after having went to a local Sephora, I was highly displeased!!</li>
            <li>The bottle is elegant, but the scent is juvenile.</li>
            <li>They are two very different perfumes, so it&#x27;s easy to understand why a person can like one and not the other.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to know what it smelled it because I didn&#x27;t like Curious too much and really just smelled it to see what she had designed.</li>
            <li>I had purchased the larger, 100 ml, and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>&quot; smells without feeling too young.  </li>
            <li>and was by far, looking forward to Fantasy.</li>
            <li>It is soft, sweet and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I am such a huge fan of Curious!</li>
            <li>It would probably be a good scent for teenagers who like smelling like candy, but for working professionals it is a little too juvenile.</li>
            <li>This one is a little too sweet for my tastes.</li>
            <li>So to new people wanting to try it out, I suggest on your next mall trip, spray some on in the beginning and walk around and see how it takes to your body.</li>
            <li>Just because you liked Curious doesn&#x27;t mean you will like this one.</li>
            <li>This is forsure a MAJOR HIT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this today at Macy&#x27;s since I really like Curious.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the gift but the love behind it that counts.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of the Dion but was still sad that I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Curious smelled a little cheap to me, like a drugstore brand.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I liked the smell of the Dion but was still sad that I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Curious smelled a little cheap to me, like a drugstore brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this on the fantasybritneyspears.com website &amp; counting down the days until my holiday to New York - the fact that it&#x27;s Britney made me wanted it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells similar to a perfume I used to wear a long time ago by Escada that was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that after Curious (which I disliked) that Britney could release such a YUMMY fragrance.</li>
            <li> One, it was far too sweet, and secondly, it smelt quite bad.</li>
            <li> I am not really able to pull off the younger \\&quot;cotton candy\\</li>
            <li> I got the other.</li>
            <li> I was not going to let her down.  </li>
            <li> Let me first tell you that I think Britney Spears is a retarded gross ho.</li>
            <li> I received a department store sales flyer in the mail a few days ago and it had a sample of Fantasy in it.  </li>
            <li> and I stopped dead in my tracks like</li>
            <li> I went back to the store everyday for about a month to put some on and see if I had a bad reaction and never did.</li>

            <li> I bought it for my mom and my sister and just like curious, they loved it, the packaging is so amazing its so nice, and the bottle is so adorable,but the best part is the scent its a sweet scent but yet not too sweet to give you a headache trust me my mom and sister are getting compliments on this and i am sure its going to be a hit just like curious so go out there and get your FANTASY!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this perfume at the mall and I must admit that I love it. I&#x27;m not a fan of Britney&#x27;s first perfume, Curious, but this one is great. It has a warm tone to it. It kind of smells like cotton candy. Delicious!!!</li>
            <li> I am the type of person that cant wear many purfumes unless they are the cheap fruitty body sprays that dont last because I am sensitive to scents. As I am getting older(24)I have been feeling the urge to have a more sophisticated individual smell but all the expensive purfumes I have tried were too strong and gave me a headache. Then came out Fantasy, I was attracted to the pretty bottle first and tried some on. I went back to the store everyday for about a month to put some on and see if I had a bad reaction and never did. I just bought it a week ago and am in love, it smells like cotton candy and a hint of vanilla!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend.  She had told me about it after Christmas, when she smelled it from a strip in a magazine.  I told her I would get it for her.  I had purchased the larger, 100 ml, and she absolutely loves it.  She has been showered many times with gifts and this was a special one.  I was not going to let her down.  It&#x27;s not the gift but the love behind it that counts.</li>
            <li> First let me say I&#x27;m not a teeny bopper Britney fan,so this is coming from a 33 yr old perfume addict! I had a magazine that had this sample in it. I just wanted to know what it smelled it because I didn&#x27;t like Curious too much and really just smelled it to see what she had designed.Curious smelled a little cheap to me, like a drugstore brand.&lt;br /&gt; But I have to say Fantasy blew me away in a million ways! WOW... this is such a fabulous scent! I love perfumes that can turn heads &amp; this will be one of them. If you like sweet candy scents with a hint of sexiness, this one is for you.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m really picky about perfumes, but I bought this one the day after I smelled the sample.&lt;br /&gt;  For the people it didn&#x27;t smell good on, everyone&#x27;s body chemistry  is different. So to new people wanting to try it out, I suggest on your next mall trip, spray some on in the beginning and walk around and see how it takes to your body. Then on the way out make sure to buy some, because you know you were smelling your wrist the whole time shopping and loved it :)&lt;br /&gt;  This may not be the scent for a professional woman, but there are enough of those light, barely there scents for them. If you want fun and flirty, this is for you!</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s.  I am not a Britney fan at all.  I received a department store sales flyer in the mail a few days ago and it had a sample of Fantasy in it.  Out of curiosity, I opened it and could not believe I liked the scent.  My husband and I are both picky about perfume.  I decided to order a sample size off of Ebay before buying the full monty - because the last perfume we both really liked was Sensi - but it made my husband sick after a bit.  Well, I got it yesterday and I still really like it.  I am shocked the sweetness that it starts with does not give me a headache.  I think I will buy a full sized bottle once my sample is gone.</li>
            <li> I tried this today at Macy&#x27;s since I really like Curious. This one is a little too sweet for my tastes. It would probably be a good scent for teenagers who like smelling like candy, but for working professionals it is a little too juvenile. I prefer Curious, which smells youthful and light, but not like you just took a bath in sugar.</li>
            <li> Why do all of her fragrances smell like shampoo? The only reason to buy it is the bottle, besides that, use a strong shampoo and you have her parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I like the bottle a lot, so I&#x27;ll give it one star instead of none.</li>
            <li> I just got this perfume for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  I love it!  Yes, it is sweet smelling, as another reviewer mentions, but it&#x27;s a pleasant sweetness.  Cotton candy does describe it, actually.  But who says grownups don&#x27;t like smelling yummy??  There&#x27;s a hint of vanilla as well and overall, I think the combo is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Curious, and now I love Fantasy, too!  They are two very different perfumes, so it&#x27;s easy to understand why a person can like one and not the other.  I will say, though, that Fantasy lasts far longer than Curious.  You can apply it in the morning and still smell it when you go to sleep!  Which, I don&#x27;t mind at all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this, of course, but I recommend you sample it before you buy.  Just because you liked Curious doesn&#x27;t mean you will like this one.</li>
            <li> I was in the mall and a woman passed me and all i could smell was this amazing scent.  I went into macys and again smelt the fragrance and asked what it was.  when the lady told me it was britney&#x27;s new perfume i was suprised.  she has a great sense of what people like.  i bought one for my girlfriend and sister then and there for christmas.</li>
            <li> I work at a consignment shop that&#x27;s geared for teens, so when this came in I just snickered because it&#x27;s Britney, and we all know how awesomely she&#x27;s doing these days...&lt;br /&gt;Then my manager sprayed it one day for a customer and I stopped dead in my tracks like, \\&quot;What is that DELICIOUS smell??\\&quot; I was really surprised that after Curious (which I disliked) that Britney could release such a YUMMY fragrance. Very surprising. Kind of sweet, sugary, but sensual with the hints of musk and vanilla. I&#x27;d suggest trying it before purchasing. Typically I go for more classic scents like Chanel or really light natural ones (like from Origins), so this branching out for me. But boy am I glad!</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of sweet perfumes but now that I&#x27;m in my mid twenties I am not really able to pull off the younger \\&quot;cotton candy\\&quot; smells without feeling too young.  This perfume is just right for it addresses my love of sweet smells but blends it with just the right amount of mature sexiness.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am such a huge fan of Curious! and was by far, looking forward to Fantasy. But after having went to a local Sephora, I was highly displeased!! One, it was far too sweet, and secondly, it smelt quite bad. It started off smelling like Mangos, but then turned into an awful stench. Kind of like cotton candy gone bad (if that&#x27;s even possible); except nothing near perfect to that delicious candy. I had actually planned on buying this perfume even before testing it, for I was so pleased with Curious. Thank god I didn&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> I was walking through the fragrance section in Dillards looking for a great sweet but not headache sweet fragrance. I ran across Britneys Fantasy. I thought \\&quot;I&#x27;ll just see what it smells like, but surely I wont buy this one.\\&quot; I also tried sevral more fragrances. I left the mall with out any purfume, but i kept digging in my purse for that incredably good smell i kept smelling. I was thinking that this scent is going to be my signature scent when I find out what it is. Turns out it was Britney Spears Fantasy. I went back and bought it the next day. Everyone at my house LOVES it!</li>
            <li> I think this parfum is so wonderful.I love the sweetness to it but it also has an hint of sexiness about it.I bet you if Britney wears this scent of hers on herself it drives Kevin crazy.I think this scent would be a great choice for women of all ages.</li>
            <li> Britney Spears follow-up fragerance \\&quot;Fantasy\\&quot; is truly \\&quot;BREATH-TAKING!\\&quot; The way it smells is just too good to be true. Its so sexy, and yet so fun. I would perfer if all woman wore this scent. ANd to add, the packaging for it is super cute. I love the bottle, and have already bought a few bottles for friends of mine as well. This is forsure a MAJOR HIT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-if you have not smelled it, I urge you too! FANTASY BRITNEY SPEARS is AMAZING, truly AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This smells so good and the packaging is so cute....It smells similar to a perfume I used to wear a long time ago by Escada that was discontinued. It is a sweet scent, but not so much that it will give you a headache.....Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent. It&#x27;s a stronger, bolder and more exotic scent. I love both the perfumes and it&#x27;s nice to have 2 different scents to interchange b/c some days you want something light...and \\&quot;Curious\\&quot; is perfect for those days, but on the days you want something stronger, I definitely recommend \\&quot;Fantasy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume on a strip in a magazine. I fell in love with both the bottle, and the scent instantaneously. I decided when I had some extra cash I would buy it or hopefully drop enough hints to get it for Christmas. Christmas came and went and no Fantasy, instead I recieved Celine Dion&#x27;s fragrance. I liked the smell of the Dion but was still sad that I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted. I decided to buy the fantasy for myself. Upon finding it at a makeup counter I became rather thankful I got the other. I think Fantasy smells a lot like this cotton candy spray I had in elementary school. mmmm to smell like a 4th grader again. The bottle is elegant, but the scent is juvenile. It&#x27;d be appropriate for preteens, but not grown women, then again, should I be surprised? I suppose the scent caters well to Spears&#x27; followers, 12 year olds.</li>
            <li> Let me first tell you that I think Britney Spears is a retarded gross ho. But I got this perfume as a Christmas gift, and it smells absolutely beautiful. I call it \\&quot;Britney Spears: Insanity\\&quot; and I love it. I just wish someone else had made it. What a delightful shock!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this on the fantasybritneyspears.com website &amp; counting down the days until my holiday to New York - the fact that it&#x27;s Britney made me wanted it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was I disappointed after my wait? Not at all, I bought the 100ml bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I was a little wary - I suffer from migraines so can&#x27;t wear a lot of my favourites; including Angel by Thierry Mugler. Not so with FANTASY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This opens with the sweetness of chocolate and cupcake, before settling with fruity scents of lychee, quince and kiwi. The base note of vanilla lingers throughout making FANTASY a truly delicious classic in the making - Angel light!!</li>
            <li> I went to smell this at Macys and I didnt find it too appealing. Curious smells way better than this one. I found this one to have a vanilla kinda scent I dont know lol. I love the bottle though and Im a sucker for that. So I would probably buy it just to have it lol. Better luck with the 3rd one. ;/</li>
            <li> This is the greatest smelling perfume ever, I would recommend this to any because it smells so great!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am 40 and fell in love with this scent right away.  The nice thing is you don&#x27;t need to douse yourself with it to get the effect.  My mother,who is 75, never mentions my perfume, noticed it right away and kept asking me about it.  I just ordered her some for her birthday.</li>
            <li> I have been stalking this perfume for months.  The first time I tried it on, the cashier at Target said, \\&quot;Mmmm... somebody smells good!\\&quot;.  So, every time I went in Target, I took a spritz. Last night, I was shopping with a friend, and after trying it on again, he grabbed the box, put it in the cart and said he was buying it for me.  So, I guess he liked it too, lol.  When I got home, I had my daughter, my brother and my husband smell it on me.  They all loved it!  It is soft, sweet and long lasting.</li>
