            <li>I had read reviews at perfume sites and thought it sounded appealing .</li>

            <li>I love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light, a fruity, subtlety spicy and warm fragrance, that is refreshing and clean overall.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>This is a powerful fragrance that lasts all day and is feminine and well formulated .</li>
            <li>Price was right also.  </li>
            <li>Actually, strong overbearing perfumes usually give me a headache, if really strong even nausea, so I&#x27;m in the habit of light and fruity.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good smell and cost effective. the best for the price, out of the US it cost double so i could not give up and bought two...</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!  I placed my order on Monday, April 27 and it was delivered on Wednesday, April 29!!!  I wish I could give Amazon more than just five stars for satisfaction, maybe more like ten or fifteen!  Product is exactly as described.  100% satisfaction...today and always!  I&#x27;d be lost without Amazon....thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> Great ! thanks amazon.com</li>
            <li> I completely second every word of IllinoisMom&#x27;s review.  I bought it in Europe in 2001 (at the time the only place you could get it).  Not only do you smell fantastic for days with just a spray, but MEN WILL STOP YOU and just ask to smell you.  In fact, I think this should come with a disclaimer.</li>
            <li> This perfume just match perfectly my skin chemistry&lt;br /&gt;I use it in a daily basis and always have great compliment about it... Subtle and very sensual perfume.. I will recommend it for a mature audience ...</li>
            <li> this order was not a razor... it was the Mauboussin perfume as pictured.  Delivery quick, I like the perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance I love wearing.&lt;br /&gt;It is light, a fruity, subtlety spicy and warm fragrance, that is refreshing and clean overall.&lt;br /&gt;I always flavor a citrusy and fresh smelling perfume which is not too heavy and overpowering. Actually, strong overbearing perfumes usually give me a headache, if really strong even nausea, so I&#x27;m in the habit of light and fruity.&lt;br /&gt;I received many compliments and will continue usining it.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. I get nice compliments. Especially from men.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent. I&#x27;ve been looking for it for years at the different perfume stores. Don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to check Amazon. Price was right also.  I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> stains clothes and really smells like an very old perfume.  not my cup of tea.  I bought it blindly based on reviews.  Perhaps it smells better on others.  Definitely an old lady smelling perfume on me.  never again...i threw mine away.</li>
            <li> My wife has received many compliments whenever she wears Mauboussin  Eau De Parfum. The last order was her secound&lt;br /&gt;  bottle.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this when I was in Paris and the smell is incredible. I bought this for my mom and it is all that she wears. A lot of people compliment her!</li>
            <li> This is a powerful fragrance that lasts all day and is feminine and well formulated . I had read reviews at perfume sites and thought it sounded appealing . I am not disappointed as I like bold scents that last and that are womanly , classy , and not obnoxious . This is a keeper !</li>
            <li> perfect gift ....everything was fine</li>
            <li> Mauboussin is the most exquisite perfume! I use it some years ago and not change it for none.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and well packaged, I do Not like the fragrance unfortunately. Blind buy based on reviews. Nice bottle though..</li>
            <li> Love  the smell and presentation! I got many compliments wearing it!</li>
            <li> I noticed the fragrance on a woman as I was shopping.  I asked her the name of the perfume which she gladl y gave to me.  I have worn it for a month and have received so many compliments on the fragrance, although I can&#x27;t smell it on myself.  The price isnt&#x27; too shabby either.</li>
            <li> Price for this perfume was great and it stays on me better than other perfumes.  I love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Spicy baby powder woody floral sweet scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So nice I bought it twice once for my mother and shortly after for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grown woman smell (grown woman NOT old woman)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice smell very attractive for women great price for a lot of fragrance! Last pretty long and drys down nicely this is an evening scent for any occasion!</li>
            <li> Given as a Christmas gift. This is the original edition. Just what my family member wanted, and a great price at the time.</li>
