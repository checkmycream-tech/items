            <li>Good soap and good value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, it seems to lather up nicely and the scent is very nice.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing really exceptional about this product but it works as promised.</li>

            <li>After using many different shave soaps I have to say that this soap suits me the best.</li>
            <li>Not an overwhelming fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this shave soap.</li>
            <li>I have found I like creams better than soaps.  </li>
            <li>At this price, what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>I now love to shave.</li>
            <li>Also noticed more razor burn from it.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to learn how to get the VDH to lather well, and once I figured out the trick, I am able to get a much better lather than I am with the Parker.  </li>
            <li>The sent is a favorite.</li>
            <li>This shave soap produces an adequate lather, nice results, no complaints with how it works.</li>
            <li>This product has an excellent aroma to it but didn&#x27;t seem to soften the beard as well as other products.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pretty light (which I like) and the cushion it provides is better than the VDH Deluxe I was using before I bought this.</li>
            <li>Parker Sandalwood &amp; Shea Butter lubricates well without being greasy and has a mild scent that I love.</li>
            <li>one note to maker is that it doesn&#x27;t quite fit in the van den haugen</li>
            <li>i recommend you put in in the microwave inside the mug for about 30 seconds to make it fit.</li>
            <li>The puck didn&#x27;t fit in my mug</li>
            <li>I use this for my legs, it produces a rich lather while protecting my skin.</li>
            <li>It certainly rinses better than Col. Conk&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Simply said, good stuff ...</li>
            <li>Super Safety Razors ships quickly and reliably.</li>
            <li>very easy to make a good lather and provides a very slick shave,.</li>
            <li>Well worth a try.</li>
            <li>While the Van Der Hagen does a nice job, and is considerably cheaper than the Parker, I would say the Parker is worth the extra money - mostly because of the lather.  </li>
            <li>These provide a great lather, last a long time, and don&#x27;t have too strong of a smell.</li>
            <li>I am just getting started with the shift to DE shaving and this is my first soap.</li>
            <li>Also be aware it is a smallish puck.</li>
            <li>This Parker soap has a wonderful but subtle scent that seems clean and manly, and provides an excellent lubrication base for my face.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced for premium shaving soap.</li>
            <li>The quality of shave I get with this soap is at least as good as, or better than the other two.  </li>
            <li>No only have I stepped my razor cost down from $35 a month to $3 a month, but I&#x27;ve quit using cans of shaving cream and gel and re-discovered how amazing it is to lather my face with a real soap and brush.  </li>
            <li>They cost a little more than the cheap shaving soaps but the bars seem to last a long time.  </li>
            <li>the most part this is true but it does contain propelyne glycol (a petroleum derivative) and a few other non-natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In a fit of anger I logged onto Amazon and scored myself a nice Merkur safety razor handle, an assortment of blades.. and a Parker brush and a twin-pack of soap.  </li>
            <li>and wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>The Parker seems like lathers up fast, but I&#x27;ve had a hard time getting a nice thick, dense foam.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty new to wet shaving and have only limited exposure to shaving soaps</li>
            <li>The only possible complaint is that once foamed with a brush it dries out a bit quicker than others I have used, but that is an easy problem to fix.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how long it&#x27;s lasted.  </li>

            <li> But I spent a couple three days wondering where that weird smell around the bathroom counter was coming from, like maybe some nail polish remover had spilled or something.</li>

            <li> It was just getting insane what Gillette was demanding I pay for cartridges.  </li>

            <li> After using many different shave soaps I have to say that this soap suits me the best. It has a great smell, foams up nice and stays foamed. Works great for a safety razor. The only possible complaint is that once foamed with a brush it dries out a bit quicker than others I have used, but that is an easy problem to fix. For the price you can&#x27;t beat the quality.</li>
            <li> The thickest luxurious and EASIEST lather i have ever found! BUT, the scent is horrendous. Absolutely not a speck of sandalwood. It smells like generic baby butt wipes.</li>
            <li> Simply said, good stuff ... nice fragrance, good lather.</li>
            <li> Good lather, nice scent that&#x27;s not cloying, this shaving soap includes emollients that leaves your skin refreshed and smooth. Reasonably priced for premium shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Good product. Not an overwhelming fragrance. Doesn&#x27;t leave the face dry. Has a good feel to it. Well worth a try. I use an Edwin Jagger double edge or my Merkur adjustable double edge.</li>
            <li> I love this shave soap. It smells great and creates a great lather. The only thing I would add is a shaving bowl with it.</li>
            <li> very easy to make a good lather and provides a very slick shave,. i recommend if you are getting a watery lather squeeze out the brush a bit to get a thicker lather. this produce smells great, my wife loves the smell. one note to maker is that it doesn&#x27;t quite fit in the van den haugen shave mug i recommend you put in in the microwave inside the mug for about 30 seconds to make it fit.</li>
            <li> This shave soap produces an adequate lather, nice results, no complaints with how it works. But I spent a couple three days wondering where that weird smell around the bathroom counter was coming from, like maybe some nail polish remover had spilled or something. Then I lean over, sniff the shave cup, and yup, that&#x27;s it. Sharp soap/chemical smell, nothing like sandalwood, and no way I&#x27;m going to use this stuff up just on smell alone.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more to say that the title hasn&#x27;t already conveyed.  This soap is great for the money.  I&#x27;m surprised how long it&#x27;s lasted.  I shave usually about every other day and at this rate these two bars will last me over 1 year!  that&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li> I have found I like creams better than soaps.  You may want to try Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li> I am just getting started with the shift to DE shaving and this is my first soap. I paid up a bit because of the &amp;#34;natural ingredients&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part this is true but it does contain propelyne glycol (a petroleum derivative) and a few other non-natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it seems to lather up nicely and the scent is very nice. Also be aware it is a smallish puck. Good travel size soap.</li>
            <li> Purchased this shaving soap along with a Parker razor.  The soap has outlasted the razor (don&#x27;t buy a parker razor).  These provide a great lather, last a long time, and don&#x27;t have too strong of a smell.</li>
            <li> Great masculine smell, best lather I have had from shaving soap. Lather remains on face and provides a great shaving experience. At this price, what more can you ask for? I recommend the purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this for my legs, it produces a rich lather while protecting my skin. I use it with a safety razor and this protects me from nicks and moisturizes!</li>
            <li> This is the best shave soap I have ever used.  Silky and smooth with a great scent.  It feels so good I now love to shave.</li>
            <li> I got tired of blowing $50 a month on shaving supplies.  It was just getting insane what Gillette was demanding I pay for cartridges.  In a fit of anger I logged onto Amazon and scored myself a nice Merkur safety razor handle, an assortment of blades.. and a Parker brush and a twin-pack of soap.  The results are impressive.  No only have I stepped my razor cost down from $35 a month to $3 a month, but I&#x27;ve quit using cans of shaving cream and gel and re-discovered how amazing it is to lather my face with a real soap and brush.  This Parker soap has a wonderful but subtle scent that seems clean and manly, and provides an excellent lubrication base for my face.  Couple this soap with a high-quality brush (like Parker&#x27;s) and you&#x27;ll end up with the smoothest shave you&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> I am pretty new to wet shaving and have only limited exposure to shaving soaps but my wife bought this for me as a Christmas gift and wow, what a difference.  The smell is good but not over-powering and the lather lasts throughout the shave.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a refill for my husband&#x27; shaving mug. He likes the shave he gets and the way his skin feels afterward.</li>
            <li> Great shave.  Wonderful Smell!</li>
            <li> This product has an excellent aroma to it but didn&#x27;t seem to soften the beard as well as other products.  Also noticed more razor burn from it.</li>
            <li> Long time double edge shaver. This is a good product. As other reviewers may have mentioned it may dry a little bit on you but positives out weigh any negatives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other shaving soaps and they just won&#x27;t do.  Parker Sandalwood &amp; Shea Butter lubricates well without being greasy and has a mild scent that I love. I no longer have irritation and redness and shaving seems to take less time.  They cost a little more than the cheap shaving soaps but the bars seem to last a long time.  Super Safety Razors ships quickly and reliably.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other shave soaps in the past - Van Der Hagen Luxury and Col. Conk&#x27;s Bay Rum.  It lathers well, and smells good too.  It certainly rinses better than Col. Conk&#x27;s.  The quality of shave I get with this soap is at least as good as, or better than the other two.  The puck didn&#x27;t fit in my mug so well, so I had to nuke it in the microwave for about 30 seconds on the defrost setting (any longer, and it might have boiled over!)  While the Van Der Hagen does a nice job, and is considerably cheaper than the Parker, I would say the Parker is worth the extra money - mostly because of the lather.  I think I&#x27;ll be buying this soap again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 2/10/14***&lt;br /&gt;I purchase in bulk, and I&#x27;ve gone back and forth between the VDH and the Parker soap, and after quite a bit of time with the two, I think I would actually lean toward the Van Der Hagen.  It took me a while to learn how to get the VDH to lather well, and once I figured out the trick, I am able to get a much better lather than I am with the Parker.  The Parker seems like lathers up fast, but I&#x27;ve had a hard time getting a nice thick, dense foam.  I bumped my review down to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Great $$$ and great product!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing really exceptional about this product but it works as promised. The smell is pretty light (which I like) and the cushion it provides is better than the VDH Deluxe I was using before I bought this. I would buy it again, just don&#x27;t expect the earth to move as you use it, it&#x27;s just good shave soap.</li>
            <li> I am really starting to like the Parker brand products. Good soap and good value.I don&#x27;t know what else they want.</li>
            <li> Great travel pack, and great shaving soap.  The sent is a favorite.</li>
