            <li>i&#x27;m sure it will be great when my daughters hair starts getting knotty too!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good brush that wouldn&#x27;t tear my hair apart.  </li>
            <li>Great product, for sure recommend.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions of brushing from the bottom up and my kids all love it!</li>

            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a ton of bristles on here, and there seem to be two lengths, so they kind of work like having a hundred fingers running through your hair -</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li>But who doesn&#x27;t want something to look nice too...</li>
            <li>It does make a bit of noise though, so if they are sensitive to the sounds of brushing hair (as some kids I know are), then it might not be the best choice for them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will buy more to have one for my frequent travels and one to keep at my girlfriend&#x27;s house.  </li>
            <li>Love the handle feature, not all detangling brushes have that</li>
            <li>I used this brush and noticed instantly that it&#x27;s made perfectly for detangling without pulling or snagging the hair.</li>
            <li>This brush has been wonderful for getting her hair brushed with a minimum of tears and upset so thank you :-)</li>
            <li>and they love it.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Fits in a purse or backpack nicely and is light in weight.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt like most brushes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute.  </li>
            <li>Easy to style toddler and adults hair as well.</li>
            <li>so you could easily slip it in your purse.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it is fine and easily knots.  </li>
            <li>Brushing my girls&#x27; hair is always a challenge (to put it lightly), and always ends in tears.</li>
            <li>This brush works incredibly well on wet, tangled hair.</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for something that is gentle yet effective with my tangles.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this hairbrush!!!!</li>
            <li>daughters have very sensitive scalps and fine hair that tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>Also, lightening fast shipping and seller sent follow-up email to ensure I received it and was pleased.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp and fine hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>I have really curly hair that tends to tangle really easily.</li>
            <li>the bristles are smooth and don&#x27;t catch on the tangles (thus the gentle detangling).</li>
            <li>My 9-year-old has very curly hair while my 5-year-old has straight hair and both LOVE using this brush.</li>
            <li>so it is worth it.</li>
            <li>think this would work great for children, especially those that are sensitive to touch.</li>
            <li>this is the first brush (of several that i already owned) that is able to get them out easily and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this brush because of its detangling feature and I have to say that it really works!</li>
            <li>This brush works great for toddlers and adults long or short hair, it detangles unruly hair with ease!</li>
            <li>It is easy and light-weight enough to use for my 5-year-old.</li>
            <li>of the aspects that I really like about this brush is</li>
            <li>I was really hopeful about this product.</li>
            <li>it really does help take the knots out without hurting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely gentle on my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair.  </li>
            <li>have tried numerous brushes and combs on their hair and this is by far the gentlest and most effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just brushed right through like a breeze!</li>
            <li>First hair brush my 7 year old likes and she is picky.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this hairbrush!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I prefer it over a normal brush, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed too.</li>
            <li>I could live with that, however, if the brush did what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>The instructions recommend starting from the ends and working slowly up as sections get detangled, but I didn&#x27;t need to do that - I could start straight from the scalp and smoothly brush through the entire length of my hair - no pain whatsoever, I love this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for any children who are sensitive to brushing knots out of their hair.  </li>
            <li>First and foremost, and this may be just an individual preference, I don&#x27;t care for the &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t feel it as it gets tangles out leaving hair soft!</li>
            <li>(one has super thick wavy hair, the other has fine straight hair).</li>
            <li>My five year old son said tonight, &amp;#34;I like this brush.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;As a guy who likes to wear his naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I was skeptical since most brushes pull my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hairbrush especially if your hair frequently tangles like mine.</li>
            <li>My daughter has really long hair and a very sensitive head.</li>
            <li>My 6 years old daughter who has very long hair loves this brush.</li>
            <li>This has helped make our mornings run much smoother and with less fuss.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my young niece who has long hair and hates getting it brushed.</li>

            <li> Wet or dry, this brush did not glide through our hair, it got caught on tangles and ripped hair no differently than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> will say that it didn&#x27;t work quite as effortlessly on dry hair as it did on wet, but even with dry hair</li>
            <li> I have super tangly hair and two daughters who inherited this unfortunate trait</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not amazing, and it didn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
            <li> My 6yr old daughter has been using this brush both after bath or swim and also when her hair is dry for the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> My other brushes I had on hand including the Wet Brush did not work as well at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also small enough</li>
            <li> It is a smaller brush, but not too small.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is straight and medium texture but always seems to get crazy knots in it from playing or even just from sleeping.  </li>
            <li> so I throw it in my bag everyday for work.  </li>
            <li> No more tugging and no more pain.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with it when it comes to brushing the underside of my hair (and my girls&#x27;).</li>
            <li> Detangles hard to brush hair,</li>
            <li> None of my kids complained that it&#x27;s pulling, tugging or hurting.</li>
            <li> and this brush isn&#x27;t too thick</li>
            <li> thick and/or tangled</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was left frustrated and disappointed, and I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was thinking we may have to cut it, it was that bad!</li>
            <li> It de tangles the worst knots in my child&#x27;s hair without breaking or damaging it.</li>

            <li> This is a great brush. It de tangles the worst knots in my child&#x27;s hair without breaking or damaging it. She didn&#x27;t even cry. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> As a mom, I&#x27;m always having challenges with brushing all my kids&#x27; hair. I ordered this brush because of its detangling feature and I have to say that it really works! None of my kids complained that it&#x27;s pulling, tugging or hurting. I followed the instructions of brushing from the bottom up and my kids all love it! Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> Please note that I did receive this product at a discounted price in return for an unbiased review.  I can say wholeheartedly that this is a great brush.  ever since having my daughter, her hands are constantly in my hair creating knot after knot.  this is the first brush (of several that i already owned) that is able to get them out easily and painlessly.  i&#x27;m sure it will be great when my daughters hair starts getting knotty too!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush!!!&lt;br /&gt;My daughters have very sensitive scalps and fine hair that tangles very easily. My 9-year-old has very curly hair while my 5-year-old has straight hair and both LOVE using this brush. It is easy and light-weight enough to use for my 5-year-old. I&#x27;ve used it on my hair too and it is very effective in detangling gently.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous brushes and combs on their hair and this is by far the gentlest and most effective.&lt;br /&gt;One of the aspects that I really like about this brush is the bristles are smooth and don&#x27;t catch on the tangles (thus the gentle detangling).</li>
            <li> It pulled my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful about this product. I have super tangly hair and two daughters who inherited this unfortunate trait (one has super thick wavy hair, the other has fine straight hair). Brushing my girls&#x27; hair is always a challenge (to put it lightly), and always ends in tears. We have tried the Wet Brush, but it didn&#x27;t work for us. So I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot. First and foremost, and this may be just an individual preference, I don&#x27;t care for the &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; design of the brush. I have a hard time with it when it comes to brushing the underside of my hair (and my girls&#x27;). I could live with that, however, if the brush did what it&#x27;s supposed to. Wet or dry, this brush did not glide through our hair, it got caught on tangles and ripped hair no differently than a regular brush. My girls had no less tears after brushing with this brush than they do any other brush. Unfortunately, I was left frustrated and disappointed, and I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> My 6 years old daughter who has very long hair loves this brush. She said: &amp;#34;This brush  is amazing! it does not hurt! my hair is so soft!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My 6yr old daughter has been using this brush both after bath or swim and also when her hair is dry for the past few weeks.  She LOVES it.... it really does help take the knots out without hurting.  This has helped make our mornings run much smoother and with less fuss.  I highly recommend for any children who are sensitive to brushing knots out of their hair.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is straight and medium texture but always seems to get crazy knots in it from playing or even just from sleeping.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> My daughter had a big ole tangled mess in her hair. I used this brush along with a detanger spray and it went through it like butter! My other brushes I had on hand including the Wet Brush did not work as well at all! Her hair came all untangled. I was thinking we may have to cut it, it was that bad!</li>
            <li> Love it! First hair brush my 7 year old likes and she is picky. You can&#x27;t feel it as it gets tangles out leaving hair soft! No more tugging and no more pain. Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush! I was skeptical since most brushes pull my long, fine hair. This one does detangle without the pain.</li>
            <li> Great brush! It works just as stated.</li>
            <li> I got this for my young niece who has long hair and hates getting it brushed. Seems to work well.</li>
            <li> It works. It&#x27;s not amazing, and it didn&#x27;t wow me. I prefer it over a normal brush, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed too. It usually take me longer to brush with it, but it&#x27;s pretty painless so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This brush works great for toddlers and adults long or short hair, it detangles unruly hair with ease! Easy to style toddler and adults hair as well. Love the handle feature, not all detangling brushes have that and this brush isn&#x27;t too thick so you could easily slip it in your purse. Awesome product! I bought 2!</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair that tends to tangle really easily. I used this brush and noticed instantly that it&#x27;s made perfectly for detangling without pulling or snagging the hair. Just brushed right through like a breeze! Great product, for sure recommend. Also, lightening fast shipping and seller sent follow-up email to ensure I received it and was pleased. I like that type of customer care.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really long hair and a very sensitive head. This brush has been wonderful for getting her hair brushed with a minimum of tears and upset so thank you :-)</li>
            <li> Works great.  I have a lot of hair, but it is fine and easily knots.  I have been looking for a good brush that wouldn&#x27;t tear my hair apart.  This one works perfect and feels great on the scalp when brushing my hair.  Very happy with this pick.  I purchased this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This brush works incredibly well on wet, tangled hair. I have hair that&#x27;s down past my waist, and it gets super tangled after a shower. The instructions recommend starting from the ends and working slowly up as sections get detangled, but I didn&#x27;t need to do that - I could start straight from the scalp and smoothly brush through the entire length of my hair - no pain whatsoever, I love this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it didn&#x27;t work quite as effortlessly on dry hair as it did on wet, but even with dry hair, if I start from the bottom and work my way up, it detangles it wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a ton of bristles on here, and there seem to be two lengths, so they kind of work like having a hundred fingers running through your hair - what one bristle doesn&#x27;t get, there&#x27;s another one waiting to work on, and another one after that, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would work great for children, especially those that are sensitive to touch. It does make a bit of noise though, so if they are sensitive to the sounds of brushing hair (as some kids I know are), then it might not be the best choice for them.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brush to handle my unruly hair and finally I find one that delivers.  It&#x27;s extremely gentle on my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair.  I would highly recommend this hairbrush especially if your hair frequently tangles like mine.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this detangling hairbrush!  I have been on the hunt for something that is gentle yet effective with my tangles.  I have a sensitive scalp and fine hair that tangles easily.  This brush does as it says.  I started at the bottoms and worked my way up.  Also, the feel of the brush in my palm is just perfect in my hand.  It&#x27;s also small enough so I throw it in my bag everyday for work.  Highly recommend this hairbrush!!!!</li>
            <li> I gave it to the girls and they love it.</li>
            <li> Terrific!  Love how it detangles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  This is the perfect size.  It is a smaller brush, but not too small.  Fits in a purse or backpack nicely and is light in weight.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Detangles hard to brush hair, thick and/or tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt like most brushes.  My five year old son said tonight, &amp;#34;I like this brush.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair!&amp;#34;  I think he meant head.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt his head.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Ergonomic.  It fits nicely in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;5.  It&#x27;s cute.  Does it have to be?  No.  But who doesn&#x27;t want something to look nice too...</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;As a guy who likes to wear his naturally curly hair long I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of brushes that claim to detangle but this one does what is says.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will buy more to have one for my frequent travels and one to keep at my girlfriend&#x27;s house.  Highly recommend this hairbrush!&amp;#34;</li>
