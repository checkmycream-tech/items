            <li>I ordered it knowing it was a Naked 2 dupe, the colors are great and the pigmentation is good!</li>
            <li>Quite a nice surprise :)</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and very pigment</li>
            <li>colors are very light</li>
            <li>Brush is ok</li>
            <li>I would Recommend using a eye shadow primer if you want it to be more pigmented.</li>
            <li>Muy rapido el envÃ­o y llegaron en perfectas condiciones :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;You may be settling for the cheaper price and satisfied with what you get, but you have no idea what&#x27;s in these products.</li>
            <li>no matter how many applications or tricks you try</li>
            <li>The colors, for the most part, are close in comparison to the authentic Naked2 palette.</li>
            <li>and when it came in I was very excited.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for it being so cheap !</li>
            <li>Was better than I expected works excellent!!</li>
            <li>I am impressed with the colers and it&#x27;s a great dupe for the Urban Decay naked 3.</li>
            <li>though I was going to get a normal plattle and some of the eyeshadow are not that good</li>
            <li>super excited and love the colors</li>
            <li>This eye shadow is very nice, I use all types of different make up</li>
            <li>but love good colors with long stay</li>
            <li>As a huge fan of the Naked palettes by Urban Decay curiousity got the best of me and I ordered one of these.</li>
            <li>Love this pallete, it completely looks and feels great just like the real Naked palette, cant tell the diffents.</li>
            <li>Love it shipped fast</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest to use eyeshadow primer with this, as the quality isn&#x27;t as good as UD.</li>
            <li>They most certainly are not fake.</li>
            <li>Most if not all the colors are pretty close to the real one.</li>
            <li>Dupes are made by reputable companies that bear their own names, like E.L.F., NYX, and all of these other companies that make their own version of these palettes WITHOUT claiming to be Urban Decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and the actual one.</li>
            <li>Love love this product  other then the shipping spand</li>
            <li>Arrived right on time</li>
            <li>understand that $54 is a little steep for an eye shadow palette, but if you want a cheaper knock-off version, then go the safe route and get it from a reputable brand.</li>
            <li>the colors are pigmented and very buttery an amazing inexpensive Christmas present.</li>
            <li>This is a great Dupe to the Real Urban Decay Naked 2.</li>
            <li>Even if it&#x27;s under $10 for a non authentic naked 2 palette.</li>
            <li>I think this product is sufficient, but my plan is to get the legit Naked 2 for better quality and pigment.</li>
            <li>but it is worth the $8 gamble to purchase this if you cannot afford the $54 real one.</li>
            <li>The pigment of this Naked 2 isn&#x27;t as good as my Naked pallette.</li>
            <li>The colors are lackluster, and are nothing more than a bunch of shimmers that don&#x27;t hold a candle to the real deal Urban Decay</li>
            <li>Mine shipped really fast</li>
            <li>The mirror on mine is very dingy and I cannot use it, and the brush heads slip off the body of the brush.</li>
            <li>but it was the real thing.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>But it is a cheap nock off Naked 2 pallet.</li>
            <li>When I received this palette, I examined it and compared it to the $54 value palette to see how much of a difference there was.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>tin does feel lighter than the real palette</li>
            <li>The quality of the shadows and brush are strikingly similar and well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Overall I love the product,  its just like the real thing, and the colors last ALL DAY!</li>
            <li>Most of the time it is the pigmentation that is not as dense and dark or one or two of the colors is off by a bit.</li>
            <li>Urban Decay and other reputable brands use ingredients approved by the FDA, and you know what you&#x27;re putting on your face and allowing to be absorbed into your body.</li>
            <li>Product was ok, Only If you buy locally.</li>
            <li>This eye shadow is very nice and has a good color and smoothness, but the brushes are weird and not very useful, and the makeup sometimes get clumped if you wear it for too long.</li>
            <li>but I suggest it highly</li>
            <li>This is a dupe of Naked two but not a very bad one.</li>
            <li>Legitimate companies make dupes all the time and they don&#x27;t claim to be Urban Decay or any brand they&#x27;re imitating, but they use FDA-approved products so you know exactly what you&#x27;re putting on your face.</li>
            <li>Colors were pretty dull, not bad for price though.</li>
            <li>It has the naked 2 casing &amp; brush but the shadows are very crappy.</li>
            <li>Really want to order this, but I want to see a customers picture of the actual palette.</li>
            <li>The shadows are highly pigmented, however the darker shades are not very comaparible to the darker shades on the real naked2.</li>
            <li>I expected a higher gloss.  </li>
            <li>I just recently bought the real deal naked pallette and figured I would order this pallette to compare.</li>
            <li>So I had read that this was a dupe pallette, and i was very surprised when it was the REAL Naked 2 pallette!</li>
            <li>This is the fake naked 2 palette obviously but overall great eyeshadow</li>
            <li>but once removed its a regular clear mirror.</li>
            <li>I normally buy the knock off version of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>These companies putting &#x27;Urban Decay&#x27; on their products are also claiming to use the same ingredients as Urban Decay uses, when you really have no idea</li>
            <li>Shipping was so much faster then expected!</li>

            <li> Shipping was so much faster then expected!</li>
            <li> I would buy from them again, the only thing that I did not like was how long it took to arrive</li>
            <li> They are authentic products that simply did not meet quality control during production for whatever reason they were not perfect so they were pulled from factory and sold to other companies.</li>
            <li> The palette received is an imitation of the naked 2 palette.</li>
            <li> Pigmentation is not bad not perfect but as long as it shows up with primer</li>
            <li> It will be messed up if you order from long distant  places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen and compared a fake Urban Decay palette to the real one.</li>
            <li> I bought this and received it before I expected it.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with this is not really up to par, but you can make it work if you have to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an Urban Decay Naked Fake and the eyeshadow is barely visible</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong that the mirror does have a scratch, and the brush isn&#x27;t quite the same?</li>
            <li> I used with primer &amp; they barely applied onto my eyelids, worse than dollar store makeup..</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Money wasted.</li>
            <li> This is a fake naked 2 palette.</li>
            <li> and I didnt know that I was going to get a fake naked 2 plattle</li>
            <li> these companies that make these counterfeit Urban Decay products were based in the United States, what they&#x27;re would be doing would be considered illegal.</li>
            <li> And if something goes wrong, these companies that counterfeit actual brands will not be held responsible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the product it is a fake naked 2 plattle beside the packaging is not good when I got my package there was black powder everywhere when I open the plattle the some of the eyeshadow were broken beside my package came late</li>
            <li> NOT happy with these shadows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to mention, the quality of these products are crap compared to Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> Completely fake.</li>
            <li> These are not counterfiet or dupes and I&#x27;m sick of hearing people bitch about them being fake.</li>
            <li> but the brush has an awful texture, feels fake.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> The worst eyeshadow.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this pallete, it completely looks and feels great just like the real Naked palette, cant tell the diffents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for it being so cheap !</li>
            <li> This pallette is perfect, my daughter just started wearing eyeshadow and these colors work great with her complexion, gonna order one for me too!</li>
            <li> Completely fake. It was even crappy as a dupe.</li>
            <li> The pallette looks and is packaged as the real naked 2, but it is not. Mine shipped really fast and when it came in I was very excited. The mirror on mine is very dingy and I cannot use it, and the brush heads slip off the body of the brush. Overall I love the product,  its just like the real thing, and the colors last ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> This eye shadow is very nice, I use all types of different make up and I like this one. The quality of the eye shadow is very nice. I would buy from them again, the only thing that I did not like was how long it took to arrive but even then the seller was ver responsive and nice to work with. Thank you</li>
            <li> got this palette in about a week ago. I am impressed with the colers and it&#x27;s a great dupe for the Urban Decay naked 3.</li>
            <li> this palette is AMAZING the colors are pigmented and very buttery an amazing inexpensive Christmas present.</li>
            <li> colors are very light</li>
            <li> This eye shadow is very nice and has a good color and smoothness, but the brushes are weird and not very useful, and the makeup sometimes get clumped if you wear it for too long.</li>
            <li> This is a fake naked 2 palette. It has the naked 2 casing &amp; brush but the shadows are very crappy. I would not suggest this. It is a waste of money. Even if it&#x27;s under $10 for a non authentic naked 2 palette. I used with primer &amp; they barely applied onto my eyelids, worse than dollar store makeup..</li>
            <li> I ordered it knowing it was a Naked 2 dupe, the colors are great and the pigmentation is good! The shadows can be a bit chalky but I do not mind because of the price I paid. When you get the package theres a plastic film covering the mirror but once removed its a regular clear mirror. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I just received the product and it looks good. I havent use it but the color palettes looks wonderful and for the price it was even better. The palette received is an imitation of the naked 2 palette. Here are some pictures of the product.</li>
            <li> I loved I&#x27;ll buy again ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a knock-off Urban Decay Naked 2 but it was the real thing. I&#x27;m very impressed. Everyone should buy this-if not for you then for friends!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just an uninformed buyer, but I didn&#x27;t know that this was actually the Naked 2 pallette. Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and the actual one. It came in the box and says Urban Decay on the back. Maybe mine was a factory reject instread of a knockoff, because the mirror is blurry and unuseable. I showed it to my friend who is a consultant at Ulta and she couldn&#x27;t tell the difference, so who knows? The colors are pigmented enough for me to use them with eye primer without a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the product it is a fake naked 2 plattle beside the packaging is not good when I got my package there was black powder everywhere when I open the plattle the some of the eyeshadow were broken beside my package came late and I didnt know that I was going to get a fake naked 2 plattle I though I was going to get a normal plattle and some of the eyeshadow are not that good the colors wear off and the make up Brush is ok</li>
            <li> Super happy with this product!  Quite a nice surprise :)</li>
            <li> This is obviously not Urban Decay Naked 3 eye shadow, but... Hey! $9.00? I&#x27;ll get over it! *Christmas presents*</li>
            <li> NOT happy with these shadows. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought the real deal naked pallette and figured I would order this pallette to compare. The pigment of this Naked 2 isn&#x27;t as good as my Naked pallette. The colors are similar to what the actual Naked 2 carries. I think this product is sufficient, but my plan is to get the legit Naked 2 for better quality and pigment.</li>
            <li> Delivery  was on time. I expected a higher gloss.  Won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I thought it was just a low priced eye shadow..it&#x27;s a urban decay knock off ,threw it away,,,</li>
            <li> So I had read that this was a dupe pallette, and i was very surprised when it was the REAL Naked 2 pallette! The only thing wrong that the mirror does have a scratch, and the brush isn&#x27;t quite the same?</li>
            <li> These are not counterfiet or dupes and I&#x27;m sick of hearing people bitch about them being fake. They most certainly are not fake. They are authentic products that simply did not meet quality control during production for whatever reason they were not perfect so they were pulled from factory and sold to other companies. The samething you find at burlington, marshalls or tjmaxx. They are Irregular. Most of the time it is the pigmentation that is not as dense and dark or one or two of the colors is off by a bit. That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Shipping was so much faster then expected! This is a dupe of Naked two but not a very bad one. Most if not all the colors are pretty close to the real one. Pigmentation is not bad not perfect but as long as it shows up with primer I&#x27;m happy thank you so much I will definitely be ordering the 3rd one once you all get it back in stock.</li>
            <li> Received it earlier then said. The colors are beautiful and very pigment</li>
            <li> I will be ordering More!! Love it shipped fast</li>
            <li> This is a great Dupe to the Real Urban Decay Naked 2. I would Recommend using a eye shadow primer if you want it to be more pigmented. But over all Its a Great Pallette and I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, unfortunately takes several layers to show up well. Not as pigmented as I thought.</li>
            <li> Really want to order this, but I want to see a customers picture of the actual palette. So if anyone who has ordered and received this could post a picture  that would be great</li>
            <li> Muy rapido el envÃ­o y llegaron en perfectas condiciones :)</li>
            <li> Great deal make up works well colors are good quality will buy from this company  again.</li>
            <li> ITS NAKED 2 I had no idea super excited and love the colors came in time and already used it and it&#x27;s amazing ! Must have</li>
            <li> I didnt know it was the ACTUAL urban decay pallete. Its amazing sooo happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the pallet, it is a very good make-up. But it is a cheap nock off Naked 2 pallet.</li>
            <li> Love love this product  other then the shipping spand but love good colors with long stay</li>
            <li> When I received this palette, I examined it and compared it to the $54 value palette to see how much of a difference there was. I am very pleased because I cannot tell the difference between this one and the $54 one! The quality of the shadows and brush are strikingly similar and well worth the purchase! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to blow on makeup. I normally buy the knock off version of the more expensive brands. I bought this and received it before I expected it. I opened the package and saw it was the legit urban decay naked 2 palette. I have yet to use it but I suggest it highly</li>
            <li> Colors were pretty dull, not bad for price though. Arrived right on time</li>
            <li> Product was ok, Only If you buy locally. It will be messed up if you order from long distant  places.</li>
            <li> Nice shades!  However, one was cracked.</li>
            <li> I see lots of people raving when they buy these counterfeit Urban Decay palettes. They say things like,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s cheaper and looks good, so I don&#x27;t mind!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also see lots of people calling these counterfeit palettes &#x27;dupes&#x27;. These are not dupes. These are counterfeit. Anything claiming to be another brand is automatically a counterfeit product. Dupes are made by reputable companies that bear their own names, like E.L.F., NYX, and all of these other companies that make their own version of these palettes WITHOUT claiming to be Urban Decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these companies that make these counterfeit Urban Decay products were based in the United States, what they&#x27;re would be doing would be considered illegal. Urban Decay and other reputable brands use ingredients approved by the FDA, and you know what you&#x27;re putting on your face and allowing to be absorbed into your body. These companies putting &#x27;Urban Decay&#x27; on their products are also claiming to use the same ingredients as Urban Decay uses, when you really have no idea what&#x27;s in these products (because they&#x27;re not the same ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, the quality of these products are crap compared to Urban Decay. I&#x27;ve seen and compared a fake Urban Decay palette to the real one. The colors are lackluster, and are nothing more than a bunch of shimmers that don&#x27;t hold a candle to the real deal Urban Decay colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be settling for the cheaper price and satisfied with what you get, but you have no idea what&#x27;s in these products. And if something goes wrong, these companies that counterfeit actual brands will not be held responsible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that $54 is a little steep for an eye shadow palette, but if you want a cheaper knock-off version, then go the safe route and get it from a reputable brand. Legitimate companies make dupes all the time and they don&#x27;t claim to be Urban Decay or any brand they&#x27;re imitating, but they use FDA-approved products so you know exactly what you&#x27;re putting on your face.</li>
            <li> The worst eyeshadow. It&#x27;s an Urban Decay Naked Fake and the eyeshadow is barely visible no matter how many applications or tricks you try. I hated it. Money wasted.</li>
            <li> Was better than I expected works excellent!! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> awesome and I will order again. Just waiting for the 3 palette to get back in Stock</li>
            <li> As a huge fan of the Naked palettes by Urban Decay curiousity got the best of me and I ordered one of these. The colors, for the most part, are close in comparison to the authentic Naked2 palette. The brush that comes with this is not really up to par, but you can make it work if you have to. This palette arrives in a dupe of the naked2 packaging. This&lt;br /&gt; tin does feel lighter than the real palette but it is worth the $8 gamble to purchase this if you cannot afford the $54 real one. The shadows are highly pigmented, however the darker shades are not very comaparible to the darker shades on the real naked2. I would definitely suggest to use eyeshadow primer with this, as the quality isn&#x27;t as good as UD.</li>
            <li> This is the fake naked 2 palette obviously but overall great eyeshadow but the brush has an awful texture, feels fake.</li>
