            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>This cologne just smells so fresh.</li>
            <li>So I bought the biggest one I could find at a very reasonable price.</li>

            <li> Does what I purchased it to do.</li>
            <li> Curve Crush By Liz Claiborne For Men is a great sent. The ladies tell me all the time when I wear this cologne. Great price and fast shipping. major retail stores sell 2.8oz bottles of this same cologne for the same price I paid for this 6.8oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews on curve crush before buying and was a little skeptical on buying cologne on the Internet to begin with. I know that companys can&#x27;t please everyone but the positive reviews far out weighted the negative ones for me. I grew up with this cologne and always thought the smell was very pleasing. I enjoy having a verity of colognes and thought I should purchase this one again, since its been awhile. I received it a lot quicker than I had originally expected and I was excited to say the least. I wore it to work the first day. People are saying that the cologne dissipates quickly. Not in my case. I work labor for six hours and it smelt just as good when I took my shirt off for a shower. I got a lot of compliments from co workers and customers loved it too! Hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5+ years! Smells great and I always get compliments! You wont be disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> He loves this cologne and you cannot get a price like this anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure my ex-wife bought this and she never gave it to me, so now, 4 years later, I&#x27;m wondering who she gave it to.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  Rather spring time essence so use accordingly.  What can you say about cologne?  Either it is a right fit for you body type of it is not.  Light and springy.</li>
            <li> No lie, seriously like 10 women have asked me what scent I&#x27;m wearing in the first week since I started to spray myself with this stuff every morning. My girlfriend loves it too. You can&#x27;t beat the price for the size either, which is a good thing, since you might want to spray a bit more than usual as the scent is pretty light....</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price!  People pay a lot more in department stores.  My 15 year son LOVES this product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and it arrived on time and perfect condition. It is what is says it is. Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> Good but took a long time to get it</li>
            <li> Have used Curve for years and wanted to give this one a try and was not disappointed, great clean scent that lasts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long could be a possible knockoff</li>
            <li> Very weak of smell as if they watered it down or something</li>
            <li> This cologne just smells so fresh. It just like having a shower. One thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it does not last very long. Just about 4 to 6 hours is the most.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s not the original, I spray it and the smell goes away in less then an hour, I have to keep spraying it if I want the smell to stay, why Are people allowed to sell garbage like this! Very un sattisfied NOT HAPPY AT ALL out of 1 through 10 I&#x27;d give it a -10</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> It is the only cologne I use. Great cologne and the ladies seem to really like the scent. High recommendation</li>
