            <li>The product itself is nice and provides a spa feel.</li>
            <li>Opening up the container, the smell of the mud mask wasn&#x27;t too strong - fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, refreshing menthol smell I have come to enjoy since it clears out my nasal passage, too!</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m glad</li>

            <li>Hell, my girlfriend could not stop touching my face either.</li>
            <li>He was impressed with it&#x27;s pore cleansing abilities, and said he will definitely use it again!  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have had the opportunity to use it several times and I can confidently say that I am thoroughly impressed!</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my skin care products and have to say I am extremely happy with this mask.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>I really love this mud mask because my face is softer after using it.</li>
            <li>I received this exfoliating &amp; clarifying ultraMUD treatment for free to review to give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>The clay powder is very fine and blends smoothly with water.</li>
            <li>Feels amazing on your face long after use and smells great.</li>
            <li>This mud mask feels like a beauty product and the scent isn&#x27;t strong.</li>
            <li>I use their cucumber soothing gel after and leave it on overnight, the next morning my skin is smooth, bright, and hydrated!</li>
            <li>At first glance, the product appeared to be nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>what an interesting mud mask not only is it easy to put on but super easy to take off great for men and woman</li>
            <li>Man this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review).</li>
            <li>After rinsing my skin was so bright and radiant, and it felt so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft, clean, and bright after using this mud mask.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I have realized a significant decrease with my blemishes pimples that would pop up on occasion.</li>
            <li>Washes off pretty easy leaving the skin feeling smooth and comfortable, the irritation goes away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of my sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m not docking more than one star.</li>
            <li>Afterwards my skin feels amazingly healthy, soft, smooth and just rejuvenated!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with skin sensitive to tea tree oil, but if you&#x27;ve tried tea tree oil and it works for you, then you might just love this mud mask!</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised at the results of having a very clean and refreshing feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>You can feel the mud cleaning your skin, with a mild tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>use this one if I want a quick mask in the mornings, or their Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel if I want to leave one on over night.</li>
            <li>My skin is a bit oily and I struggle with mild breakouts.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say it does more than other masks I have tried.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li>The mud smells really nice after mixed up, came packed</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li>I got used to it by the second treatment, and actually kindly like the tingling burn sensation.</li>
            <li>As the mud dries I can see dots from my pores where the oil is absorbed.</li>
            <li>The burning does take some getting used to, but for me it&#x27;s well worth it for a product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is great, although there is a slight burning when it&#x27;s first applied (let&#x27;s me know it&#x27;s working).</li>
            <li>not strong smelling and would be a great addition to a detox gel or moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li>Other than that, i loved it.</li>
            <li>Nothing but positive thoughts about this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to apply and it works very well!</li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to follow, and the mask applied easily and was easy to wash off after waiting a few minutes for it to work.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a little overpriced, though it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>This is the first mud mask product my I have tried.</li>
            <li>With more uses, the time left on the mud can be extended as your skin becomes acclimated with it.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a mud treatment.</li>
            <li>tried it the first day I got it and also this morning before finishing my review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s recommended to use up to 3 minutes the first time</li>
            <li>The bottle says to use it for 2 minutes the first use, and work up to 15 depending on tolerance.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this mask I put it on for 2 minutes then put water on my face to get the mask off.</li>
            <li>Helps to do some light exfoliating afterward with a wet towel to really get your skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>I always thought mud treatments were just for fun and that it wasn&#x27;t really going to do much for your face except make you feel like a million bucks for having mud on your face like in the movies, but when I put this mud treatment on I felt it working on my face right away.</li>
            <li>The product is rather intense if you have sensitive skin like I do, however the tingling sensation is very mild.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever stick to skin care treatments unless it really works for me and unless I can see the difference right away</li>
            <li>I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of mud masks and facial products that have made my skin clearer and also good feeling and usually I buy products that fit both criteria.</li>
            <li>, my skin looks more even and soft.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not cheap, but I thought it was worth it!</li>
            <li>When I first used this, I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to take the mask off because you don&#x27;t have to rub your skin a million times trying to get it off like you would with other masks.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, as I can easily pick it up and put it aside onto the lid, but</li>
            <li>He left it on for a little over five minutes, and experienced no burning.  </li>
            <li>After washing off the mask (in circular motions as per instructions), I can see that it really went to work on my face causing it to glow with redness</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this face mask, you will NOT regret buying it!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>I was incredibly nervous that my sensitive skin would be broken out.</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed that it helps small scars fade more quickly.  </li>
            <li>just so you can get the full effect of this product, for sensitive skin i recommend doing 60 seconds at a time and making sure you moisturize really well after using it with perhaps aloe and or cucumber just to get rid of any redness that the mask may leave behind which usually goes away in a minute or two with any great mask like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and it left my face feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>It definitely leaves your skin feeling clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s pretty sure she just left it on for a bit too long, her skin was also not accustomed to it, so I would not recommend using it for more than a few minutes at a time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It started as a tingle, and progressed to a steady sting.</li>
            <li>I was left with smooth, soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product becomes tingly and intense at the 2-3 minute marker the first go around or for sensitive skin, try to avoid getting mud in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s often irritated by certain products.</li>
            <li>While the initial price is a bit on the high side, it is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work wonders on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Also it is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Yes, your comfort is a small price to pay for good facial skin.</li>
            <li>so this is not the type of thing I normally use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a week, and have had no negative effects.</li>
            <li>You can definitely feel the difference right away after wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did leave my skin a little dry feeling after the first time use, but as I&#x27;ve used it more than once now, I don&#x27;t so much have that problem anymore.</li>
            <li>I had never tried a product with tea tree oil in it before (which this mud mask contains), so I was sure to patch test it first before I slathered it all over my face in case my skin was sensitive to it, which is quite common.</li>
            <li>face will feel brand new afterwards.</li>
            <li>People have commented that my face looks like it has a new glow to it.</li>
            <li>It tingles at first but feels like it&#x27;s actually exfoliating and treating my skin-</li>
            <li>You can actually feel it working, and notice a result after the first use.</li>
            <li>For such effective results, the burning feeling was a small price to pay.  </li>
            <li>It is also very easy to wash off and doesn&#x27;t leave you skin tight and dry.</li>
            <li>Tried this to help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an 18 year old guy</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and within 30 seconds of applying the mud I could feel the burn.</li>
            <li>Not even a minute later, the cooling sensation turned mildly warm which quickly developed into a very raw feel.</li>
            <li>I bought this after using one other VIA item with success</li>
            <li>This has definitely become a part of my skin care routine and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to someone who&#x27;s looking for a spa feel, and something to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>a like, it leaves your skin super soft and those pesky black heads are gone around my nose!</li>
            <li>This made me worry a bit as I normally use a volcano mud facial wash which has a cooling feeling.  </li>
            <li>The patch test was fine, no irritation, so the next day I used the mud as a spot treatment on a few pimples.</li>
            <li>With that preamble out of the way, I must say that after using this mud for the past few days, my skin feels luxurious, is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and my face glows like the radiance of a 8 month pregnant woman.</li>
            <li>The results are instant, and immediately my face felt brand new.</li>
            <li>My mom left it on for a few more minutes and her skin was left with a red tint.</li>
            <li>I can only assume that the natural ingredients in here makes all the difference</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my skin is not that sensitive and it stayed red for a while after this.</li>
            <li>For really sensitive skin, I would definitely follow the directions and just leave it on for 2-3 minutes (and build tolerance from there) in order avoid any temporary red/irritation.  </li>
            <li>This one works very similar -- i applied a thin layer and in less than a min most of it had dried and tightened my skin (i love that feeling</li>
            <li>Overall I recommend it as it did clear up my face without having to use a gritty scrub which can leave tiny tears in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have spent a lot of money on face masks that felt like putting particularly sticking face lotion on, with no proof it was actually working (during or after).</li>

            <li> Helps to do some light exfoliating afterward with a wet towel to really get your skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> I always thought mud treatments were just for fun and that it wasn&#x27;t really going to do much for your face except make you feel like a million bucks for having mud on your face like in the movies, but when I put this mud treatment on I felt it working on my face right away.</li>
            <li> The product is rather intense if you have sensitive skin like I do, however the tingling sensation is very mild.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever stick to skin care treatments unless it really works for me and unless I can see the difference right away</li>
            <li> I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of mud masks and facial products that have made my skin clearer and also good feeling and usually I buy products that fit both criteria.</li>
            <li> , my skin looks more even and soft.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not cheap, but I thought it was worth it!</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to take the mask off because you don&#x27;t have to rub your skin a million times trying to get it off like you would with other masks.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, as I can easily pick it up and put it aside onto the lid, but</li>
            <li> He left it on for a little over five minutes, and experienced no burning.  </li>
            <li> After washing off the mask (in circular motions as per instructions), I can see that it really went to work on my face causing it to glow with redness</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this face mask, you will NOT regret buying it!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was incredibly nervous that my sensitive skin would be broken out.</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that it helps small scars fade more quickly.  </li>
            <li> just so you can get the full effect of this product, for sensitive skin i recommend doing 60 seconds at a time and making sure you moisturize really well after using it with perhaps aloe and or cucumber just to get rid of any redness that the mask may leave behind which usually goes away in a minute or two with any great mask like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and it left my face feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> It definitely leaves your skin feeling clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s pretty sure she just left it on for a bit too long, her skin was also not accustomed to it, so I would not recommend using it for more than a few minutes at a time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It started as a tingle, and progressed to a steady sting.</li>
            <li> I was left with smooth, soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product becomes tingly and intense at the 2-3 minute marker the first go around or for sensitive skin, try to avoid getting mud in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s often irritated by certain products.</li>
            <li> While the initial price is a bit on the high side, it is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work wonders on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Also it is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, your comfort is a small price to pay for good facial skin.</li>
            <li> so this is not the type of thing I normally use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a week, and have had no negative effects.</li>
            <li> You can definitely feel the difference right away after wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did leave my skin a little dry feeling after the first time use, but as I&#x27;ve used it more than once now, I don&#x27;t so much have that problem anymore.</li>
            <li> I had never tried a product with tea tree oil in it before (which this mud mask contains), so I was sure to patch test it first before I slathered it all over my face in case my skin was sensitive to it, which is quite common.</li>
            <li> face will feel brand new afterwards.</li>
            <li> People have commented that my face looks like it has a new glow to it.</li>
            <li> It tingles at first but feels like it&#x27;s actually exfoliating and treating my skin-</li>
            <li> You can actually feel it working, and notice a result after the first use.</li>
            <li> For such effective results, the burning feeling was a small price to pay.  </li>
            <li> It is also very easy to wash off and doesn&#x27;t leave you skin tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Tried this to help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an 18 year old guy</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and within 30 seconds of applying the mud I could feel the burn.</li>
            <li> Not even a minute later, the cooling sensation turned mildly warm which quickly developed into a very raw feel.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using one other VIA item with success</li>
            <li> This has definitely become a part of my skin care routine and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to someone who&#x27;s looking for a spa feel, and something to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> a like, it leaves your skin super soft and those pesky black heads are gone around my nose!</li>
            <li> This made me worry a bit as I normally use a volcano mud facial wash which has a cooling feeling.  </li>
            <li> The patch test was fine, no irritation, so the next day I used the mud as a spot treatment on a few pimples.</li>
            <li> With that preamble out of the way, I must say that after using this mud for the past few days, my skin feels luxurious, is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and my face glows like the radiance of a 8 month pregnant woman.</li>
            <li> The results are instant, and immediately my face felt brand new.</li>
            <li> My mom left it on for a few more minutes and her skin was left with a red tint.</li>
            <li> I can only assume that the natural ingredients in here makes all the difference</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my skin is not that sensitive and it stayed red for a while after this.</li>
            <li> For really sensitive skin, I would definitely follow the directions and just leave it on for 2-3 minutes (and build tolerance from there) in order avoid any temporary red/irritation.  </li>
            <li> This one works very similar -- i applied a thin layer and in less than a min most of it had dried and tightened my skin (i love that feeling</li>
            <li> Overall I recommend it as it did clear up my face without having to use a gritty scrub which can leave tiny tears in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have spent a lot of money on face masks that felt like putting particularly sticking face lotion on, with no proof it was actually working (during or after).</li>
            <li> Not generally a fan of exfoliating masks</li>
            <li> The first treatment I did, the Mud burned a little, but not like a bad burn, but you can definitely feel it working its magic.</li>
            <li> For the price point, I expected a larger container; even more frustrating was that the jar was half empy, similar to a bag of potato chips!</li>
            <li> I had several girls later that night compliment my face due to the softness and lack of oil.</li>
            <li> Her skin was a bit pink the next day too.</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m not very patient), but this mud treatment is definitely staying.</li>
            <li> It had the tingling feeling that I only usually feel when I use other high end products.</li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews its seems that this product on the other hand fulfills the only the former.</li>
            <li> A few days later I put the mud on my entire face (except for the eye and lip areas, of course) and within about 30 seconds</li>
            <li> When there was a little bit of the mask left on my face</li>
            <li> Perhaps I need to use it for a longer period of time, but with the burning I experience from the mud, I&#x27;m not very motivated to continue using this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied the mask as per the instructions, applying a thin layer on the whole face while avoiding eyes and lips.</li>
            <li> After being applied, there is some stinging/tingling as is expected from the ingredients</li>
            <li> I used a wet wash cloth to remove the rest.</li>
            <li> It has a whipped consistency, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My face was noticeably pink and stayed that way for about an hour!</li>
            <li> Also, for those who have had bad experiences with other facial creams and muds, my face absolutely did not break out after this treatment.</li>
            <li> just slightly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a slight burning/tingling sensation when you apply the product.</li>
            <li> It left my face red, and a tad uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I am always a little weary when it comes to exfoliating products since I don&#x27;t want to scrape my skin off</li>
            <li> husband, on the other hand, used this as a spot-treatment, applying it to a couple of small areas (maybe dime-sized areas).  </li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve used the mask as a spot treatment a few times, but I have yet to notice any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses</li>
            <li> You leave it on for a few minutes and take it off.</li>
            <li> I am 6&#x27;3&amp;#34;, thick dark beard, and not at all the typical customer that Via Cosmedics had in mind when they created this treatment.</li>
            <li> My face usually feels oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I have used indian clay mud in the past.</li>
            <li> I started out using this mask for just a few minutes at a time according to the directions then slowly increased the time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I felt an intense burning sensation within mere seconds of applying.  </li>
            <li> The mud is a thin paste that you apply in a thin layer over the face and leave for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying this is not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>

            <li> I had never tried a product with tea tree oil in it before (which this mud mask contains), so I was sure to patch test it first before I slathered it all over my face in case my skin was sensitive to it, which is quite common. The patch test was fine, no irritation, so the next day I used the mud as a spot treatment on a few pimples. No irritation, but the mud didn&#x27;t seem to help my skin either. A few days later I put the mud on my entire face (except for the eye and lip areas, of course) and within about 30 seconds I could feel it tingle. That tingling soon turned into a burning sensation, so I had to wash it off around the 1:30 mark. My face was noticeably pink and stayed that way for about an hour! Good thing I had a sunscreen with a white-cast to hide the redness a bit. No lasting damage, but it also didn&#x27;t help my skin from what I could tell. Since then I&#x27;ve used the mask as a spot treatment a few times, but I have yet to notice any difference in my skin. Perhaps I need to use it for a longer period of time, but with the burning I experience from the mud, I&#x27;m not very motivated to continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one small issue with the packaging: The lid has a paper &amp;#34;liner&amp;#34; on the inside, which I assume is supposed to be attached to the lid, but it was already detached when I first unscrewed the lid. Not a big deal, as I can easily pick it up and put it aside onto the lid, but just slightly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with skin sensitive to tea tree oil, but if you&#x27;ve tried tea tree oil and it works for you, then you might just love this mud mask!</li>
            <li> This is the first mud mask product my I have tried. Follow the directions for best results. The mud smells really nice after mixed up, came packed well, instructions on the box and product. The product becomes tingly and intense at the 2-3 minute marker the first go around or for sensitive skin, try to avoid getting mud in sensitive areas. Then the product starts to tighten up on the face. Washes off pretty easy leaving the skin feeling smooth and comfortable, the irritation goes away. With more uses, the time left on the mud can be extended as your skin becomes acclimated with it. Overall, very satisfied and great product!</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a mud treatment. I was excited to try it out. My face usually feels oily by the end of the day. I followed the directions and it left my face feeling refreshed and clean. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this after using one other VIA item with success and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it the first day I got it and also this morning before finishing my review and I have had the same results.&lt;br /&gt;This makes me skin feel smooth and healthy! I am always a little weary when it comes to exfoliating products since I don&#x27;t want to scrape my skin off but this was east and non-evasive. It has a pleasant, refreshing menthol smell I have come to enjoy since it clears out my nasal passage, too!</li>
            <li> I would like to start off by saying that I am no stranger to skin cleaning products. I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of mud masks and facial products that have made my skin clearer and also good feeling and usually I buy products that fit both criteria. Based on the other reviews its seems that this product on the other hand fulfills the only the former. This made me worry a bit as I normally use a volcano mud facial wash which has a cooling feeling.  I applied the mask as per the instructions, applying a thin layer on the whole face while avoiding eyes and lips. Initially there was a cooling sensation and it made me wonder what the fuss was about. Not even a minute later, the cooling sensation turned mildly warm which quickly developed into a very raw feel. This was 2 minutes into the application. The product recommends leaving it for 5. Not too big of a deal but oh, dear god it burns! After washing off the mask (in circular motions as per instructions), I can see that it really went to work on my face causing it to glow with redness and it was stinging for a good period of time after. Once the mask was off though it felt amazing! My skin was softer and more tender than ever before and it suppressed the oiliness as well! I had several girls later that night compliment my face due to the softness and lack of oil. For such effective results, the burning feeling was a small price to pay.  So in conclusion, should you get this item? Yes, your comfort is a small price to pay for good facial skin.</li>
            <li> I love it! It feels nice on my skin. My skin feels smooth and clean. My skin looks brighter.</li>
            <li> I really liked this face mask! It has a whipped consistency, and a little goes a long way. It makes your skin tingle! After rinsing my skin was so bright and radiant, and it felt so clean and soft. I would highly recommend this face mask, you will NOT regret buying it!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! You can feel the mud cleaning your skin, with a mild tingling sensation. When the mud dries you can actually see the oil that was removed from your pores! It is also very easy to wash off and doesn&#x27;t leave you skin tight and dry. I use their cucumber soothing gel after and leave it on overnight, the next morning my skin is smooth, bright, and hydrated! I will definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have both tried it. Feels amazing on your face long after use and smells great. My skin feels brighter and more youthful. I will definately be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Was trying to repair my sun damaged skin using this product.&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses I can definitely some effects, my skin looks more even and soft.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not cheap, but I thought it was worth it!</li>
            <li> This one is great, although there is a slight burning when it&#x27;s first applied (let&#x27;s me know it&#x27;s working). You can definitely feel the difference right away after wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this one if I want a quick mask in the mornings, or their Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel if I want to leave one on over night.</li>
            <li> I have used indian clay mud in the past. This one works very similar -- i applied a thin layer and in less than a min most of it had dried and tightened my skin (i love that feeling bc that&#x27;s how u know it&#x27;s working). The clay powder is very fine and blends smoothly with water. My skin looked and felt smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason i gave 4/5 stars is bc i think i should be sold at a lower price. Other than that, i loved it.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I&#x27;m an 18 year old guy so this is not the type of thing I normally use. However my mom is a cosmetologist, so I thought I&#x27;d also let her try it and help form an opinion on this stuff. We used it together and overall I would definitely recommend it and so would my mom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight burning/tingling sensation when you apply the product. You leave it on for a few minutes and take it off. My mom left it on for a few more minutes and her skin was left with a red tint. Her skin was a bit pink the next day too. But it did not bother. She&#x27;s pretty sure she just left it on for a bit too long, her skin was also not accustomed to it, so I would not recommend using it for more than a few minutes at a time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your face will feel brand new afterwards. It did leave my skin a little dry feeling after the first time use, but as I&#x27;ve used it more than once now, I don&#x27;t so much have that problem anymore. You may or may not want to use face moisturizer afterwards, but aside from that, it&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;ll be honest though, me being a guy, I would not buy this again. Although my mom said she definitely would!</li>
            <li> Nothing but positive thoughts about this product! I always thought mud treatments were just for fun and that it wasn&#x27;t really going to do much for your face except make you feel like a million bucks for having mud on your face like in the movies, but when I put this mud treatment on I felt it working on my face right away. It had the tingling feeling that I only usually feel when I use other high end products. I don&#x27;t ever stick to skin care treatments unless it really works for me and unless I can see the difference right away (i&#x27;m not very patient), but this mud treatment is definitely staying. It&#x27;s fun to apply and it works very well! I&#x27;m even thinking of having some ladies over and having an at home spa day with the mud treatments! I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Man this stuff is fantastic. Not generally a fan of exfoliating masks but I was pleasantly surprised at the results of having a very clean and refreshing feeling afterwards. I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s often irritated by certain products. I can only assume that the natural ingredients in here makes all the difference and I can feel that it works! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Tried this to help clear up my skin. The mud is a thin paste that you apply in a thin layer over the face and leave for a few minutes. It&#x27;s recommended to use up to 3 minutes the first time and I don&#x27;t think I even made it to the point because of the burning sensation. I removed after ~2 minutes using circular motions and I have to say my skin did feel a lot smoother. Helps to do some light exfoliating afterward with a wet towel to really get your skin super smooth. Overall I recommend it as it did clear up my face without having to use a gritty scrub which can leave tiny tears in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my skin is not that sensitive and it stayed red for a while after this. My advice: use it the night before so the redness has time to subside.</li>
            <li> what an interesting mud mask not only is it easy to put on but super easy to take off great for men and woman a like, it leaves your skin super soft and those pesky black heads are gone around my nose! not strong smelling and would be a great addition to a detox gel or moisturizer afterwards just so you can get the full effect of this product, for sensitive skin i recommend doing 60 seconds at a time and making sure you moisturize really well after using it with perhaps aloe and or cucumber just to get rid of any redness that the mask may leave behind which usually goes away in a minute or two with any great mask like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review). I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li> After one use of the product I noticed brighter and smoother skin.  Also, I noticed that it helps small scars fade more quickly.  It definitely leaves your skin feeling clean afterwards.  For really sensitive skin, I would definitely follow the directions and just leave it on for 2-3 minutes (and build tolerance from there) in order avoid any temporary red/irritation.  Overall, I think this is a spa quality product for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Before I begin my review of this this mud, I want to give some background on myself. I am 6&#x27;3&amp;#34;, thick dark beard, and not at all the typical customer that Via Cosmedics had in mind when they created this treatment. With that preamble out of the way, I must say that after using this mud for the past few days, my skin feels luxurious, is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and my face glows like the radiance of a 8 month pregnant woman. The first treatment I did, the Mud burned a little, but not like a bad burn, but you can definitely feel it working its magic. I got used to it by the second treatment, and actually kindly like the tingling burn sensation. The results are instant, and immediately my face felt brand new. Like I had just found the fountain of youth and dipped my face into it and revitalized myself by 2-3 years. While the initial price is a bit on the high side, it is well worth every penny. Honestly, people compliment me on my glow and asked if I had just come from a spa treatment or say that I looked more relaxed. Hell, my girlfriend could not stop touching my face either. Also, for those who have had bad experiences with other facial creams and muds, my face absolutely did not break out after this treatment. So I will definitely be ordering another one of these.</li>
            <li> I wish that I loved this more!  I really wanted it to work wonders on my sensitive skin.  Unfortunately, I felt an intense burning sensation within mere seconds of applying.  I did an all-over facial treatment, and it burned all over.  I left it on the minimum amount of time (couldn&#x27;t handle one second longer of the burning), and washed it off as directed.  It left my face red, and a tad uncomfortable. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of my sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m not docking more than one star. I would just use caution of you are prone to sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;My husband, on the other hand, used this as a spot-treatment, applying it to a couple of small areas (maybe dime-sized areas).  He left it on for a little over five minutes, and experienced no burning.  He was impressed with it&#x27;s pore cleansing abilities, and said he will definitely use it again!  :)</li>
            <li> I took a leap of faith and tried all three of the VIA Cosmetics products; the UltraMud being one of them. I have had the opportunity to use it several times and I can confidently say that I am thoroughly impressed! The product is rather intense if you have sensitive skin like I do, however the tingling sensation is very mild. You can literally feel the &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; working into your pores. Since I have started using the UltraMud I have realized a significant decrease with my blemishes pimples that would pop up on occasion. I would highly recommend this product to anyone! Not to mention it also has an excellent price point!</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my skin care products and have to say I am extremely happy with this mask. My skin is a bit oily and I struggle with mild breakouts. I&#x27;ve used this a couple times a week for over a month now and I love the results. I can honestly say it does more than other masks I have tried. It tingles at first but feels like it&#x27;s actually exfoliating and treating my skin- so I like that. As the mud dries I can see dots from my pores where the oil is absorbed. I started out using this mask for just a few minutes at a time according to the directions then slowly increased the time. Afterwards my skin feels amazingly healthy, soft, smooth and just rejuvenated! People have commented that my face looks like it has a new glow to it. Also my oily skin and breakouts are reduced. This has definitely become a part of my skin care routine and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying this is not for the faint of heart. I have sensitive skin and within 30 seconds of applying the mud I could feel the burn. It started as a tingle, and progressed to a steady sting. The bottle says to use it for 2 minutes the first use, and work up to 15 depending on tolerance. I was incredibly nervous that my sensitive skin would be broken out. However as I started rinsing the mask off I could already see there was no redness or irritation. I was left with smooth, soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent a lot of money on face masks that felt like putting particularly sticking face lotion on, with no proof it was actually working (during or after). This VIA mud mask sets itself apart. You can actually feel it working, and notice a result after the first use. I&#x27;ve used it for a week, and have had no negative effects. The burning does take some getting used to, but for me it&#x27;s well worth it for a product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to someone who&#x27;s looking for a spa feel, and something to use on a regular basis. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, which was nice. At first glance, the product appeared to be nicely packaged. However, there was a red substance that was leaking from the jar that got on the outer packaging also. For the price point, I expected a larger container; even more frustrating was that the jar was half empy, similar to a bag of potato chips! The product itself is nice and provides a spa feel.</li>
            <li> Opening up the container, the smell of the mud mask wasn&#x27;t too strong - fairly pleasant. The instructions were easy to follow, and the mask applied easily and was easy to wash off after waiting a few minutes for it to work. After being applied, there is some stinging/tingling as is expected from the ingredients but it wasn&#x27;t painful. Once it was washed off, my skin was visibly cleaner, exfoliated and felt great. I&#x27;m very happy using this as part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I really love this mud mask because my face is softer after using it. Also it is gentle on my sensitive skin. The first time I used this mask I put it on for 2 minutes then put water on my face to get the mask off. When there was a little bit of the mask left on my face I used a wet wash cloth to remove the rest. It was very easy to take the mask off because you don&#x27;t have to rub your skin a million times trying to get it off like you would with other masks. My skin felt soft, clean, and bright after using this mud mask. This mud mask feels like a beauty product and the scent isn&#x27;t strong. I received this exfoliating &amp; clarifying ultraMUD treatment for free to review to give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little overpriced, though it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
