            <li>The samplers are great and have wonderful new fragrances in them.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both found these bath products to be a refreshing addition to the bath water for a good and relaxing soak -- good for the skin, mind and soul.</li>
            <li>But when our son is stumped for a gift, he can always give her these amazing bath oils.</li>
            <li>This was a good way to try many of the varieties.</li>
            <li>Nice collection of scents.  </li>
            <li>After living in three countries in Europe for 20 years, it is clear that Kneipp makes the best bath oils.</li>
            <li>A gift that I&#x27;m told was lovely.</li>
            <li>Love the variety and the ability to chose based on my needs at the time.</li>
            <li>I fell in love immediately.  </li>
            <li>Was given as a gift, and the recipient really enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>Many of them stink, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Love everything about them, will order more when I finish this set.</li>
            <li>Love Kneipp.</li>
            <li>I ordered more and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>Better than any spa products I have used</li>
            <li>I enjoy a warm bath and all of Kneipp&#x27;s products give you that relaxing feeling.  </li>
            <li>so I can try all of their scents and glad I did because I love them all..............</li>
            <li>Many of them smell like cough syrup to me.</li>
            <li>I really love herbal bathes.</li>
            <li>Love the oils and the salts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more when these run out.</li>
            <li>Because it is a wonderful aromatic oil that totally relaxes you!</li>
            <li>people love them</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for relaxing after a long day</li>
            <li>These are strong smelling</li>
            <li>if she cares for one or more, she can then buy the full sized version for herself.</li>
            <li>Of the 10 bottles, I have found two that I really like (Pure Bliss &amp; Sensual Seduction), one that&#x27;s really nice (Lavender) and one that is okay (Warm Embrace).</li>
            <li>This pack is great for the traveler who wants a good bath soak at the hotel after a long day.</li>
            <li>the variety of different soothing scents is great</li>
            <li>They use essential oils and are a great product.</li>
            <li>great sample sizes yet still ample for appreciating several baths with one bottle.  </li>
            <li>Kneipp is superior -- by far -- to them all.  </li>
            <li>Kneipp bath oils are just great and high quality and in a little bag they look very cute!</li>
            <li>Baths are important to me, they make me feel special.  </li>
            <li>The oils are great and you don&#x27;t need to use near ad much as they recommend.</li>
            <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy the large bottles like I had planned on doing.</li>
            <li>The bath oils are lovely, and as far as I can tell, they seem genuine.</li>
            <li>So glad it is possible to get this great European product and so quickly.  </li>
            <li>some of these are new or combined scents, look forward to some lovely bathing experiences</li>
            <li>Just used my last bottle today and need to order more!</li>
            <li>They arrived nicely packaged five in each open face box, not a box nice enough to keep; I immediately put it in the recycling.</li>
            <li>kneipp offers outstanding quality every time</li>
            <li>use them frequently and am pleased with them.</li>
            <li>They diffuse just right in the water.</li>
            <li>I like the sample set, but there were only a couple scents that I actually enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to the Lavender Kneipp in a subscription box.  </li>
            <li>Never fails to impress.</li>
            <li>If you have muscle spasms in your back, neck and legs, add to bath water and relax, you will sleep so much better with these Herbal Bath Salts.</li>
            <li>They are indeed very zen!</li>
            <li>However, if you do a lot of traveling on business then these would easily go through airport security, and that might be worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>She loves to bathe and appreciated them very much.</li>
            <li>Really looing forward to my first bath using it.</li>
            <li>She also liked the little case it was in.</li>
            <li>I give it three stars based on the ones that I really like.</li>
            <li>I do t use as much</li>
            <li>Very soothing and relaxing,</li>
            <li>Great oils disperse easy in the water with no oily film on the bad afterwards.</li>
            <li>IDK how she&#x27;ll like them, but I liked that there was a small amount of each type to try-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other natural brands and bath soak types (salts, foam, etc.).  </li>
            <li>My only issue is that for the size of what I received, I was charged about twice what I would have thought they are worth.</li>
            <li>I expected to like the Rosemary and Eucalyptus because I do enjoy those general scents, but not so much.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve combined the old scents with some of the newer ones in a cute little package.  </li>
            <li>After reading an article in the New York Times, I bought this set as a bday gift for a dear friend who is a bath-taking aficionado.  </li>
            <li>Black Night Blooming Jasmine, Herbal Bath--Valerian &amp; Hops, Stress Free Bath--Mandarin Orange, Herbal Bath--</li>
            <li>So far I do not love most of these bath oils.</li>
            <li>Pure Bliss Bath Red Poppy Hemp, Herbal Bath--Cold &amp; Sinus</li>
            <li>Relief Eucalyptus, Soft Skin Bath Almond Blossom, and Herbal Bath Juniper.  </li>
            <li>I used to order  direct from Kneipp.</li>
            <li>The ingredient quality is unsurpassed; my skin always feels soft and refreshed after using them.  </li>
            <li>However, this is a minor hassle because the product itself is really</li>
            <li>Kniepp herbal baths are fantastic, and it&#x27;s hard to find the sampler selection.</li>

            <li> Kniepp herbal baths are fantastic, and it&#x27;s hard to find the sampler selection.</li>
            <li> A classic, I grew up with this stuff, save them for when you need a little treat in the tub.</li>
            <li> She rations them out for as long as possible and when they are gone, she reverts to Epsom salts and various essential oils.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that, if some of the vivid colors are added not natural, could they cut that down.</li>
            <li> I think I will love this but have been unable to use it yet due to foot surgery.  </li>
            <li> The little bottles pack a classy euro punch.</li>
            <li> I will definitely return to buy the Pure Bliss &amp; Sensual Seduction, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted so much money to find out most of them are awful.</li>
            <li> This has lasted me a long time, and now I know which ones I would want to order again.  </li>
            <li> We put each of these little bottles in a white transparent gift bag for my daughter&#x27;s (12y.)</li>
            <li> They are expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I only use a few cap fills for each bath.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small enough to take through hand baggage.</li>
            <li> But I have a small water heater and I&#x27;m not willing to waste an entire bath to find out.</li>
            <li> But based on my past experience with the brand, I was expecting these small bottles to be about twice/three times as big.</li>
            <li> there is a heavy soap odor which probably doesn&#x27;t make sense to you</li>
            <li> Not available from them anymore.</li>
            <li> theses came in just a few days and are well packed.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I give this to each other at least once a year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Totally overpriced - you need at least two bottles per bath and even then the aroma is too weak.</li>
            <li> have used Kneipp herbal baths in the past...</li>
            <li> Although a bit pricey, they are a small price to pay for spa-like luxury.</li>
            <li> I have not found one in this path that I have not liked.</li>
            <li> The Eucalyptus one particularly was heaven during this nasty winter with colds and flu.  </li>
            <li> However, the bottles tend to stick to the bottom of the package and are sometimes difficult to remove and replace.  </li>
            <li> was TERRIBLE, I was so embarrassed</li>
            <li> The rest are TERRIBLE smelling.</li>

            <li> A gift that I&#x27;m told was lovely. I&#x27;ve used this line myself and find the scents very appealing and relaxing. My only wish is that, if some of the vivid colors are added not natural, could they cut that down. They stain washcloths and seem a bit psychedelic for something that&#x27;s supposed to be calming. When the orange one spilt into my carry-on it was dastardly.</li>
            <li> Very nice assortment of bath oils.</li>
            <li> We put each of these little bottles in a white transparent gift bag for my daughter&#x27;s (12y.) birthday party to hand out to her friends. Kneipp bath oils are just great and high quality and in a little bag they look very cute!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both found these bath products to be a refreshing addition to the bath water for a good and relaxing soak -- good for the skin, mind and soul.</li>
            <li> Great bath oil. Love the variety and the ability to chose based on my needs at the time.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to the Lavender Kneipp in a subscription box.  I fell in love immediately.  I purchased this set, the shipping was fast, it arrived in excellent condition and it&#x27;s a great sampler set and a good value!</li>
            <li> have used Kneipp herbal baths in the past...some of these are new or combined scents, look forward to some lovely bathing experiences</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift, and the recipient really enjoyed it.  Said the scents lasted and were pleasant.  She also liked the little case it was in.</li>
            <li> The bath oils are lovely, and as far as I can tell, they seem genuine. But based on my past experience with the brand, I was expecting these small bottles to be about twice/three times as big. The bottles I received are .68 fl oz (20ml) each.  Enough for one bath using each bottle.  Sensual Seduction Bath--Black Night Blooming Jasmine, Herbal Bath--Valerian &amp; Hops, Stress Free Bath--Mandarin Orange, Herbal Bath--Warmth &amp; Energy Spruce and Pine, Balancing Lavender,  Joint &amp; Muscle Rescue Bath Arnica, Pure Bliss Bath Red Poppy Hemp, Herbal Bath--Cold &amp; Sinus Relief Eucalyptus, Soft Skin Bath Almond Blossom, and Herbal Bath Juniper.  They arrived nicely packaged five in each open face box, not a box nice enough to keep; I immediately put it in the recycling. My only issue is that for the size of what I received, I was charged about twice what I would have thought they are worth. However, if you do a lot of traveling on business then these would easily go through airport security, and that might be worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Never fails to impress. A classic, I grew up with this stuff, save them for when you need a little treat in the tub. The little bottles pack a classy euro punch.</li>
            <li> If you have muscle spasms in your back, neck and legs, add to bath water and relax, you will sleep so much better with these Herbal Bath Salts.</li>
            <li> After reading an article in the New York Times, I bought this set as a bday gift for a dear friend who is a bath-taking aficionado.  IDK how she&#x27;ll like them, but I liked that there was a small amount of each type to try-if she cares for one or more, she can then buy the full sized version for herself.</li>
            <li> It was the best to to choose which of these we really liked. the variety of different soothing scents is great</li>
            <li> just okay. Many of them stink, in my opinion. there is a heavy soap odor which probably doesn&#x27;t make sense to you but I swear it&#x27;s chokingly so.</li>
            <li> All of the scents are great and each is a perfect travel size.  Love everything about them, will order more when I finish this set.</li>
            <li> Love Kneipp. Delivered on time</li>
            <li> So glad it is possible to get this great European product and so quickly.  The samplers are great and have wonderful new fragrances in them.  They are indeed very zen!</li>
            <li> Got a sample from s Beaty sample box and loved it. I ordered more and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I give this to each other at least once a year.&lt;br /&gt;Kneipp lets us relax in a wonderful bath!!</li>
            <li> Better than any spa products I have used</li>
            <li> I think I will love this but have been unable to use it yet due to foot surgery.  Really looing forward to my first bath using it.</li>
            <li> My son started buying these to give to my wife for Christmas. She loves to bathe and appreciated them very much. She rations them out for as long as possible and when they are gone, she reverts to Epsom salts and various essential oils. But when our son is stumped for a gift, he can always give her these amazing bath oils. Each bottle yields two baths. Although a bit pricey, they are a small price to pay for spa-like luxury.</li>
            <li> pkg was not as shown on bottle was  brken and it was a gift, was TERRIBLE, I was so embarrassed</li>
            <li> I used to order  direct from Kneipp. Not available from them anymore. So I was happy to find this supplier.     Very happy with the service.</li>
            <li> These bath oils are great for an air tub.  I love the poppy one and the lavendar one the best!</li>
            <li> After living in three countries in Europe for 20 years, it is clear that Kneipp makes the best bath oils. They aren&#x27;t oily. They diffuse just right in the water. They use essential oils and are a great product. This pack is great for the traveler who wants a good bath soak at the hotel after a long day. They&#x27;re small enough to take through hand baggage.</li>
            <li> great sample sizes yet still ample for appreciating several baths with one bottle.  this is second purchase of the same.  kneipp offers outstanding quality every time</li>
            <li> No carrying tote as pictured.</li>
            <li> Awesome to be able to try new scents - they r all great!</li>
            <li> Totally overpriced - you need at least two bottles per bath and even then the aroma is too weak.</li>
            <li> I have used Kneipp bath oils and foaming baths for 30+ years.  I&#x27;ve tried many other natural brands and bath soak types (salts, foam, etc.).  Kneipp is superior -- by far -- to them all.  The ingredient quality is unsurpassed; my skin always feels soft and refreshed after using them.  Depending on the fragrance used, you will truly feel the way it is described on the label.  The Eucalyptus one particularly was heaven during this nasty winter with colds and flu.  Just used my last bottle today and need to order more!</li>
            <li> Kneipp oils just the best. This is my second purchase. Great oils disperse easy in the water with no oily film on the bad afterwards. They are expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have not found one in this path that I have not liked. Good quality is what it is. Would be an excellent gift.</li>
            <li> Kniepp herbal baths are fantastic, and it&#x27;s hard to find the sampler selection. This was a luxurious gift to myself using a gift card. Yay!</li>
            <li> I enjoy a warm bath and all of Kneipp&#x27;s products give you that relaxing feeling.  I purchased the 10 pc so I can try all of their scents and glad I did because I love them all..............</li>
            <li> So far I do not love most of these bath oils. Many of them smell like cough syrup to me. I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy the large bottles like I had planned on doing. This was a good way to try many of the varieties.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Delivered on estimated time.</li>
            <li> I really love herbal bathes. These are strong smelling I only use a few cap fills for each bath. The aromas are great and the verity in this pack is wonderful you will love it. theses came in just a few days and are well packed.</li>
            <li> Of the 10 bottles, I have found two that I really like (Pure Bliss &amp; Sensual Seduction), one that&#x27;s really nice (Lavender) and one that is okay (Warm Embrace). The rest are TERRIBLE smelling. I expected to like the Rosemary and Eucalyptus because I do enjoy those general scents, but not so much. I admit I have just smelled them by taking a drop and rubbing it on my skin and not actually adding them to water, so perhaps that would make a difference. But I have a small water heater and I&#x27;m not willing to waste an entire bath to find out. I will definitely return to buy the Pure Bliss &amp; Sensual Seduction, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted so much money to find out most of them are awful. I give it three stars based on the ones that I really like.</li>
            <li> Greatest herbal products ever. Period. A must for any bath lover. Love the oils and the salts. Don&#x27;t forget the book.</li>
            <li> The oils are great and you don&#x27;t need to use near ad much as they recommend. I would buy them to see what you like or as a gift.</li>
            <li> They are so great. I do t use as much and they tell you you are supposed too you can get more out of each bottle and they smell so good!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for bath bombs and ran across these.  I used them years ago and forgot how wonderful they were.  They smell so good!  I&#x27;ll be ordering more when these run out.</li>
            <li> Kneipp is the very best product for a great bath. My wife and 3 daughters use this bath product always.</li>
            <li> Because it is a wonderful aromatic oil that totally relaxes you! I will always purchase it for my baths. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfect for relaxing after a long day</li>
            <li> These products are fragrant and help with sleep and soreness.&lt;br /&gt;I use them frequently and am pleased with them. I give them as gifts&lt;br /&gt;And people love them</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Baths are important to me, they make me feel special.  The kniepp Herbal Bath Set is marvelous.  The smells are delicious and they make the bath feel excellent</li>
            <li> Very soothing and relaxing,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Kneipp products all of my life and this is a nice assortment of scents.  They&#x27;ve combined the old scents with some of the newer ones in a cute little package.  However, the bottles tend to stick to the bottom of the package and are sometimes difficult to remove and replace.  However, this is a minor hassle because the product itself is really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the Eucalyptus, which when experiencing allergies, is great at clearing your sinuses!</li>
            <li> Nice collection of scents.  (Don&#x27;t use in whirlpool baths.)</li>
            <li> Excellent product, as I always receive it.</li>
