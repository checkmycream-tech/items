            <li>Great moisture product for hair and skin.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t smell so pleasant.</li>
            <li>Good stuff and nice price!</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>That was until I ordered this shea butter blend and my hair INSTANTLY loved it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I Love it!</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I am away from home and do not have the resources to make my own homemade whipped shea butter</li>
            <li>I warm it up</li>
            <li>This was incredible, very well made</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Seems to be mostly Shea Butter judging from consistency and smell but still nonetheless has been doing wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>Smell is just ok</li>
            <li>My order even came with a handwritten thank you from the order, which you don&#x27;t see too many people doing these days.</li>
            <li>I am a highly satisfied customer</li>
            <li>Lovely smell</li>
            <li>(as many naturals report, I have more than 1 hair texture on my head).</li>
            <li>But, there has to be some non hormone disruptive scents out there that are safe.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great winter moisturizer, and very good after shaving my legs without the usual burn from lotions packed with chemicals and alcohols.</li>
            <li>The butter itself is fine.</li>
            <li>Very good for dry skin and hair!!!</li>
            <li>The product arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>The little thing inside the lid got lost quickly but the butter is still good</li>
            <li>The moisture it provides is like no other and my curls are in love.</li>
            <li>This product is different since it melts easily and goes into my hair smoothly.</li>
            <li>and I decided I should try to do things more similar to her.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li>I really love this product especially for hair!</li>
            <li>skin&#x27;s been surviving the Wisconsin winter much better with this blend, especially my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you give it enough time to sink in</li>
            <li>having a product that both adds moisture and seals (apparently: Please don&#x27;t quote me on this because I&#x27;m not a naturalistA, just a chick who has been natural forever and is super lazy about varying her routine) is awesome.</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of products promising shiny, curly, moisturized hair and have yet to find the product that does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>so I use it on my hair and dry areas on my skin with another product that has a better smell.</li>
            <li>My dry cracked hands feels so much better.</li>
            <li>To make a long story short, my first twist out using this cream was beautiful, light, and fluffy with lots of volume!</li>
            <li>Delivered on time and my skin loves it so much.</li>
            <li>My hair is very shiny and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This product works great to style my wife&#x27;s hair (who is part African American), but she does not like the smell and that is a big deterrent for her.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and super simple, not like the commercial products loaded with chemicals (which were probably causing my styles to look less than ideal.)</li>
            <li>Love supporting small businesses w wholesome ingredients</li>
            <li>I love my natural hair and will never consider being anything other than being a naturalista for the rest of my life</li>
            <li>I just wish it was more fluffy since its supposed to be whipped</li>
            <li>I started using them a few months ago, and I love the way it keeps my skin moisturized without having to do so with a ton of additives.</li>
            <li>I have finally found what I have been looking for, a product that claims to do exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a little hard but its great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to go natural</li>
            <li>It makes your hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I use it to keep my natural as well as my daughter&#x27;s natural hairstyles keep moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use this in both me and my 1 year old&#x27;s hair for sealing moisture.</li>
            <li>Commercial lotion brands are no comparison to Shea butter, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>In the description it says spf6, is that added or does implying that it protects your skin from the sun naturally?</li>
            <li>I use this on my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 3C/4A natural hair.</li>
            <li>I agree with my wife, the scent is not horrible, but not pleasant.</li>
            <li>I am a newbie in the natural world and have only been natural for 6 months.</li>
            <li>The only product I&#x27;ve found that compares is pure Emu Oil but doesn&#x27;t seem to hold as long.</li>
            <li>The results are worth the trouble of using two products.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s thick and without useless filers,  my skin looks like new, life full and remains healthy for days even after one use.</li>
            <li>I have absolute knowledge of the benefits of Shea butter (especially the additional blends of other oils).</li>
            <li>I live in a dry, DRY state, so</li>

            <li> I live in a dry, DRY state, so</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is authentic or organic or does it really contains all the ingredients as advertised by the seller, product pics say &amp;#34;100% Ghanaian unrefined raw Shea butter, whereas I received &amp;#34;100% unrefined raw Shea butter&amp;#34;, No American FDA approval or made in information, buyer be careful.</li>
            <li> We live in a very dry climate with little to no humidity and thus a deep moisturizer that lasts is essential.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin and kp and commercial products just don&#x27;t cut it,  not to mention all the harmful chemicals they pack.  </li>
            <li> Not bad a little hard melt though.</li>
            <li> (I had previously detangled with my wide toothed comb and of course I was doing this on SLIGHTLY dampened hair).</li>
            <li> but before I pat my skin dry, because it is thick and it helps with spreading.</li>
            <li> and this is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> It is not a whipped butter, so it is hard as a ROCK, but I just dutifully jammed my finger in and got a dime sized amount that I rubbed vigorously between my hands until it warmed up and became a liquid/oil.</li>
            <li> I am trying to help her avoid xeno and phyto estrogens due to her postpartum depression symptoms, and I know it is hard to do that when adding a scent to products.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter vastly improved both conditions, but I found it took too long to soak in, and finding it in other products without a hundred other chemicals or cocoa butter (horrible on my skin!!)</li>
            <li> I distributed it between my palms onto approximately 4&amp;#34; sections of my hair (I have a LOT of hair, so it was divvied into approximately 6 sections) and then brushed with my denman brush</li>
            <li> and I usually find them hard to melt, even when I rub them in my hands.</li>
            <li> is ridiculously hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) pretty bad on my arms and legs, and as a bonus, am acne-prone.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering buying this, but I&#x27;m a bit confused.</li>
            <li> but I will have to admit the process has been frustrating at times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of butters because my hair tends to be oily in parts</li>
            <li> I have turned into a product junkie during this process and have remained frustrated by accumulating all these products to no avail.</li>
            <li> and I was absolutely shocked at the level of moisture and shine that my hair had this morning.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product. Delivered on time and my skin loves it so much.</li>
            <li> it was whar i wxpected it to be. i like it.</li>
            <li> Not bad a little hard melt though. So I switched to another brand .</li>
            <li> This whipped shea butter is awesome! I haven&#x27;t tried it on my body yet, but I have on my hair. I&#x27;ve decided to go natural and I have type 4a hair. I&#x27;ve tried every twisting butter under the sun but none of them have yielded the results I wanted. I follow Naptural85 on YouTube and she has a simple regimen of using her homemade whipped shea butter to do sets with flexirods and CurlFormers, as well as twist-outs. Her hair comes out beautifully every time. I have the same hair type as her and I decided I should try to do things more similar to her. I am away from home and do not have the resources to make my own homemade whipped shea butter so I decided to purchase this one. It&#x27;s all natural and super simple, not like the commercial products loaded with chemicals (which were probably causing my styles to look less than ideal.) To make a long story short, my first twist out using this cream was beautiful, light, and fluffy with lots of volume! The product arrived right on time. I will most definitely repurchase! Thank you to the sellers!</li>
            <li> Good but doesn&#x27;t smell so pleasant. Can&#x27;t put my finger on what it smells like but it&#x27;s not great. The butter itself is fine. Packaged just as shown. The little thing inside the lid got lost quickly but the butter is still good so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have 2c 3a curl type and this is a little heavy. I warm it up w my hands  before I put it in and I dont mind the oily look. If you do this would still work as a great moisturizer for any hair type!! Love supporting small businesses w wholesome ingredients i  their products</li>
            <li> I love this product. It melts in my hand and melts in my hair. My hair is very shiny and moisturized. I just wish it was more fluffy since its supposed to be whipped</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It makes your hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I really love this product especially for hair! I use it to keep my natural as well as my daughter&#x27;s natural hairstyles keep moisturizer. We live in a very dry climate with little to no humidity and thus a deep moisturizer that lasts is essential. This product delivers, I am a fan!</li>
            <li> Good stuff and nice price! This absorbs well and is lasting. Smells mehhh, but goes away immediately and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfume, so that&#x27;s a plus as well.</li>
            <li> I melted it and made it into a whip.  It&#x27;s still a little hard but its great</li>
            <li> Seems to be mostly Shea Butter judging from consistency and smell but still nonetheless has been doing wonders for my skin. I suffer from dry skin and kp and commercial products just don&#x27;t cut it,  not to mention all the harmful chemicals they pack.  I use this in the shower immediately after I shut off the water but before I pat my skin dry, because it is thick and it helps with spreading. Because it&#x27;s thick and without useless filers,  my skin looks like new, life full and remains healthy for days even after one use. I&#x27;ve even received complements on the appearance of my skin.  The only product I&#x27;ve found that compares is pure Emu Oil but doesn&#x27;t seem to hold as long. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great moisture product for hair and skin. Smell is just ok so I use it on my hair and dry areas on my skin with another product that has a better smell. The results are worth the trouble of using two products.</li>
            <li> I have been buying shea butter blends for years and I usually find them hard to melt, even when I rub them in my hands. This product is different since it melts easily and goes into my hair smoothly. The moisture it provides is like no other and my curls are in love. My order even came with a handwritten thank you from the order, which you don&#x27;t see too many people doing these days. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I Love it! I use this in both me and my 1 year old&#x27;s hair for sealing moisture. Was delivered within days of ordering.. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have absolute knowledge of the benefits of Shea butter (especially the additional blends of other oils).

            <li> I am a newbie in the natural world and have only been natural for 6 months.

I have tried all kinds of products promising shiny, curly, moisturized hair and have yet to find the product that does exactly what it claims. I have turned into a product junkie during this process and have remained frustrated by accumulating all these products to no avail. That was until I ordered this shea butter blend and my hair INSTANTLY loved it. I have finally found what I have been looking for, a product that claims to do exactly what it says. I have 4b/4c kinky, course hair and the moment thr product touch my hair a miracle was preformed.&lt;br /&gt;The seller had my product shipped within 24 hours and although at checkout I was told it would take like 5-7 days for delivery I received mines before then. I am a highly satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is authentic or organic or does it really contains all the ingredients as advertised by the seller, product pics say &amp;#34;100% Ghanaian unrefined raw Shea butter, whereas I received &amp;#34;100% unrefined raw Shea butter&amp;#34;, No American FDA approval or made in information, buyer be careful.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 4 year old daughter. Very good for dry skin and hair!!! Lovely smell, it&#x27;s a must buy!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. My dry cracked hands feels so much better.</li>
            <li> I started using them a few months ago, and I love the way it keeps my skin moisturized without having to do so with a ton of additives.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) pretty bad on my arms and legs, and as a bonus, am acne-prone. I finally realized that I was over-drying my skin, which was not helping my kp or acne at all. Shea butter vastly improved both conditions, but I found it took too long to soak in, and finding it in other products without a hundred other chemicals or cocoa butter (horrible on my skin!!) is ridiculously hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin&#x27;s been surviving the Wisconsin winter much better with this blend, especially my arms and legs. It&#x27;s a great winter moisturizer, and very good after shaving my legs without the usual burn from lotions packed with chemicals and alcohols. Just make sure you give it enough time to sink in or you&#x27;ll be wiping it off on your clothes!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 3C/4A natural hair. I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of butters because my hair tends to be oily in parts (as many naturals report, I have more than 1 hair texture on my head). I bought this with low expectations, just to add a butter to my regimen. I&#x27;ve been a conditioner, styling product, gel girl who loves wash n&#x27; gos always. I tried this last night for a braid out and I was absolutely shocked at the level of moisture and shine that my hair had this morning. I admit, I was totally a non-believer, but if you&#x27;re on the fence definitely try it. This blend is perfect for my hair! It is not a whipped butter, so it is hard as a ROCK, but I just dutifully jammed my finger in and got a dime sized amount that I rubbed vigorously between my hands until it warmed up and became a liquid/oil. I distributed it between my palms onto approximately 4&amp;#34; sections of my hair (I have a LOT of hair, so it was divvied into approximately 6 sections) and then brushed with my denman brush (I had previously detangled with my wide toothed comb and of course I was doing this on SLIGHTLY dampened hair). I then braided my hair and went to bed. When I took it out this morning, my hair was shiny, bouncy and defined. Additionally, there was none of that greasy feel that I&#x27;ve gotten from trying heavier oils like castor or jojoba alone. I live in a dry, DRY state, so having a product that both adds moisture and seals (apparently: Please don&#x27;t quote me on this because I&#x27;m not a naturalistA, just a chick who has been natural forever and is super lazy about varying her routine) is awesome. My hair feels and looks amazing. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This product works great to style my wife&#x27;s hair (who is part African American), but she does not like the smell and that is a big deterrent for her.  I am trying to help her avoid xeno and phyto estrogens due to her postpartum depression symptoms, and I know it is hard to do that when adding a scent to products.  But, there has to be some non hormone disruptive scents out there that are safe.  I agree with my wife, the scent is not horrible, but not pleasant.</li>
            <li> This was incredible, very well made</li>
