            <li> These socks are great, and I wish they were available in the stores. These socks are great for diabetics, and because of that I have ordered more of them.</li>
            <li> Really high quality aloe socks.  Thank you very much. Wish I would have had two pair to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> These socks are OK. Nice and soft- but I don&#x27;t feel like there is anything extra special in terms of healing qualities, just soft socks.</li>
            <li> For my wife this pair of Aloe socks is a God send. She suffers from very dry feet and these socks exude a healing moisture that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Very good product. works well even after several cycles in the washer. Sock are very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose they also sell one that cover more leg, but these are perfect when all you want to moisturize is your fee.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it, I would buy it again and the packaging and delivery were perfect.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to wear these socks when the weather cools.</li>
            <li> I was given some of these socks as a gift and wanted some for my daughter. They are some of the best socks O have ever worn. Soft, warm and comfortable</li>
            <li> This is the best brand of aloe infused socks?  They hold up great in the wash.  Super warm and a very tight weave.  Sizing is the same as any other socks.  I have several pairs and use them frequently as gifts.</li>
            <li> So soft and luxurious feeling!  When i paired these with some miracle foot cream the cracks in my feet were significantly better after just one night!</li>

            <li> I biught these socks for my elderly mom. Traditional socks are too binding at the top, leaving marks at the top on her tender legs. She loves the comfort and warmth of these socks.</li>
            <li> Sox kept shedding all over carpet. Had to throw them out</li>
            <li> They shed while wearing them, leaving black small black balls on the bottom of my feet and on the carpet</li>
            <li> I bought and gave these to my daughter in law. She loves them! They are very soft and wear well. Just be sure to follow washing instructions.</li>

            <li> They feel good on my feet, but I was hoping for the ones like Earth Therapeutics made before, which are more soothing and last longer. These are not the same. These are very small, and I can not even tell there was aloe in them. I bought Aloe Vera Gel and put it on before using them. I can do that with any socks.</li>
            <li> Price for 1 pair is high compared to other sites which offer 2 for not much more.</li>
            <li> great, moisturizes your feet. feels like  luxury and keeps your feet warm&lt;br /&gt;they are great, moisturizes your feet. feels like  luxury and keeps your feet warm&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend every one should own some</li>
            <li> i bought these to have a counter color to some blue moisturizing socks i&#x27;d bought. Well, i opened the package and took out the socks to brag to my teen son. Guess what? HE took them - he loves them. and seriously, if i can get a 15 year old boy to take any notice of his feet, I&#x27;ll take having my socks stolen.</li>
            <li> These socks are really really soft. They make my feet really soft. Every time I take off the sock, I get fuzzies on my feet from the socks. I love wearing them.</li>
            <li> I wear these with my gym shoes and blisters are a thing of the past.  Great comfort!  I highly recommend them to all.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my parents. They are enjoying them. Socks keep their feet soft. Needed to wash a few time to get rid of fluff.</li>
