            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>A spa in Florida used it on my toes when I was there, and I was so pleased with the color, that I had to purchase it on my return home.  </li>
            <li>This is a very pretty color with a nice finish.</li>
            <li>My new favorite color!!</li>
            <li>I applied three coats and then a clear topcoat, stunning!!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more cream look and full coverage.</li>
            <li>really cool.</li>
            <li>This color is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Beautiful Hot Pink color for nails and toes!</li>
            <li>I absolutely looove it ....!!</li>
            <li>The color goes on very light, almost clear.  </li>
            <li>I always saw and clicked on it to see what it was and finally had to own it.</li>
            <li>It was a bit too thin, but this color and jelly is just wonderful.</li>
            <li>The ones I have are either super opaque and dry kind of matte</li>
            <li>I had to put on like 10 coats to make it the right color.</li>
            <li>Needs several layers to build up to a very pretty bright pink.</li>
            <li>This is a jelly polish and it is very transparent.</li>
            <li>The color is very transparent and watery.</li>
            <li>If anyone knows where to get the real China Glaze, let me know.</li>
            <li>Not as vibrant as the picture depicts though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as if they took an old bottle and put nail polish remover in it to stretch it.</li>
            <li>The color is hot neon pink.</li>
            <li>Very prompt shipping, came way sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a jelly polish and is supposed to be thin, but it&#x27;s kind of extreme.</li>

            <li> or they are really thin and take a lot of work to get the color as pretty in the bottle.</li>
            <li> My nail lady told me to leave the lid off for a few days.</li>
            <li> Very thin, you have to put on SEVERAL coats.</li>
            <li> Even with a solid white base coat, I had to use two coats to get the desired color.</li>
            <li> It was expensive and not really worth it.</li>
            <li> I found it to be thin and watery and just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have to say, though, I&#x27;m a little disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Even with 3 coats it is nothing like it looks in the bottle, very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This is a very pretty color with a nice finish. It builds up to a really pretty color, but it&#x27;s extremely thin. I used 4 coats on some nails and 5 on others. I know it&#x27;s a jelly polish and is supposed to be thin, but it&#x27;s kind of extreme.</li>
            <li> super bright lovely color</li>
            <li> Color isn&#x27;t same as photo But I like it</li>
            <li> This s my fav nail polish I absolutely looove it ....!! It&#x27;s a must have if you into polishes !</li>
            <li> Love it! My nail lady told me to leave the lid off for a few days. She said this brand needs to breathe and it will thicken. I tried it and it actually worked.</li>
            <li> The color goes on very light, almost clear.  Even with 3 coats it is nothing like it looks in the bottle, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the formulation of this product. I found it to be thin and watery and just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Very prompt shipping, came way sooner than expected. 5 stars for service. The color on the other hand is so sheer. Needs several layers to build up to a very pretty bright pink. 3 stars for actual product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Not as vibrant as the picture depicts though.</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty. I always saw and clicked on it to see what it was and finally had to own it. I have to say, though, I&#x27;m a little disappointed with it. It is not opaque at all. Even with a solid white base coat, I had to use two coats to get the desired color. It seems to be a China Glaze thing. The ones I have are either super opaque and dry kind of matte or they are really thin and take a lot of work to get the color as pretty in the bottle.</li>
            <li> really cool. love it.</li>
            <li> This is a jelly polish and it is very transparent. I was hoping for a more cream look and full coverage. The color is hot neon pink.</li>
            <li> It was a bit too thin, but this color and jelly is just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Stays on a long time. Love this color!</li>
            <li> Love the color.  I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> This is sheer. Not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This is not the same formula as the China Glaze used at the salon. The color is very transparent and watery. It&#x27;s almost as if they took an old bottle and put nail polish remover in it to stretch it. Very unhappy. If anyone knows where to get the real China Glaze, let me know.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this color. A spa in Florida used it on my toes when I was there, and I was so pleased with the color, that I had to purchase it on my return home.  Very bright and perfect for summer.  Looks perfect with a tan, but also looks good even if you don&#x27;t have one.  My new favorite color!!</li>
            <li> you have to put 4-5 coats on this is not a lacquer nail polish period.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Hot Pink color for nails and toes! I applied three coats and then a clear topcoat, stunning!! Very happy w/ purchase!</li>
