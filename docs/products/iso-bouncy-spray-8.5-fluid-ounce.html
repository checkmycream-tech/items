            <li>It is the absolute best for my permed hair!</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years, and it is one of my favorite hair products on the market today!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and for some reason the product made my hair stick together and look oily.</li>
            <li>This just an ok product.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to all my friends with curly hair and they love it also.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair and have tried so many products for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Blow drying and scrunching with Ur hands as opposed to a diffuser breaks down the product more for softer curls and also allows you to feel if your hair is getting too hot to prevent overheating of hair leading to damage To top it off this product smells wonderful, I get compliments on how grreat my hair smells all the time!</li>

            <li>I hope it continues to be available.</li>
            <li>I prefer the spray which is why I ended up here looking for the original product.</li>
            <li>I know how hard it is for us curly haired girls to find the perfect product.</li>
            <li>I tried Fekkai curl cream, moroccanoil intense curl cream, curly sexy hair cream, bed head, and kerastase oleo curl cream.  </li>
            <li>I know holds quality, I previously tried to get my curls to do this with many different products, this product does the job nicely !!!</li>
            <li>I spray this on my hair after towel-drying while it is still good and wet and then disperse it through with my fingers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This makes great curls in my hair which is only moderately wavy when the weather is humid or if I don&#x27;t blow-dry.</li>
            <li>It is definitely one of the better curl enhances out there.  </li>
            <li>After paying more than I would have paid for a similar product at the salon (by the time I paid sh),I threw away over three-fourths of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Finish with hairspray, and my curls hold pretty well throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty sticky.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for years, price was reasonable too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;TO USE  DAILY TO ADD MORE CURLS.</li>
            <li>I just used the creme for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I know how hard it is for us curly haired girls to find the perfect product.is, expect that your hair may be quite big.</li>
            <li>cause my hair is fine so if you have thicker hair and you do this, expect that your hair may be quite big.</li>
            <li>It works really fast.</li>
            <li>The bouncy spray really helps my curls form after years of hormone imbalance, but it really dries out my hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Great product of my fine, straight hair, gives it body without weighing it down,  last a long time too!!</li>
            <li>I love the other ISO products I&#x27;ve tried, but this one leaves hair sticky and crunchy.</li>
            <li>I start with the ISO Bouncy Creme and apply a quarter size amount to each side (left and right)and a pea sized amount to the top/crown of my head and comb product through with my fingers paying special attention to my ends.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not something you could use as the main product to hold your curls (unless you want crispy hair).  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>I then use a diffuser on my blow dryer set at a medium speed and high heat.</li>
            <li>This is basically just a light (but wet) hairspray.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long but also fine and sometimes can&#x27;t decide whether it wants to be wavy or curly and is also easily weighed down by product that is too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>.it really brings life and shine back to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I prefer soft, non-crunchy curls and need help activating them.  </li>
            <li>I use the cream first, scrunching my hair with my fingers, then spritz all over with this spray, still scrunching, and then use a diffuser to dry.  </li>
            <li>Now, each curly haired girl styles their hair differently and wants different things from their styling prouducts</li>

            <li> This is a wonderful hair product!</li>
            <li> It is definitely one of the better curl enhances out there.  I spray it on when my hair is damp and scrunch with my hands.  It works really fast.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I have very fine hair and for some reason the product made my hair stick together and look oily. After paying more than I would have paid for a similar product at the salon (by the time I paid sh),I threw away over three-fourths of the bottle. It was just too sticky.</li>
            <li> This product acts like a hairspray. I love the other ISO products I&#x27;ve tried, but this one leaves hair sticky and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and I try to find products that will give it some extra curl.  This works well with the ISO Bouncy Creme.  I use the cream first, scrunching my hair with my fingers, then spritz all over with this spray, still scrunching, and then use a diffuser to dry.  Finish with hairspray, and my curls hold pretty well throughout the day.</li>
            <li> USED THIS FOR YEARS. vERY GOOD PRODUCT. WORKS WELL. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> This just an ok product.  I have naturally wavy, very thick, medium length hair and this product does do what it advertises.  However, it leaves a lot of product build up that only comes out after numerous clarifying shampoos.  It&#x27;s also pretty sticky.  All around I will keep using it as I like how it works.  I&#x27;m just not happy about the build up it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Great product of my fine, straight hair, gives it body without weighing it down,  last a long time too!! Have used it for years, price was reasonable too!</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair and have tried so many products for curly hair. I found this product 2 years ago and have never used anything else since. The salon I purchased it from no longer carries it and I was frantic trying to find it. I am extremely happy I found it on Amazon.com and don&#x27;t know what I would do if Amazon.com stops selling it. I have recommended this product to all my friends with curly hair and they love it also.</li>
            <li> This is really a great product.  So happy to be able to get it on line.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. . .it really brings life and shine back to your hair.  I have used it for many years, and it is one of my favorite hair products on the market today!</li>
            <li> Great product for your hair , thank you! Love it! Smells great too. Use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair too.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS GREAT- PRICE IS BETTER THAN BUYING IT AT MY SALON- WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;TO USE  DAILY TO ADD MORE CURLS.</li>

            <li> Good product.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am a faithful user of bouncy creme and hoped this would be a good finisher product to pair with the creme. I did not like how stiff this made my curls and prefer something lighter. I will not buy this again for my curls.</li>
            <li> ISO Bouncy styling products are the best I&#x27;ve ever used! I have type 3a sometime 2c curly hair.  My hair is long but also fine and sometimes can&#x27;t decide whether it wants to be wavy or curly and is also easily weighed down by product that is too heavy.  I&#x27;ve been using this product in conjunction with ISO Bouncy Creme for 10+ years.  Now I know that sounds like I&#x27;m stuck in my ways but in all reality, I&#x27;m a product junkie.  This product is not easy to find.  They used to sell it nationally at ulta and last year removed it from their stores.  I tried really hard to find a replacement to avoid having to order it online instead of running to the store to get it.  I tried Fekkai curl cream, moroccanoil intense curl cream, curly sexy hair cream, bed head, and kerastase oleo curl cream.  None of them even came close to what the ISO Bouncy line does for my hair.  I got sick of trying new products and decided I would just buy my hair products from Amazon which to my surprise was cheaper anyways.  Now, each curly haired girl styles their hair differently and wants different things from their styling prouducts so I&#x27;ll explain my preferences and routine for using these products.  I prefer soft, non-crunchy curls and need help activating them.  I start with the ISO Bouncy Creme and apply a quarter size amount to each side (left and right)and a pea sized amount to the top/crown of my head and comb product through with my fingers paying special attention to my ends.  I scrunch my hair until it has a slight wave/curl and still relatively wet.  I then spray this ISO Bouncy Spray generously all over my hair and then scrunch it again.  You will notice curl activation immediately.  At this point you can air dry if you want but your hair will be a little more stiff than if you blow dry.  I then flip my head over and scrunch my hair with the blow dryer on a low speed setting(to reduce frizz).  Again, I need help with volume cause my hair is fine so if you have thicker hair and you do this, expect that your hair may be quite big. Blow drying and scrunching with Ur hands as opposed to a diffuser breaks down the product more for softer curls and also allows you to feel if your hair is getting too hot to prevent overheating of hair leading to damage To top it off this product smells wonderful, I get compliments on how grreat my hair smells all the time! Hope this helps someone with curly hair....I know how hard it is for us curly haired girls to find the perfect product.is, expect that your hair may be quite big.

            <li> I looked for something with a name I know holds quality, I previously tried to get my curls to do this with many different products, this product does the job nicely !!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Gives my hair body and curl.  Good product!</li>
            <li> People who say this makes hair sticky and that it&#x27;s more for a hairspray HAVE to be using it wrong. It sounds like they are putting it on after styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes great curls in my hair which is only moderately wavy when the weather is humid or if I don&#x27;t blow-dry. I spray this on my hair after towel-drying while it is still good and wet and then disperse it through with my fingers. I then use a diffuser on my blow dryer set at a medium speed and high heat. It works great. I touch up some of the ends with my curling iron and the style lasts for 2 to 3 days, with it being a little less curly each day but still looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curl can be stiff if I use way too much but that doesn&#x27;t happen too often. I&#x27;ve been using it off and on for several years. Recently I had to purchase the Bouncy Creme because I was told at the store where I have been purchasing it that it had been discontinued. I just used the creme for the first time today. It doesn&#x27;t curl as well but it not sticky at all. I prefer the spray which is why I ended up here looking for the original product. I hope it continues to be available. My daughter and one of her friends have also started using it.</li>
            <li> I love ISO Bouncy Spray! It is the absolute best for my permed hair!</li>
