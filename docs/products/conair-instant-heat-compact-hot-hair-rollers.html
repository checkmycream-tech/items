            <li>Here&#x27;s a tip: zip up the container and let it heat for 10 minutes, not 30 seconds, and they will be the perfect level of ultra-warm to curl your hair without scorching it or burning your fingers.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a cute set a friend of mine bought second-hand that inspired me to buy these, but they&#x27;re not the great set to compare to that.</li>
            <li>They warm up quickly and are the perfect size for storage and travel.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love these curlers!  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought them!</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to pack for trips.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to know the sizes of rollers.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact for use while traveling.</li>
            <li>They do produce a nice wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I own 5 sets of these.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact.</li>
            <li>It might just depend on your preference though and what kind of effect you are going for.</li>
            <li>so I have just been using my own.</li>
            <li>I was planning on taking them on a business trip since the size is so nice and compact, but I&#x27;ll have to stick with my curling iron.</li>
            <li>You should feel them kind of snap in place.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the popular [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I travel a lot, and these will fit nicely into my suitcase as well !</li>
            <li>Great size for when I have to travel and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly and great for travel.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are great for traveling and heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>Other than that these are great rollers for an awesome price.</li>
            <li>They are very good for travel or fast touch ups</li>
            <li>Took this product on an international trip and it was perfect when using a converter/adapter and it fits nicely in your travel bags.  </li>
            <li>and I liked better in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just took these hot rollers on a vacation to Paris and they are compact and great for traveling (dual voltage).</li>
            <li>A great buy for travel hot rollers.</li>
            <li>The size of the rollers is nice and compact and you can easily travel with them.  </li>
            <li>plastic zipper bag makes it much more convenient to travel with than one of those bulky plastic boxes.</li>
            <li>I like them MUCH more than the hair clamps because, unlike the clamps, the pins don&#x27;t leave kinks and dents in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this set.</li>
            <li>Love these rollers, heat up quick,nice for travel.</li>
            <li>they are ok.....</li>
            <li>This is an excellent system for short hair gals.  </li>
            <li>I found this system to be excellent and would advise anyone with short hair to get this.</li>
            <li>I thought these rollers were really cute</li>
            <li>You spend more time fiddling with the curlers and clips that you might as well curl your hair with a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li>I found that by heating them 10 minutes or more, they work much better.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t image getting more from something pricier.</li>
            <li>With that addition I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent buy and the product does the job.</li>
            <li>I could imagine wearing there&#x27;s curlers for more than 20 minutes without getting a headache.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>reading many reviews I purchased this set.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and these make the most of what I have.  </li>
            <li>More for straightening than curling.</li>
            <li>The metal holders that hole the rollers is not my favorite</li>
            <li>When the UPS guy handed me the box, I couldn&#x27;t believe how light it was!  </li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>I use just four rollers in the top of my hair</li>
            <li>I love these hit rollers.</li>
            <li>This is a great, very compact set.</li>
            <li>I love that it has dual voltage</li>
            <li>I enjoy it every time I use it!</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I had a lot more hair, they&#x27;d stay in better, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Maybe if they came with twice as many clips, and I put two on each roller instead of one?</li>
            <li>Also I think this set heats more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Conair products for many of my 59 years</li>
            <li>The grip on the rollers is great -- it really holds the hair in place -- and</li>
            <li>the kind that would fit over the roller entirely..referred as alligator clips sometimes...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d pay more than that for a premium martini.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d pay more than that for a premium martini.</li>
            <li>the clips have nothing to do with the performance of the product, the product is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I like the 12-pack travel rollers from Conair much better.</li>
            <li>much more secure/tight.  </li>
            <li>but okay for the price.</li>
            <li>love this product/fabulous</li>
            <li>I WISH THE CLIPS STAYED IN BETTER</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I put one in my carry-on and one in my checked bag to be safe</li>
            <li>This is great for travel as very compact.</li>
            <li>The reviews were pretty good, too.</li>
            <li>It is most important to make sure they are seated on the element correctly.</li>
            <li>They heat quickly, stay hot plenty of time to do the job, and are in a compact case that will be great for travel.</li>
            <li>The soft case makes them very easy to tuck into a suitcase, and they do a good job of heating up in 90 seconds as promised in the instructions.</li>
            <li>I love this hot curler and use it all the time, it&#x27;s nice and compact for travel too.</li>
            <li>On top of that, they aren&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Still and all, it&#x27;s great to have for the modest price.</li>
            <li>I love using the Conair Instant Heat Compact Rollers.&lt;br /&gt;It heats at the right temperature and curls great!</li>
            <li>These hot roller heat up very fast and do a great job.</li>
            <li>Also there is nothing to cover the roller when it is on your hair so the heat escapes very quickly.</li>
            <li>They heat and curl very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Compact and easy to store or take in a suitcase.</li>
            <li>curl lasts all day and the comb type grabbers in each roller makes for easy roll-up.</li>
            <li>use at home now because the size is so easy to use and put away.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>They are compact and the design of the curler goes into your hair easily.</li>
            <li>I found they heated very quickly .</li>
            <li>The Conair HS10W hot rollers heat up quickly and provide good curl</li>
            <li>These work pretty good for being so small, I was impressed.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Results are great, full body and soft curls.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t manage these on my fine head of hair.</li>
            <li>Ended up returning these and just using my trusty curling iron for the hairdo, and it worked out fine.</li>
            <li>I had reservations about plastic curlers but these are fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>The wire clips work just fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the rollers did not stay in place</li>
            <li>Compact, comfortable, packs light, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Heat up super quick and super cute packaging too!</li>
            <li>I ordered extra large rollers because they work the best for me.</li>
            <li>may even order a second set of the medium sized one, they give super good curls to the hair!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want something huge that takes up all my counter space.</li>
            <li>Personally, this was a really great buy</li>
            <li>I thought that it would be a great time saver since i wouldn&#x27;t have to sit with the iron in my hand the entire time because I have a lot of hair and it takes forever to curl.</li>
            <li>So I bought the Conair Proclips, which are supposed to fit any size curler.</li>
            <li>Considering the fact that these are compact If you want to do your whole head you have to warm them up twice.</li>
            <li>These will fit in an 8&amp;#34; x 5&amp;#34; spot in your drawer or suitcase when you travel.  </li>
            <li>My stylist confirmed that Velro rollers don&#x27;t ruin your hair.</li>
            <li>but I could still use them, or it still worked, its just that I needed an updated one that fit my needs.</li>
            <li>Great product overall.</li>
            <li>This item is more a child&#x27;s toy than a useful toy.  </li>
            <li>A cheap set...</li>
            <li>but I never got a good bouncy head of softly curled hair out of these.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t needed heated rollers for many years and was reluctant to spend much money on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would use.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Velcro rollers are far superior.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s of good quality, and has enough rollers to accommodate most heads of hair.</li>
            <li>I would of loved it if had just more space to accomodate the medium and larger rollers.  </li>
            <li>Great size for travel but don&#x27;t do the job - should be simple to design a better hot roller.</li>
            <li>Curling iron or a better brand of hot rollers might be more useful than this one.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and they are easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I found that it takes 5 minutes or more to get them consistently hot.     </li>
            <li>Most travel hot rollers are two sizes.</li>
            <li>: They&#x27;re small, they&#x27;re designed well, they&#x27;re perfect for travel (with dual voltage too!)</li>
            <li>: They&#x27;re small, they&#x27;re designed well, they&#x27;re perfect for travel (with dual voltage too!)</li>
            <li>you have thicker or less fine hair that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;kink\\&quot; easily, then these will probably work great.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast and provide great soft curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Conair products and was exciting about finding hot rollers with both jumbo and large sizes.</li>
            <li>and so I just put these curlers in for about 1 minute and my hair is curled very nicely, if I leave them in too long its way to curly.</li>
            <li>Would love to see a set with 8 large, but haven&#x27;t found yet.</li>
            <li>I like to use those better than the large.</li>
            <li>so I bought another set to get more of the medium and large rollers.</li>
            <li>It most certainly did,</li>
            <li>I am able to curl all my hair with the 3 medium, and 3 large rollers.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Conair, for doing this right!</li>
            <li>the record, my hair is right at shoulder length and baby fine, and there&#x27;s a lot of it.</li>
            <li>These are AMAZING...compact, and all the reviews are true.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t curl as well as a complete, at-home sets but they work nicely on the go.</li>
            <li>but they really look like would be OK for travel but maybe not for every day use.</li>
            <li>Leave them in until completely cool.</li>
            <li>I bought this set of curlers to take on the road with me since they are in a nice soft carrying case.</li>
            <li>Curls come out full and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>They heat up very fast and are reasonably easy to put in.</li>
            <li>They do heat quickly, but take more like 5 min to really get uniformly heated.  </li>
            <li>The hot rollers are easy to use and don&#x27;t tangle or pull my hair</li>
            <li>but I would not recommend for continuous use as they get too hot and the clips don&#x27;t hold them well in fine hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>Super convenient product.</li>
            <li>The system heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I dont think they heat up particularly quickly, either.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are warm in just a few minutes, but if you have longer hair or want a tighter curl, the rollers need to be really warm.  </li>
            <li>I do not use the wire clips of this set but bought super clips from Conair separetly.</li>
            <li>Quick to heat, you can purchase extras of the sizes you want to customize.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and the clips hold if you put threm in correctly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the metal prongs that come with it, but bought the Conair Super Clips instead.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly.  </li>
            <li>they still fall out ... like clipping rocks to my head, also don&#x27;t get very hot</li>
            <li>even when they do, it isnt very hot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cute set; much smaller than depicted online.    </li>
            <li>Using this method, my rollers are very hot within 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>They heated up within just a few minutes and made beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li>Loved them I have long hair</li>
            <li>They warm up, but do not get anywhere near as hot as they should.</li>
            <li>I think this will work for easy to curl hair for someone looking for almost straight hair.  </li>
            <li>the rollers arrived quickly   I have fine straight hair  </li>
            <li>I love the way they make my hair look (soft &amp; full)  </li>
            <li>Instead of sticking good to my hair, i end up looking like a yak with rollers hanging loosely on my hair.</li>
            <li>These curlers work fast and really smooth out my hair and produce long-lasting curls.</li>
            <li>I agree wholeheartedy, I really dislike this type of metal holder thing myself, which is why I went out and bought a cheap set of plastic clips  to hold them to my head.</li>
            <li>Much more convenient than my old set with the plastic case (which I threw away now that I have these).</li>
            <li>IT IS WORTH</li>
            <li>If you let the cool in your hair, the curl will stay longer as they will with all hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>This may work well for many people, but I find that it leaves a frizzy kink in the ends of my hair if they are anywhere near that strip when I roll them.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not crazy about them.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy being able to throw my hair up in rollers rather than spending the extra time with the curling iron.</li>
            <li>so it didnt hold curl worth anything.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I have been using hot rollers since they first became available in the 70s,</li>
            <li>This roller set is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>They fall pretty quickly but you are still left with nice body and bouncy waves.</li>
            <li>My rollers heat very fast, and get very hot.  </li>
            <li>These rollers do not get caught, I did decide to look online and get another type of clip, after I misplaced one of the metal ones, and I think I like the \\&quot;grip\\&quot; type clips better, they are available on amazon as well, the metal clips are fine, but they sometimes take a little more time and effort to put in.&lt;br /&gt;In essence, this set heats nicely, does the job, the rollers don&#x27;t get tangled, and has not damaged my hair in anyway.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it takes up to 5 minutes to get to an ideal hot to actually curl your hair</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length and these aways give me the right amount of curl.</li>
            <li>Product came fast and well package, its a real cute travel case (im a Pink lover).</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love these rollers although they take 15 minutes to reach their full heating potential.</li>
            <li>It seems that the rollers never get hot enough, but surprisingly, if I can get them to stay in my hair, the curls are great and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>These would be great to pack and take anywhere as the case is small.  </li>
            <li>These are small, compact, and great for traveling.</li>
            <li>They worked fine, giving me great bouncy long-lasting curls even though they weren&#x27;t hot enough to singe my ears like other sets</li>
            <li>This set is great for those with above the shoulder or short hair.  </li>
            <li>After trying these rollers, in their weightless, compact, soft plastic, zippered box, I knew why I loved them back in the day.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, and work really well if you use mousse and hairspray on your hair before you roll each piece.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super compact and very convenient to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soft, compact pouch made it easy to pack.</li>
            <li>These rollers are perfect for everyday use - and especially for travel.  </li>
            <li>They probably would be great for jumbo rollers; however, they hold the medium rollers only so-so, not very tightly, and good luck getting them on the small rollers.</li>
            <li>My hair got too long since I had no time to get to the salon, I needed a way to quickly give me some curl, these are quick &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>The curls were nice but the clips were too loose</li>
            <li>I will likely let it grow and will still be able to use this set.</li>
            <li>so the rollers should definitely take more time to heat</li>
            <li>It will make my hair so much easier to maintain while I&#x27;m abroad!</li>
            <li>Can not use it and a hair dryer on the same outlet in most locations.</li>
            <li>I agree with another comment that the pins are more suitable for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the Conair Compact Hot Roller Set and love it.  </li>
            <li>Looked and worked exactly like everyone posted.</li>
            <li>this is my first time trying hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I do wish there were more of the larger sized rollers.  </li>
            <li>the price, they are ok and if you need to travel with rollers they are definitely compact.  </li>
            <li>I had given away my hot rollers years ago, but I bought these to combat the effects humidity has on my hair and I am using them every day this summer.</li>
            <li>I could use a few more curlers, but even \\&quot;loading\\&quot; a lot of hair on the rollers when they are really hot seems to be good enough to hold a curl.</li>
            <li>I do wish there were more of the larger rollers.</li>
            <li>I suggest using these immediately when hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>The first time I used them, I had to fight the impulse to buy a second set to make sure I never have to go without them.  </li>
            <li>but I read some reviews saying they are OK with short hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to try hot rollers again after years of using a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I let them heat up for 20 minutes or so to guarantee they&#x27;re plenty hot.</li>
            <li>The small case is great for travel &amp;  heat fast  </li>
            <li>You might consider ordering extra of the size you think you&#x27;ll need most if you have a lot of hair to curl.</li>
            <li>And the curls hold up pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this hot rollers set because the compact size for traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, i would recommend not to buy if its your first time.</li>
            <li>they make you buy more of the big ones separately if you want them!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>This product is compact so it can be taken every where without too much bulk!</li>
            <li>Great Curls even on thick strait hair.  </li>
            <li>I do wish there were more larger rollers.</li>
            <li>This product worked well for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>And if I heat them for even longer, like 10+ minutes, they still don&#x27;t get as hot as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Put them in from UNDER the roller, going against the direction of the curl, with the rounded end close to your scalp and the open end (bent end on top) sticking up.</li>
            <li>the curls look pretty.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get hot at all and wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get as hot as I need them to get</li>
            <li>This was my first time experimenting with hot rollers</li>
            <li>I would have preferred to have more of the bigger sizes rather than the smallest curlers.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>:  Be sure curlers are seated properly before using and keep lid zipped to heat.</li>
            <li>My hair is short, straight and very fine.</li>
            <li>There are just the right amount of rollers for a \\&quot;fast fix\\&quot; in the morning.  </li>
            <li>My fine hair stays full of body all day long (with the use of Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Spray.)  </li>
            <li>The only recommendation I would make is that more large curlers would be needed for longer hair.  </li>
            <li>... works okay to smooth out frizzy hair and give a little curl.</li>
            <li>From the negative reviews I did not expect much from these, which I bought to use for travel, but I am perfectly happy with them.</li>
            <li>These will hold a curl in my hair for a good 8 hrs without having to use any fixative, which is great, because I hate using hairspray.</li>
            <li>They take up very little space in the suitcase, so will be easy to take along on those trips requiring light packing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never like the clips that come with the hot rollers, but I bought a pack of the sleeve-type that go over the whole roller.</li>
            <li>plusses: they head up pretty fast (though I think</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great, curl my hair nicely but the clips are a little annoying keep popping off besides that they&#x27;re good</li>
            <li>My curlers arrived this morning (earlier than expected too, so that was a nice treat!)</li>
            <li>This system is compact that you can put it in a large purse or a tote bag and away you go.  </li>
            <li>It certainly out performs expectations, given what I&#x27;d read in ratings.</li>
            <li>3 jumbo, 3 large, 4 medium.  </li>
            <li>They were certainly inexpensive, as were the Curl n&#x27; Carry set, but in this case, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>The Remington set doesn&#x27;t include any as large.  </li>
            <li>The rollers warmed up nicely (need to keep the case zipped during heating process) and it curled my medium length hair the same as my regular hot curlers at home.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used them I let them heat for about ten minutes, and they were only warm to the touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure these are probably a good product for some people out there, but they&#x27;re absolute rubbish if your hair is long and thick and curly like mine.</li>
            <li>However, there seems to be no way to get them to stay in my hair (which is short and fine).</li>
            <li>But, they work so much better than any other set of hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>This is especially helpful if you have fine hair, or have problems with rollers falling out.    </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and rollers will only stay in when I purchased additional alligator clips.  </li>
            <li>There is a nice little pocket to store the clips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like the little comb along the side of the roller, its kind of cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for, and since you don&#x27;t pay for much you don&#x27;t get much out of it.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping ..</li>
            <li>While this curlers heat up fast, I find the clips they come with to be a disaster.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>I leave 2 sets in my suitcase so they are ready to travel.</li>
            <li>I have really course shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>Put them in my hair and then finish getting ready.</li>
            <li>I have it for 2 years, still very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super fast to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>if they really auto switch the voltage as indicated.  </li>
            <li>is better than 90 sec.)</li>
            <li>and they are very compact.</li>
            <li>works as described, fast shipping</li>
            <li>My hair holds a curl very well</li>
            <li>I had to hold really still</li>
            <li>On a side note: they *do* heat up fast and don&#x27;t burn my scalp (probably because they don&#x27;t spend so much time on my head, huh?).</li>
            <li>However, I really needed it when I was overseas &amp; 1/2 of it refused to heat.</li>
            <li>The metals clips hold on to the hair well if you really stick it, if not they may fall out.</li>
            <li>so I can do my whole head at once.</li>
            <li>Too much variation between sizes.  </li>
            <li>The whole unit is flimsy causing the curlers to keep falling out  of the case.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really as it appears in Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair..</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t want to pay much.</li>
            <li>They heat up really fast and along with hair spray, my hair holds the curl all day.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>It was cheaper to buy the whole set than to buy additional rollers.  </li>
            <li>Also, doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other curlers, I would say warm curlers not hot takes a while to get warm not instant by any means.</li>
            <li>If i wanted a longer lasting curl i will leave them heat up longer and leave them in a bit longer, but i only had them in for 20 min and still got nice results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this product gives you a more natural look since there are three different sizes.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, esp for the price, but I don&#x27;t think they get hot enough...</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the larger size rollers (1.25&amp;#34;) in this set are very nice, as for some reason I do not understand, it is hard to find hot rollers in that size.  </li>
            <li>and I need large, but don&#x27;t want to pay for a new set!</li>
            <li>I bought the travel rollers originally because it is a smaller container and doesn&#x27;t take up as much space in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>unlike many of the other \\&quot;travel\\&quot; size kits that i looked at, this one is truly compact.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am satisfied for what I paid.</li>
            <li>At this point I am sticking with my older ones which are very reliable.</li>
            <li>I have a medium amount of fine hair about neck-length long.</li>
            <li>Works great, curls hold and is small enough for travel.  </li>
            <li>I made sure each roller was firmly clamped/snapped into place first, as you can clearly see that they have to be, plugged them in with the case zipped and gave them a decent amount of time to heat up, probably about 10 mins or so, they might have been hot before that</li>
            <li>The pins are also very difficult to fasten, the rollers have grooves in them and everything has to be perfectly aligned to fasten.  </li>
            <li>So if you have a lot of hair like me, just start with the top half and then reheat the rollers and finish off  the bottom half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve tried that a couple times, putting in half as many rollers, and that didn&#x27;t help, either.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this set, it did not get hot enough but still managed to put a usable curl in my hair.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and are compact enough to pack in your suitcase.</li>
            <li>I bought an extra set of wire clips from my local beauty supply store that were narrower and springier - they hold much better.</li>
            <li>Like the different size rollers and quick heat up.</li>
            <li>Decent set of rollers when you consider the price.</li>
            <li>I have thick short hair, the curlers would not stay in my head and the clip to hold them would fly out of my head like missles.  </li>
            <li>Too many tiny rollers in relationship to the big ones, and</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and my hair keeps its curl the entire day.</li>
            <li>Over a year later, still using them regularly and enjoying the results.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Replacement rollers are way too high.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>love the little carrying case</li>
            <li>I love the little pocket to stash your clips in.</li>
            <li>The sizes of the rollers is limited but for a quick curl it works really well.</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up fast, and do the trick for my very straight, Asian air.</li>
            <li>I was so happy with this little Conair unit, I purchased the larger set, Conair Compact Hairsetter, Blue.  </li>
            <li>If you use a clip that is the wrong size for the roller, it will either fly across the room or</li>
            <li>So if you have thick hair, i&#x27;m pretty sure it will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;2).</li>
            <li>I have long hair and could definitely use more rollers.  </li>
            <li>All-in-all this will definitely be worth the luggage space when we head back to summer living.</li>
            <li>it is *obvious* that there are three distinct sizes.</li>
            <li>but did not like them nearly as much, as the rollers did not get hot enough, nor curl my hair well.      </li>
            <li>I remembered my old electric rollers -- they were good, but heavy, and traveling with them was a big deal.  </li>
            <li>BUT THEY DO A GOOD JOB FOR THIN HAIR.</li>
            <li>If they work for you, the only positive thing I can say is that they are very portable.  </li>
            <li>I suppose the little ones will come in handy when I get my next haircut, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got these to use with the hot roller set I already have, a full size set still never has enough rollers for my whole head, but I didn&#x27;t need 2 full size sets either, just a few extra.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be more careful when I order in the future.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of thick hair and this product give me nice soft curls.  </li>
            <li>There are not enough of the large and medium curlers and too many little ones.  </li>
            <li>curlers do not get hot enough</li>
            <li>and still they never get hot enough.....</li>
            <li>These curlers are not only a space saver, they also heat up Fast!</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up pretty quickly, especially if the pouch is zipped.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more of the small rollers.</li>
            <li>I always wanted hot rollers, but didn&#x27;t do the research necessary before I purchased.</li>
            <li>This is my second set of them (First set shorted out).</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get hot enough to hold the curl.</li>
            <li>They never seemed to get hot enough to do anything.</li>
            <li>had they gotten hot enough to use.</li>
            <li>Also, even after they&#x27;ve heated up for 10-15 minutes, they don&#x27;t seem hot enough.</li>
            <li>She has little experience so that shows how easy they are to use.</li>
            <li>I used them this evening on slightly damp hair, and got fabulous results.</li>
            <li>My old curlers had a hard top and after a few years the top got cracked then finally the whole lid broke off</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely portable that easily fits into my travel back pack</li>
            <li>All of these rollers aren&#x27;t enough to cover my whole head.</li>
            <li>only thing is my hair really didn&#x27;t holds its curl</li>
            <li>So far the rollers are performing well.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>but I really bought them for international travel.  </li>
            <li>Quite compact, but it means that you will definitely not have enough rollers to fit your entire head.</li>
            <li>I have another Conair set that are soft rollers but have just lost a couple rollers and clips over the years</li>
            <li>They heat up so fast and my curls last all day.</li>
            <li>But when they arrived, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are a bit heavy, so if you don&#x27;t secure them well with the pin, they will drop out.    </li>
            <li>Purchased this because I only needed a few rollers and thought it would be nice to have smaller set--but I would leave them heating up for over an hour</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I only needed a few rollers for the top of my hair</li>
            <li>I do not think they would work for someone with thick or curly hair as you would need more rollers.  </li>
            <li>only positive to these curlers is that they don&#x27;t take up much space, but a curling iron (which I had been using) takes up less space, works just as quickly, and actually makes my hair curly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just not hot enough; 2) the small size works well for this length of hair, but the bigger ones are probably more suitable for longer hair; 3) 10 rollers can only cover 1/3 - 1/2 of my hair</li>
            <li>Even if they fit the small rollers, which they don&#x27;t, it would be hard to fit them on rollers that are close together, because the clips are so large.    </li>
            <li>I have super thin hair, so I can get all my hair curled with one go - that may not be true for girls with thicker hair.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t get very hot at all, but the for the price it was not worth me returning.</li>
            <li>previously owned a larger set with more rollers, but there are enough rollers in this set to do the trick.</li>
            <li>The curlers don&#x27;t get hot enough to actually curl hair.  </li>
            <li>I will be looking for other travel curlers that allow my hair to lay flat and smooth against the curler when rolled up.</li>
            <li>Not only were these hot rollers inexpensive, but they heat up in a hurry and don&#x27;t monopolize the entire bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>They were just as hot as my more expensive set, all of them, and evenly heated as well.</li>
            <li>After reading mixed reviews, I had very low expectations for these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>These just don&#x27;t get very hot, so even after leaving them in over half an hour, my curls fell out as soon as the rollers came out.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old daughter has little trouble rolling her own hair with these curlers.</li>
            <li>These rollers do their job, more or less, but the problem with them is that they keep slipping out of my hair.</li>
            <li>are too small too fit on the jumbo rollers</li>
            <li>Small and light for your carry on.</li>
            <li>Also I like the idea of having a small travel option that will fit neatly in my carry on if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stick pins were a pain for me at first, but after two tries, I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>This would have been my fourth set of hot rollers and these definitely don&#x27;t get as hot as any of the other sets.</li>
            <li>I had a new haircut, slightly above shoulder length, tho</li>
            <li>I use bigger clips and not the wire ones that come with my new one.</li>
            <li>They heated up fast, and i didn&#x27;t have to leave them in for very long either</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t use the big rollers as much as they only roll my hair in, instead of making waves or curls.</li>
            <li>I chose only four stars because I would have preferred a set with all &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; rollers, and I only really need six or seven.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste time and money purchasing such a cheap item.</li>
            <li>I have thick shoulderblade-length hair, so I purchased two sets of these (I couldn&#x27;t find any other dual-voltage hot rollers that were this well-priced) and they were more than enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>My only concerns would be that with only ten roller I am only able to do half of my head at a time.</li>
            <li>only reason I give these rollers 4/5 stars is because the curls don&#x27;t have a major WOW factor.  </li>
            <li>Protective, but soft and squishy enough to shove in a bag.</li>
            <li>rollers and will go back to the soft rollers.</li>
            <li>They create tons of volume and the different variety of roller sizes makes for a natural looking head of curls.</li>
            <li>so when I blow dry it myself it is a little frizzy/not smooth.</li>
            <li>i have used other hot rollers in the pass they all clip in about the same  </li>
            <li>The amount of curlers are not enough if you have long hair, only has three large curlers.  </li>
            <li>Im using for a 3 month trip to Europe this summer,  heat up quickly, doesnt tangle hair and gives long lasting soft tight curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast while you have your haired rolled up it gives you the opportunity to do other things.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; rollers are 1 inch, the size of my medium curling are and there are only 3 of them I would call the other sizes Large and Jumbo.  </li>
            <li>I am no pro with hot rollers and I curl my hair in less than 5 mins!</li>
            <li>They do curl pretty well, but because of the little strip of pegs, the curls don&#x27;t come out as even or soft-looking as they do with my larger set of flocked curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not sure if this is the right one</li>
            <li>The price was right and compact for traveling or small spaces.</li>
            <li>I can barely wrap my short hair over the middle size and not at all around the largest size.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I should have ignored the negative reviews and not bought the Conair super clips to go with them, because they are not needed.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because summers I live on a boat with limited space and only occasional need for hair styling</li>
            <li>I looked quite a long time for rollers since I was due for new ones and my old Conair ones where shot after 2o+ years of using.</li>
            <li>I live in an apartment with a small bathroom, and simply wanted a small unit that was easy to tuck away and store.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it for travel, but for every day use and it fits easily in the bathroom and would certainly travel well, the metal clips are in a little inner slot behind the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do however, have fine, thin hair, so while 10 rollers are just right, I&#x27;m not going to say they&#x27;d be enough for someone with a head of thick hair.</li>

            <li> I would say that I got a better result when I curled my hair over night but the curls were great.</li>
            <li> and i love this product all three sizes of roller form a beautiful curl that lasts all day and when youe sleep in them in the morning you have a nice wave.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a cute set a friend of mine bought second-hand that inspired me to buy these, but they&#x27;re not the great set to compare to that.</li>
            <li> They warm up quickly and are the perfect size for storage and travel.</li>

            <li> Works great, easy to pack for trips.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to know the sizes of rollers.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact for use while traveling.</li>
            <li> They do produce a nice wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I own 5 sets of these.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact.</li>
            <li> It might just depend on your preference though and what kind of effect you are going for.</li>
            <li> so I have just been using my own.</li>
            <li> I was planning on taking them on a business trip since the size is so nice and compact, but I&#x27;ll have to stick with my curling iron.</li>
            <li> You should feel them kind of snap in place.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the popular [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I travel a lot, and these will fit nicely into my suitcase as well !</li>
            <li> Great size for when I have to travel and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly and great for travel.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are great for traveling and heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> Other than that these are great rollers for an awesome price.</li>
            <li> They are very good for travel or fast touch ups</li>
            <li> Took this product on an international trip and it was perfect when using a converter/adapter and it fits nicely in your travel bags.  </li>
            <li> and I liked better in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just took these hot rollers on a vacation to Paris and they are compact and great for traveling (dual voltage).</li>
            <li> A great buy for travel hot rollers.</li>
            <li> The size of the rollers is nice and compact and you can easily travel with them.  </li>
            <li> plastic zipper bag makes it much more convenient to travel with than one of those bulky plastic boxes.</li>
            <li> I like them MUCH more than the hair clamps because, unlike the clamps, the pins don&#x27;t leave kinks and dents in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers, heat up quick,nice for travel.</li>
            <li> they are ok.....</li>
            <li> This is an excellent system for short hair gals.  </li>
            <li> I found this system to be excellent and would advise anyone with short hair to get this.</li>
            <li> I thought these rollers were really cute</li>
            <li> You spend more time fiddling with the curlers and clips that you might as well curl your hair with a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li> I found that by heating them 10 minutes or more, they work much better.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t image getting more from something pricier.</li>
            <li> With that addition I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent buy and the product does the job.</li>
            <li> I could imagine wearing there&#x27;s curlers for more than 20 minutes without getting a headache.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> reading many reviews I purchased this set.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and these make the most of what I have.  </li>
            <li> More for straightening than curling.</li>
            <li> The metal holders that hole the rollers is not my favorite</li>
            <li> When the UPS guy handed me the box, I couldn&#x27;t believe how light it was!  </li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li> I use just four rollers in the top of my hair</li>
            <li> I love these hit rollers.</li>
            <li> This is a great, very compact set.</li>
            <li> I love that it has dual voltage</li>
            <li> I enjoy it every time I use it!</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I had a lot more hair, they&#x27;d stay in better, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Maybe if they came with twice as many clips, and I put two on each roller instead of one?</li>
            <li> Also I think this set heats more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Conair products for many of my 59 years</li>
            <li> The grip on the rollers is great -- it really holds the hair in place -- and</li>
            <li> the kind that would fit over the roller entirely..referred as alligator clips sometimes...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d pay more than that for a premium martini.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d pay more than that for a premium martini.</li>
            <li> the clips have nothing to do with the performance of the product, the product is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I like the 12-pack travel rollers from Conair much better.</li>
            <li> much more secure/tight.  </li>
            <li> but okay for the price.</li>
            <li> love this product/fabulous</li>
            <li> I WISH THE CLIPS STAYED IN BETTER</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I put one in my carry-on and one in my checked bag to be safe</li>
            <li> This is great for travel as very compact.</li>
            <li> The reviews were pretty good, too.</li>
            <li> It is most important to make sure they are seated on the element correctly.</li>
            <li> They heat quickly, stay hot plenty of time to do the job, and are in a compact case that will be great for travel.</li>
            <li> The soft case makes them very easy to tuck into a suitcase, and they do a good job of heating up in 90 seconds as promised in the instructions.</li>
            <li> I love this hot curler and use it all the time, it&#x27;s nice and compact for travel too.</li>
            <li> On top of that, they aren&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Still and all, it&#x27;s great to have for the modest price.</li>
            <li> I love using the Conair Instant Heat Compact Rollers.&lt;br /&gt;It heats at the right temperature and curls great!</li>
            <li> These hot roller heat up very fast and do a great job.</li>
            <li> Also there is nothing to cover the roller when it is on your hair so the heat escapes very quickly.</li>
            <li> They heat and curl very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Compact and easy to store or take in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> curl lasts all day and the comb type grabbers in each roller makes for easy roll-up.</li>
            <li> use at home now because the size is so easy to use and put away.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> They are compact and the design of the curler goes into your hair easily.</li>
            <li> I found they heated very quickly .</li>
            <li> The Conair HS10W hot rollers heat up quickly and provide good curl</li>
            <li> These work pretty good for being so small, I was impressed.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> Results are great, full body and soft curls.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t manage these on my fine head of hair.</li>
            <li> Ended up returning these and just using my trusty curling iron for the hairdo, and it worked out fine.</li>
            <li> I had reservations about plastic curlers but these are fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> The wire clips work just fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the rollers did not stay in place</li>
            <li> Compact, comfortable, packs light, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Heat up super quick and super cute packaging too!</li>
            <li> I ordered extra large rollers because they work the best for me.</li>
            <li> may even order a second set of the medium sized one, they give super good curls to the hair!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want something huge that takes up all my counter space.</li>
            <li> Personally, this was a really great buy</li>
            <li> I thought that it would be a great time saver since i wouldn&#x27;t have to sit with the iron in my hand the entire time because I have a lot of hair and it takes forever to curl.</li>
            <li> So I bought the Conair Proclips, which are supposed to fit any size curler.</li>
            <li> Considering the fact that these are compact If you want to do your whole head you have to warm them up twice.</li>
            <li> These will fit in an 8&amp;#34; x 5&amp;#34; spot in your drawer or suitcase when you travel.  </li>
            <li> My stylist confirmed that Velro rollers don&#x27;t ruin your hair.</li>
            <li> but I could still use them, or it still worked, its just that I needed an updated one that fit my needs.</li>
            <li> Great product overall.</li>
            <li> This item is more a child&#x27;s toy than a useful toy.  </li>
            <li> A cheap set...</li>
            <li> but I never got a good bouncy head of softly curled hair out of these.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t needed heated rollers for many years and was reluctant to spend much money on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would use.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Velcro rollers are far superior.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s of good quality, and has enough rollers to accommodate most heads of hair.</li>
            <li> I would of loved it if had just more space to accomodate the medium and larger rollers.  </li>
            <li> Great size for travel but don&#x27;t do the job - should be simple to design a better hot roller.</li>
            <li> Curling iron or a better brand of hot rollers might be more useful than this one.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and they are easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I found that it takes 5 minutes or more to get them consistently hot.     </li>
            <li> Most travel hot rollers are two sizes.</li>
            <li> : They&#x27;re small, they&#x27;re designed well, they&#x27;re perfect for travel (with dual voltage too!)</li>
            <li> : They&#x27;re small, they&#x27;re designed well, they&#x27;re perfect for travel (with dual voltage too!)</li>
            <li> you have thicker or less fine hair that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;kink\\&quot; easily, then these will probably work great.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast and provide great soft curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Conair products and was exciting about finding hot rollers with both jumbo and large sizes.</li>
            <li> and so I just put these curlers in for about 1 minute and my hair is curled very nicely, if I leave them in too long its way to curly.</li>
            <li> Would love to see a set with 8 large, but haven&#x27;t found yet.</li>
            <li> I like to use those better than the large.</li>
            <li> so I bought another set to get more of the medium and large rollers.</li>
            <li> It most certainly did,</li>
            <li> I am able to curl all my hair with the 3 medium, and 3 large rollers.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Conair, for doing this right!</li>
            <li> the record, my hair is right at shoulder length and baby fine, and there&#x27;s a lot of it.</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING...compact, and all the reviews are true.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t curl as well as a complete, at-home sets but they work nicely on the go.</li>
            <li> but they really look like would be OK for travel but maybe not for every day use.</li>
            <li> Leave them in until completely cool.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of curlers to take on the road with me since they are in a nice soft carrying case.</li>
            <li> Curls come out full and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> They heat up very fast and are reasonably easy to put in.</li>
            <li> They do heat quickly, but take more like 5 min to really get uniformly heated.  </li>
            <li> The hot rollers are easy to use and don&#x27;t tangle or pull my hair</li>
            <li> but I would not recommend for continuous use as they get too hot and the clips don&#x27;t hold them well in fine hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> Super convenient product.</li>
            <li> The system heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I dont think they heat up particularly quickly, either.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are warm in just a few minutes, but if you have longer hair or want a tighter curl, the rollers need to be really warm.  </li>
            <li> I do not use the wire clips of this set but bought super clips from Conair separetly.</li>
            <li> Quick to heat, you can purchase extras of the sizes you want to customize.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and the clips hold if you put threm in correctly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the metal prongs that come with it, but bought the Conair Super Clips instead.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly.  </li>
            <li> they still fall out ... like clipping rocks to my head, also don&#x27;t get very hot</li>
            <li> even when they do, it isnt very hot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very cute set; much smaller than depicted online.    </li>
            <li> Using this method, my rollers are very hot within 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> They heated up within just a few minutes and made beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li> Loved them I have long hair</li>
            <li> They warm up, but do not get anywhere near as hot as they should.</li>
            <li> I think this will work for easy to curl hair for someone looking for almost straight hair.  </li>
            <li> the rollers arrived quickly   I have fine straight hair  </li>
            <li> I love the way they make my hair look (soft &amp; full)  </li>
            <li> Instead of sticking good to my hair, i end up looking like a yak with rollers hanging loosely on my hair.</li>
            <li> These curlers work fast and really smooth out my hair and produce long-lasting curls.</li>
            <li> I agree wholeheartedy, I really dislike this type of metal holder thing myself, which is why I went out and bought a cheap set of plastic clips  to hold them to my head.</li>
            <li> Much more convenient than my old set with the plastic case (which I threw away now that I have these).</li>
            <li> IT IS WORTH</li>
            <li> If you let the cool in your hair, the curl will stay longer as they will with all hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> This may work well for many people, but I find that it leaves a frizzy kink in the ends of my hair if they are anywhere near that strip when I roll them.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not crazy about them.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy being able to throw my hair up in rollers rather than spending the extra time with the curling iron.</li>
            <li> so it didnt hold curl worth anything.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have been using hot rollers since they first became available in the 70s,</li>
            <li> This roller set is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> They fall pretty quickly but you are still left with nice body and bouncy waves.</li>
            <li> My rollers heat very fast, and get very hot.  </li>
            <li> These rollers do not get caught, I did decide to look online and get another type of clip, after I misplaced one of the metal ones, and I think I like the \\&quot;grip\\&quot; type clips better, they are available on amazon as well, the metal clips are fine, but they sometimes take a little more time and effort to put in.&lt;br /&gt;In essence, this set heats nicely, does the job, the rollers don&#x27;t get tangled, and has not damaged my hair in anyway.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it takes up to 5 minutes to get to an ideal hot to actually curl your hair</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and these aways give me the right amount of curl.</li>
            <li> Product came fast and well package, its a real cute travel case (im a Pink lover).</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love these rollers although they take 15 minutes to reach their full heating potential.</li>
            <li> It seems that the rollers never get hot enough, but surprisingly, if I can get them to stay in my hair, the curls are great and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> These would be great to pack and take anywhere as the case is small.  </li>
            <li> These are small, compact, and great for traveling.</li>
            <li> They worked fine, giving me great bouncy long-lasting curls even though they weren&#x27;t hot enough to singe my ears like other sets</li>
            <li> This set is great for those with above the shoulder or short hair.  </li>
            <li> After trying these rollers, in their weightless, compact, soft plastic, zippered box, I knew why I loved them back in the day.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, and work really well if you use mousse and hairspray on your hair before you roll each piece.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super compact and very convenient to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soft, compact pouch made it easy to pack.</li>
            <li> These rollers are perfect for everyday use - and especially for travel.  </li>
            <li> They probably would be great for jumbo rollers; however, they hold the medium rollers only so-so, not very tightly, and good luck getting them on the small rollers.</li>
            <li> My hair got too long since I had no time to get to the salon, I needed a way to quickly give me some curl, these are quick &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> The curls were nice but the clips were too loose</li>
            <li> I will likely let it grow and will still be able to use this set.</li>
            <li> so the rollers should definitely take more time to heat</li>
            <li> It will make my hair so much easier to maintain while I&#x27;m abroad!</li>
            <li> Can not use it and a hair dryer on the same outlet in most locations.</li>
            <li> I agree with another comment that the pins are more suitable for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Conair Compact Hot Roller Set and love it.  </li>
            <li> Looked and worked exactly like everyone posted.</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I do wish there were more of the larger sized rollers.  </li>
            <li> the price, they are ok and if you need to travel with rollers they are definitely compact.  </li>
            <li> I had given away my hot rollers years ago, but I bought these to combat the effects humidity has on my hair and I am using them every day this summer.</li>
            <li> I could use a few more curlers, but even \\&quot;loading\\&quot; a lot of hair on the rollers when they are really hot seems to be good enough to hold a curl.</li>
            <li> I do wish there were more of the larger rollers.</li>
            <li> I suggest using these immediately when hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> The first time I used them, I had to fight the impulse to buy a second set to make sure I never have to go without them.  </li>
            <li> but I read some reviews saying they are OK with short hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to try hot rollers again after years of using a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I let them heat up for 20 minutes or so to guarantee they&#x27;re plenty hot.</li>
            <li> The small case is great for travel &amp;  heat fast  </li>
            <li> You might consider ordering extra of the size you think you&#x27;ll need most if you have a lot of hair to curl.</li>
            <li> And the curls hold up pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this hot rollers set because the compact size for traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, i would recommend not to buy if its your first time.</li>
            <li> they make you buy more of the big ones separately if you want them!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product is compact so it can be taken every where without too much bulk!</li>
            <li> Great Curls even on thick strait hair.  </li>
            <li> I do wish there were more larger rollers.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> And if I heat them for even longer, like 10+ minutes, they still don&#x27;t get as hot as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Put them in from UNDER the roller, going against the direction of the curl, with the rounded end close to your scalp and the open end (bent end on top) sticking up.</li>
            <li> the curls look pretty.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get hot at all and wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get as hot as I need them to get</li>
            <li> This was my first time experimenting with hot rollers</li>
            <li> I would have preferred to have more of the bigger sizes rather than the smallest curlers.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> :  Be sure curlers are seated properly before using and keep lid zipped to heat.</li>
            <li> My hair is short, straight and very fine.</li>
            <li> There are just the right amount of rollers for a \\&quot;fast fix\\&quot; in the morning.  </li>
            <li> My fine hair stays full of body all day long (with the use of Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Spray.)  </li>
            <li> The only recommendation I would make is that more large curlers would be needed for longer hair.  </li>
            <li> ... works okay to smooth out frizzy hair and give a little curl.</li>
            <li> From the negative reviews I did not expect much from these, which I bought to use for travel, but I am perfectly happy with them.</li>
            <li> These will hold a curl in my hair for a good 8 hrs without having to use any fixative, which is great, because I hate using hairspray.</li>
            <li> They take up very little space in the suitcase, so will be easy to take along on those trips requiring light packing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never like the clips that come with the hot rollers, but I bought a pack of the sleeve-type that go over the whole roller.</li>
            <li> plusses: they head up pretty fast (though I think</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great, curl my hair nicely but the clips are a little annoying keep popping off besides that they&#x27;re good</li>
            <li> My curlers arrived this morning (earlier than expected too, so that was a nice treat!)</li>
            <li> This system is compact that you can put it in a large purse or a tote bag and away you go.  </li>
            <li> It certainly out performs expectations, given what I&#x27;d read in ratings.</li>
            <li> 3 jumbo, 3 large, 4 medium.  </li>
            <li> They were certainly inexpensive, as were the Curl n&#x27; Carry set, but in this case, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> The Remington set doesn&#x27;t include any as large.  </li>
            <li> The rollers warmed up nicely (need to keep the case zipped during heating process) and it curled my medium length hair the same as my regular hot curlers at home.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used them I let them heat for about ten minutes, and they were only warm to the touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these are probably a good product for some people out there, but they&#x27;re absolute rubbish if your hair is long and thick and curly like mine.</li>
            <li> However, there seems to be no way to get them to stay in my hair (which is short and fine).</li>
            <li> But, they work so much better than any other set of hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This is especially helpful if you have fine hair, or have problems with rollers falling out.    </li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and rollers will only stay in when I purchased additional alligator clips.  </li>
            <li> There is a nice little pocket to store the clips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like the little comb along the side of the roller, its kind of cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for, and since you don&#x27;t pay for much you don&#x27;t get much out of it.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping ..</li>
            <li> While this curlers heat up fast, I find the clips they come with to be a disaster.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> I leave 2 sets in my suitcase so they are ready to travel.</li>
            <li> I have really course shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> Put them in my hair and then finish getting ready.</li>
            <li> I have it for 2 years, still very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super fast to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> if they really auto switch the voltage as indicated.  </li>
            <li> is better than 90 sec.)</li>
            <li> and they are very compact.</li>
            <li> works as described, fast shipping</li>
            <li> My hair holds a curl very well</li>
            <li> I had to hold really still</li>
            <li> On a side note: they *do* heat up fast and don&#x27;t burn my scalp (probably because they don&#x27;t spend so much time on my head, huh?).</li>
            <li> However, I really needed it when I was overseas &amp; 1/2 of it refused to heat.</li>
            <li> The metals clips hold on to the hair well if you really stick it, if not they may fall out.</li>
            <li> so I can do my whole head at once.</li>
            <li> Too much variation between sizes.  </li>
            <li> The whole unit is flimsy causing the curlers to keep falling out  of the case.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really as it appears in Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair..</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want to pay much.</li>
            <li> They heat up really fast and along with hair spray, my hair holds the curl all day.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> It was cheaper to buy the whole set than to buy additional rollers.  </li>
            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other curlers, I would say warm curlers not hot takes a while to get warm not instant by any means.</li>
            <li> If i wanted a longer lasting curl i will leave them heat up longer and leave them in a bit longer, but i only had them in for 20 min and still got nice results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this product gives you a more natural look since there are three different sizes.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, esp for the price, but I don&#x27;t think they get hot enough...</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the larger size rollers (1.25&amp;#34;) in this set are very nice, as for some reason I do not understand, it is hard to find hot rollers in that size.  </li>
            <li> and I need large, but don&#x27;t want to pay for a new set!</li>
            <li> I bought the travel rollers originally because it is a smaller container and doesn&#x27;t take up as much space in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> unlike many of the other \\&quot;travel\\&quot; size kits that i looked at, this one is truly compact.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am satisfied for what I paid.</li>
            <li> At this point I am sticking with my older ones which are very reliable.</li>
            <li> I have a medium amount of fine hair about neck-length long.</li>
            <li> Works great, curls hold and is small enough for travel.  </li>
            <li> I made sure each roller was firmly clamped/snapped into place first, as you can clearly see that they have to be, plugged them in with the case zipped and gave them a decent amount of time to heat up, probably about 10 mins or so, they might have been hot before that</li>
            <li> The pins are also very difficult to fasten, the rollers have grooves in them and everything has to be perfectly aligned to fasten.  </li>
            <li> So if you have a lot of hair like me, just start with the top half and then reheat the rollers and finish off  the bottom half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve tried that a couple times, putting in half as many rollers, and that didn&#x27;t help, either.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this set, it did not get hot enough but still managed to put a usable curl in my hair.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and are compact enough to pack in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> I bought an extra set of wire clips from my local beauty supply store that were narrower and springier - they hold much better.</li>
            <li> Like the different size rollers and quick heat up.</li>
            <li> Decent set of rollers when you consider the price.</li>
            <li> I have thick short hair, the curlers would not stay in my head and the clip to hold them would fly out of my head like missles.  </li>
            <li> Too many tiny rollers in relationship to the big ones, and</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and my hair keeps its curl the entire day.</li>
            <li> Over a year later, still using them regularly and enjoying the results.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Replacement rollers are way too high.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> love the little carrying case</li>
            <li> I love the little pocket to stash your clips in.</li>
            <li> The sizes of the rollers is limited but for a quick curl it works really well.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up fast, and do the trick for my very straight, Asian air.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this little Conair unit, I purchased the larger set, Conair Compact Hairsetter, Blue.  </li>
            <li> If you use a clip that is the wrong size for the roller, it will either fly across the room or</li>
            <li> So if you have thick hair, i&#x27;m pretty sure it will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;2).</li>
            <li> I have long hair and could definitely use more rollers.  </li>
            <li> All-in-all this will definitely be worth the luggage space when we head back to summer living.</li>
            <li> it is *obvious* that there are three distinct sizes.</li>
            <li> but did not like them nearly as much, as the rollers did not get hot enough, nor curl my hair well.      </li>
            <li> I remembered my old electric rollers -- they were good, but heavy, and traveling with them was a big deal.  </li>
            <li> BUT THEY DO A GOOD JOB FOR THIN HAIR.</li>
            <li> If they work for you, the only positive thing I can say is that they are very portable.  </li>
            <li> I suppose the little ones will come in handy when I get my next haircut, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got these to use with the hot roller set I already have, a full size set still never has enough rollers for my whole head, but I didn&#x27;t need 2 full size sets either, just a few extra.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be more careful when I order in the future.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick hair and this product give me nice soft curls.  </li>
            <li> There are not enough of the large and medium curlers and too many little ones.  </li>
            <li> curlers do not get hot enough</li>
            <li> and still they never get hot enough.....</li>
            <li> These curlers are not only a space saver, they also heat up Fast!</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up pretty quickly, especially if the pouch is zipped.</li>
            <li> I wish it had more of the small rollers.</li>
            <li> I always wanted hot rollers, but didn&#x27;t do the research necessary before I purchased.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of them (First set shorted out).</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get hot enough to hold the curl.</li>
            <li> They never seemed to get hot enough to do anything.</li>
            <li> had they gotten hot enough to use.</li>
            <li> Also, even after they&#x27;ve heated up for 10-15 minutes, they don&#x27;t seem hot enough.</li>
            <li> She has little experience so that shows how easy they are to use.</li>
            <li> I used them this evening on slightly damp hair, and got fabulous results.</li>
            <li> My old curlers had a hard top and after a few years the top got cracked then finally the whole lid broke off</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely portable that easily fits into my travel back pack</li>
            <li> All of these rollers aren&#x27;t enough to cover my whole head.</li>
            <li> only thing is my hair really didn&#x27;t holds its curl</li>
            <li> So far the rollers are performing well.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> but I really bought them for international travel.  </li>
            <li> Quite compact, but it means that you will definitely not have enough rollers to fit your entire head.</li>
            <li> I have another Conair set that are soft rollers but have just lost a couple rollers and clips over the years</li>
            <li> They heat up so fast and my curls last all day.</li>
            <li> But when they arrived, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are a bit heavy, so if you don&#x27;t secure them well with the pin, they will drop out.    </li>
            <li> Purchased this because I only needed a few rollers and thought it would be nice to have smaller set--but I would leave them heating up for over an hour</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I only needed a few rollers for the top of my hair</li>
            <li> I do not think they would work for someone with thick or curly hair as you would need more rollers.  </li>
            <li> only positive to these curlers is that they don&#x27;t take up much space, but a curling iron (which I had been using) takes up less space, works just as quickly, and actually makes my hair curly.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not hot enough; 2) the small size works well for this length of hair, but the bigger ones are probably more suitable for longer hair; 3) 10 rollers can only cover 1/3 - 1/2 of my hair</li>
            <li> Even if they fit the small rollers, which they don&#x27;t, it would be hard to fit them on rollers that are close together, because the clips are so large.    </li>
            <li> I have super thin hair, so I can get all my hair curled with one go - that may not be true for girls with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t get very hot at all, but the for the price it was not worth me returning.</li>
            <li> previously owned a larger set with more rollers, but there are enough rollers in this set to do the trick.</li>
            <li> The curlers don&#x27;t get hot enough to actually curl hair.  </li>
            <li> I will be looking for other travel curlers that allow my hair to lay flat and smooth against the curler when rolled up.</li>
            <li> Not only were these hot rollers inexpensive, but they heat up in a hurry and don&#x27;t monopolize the entire bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> They were just as hot as my more expensive set, all of them, and evenly heated as well.</li>
            <li> After reading mixed reviews, I had very low expectations for these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> These just don&#x27;t get very hot, so even after leaving them in over half an hour, my curls fell out as soon as the rollers came out.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter has little trouble rolling her own hair with these curlers.</li>
            <li> These rollers do their job, more or less, but the problem with them is that they keep slipping out of my hair.</li>
            <li> are too small too fit on the jumbo rollers</li>
            <li> Small and light for your carry on.</li>
            <li> Also I like the idea of having a small travel option that will fit neatly in my carry on if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stick pins were a pain for me at first, but after two tries, I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> This would have been my fourth set of hot rollers and these definitely don&#x27;t get as hot as any of the other sets.</li>
            <li> I had a new haircut, slightly above shoulder length, tho</li>
            <li> I use bigger clips and not the wire ones that come with my new one.</li>
            <li> They heated up fast, and i didn&#x27;t have to leave them in for very long either</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t use the big rollers as much as they only roll my hair in, instead of making waves or curls.</li>
            <li> I chose only four stars because I would have preferred a set with all &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; rollers, and I only really need six or seven.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time and money purchasing such a cheap item.</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulderblade-length hair, so I purchased two sets of these (I couldn&#x27;t find any other dual-voltage hot rollers that were this well-priced) and they were more than enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> My only concerns would be that with only ten roller I am only able to do half of my head at a time.</li>
            <li> only reason I give these rollers 4/5 stars is because the curls don&#x27;t have a major WOW factor.  </li>
            <li> Protective, but soft and squishy enough to shove in a bag.</li>
            <li> rollers and will go back to the soft rollers.</li>
            <li> They create tons of volume and the different variety of roller sizes makes for a natural looking head of curls.</li>
            <li> so when I blow dry it myself it is a little frizzy/not smooth.</li>
            <li> i have used other hot rollers in the pass they all clip in about the same  </li>
            <li> The amount of curlers are not enough if you have long hair, only has three large curlers.  </li>
            <li> Im using for a 3 month trip to Europe this summer,  heat up quickly, doesnt tangle hair and gives long lasting soft tight curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast while you have your haired rolled up it gives you the opportunity to do other things.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; rollers are 1 inch, the size of my medium curling are and there are only 3 of them I would call the other sizes Large and Jumbo.  </li>
            <li> I am no pro with hot rollers and I curl my hair in less than 5 mins!</li>
            <li> They do curl pretty well, but because of the little strip of pegs, the curls don&#x27;t come out as even or soft-looking as they do with my larger set of flocked curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this is the right one</li>
            <li> The price was right and compact for traveling or small spaces.</li>
            <li> I can barely wrap my short hair over the middle size and not at all around the largest size.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I should have ignored the negative reviews and not bought the Conair super clips to go with them, because they are not needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because summers I live on a boat with limited space and only occasional need for hair styling</li>
            <li> I looked quite a long time for rollers since I was due for new ones and my old Conair ones where shot after 2o+ years of using.</li>
            <li> I live in an apartment with a small bathroom, and simply wanted a small unit that was easy to tuck away and store.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it for travel, but for every day use and it fits easily in the bathroom and would certainly travel well, the metal clips are in a little inner slot behind the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do however, have fine, thin hair, so while 10 rollers are just right, I&#x27;m not going to say they&#x27;d be enough for someone with a head of thick hair.</li>
            <li> Curlers not small enough for short hair, takes a little practice.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really straight, so i was skeptical if this would work, since its my first time with curls.</li>
            <li> The only minor issue is that there&#x27;s no place to segregate the differently sized clips</li>
            <li> The rollers are durable, and come in three sizes: 4 small (3/4 inch), 3 medium (1 inch), and 3 large (1.25 inch).  </li>
            <li> I used to roll my hair everyday in high school.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To address the common complaints: The rollers do not have to feel blazing hot to your hand in order to work.</li>
            <li> Curls are long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I like the way the crown doesn&#x27;t go flat anymore.  </li>
            <li> The number of rollers were enough for my long hair</li>
            <li> I have fairly short, thick, straight hair (above my shoulders).</li>
            <li> Wish these had a little more heat to them, but for my nieces thin hair, they worked for what we wanted them for.</li>
            <li> i have a lot of hair...and based on all the other reviews, the girls with less hair aren&#x27;t having that much luck with theirs.</li>
            <li> These curlers aren&#x27;t expensive, and they are compact and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> The clip storage is a little awkward, so I stashed the clips in a little box next to the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;The case is compact enough for travel, another boon, and the large, med and small sizes come in the right distribution for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Because it was difficult for me to secure big rollers - due to the fact that I couldn&#x27;t roll my short hair multi times around the roller and therefore the thickness wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> If the rollers are loose, they will not heat properly.</li>
            <li> For the short hair in back, I may use still other clips with long teeth that clamp around the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointing for sure.</li>
            <li> Does take awhile to heat up and curls don&#x27;t hold that long.</li>
            <li> So it took me 25 - 30 minutes to curl all my hair, which is way too long.</li>
            <li> Voltage isn&#x27;t a problem overseas as long as you have the adaptors.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that hits mid-shoulder.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re constantly slipping out and I&#x27;m always having to roll them back up again.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a minor issue.</li>
            <li> I usually use these when I am not happy with how my blowdry comes out or if I just want a different look that is easy maintenance.  </li>
            <li> The curler holders do not come &amp;#34;color coded&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s not easy to pick which pins to use for the proper curlers (there&#x27;s not a big visual difference for the holders on the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; rollers from the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; rollers.)  </li>
            <li> but I have found they never really hot enough to make any difference.  </li>
            <li> Ten rollers come in a pack with ten round pins that correspond to the sizes of the curlers.</li>
            <li> I like this little set but would find it a lot handier if a person could get all small rollers, medium, large or a mix.  </li>
            <li> I was really confused between a curling iron and a hot roller.</li>
            <li> However, the curlers don&#x27;t stay on the stems, so I&#x27;m constantly having to push them down to heat up after the slightest jarring.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the rollers are not perfectly round; they are slightly oval due to the strip of teeth on one side.  </li>
            <li> I have thick straight Asian hair that is not easy to curl.</li>
            <li> You have the following;  4 small rollers  5 medium rollers  and 3 big rollers.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a small set that would be similar since I burned out my last set of Curl n&#x27; Carry and can&#x27;t find them anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I found the clips included to be too large and inflexible.</li>
            <li> A little above shoulder.</li>
            <li> Further, the non-round shape makes it a little harder to get the clips around the curlers.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair past your shoulders, you may want a different one or you might have to get 2 sets.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m frankly surprised at all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> bought this set because I will be going to Europe in a few weeks for a musical tour with my choir and orchestra.</li>
            <li> You must keep the carry bag closed and the rollers retain the heat.  </li>
            <li> hair is on the Thick side, so i was skeptical that there may not be enough curlers for all of my hair, but they worked out fabulous.</li>
            <li> I had the lid closed when heating, too.</li>
            <li> Go to your local beauty supply  and for a few dollars purchase plastic clips..</li>
            <li> When I heat the rollers, I keep the case and lid closed.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use rollers very hard and dont get hot enough to set your hair and the clips leave a dent in your hair.</li>
            <li> I had the Conair Curl n&#x27;Carry set previously - bought about 4 of them over a long stretch of years.  </li>
            <li> and I had to re-heat / roll again to other area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works and it&#x27;s small enough to travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the order slip form it came with to purchase refills is still valid, so I may just have to buy a second set.</li>
            <li> Love the size of the unit, so I am disappointed they won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> AND THEY ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO TRAVEL WITH.  </li>
            <li> These curlers are not perfectly round - they are slightly oval in shape to accommodate a strip of small little pegs which are supposed to help grip the hair.</li>
            <li> Keep the rollers in the pink travel bag and keep the lid down while heating and in between using the rollers.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was, they&#x27;re very heavy.</li>
            <li> But I am so disappointed in them as far as they do not get hot.</li>
            <li> Just received today rollers are fine but the clips are really bad</li>
            <li> The smallest size is not really useful</li>
            <li> Really this was a random purchase.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the pins.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, past my arm pits, of medium thickness.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the holders.</li>
            <li> Not worth the frustration in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the sizes of the curlers.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> I deducted one star because you have to pay some attention to the roller base, and make sure each roller is pushed down onto it&#x27;s heating element.    </li>
            <li> All fits in the carry case and then down into my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Leave the cover down while they heat up, which they do in 90 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> Small are too small but enough of the other sizes to work for me.  </li>
            <li> I purchased them a few weeks ago and the past weekend I finally opened the box and started to use them, however there were NO clips in box or anywhere inside the little pouch.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I have a slight wave, silky textured hair, if that is helpful to know.</li>
            <li> It heat up in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and these rollers are too small and too few.</li>
            <li> I would reccommed to anyone who does not wnat the typical shir;y temple spiral curls</li>
            <li> i was shocked to see how small and easy to carry it is.</li>
            <li> I have long layered medium length thick hair ...</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick, so I was concerned about how well they would do.  </li>
            <li> To replace large ones with small ones it is less expensive to just buy another set.  </li>
            <li> After reading previous reviews I was a little apprehensive to order this set.  </li>
            <li> The curlers are heavy, so when you roll them in your hair, they weigh down the hair on the crown of your head.  </li>
            <li> but next time ill leave them in even long  to see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> so I sort them before I start rolling and lay in them in little groups on the counter.</li>
            <li> I have had this product a little over 24 months</li>
            <li> i need little to no hairspray to keep the curls</li>
            <li> These rollers are moderately comfortable the pins are uncomfortable if you put them in wrong.</li>
            <li> Curlers are so heavy ...</li>
            <li> Even though they were inexpensive, they were still a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The weight of the rollers are too heavy on your head.</li>
            <li> I have used these for quit a few years....</li>
            <li> and I wish it came with a few extras.</li>
            <li> After a few times they get easier to keep in</li>
            <li> ( i get impatient )  </li>
            <li> I was missing some clips</li>
            <li> I researched a bit and after reading a few reviews, ordered this product.</li>
            <li> If the pin does not secure my roller</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, the 90 seconds is not accurate.  </li>
            <li> im assuming that the girls with less hair didn&#x27;t like the fact that the set came with pins, but i did!</li>
            <li> so if you purchase know that you will need to purchase other clips so this hardly a deal  because of the added expense.</li>
            <li> I saw other reviews where people complained about the pins.  </li>
            <li> The metal clips that came with them worked only when stuck in at odd and uncomfortable angles, and I could have used a curling iron in the amount of time it took to get them in.</li>
            <li> I dont know if its that the heat is uneven or, or maybe the rollers are too small, or what,</li>
            <li> OK if you are desperately looking for set to travel with, but basically disappointing.</li>
            <li> Also, the pins are hard to access in the little pocket inside.  </li>
            <li> They take up very little space.  </li>
            <li> Very little to no heat.</li>
            <li> but I guess might be to travel as it is small</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to place the curlers on the heating platform to ensure they have proper contact with the heating</li>
            <li> I like the small size of this set for traveling and it works well too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a small set.</li>
            <li> It works well if you understand it&#x27;s a small travel case.</li>
            <li> I could do without the four small ones, but I make do.</li>
            <li> I bought two sets, when I travel, I take all the ones that I want (usually the small and medium-sized ones) and swap them out for a customized set on-the-go.</li>
            <li> I do not use the small rollers.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s your hair type if it&#x27;s hard to curl</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that hard to do</li>
            <li> I like it.. but had a hard time getting the rollers on at first&lt;br /&gt;still</li>
            <li> The clips are hard to reach and store in the bag.  </li>
            <li> I have never liked to curl my hair because the curls never stayed in.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with them and sent mine back</li>

            <li> tips for the girls with thick hair*:&lt;br /&gt;1).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very experienced with rollers</li>
            <li> They are the little uncomfortable because they&#x27;re plastic, but maybe it&#x27;s just me -</li>
            <li> Not a good purchase.</li>
            <li> The initial impression:  hated the ugly cheap stupid pink cover for these curlers...</li>
            <li> These are the worst hot rollers I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> For the record, I have very thick, almost shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> But it gets worse.  </li>
            <li> These are just useless - at least for me.</li>
            <li> Not having an on /off switch was a hassle since I would have to reach behind the chest to plug/unplug each time, but I would have put up with that inconvenience</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and have a difficult time finding curlers that will work in my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The curlers are awkwardly shaped and hard to hold onto.  </li>
            <li> but I found these to be almost useless.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> but I find nothing wrong with these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that this product was so poor, but cannot recommend it to anyone, even though I&#x27;ve tried to use it on 3 separate occasions.</li>
            <li> It was disappointing.</li>
            <li> The disappointing part is that the clips don&#x27;t hold my hair.</li>
            <li> Cumbersome and awkward.</li>
            <li> Once I roll my hair, it is nigh impossible to get the metal rods to hold them in place.</li>
            <li> thing I have noticed that caused that made people give this product a bad review is that they don&#x27;t like the clips.</li>
            <li> Ensure the rollers are inserted on the base unit correctly.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product is terrible!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Curlers are so heavy ...I have long layered medium length thick hair ... they still fall out ... like clipping rocks to my head, also don&#x27;t get very hot ... works okay to smooth out frizzy hair and give a little curl.</li>
            <li> Very good for travel.  Curls are long lasting.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> curlers do not get hot enough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very experienced with rollers but I found these to be almost useless. The biggest problem was that they didn&#x27;t stay in place with the wire clips. Also there is nothing to cover the roller when it is on your hair so the heat escapes very quickly. Even though they were inexpensive, they were still a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because I only needed a few rollers and thought it would be nice to have smaller set--but I would leave them heating up for over an hour and still they never get hot enough.....you get what you pay for, and since you don&#x27;t pay for much you don&#x27;t get much out of it. I&#x27;m planning on selling these at my rummage sale this weekend........</li>
            <li> I used this product for a couple of times but the curlers did not stay in place with the wire clips.  It was disappointing.</li>
            <li> This roller set is perfect for me.  I had a new haircut, slightly above shoulder length, tho I will likely let it grow and will still be able to use this set. I do however, have fine, thin hair, so while 10 rollers are just right, I&#x27;m not going to say they&#x27;d be enough for someone with a head of thick hair. I have a slight wave, silky textured hair, if that is helpful to know. These rollers do not get caught, I did decide to look online and get another type of clip, after I misplaced one of the metal ones, and I think I like the \\&quot;grip\\&quot; type clips better, they are available on amazon as well, the metal clips are fine, but they sometimes take a little more time and effort to put in.&lt;br /&gt;In essence, this set heats nicely, does the job, the rollers don&#x27;t get tangled, and has not damaged my hair in anyway. I didn&#x27;t buy it for travel, but for every day use and it fits easily in the bathroom and would certainly travel well, the metal clips are in a little inner slot behind the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to know the sizes of rollers. They were medium and I need large, but don&#x27;t want to pay for a new set!</li>
            <li> After going back and forth to China for 25 years, taking hair rollers that needed adapters, and destroying several sets, I was very thankful to get these travel size 110/220 that can go anywhere. They work great!!</li>
            <li> Nice and compact for use while traveling.</li>
            <li> Excellent Seller .. Fast Shipping .. Quality items .. Recommanded A+++++</li>
            <li> Good starter curlers. Does take awhile to heat up and curls don&#x27;t hold that long. I bought these for my daughter to help her start learning how to roll her hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> Personally, this was a really great buy and I would recommend it under these circumstances:&lt;br /&gt;1). i have a lot of hair...and based on all the other reviews, the girls with less hair aren&#x27;t having that much luck with theirs. the rollers stay perfectly well in my hair..and im assuming that it&#x27;s of hairs&#x27; thickness that&#x27;s making it stay. So if you have thick hair, i&#x27;m pretty sure it will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;2). unlike many of the other \\&quot;travel\\&quot; size kits that i looked at, this one is truly compact. i was shocked to see how small and easy to carry it is. plastic zipper bag makes it much more convenient to travel with than one of those bulky plastic boxes. So if you want a truly compact kit, this is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;3). im assuming that the girls with less hair didn&#x27;t like the fact that the set came with pins, but i did! I like them MUCH more than the hair clamps because, unlike the clamps, the pins don&#x27;t leave kinks and dents in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;*2 tips for the girls with thick hair*:&lt;br /&gt;1). let the rollers heat from anywhere between 7 to 15 mins instead of the 90 seconds it says on the box. it will take extra time for the hairr to heat all the way through so the rollers should definitely take more time to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;2). you should divide your time...and your hair wisely. All of these rollers aren&#x27;t enough to cover my whole head. So if you have a lot of hair like me, just start with the top half and then reheat the rollers and finish off  the bottom half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this set because I will be going to Europe in a few weeks for a musical tour with my choir and orchestra. I thought that it would be a great time saver since i wouldn&#x27;t have to sit with the iron in my hand the entire time because I have a lot of hair and it takes forever to curl. I absolutely love this set. It will make my hair so much easier to maintain while I&#x27;m abroad!</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace one from the 70&#x27;s.  Works great, easy to pack for trips.  Can not use it and a hair dryer on the same outlet in most locations.</li>
            <li> Super convenient product. Heats up nicely/fast. I have super thin hair, so I can get all my hair curled with one go - that may not be true for girls with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight Asian hair that is not easy to curl. A little above shoulder. So it took me 25 - 30 minutes to curl all my hair, which is way too long. The reason is: 1) it&#x27;s just not hot enough; 2) the small size works well for this length of hair, but the bigger ones are probably more suitable for longer hair; 3) 10 rollers can only cover 1/3 - 1/2 of my hair and I had to re-heat / roll again to other area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pins work well though. The trick is to put the pin from beneath and leave the open part pointing towards sky. I agree with another comment that the pins are more suitable for people with thick hair. Because it was difficult for me to secure big rollers - due to the fact that I couldn&#x27;t roll my short hair multi times around the roller and therefore the thickness wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughters love these things!</li>
            <li> Product came fast and well package, its a real cute travel case (im a Pink lover). only thing is my hair really didn&#x27;t holds its curl but next time ill leave them in even long  to see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers, heat up quick,nice for travel. Small are too small but enough of the other sizes to work for me.  I use roller clips instead of the pins that come with the rollers. Would love to see a set with 8 large, but haven&#x27;t found yet.</li>
            <li> they are ok.....I wanted something to use in between shampoos without having damp hair.  this says to use with damp hair.  oh well</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Conair Compact Hot Roller Set and love it.  There are just the right amount of rollers for a \\&quot;fast fix\\&quot; in the morning.  I usually use these when I am not happy with how my blowdry comes out or if I just want a different look that is easy maintenance.  I have fine hair so I can get all of my hair wrapped with the 10 rollers.  I do not think they would work for someone with thick or curly hair as you would need more rollers.  These would be great to pack and take anywhere as the case is small.  All in all, good purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this roller set!</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING...compact, and all the reviews are true. Looked and worked exactly like everyone posted.</li>
            <li> These curlers are not only a space saver, they also heat up Fast! I like the clips for the curlers because they don&#x27;t leave creases in your hair. This is an Excellent price and has just the right number of curlers for any hairdo. A Great Buy!!</li>
            <li> First let me say this set is absolutely wonderful.  You have the following;  4 small rollers  5 medium rollers  and 3 big rollers.  This set is great for those with above the shoulder or short hair.  The system heats up quickly.  You must keep the carry bag closed and the rollers retain the heat.  The system comes with hair pins that hold the rollers in place and they do an excellent job of it if you know how to use them.  I saw other reviews where people complained about the pins.  Guess what you have to know how to use the rollers and how to set your hair.  Sometimes it takes practice all systems have hair clips that you must use or even  if you get the Caruso curler the shell holds.  This system is compact that you can put it in a large purse or a tote bag and away you go.  This is an excellent system for short hair gals.  It&#x27;s fast while you have your haired rolled up it gives you the opportunity to do other things.  The curls with these rulers stay for me but I must say it&#x27;s not the roller that determines if your hair curler will stay it&#x27;s your hair type if it&#x27;s hard to curl then you must use some product then try the rollers.  Spend some time with the system it&#x27;s not that hard to do I would advise that on any hair styling product.  I found this system to be excellent and would advise anyone with short hair to get this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Conair products and was exciting about finding hot rollers with both jumbo and large sizes. But I am so disappointed in them as far as they do not get hot. They warm up, but do not get anywhere near as hot as they should. At this point I am sticking with my older ones which are very reliable.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t curl as well as a complete, at-home sets but they work nicely on the go.</li>
            <li> I thought these rollers were really cute but I ended up giving them away. I dont know if its that the heat is uneven or, or maybe the rollers are too small, or what, but I never got a good bouncy head of softly curled hair out of these.  I dont think they heat up particularly quickly, either. They might be good for a kid.</li>
            <li> I have fairly short, thick, straight hair (above my shoulders). I have never liked to curl my hair because the curls never stayed in. I got this on a whim at Walmart. The rollers heat up pretty quickly, especially if the pouch is zipped. These will hold a curl in my hair for a good 8 hrs without having to use any fixative, which is great, because I hate using hairspray. I wish it had more of the small rollers. I like to use those better than the large. The stick pins were a pain for me at first, but after two tries, I got the hang of it. They are the little uncomfortable because they&#x27;re plastic, but maybe it&#x27;s just me - this is my first time trying hot rollers. All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with these.</li>
            <li> Rollers don&#x27;t stay in my short hair.  Great size for travel but don&#x27;t do the job - should be simple to design a better hot roller.</li>
            <li> While this curlers heat up fast, I find the clips they come with to be a disaster. Once I roll my hair, it is nigh impossible to get the metal rods to hold them in place. You spend more time fiddling with the curlers and clips that you might as well curl your hair with a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li> Some of them do not work</li>
            <li> These curlers aren&#x27;t expensive, and they are compact and easy to pack. However, there seems to be no way to get them to stay in my hair (which is short and fine). The metal clips that came with them worked only when stuck in at odd and uncomfortable angles, and I could have used a curling iron in the amount of time it took to get them in. So I bought the Conair Proclips, which are supposed to fit any size curler. They probably would be great for jumbo rollers; however, they hold the medium rollers only so-so, not very tightly, and good luck getting them on the small rollers. Even if they fit the small rollers, which they don&#x27;t, it would be hard to fit them on rollers that are close together, because the clips are so large.    Not having an on-off switch with an automatic turnoff is a pain. I found that it takes 5 minutes or more to get them consistently hot.     All in all, not a well-designed product. OK if you are desperately looking for set to travel with, but basically disappointing.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife (one of her wish rist) who&#x27;s a guitarist,  small,cute and compact,best price. she loves it,thank you!</li>
            <li> The size of the rollers is nice and compact and you can easily travel with them.  The instant heat is misleading.  Yes, they are warm in just a few minutes, but if you have longer hair or want a tighter curl, the rollers need to be really warm.  I found that by heating them 10 minutes or more, they work much better.  I do wish there were more of the larger sized rollers.  I have long hair and could definitely use more rollers.  They do produce a nice wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, they are ok and if you need to travel with rollers they are definitely compact.  I would definitely look for another model if you want them for every day use.</li>
            <li> I love using the Conair Instant Heat Compact Rollers.&lt;br /&gt;It heats at the right temperature and curls great!</li>
            <li> I just got my curlers in the mail on Wednesday and I have to say I love these rollers although they take 15 minutes to reach their full heating potential. Ten rollers come in a pack with ten round pins that correspond to the sizes of the curlers. Considering the fact that these are compact If you want to do your whole head you have to warm them up twice. These rollers are moderately comfortable the pins are uncomfortable if you put them in wrong. The only thing I dislike about this product is it has no on/off switch. The shipping took 2 days!!!! (I&#x27;ve only had this for 4 day so I will be posting an update)</li>
            <li> I had given away my hot rollers years ago, but I bought these to combat the effects humidity has on my hair and I am using them every day this summer. The smallest size is not really useful so I bought another set to get more of the medium and large rollers.</li>
            <li> A very nice product.  Compact, comfortable, packs light, and easy to use.  A good value.  I can&#x27;t image getting more from something pricier.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this set, it did not get hot enough but still managed to put a usable curl in my hair.  The second time I used it, I made a deliberate attempt to let it heat longer to see if performance would improve.  It most certainly did, so perhaps that is the key.  For the record, I have very thick, almost shoulder length hair.  I purchased this item because summers I live on a boat with limited space and only occasional need for hair styling and I need dual voltage. It seems to be doing the job when tested at home, IF I can be patient and/or plug in the unit further in advance of when I need it.  I could use a few more curlers, but even \\&quot;loading\\&quot; a lot of hair on the rollers when they are really hot seems to be good enough to hold a curl. All-in-all this will definitely be worth the luggage space when we head back to summer living. It certainly out performs expectations, given what I&#x27;d read in ratings.</li>
            <li> The rollers are great! They&#x27;re extremely portable that easily fits into my travel back pack Im using for a 3 month trip to Europe this summer,  heat up quickly, doesnt tangle hair and gives long lasting soft tight curls. Love them!</li>
            <li> These work great. I didn&#x27;t want something huge that takes up all my counter space. These are perfect. They heat up quickly and are compact enough to pack in your suitcase. I do wish there were more of the larger rollers.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts, but 10 rollers is enough. I&#x27;ve never like the clips that come with the hot rollers, but I bought a pack of the sleeve-type that go over the whole roller. With that addition I absolutely love this product. It works and it&#x27;s small enough to travel. Much more convenient than my old set with the plastic case (which I threw away now that I have these).</li>
            <li> Hard to use rollers very hard and dont get hot enough to set your hair and the clips leave a dent in your hair. but I guess might be to travel as it is small</li>
            <li> These work pretty good for being so small, I was impressed. They are a good buy for what I payed.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  Great for living out of a suitcase .  All fits in the carry case and then down into my travel bag.</li>
            <li> This is a travel set with dual voltage. It takes about 20 minutes to heat up to the point we can roll the hair. But outside the US (Thailand), the time was shorten!!! It heat up in less than 10 minutes. I do not use the wire clips of this set but bought super clips from Conair separetly. Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> The weight of the rollers are too heavy on your head. Otherwise they do work good</li>
            <li> These are my matches made in heaven! I am no pro with hot rollers and I curl my hair in less than 5 mins! Heat up super quick and super cute packaging too! Dual voltage is a plus! highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I suggest using these immediately when hot to the touch. They are very good for travel or fast touch ups but I would not recommend for continuous use as they get too hot and the clips don&#x27;t hold them well in fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hot curler and use it all the time, it&#x27;s nice and compact for travel too. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it takes up to 5 minutes to get to an ideal hot to actually curl your hair but besides that it&#x27;s wonderful and no issues with quality either.</li>
            <li> So far the rollers are performing well.  Not sure how the case will hold up as it looks pretty flimsy.  No way to know as present but they really look like would be OK for travel but maybe not for every day use.</li>
            <li> These rollers work even faster then a curling iron and you can do something else (like makeup) while they are working.</li>
            <li> I have used these for quit a few years....Not only for home use but especially for travel. Voltage isn&#x27;t a problem overseas as long as you have the adaptors. I own 5 sets of these. I leave 2 sets in my suitcase so they are ready to travel. My hair is shoulder length and these aways give me the right amount of curl.</li>
            <li> Needed smaller rollers while my hair is growing out - for the nape for the neck especially. These stay in place quite well and do an excellent job with a resulting smooth curve of the hair. They heat quickly, stay hot plenty of time to do the job, and are in a compact case that will be great for travel. The only minor issue is that there&#x27;s no place to segregate the differently sized clips so I sort them before I start rolling and lay in them in little groups on the counter. Overall, an excellent buy and the product does the job.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Heats up great!</li>
            <li> The initial impression:  hated the ugly cheap stupid pink cover for these curlers... they looked like a Mattel Barbi toy set.  But it gets worse.  The curlers don&#x27;t get hot enough to actually curl hair.  The curlers are heavy, so when you roll them in your hair, they weigh down the hair on the crown of your head.  The curler holders do not come &amp;#34;color coded&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s not easy to pick which pins to use for the proper curlers (there&#x27;s not a big visual difference for the holders on the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; rollers from the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; rollers.)  Also, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to place the curlers on the heating platform to ensure they have proper contact with the heating elements.&lt;br /&gt;The only positive to these curlers is that they don&#x27;t take up much space, but a curling iron (which I had been using) takes up less space, works just as quickly, and actually makes my hair curly.  I&#x27;m disappointed that this product was so poor, but cannot recommend it to anyone, even though I&#x27;ve tried to use it on 3 separate occasions.</li>
            <li> These curlers work great! They give my hair a lot of body and the curls actually hold up. The only problem I had was, they&#x27;re very heavy. I could imagine wearing there&#x27;s curlers for more than 20 minutes without getting a headache.&lt;br /&gt;But over all a great product. I love conair!</li>
            <li> Really this was a random purchase. I always wanted hot rollers, but didn&#x27;t do the research necessary before I purchased. I have long hair and these rollers are too small and too few. I&#x27;m not sure if the order slip form it came with to purchase refills is still valid, so I may just have to buy a second set. They work great and do leave a great curl, but I just regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick hair and this product give me nice soft curls.  I do let them heat up for 10 to 15 minutes though.  I feel that with any heating tool you need to let it heat up!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t needed heated rollers for many years and was reluctant to spend much money on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would use.&lt;br /&gt;After reading many reviews I purchased this set.  For my hair these are perfect.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and these make the most of what I have.  They take up very little space.  They heat and curl very quickly.  I am very impressed with the design.  The first time I used them, I had to fight the impulse to buy a second set to make sure I never have to go without them.  Thank you, Conair, for doing this right!</li>
            <li> More for straightening than curling. The &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; rollers are 1 inch, the size of my medium curling are and there are only 3 of them I would call the other sizes Large and Jumbo.  I can barely wrap my short hair over the middle size and not at all around the largest size.  This would have been my fourth set of hot rollers and these definitely don&#x27;t get as hot as any of the other sets. I think this will work for easy to curl hair for someone looking for almost straight hair.  I was unhappy with them and sent mine back</li>
            <li> Quick to heat, you can purchase extras of the sizes you want to customize.</li>
            <li> This to me is the best travel hot rollers.  You get 3 different sizes.  3 jumbo, 3 large, 4 medium.  Perfect. Most travel hot rollers are two sizes. This is my second set of them (First set shorted out). This is really good for people with medium length hair.  If you have long hair past your shoulders, you may want a different one or you might have to get 2 sets. 10 rollers with 3 different sizes are enough for me.  These are perfect.</li>
            <li> I literally can&#x27;t use them - they do not stay on my hair at all… I have short hair but I read some reviews saying they are OK with short hair. but the clips do not hold the rollers at all. I returned them.</li>
            <li> Great size for when I have to travel and heats up quickly.  The metal holders that hole the rollers is not my favorite but they do the job.  The hot rollers are easy to use and don&#x27;t tangle or pull my hair so that&#x27;s a plus.  All over a good buy.</li>
            <li> The amount of curlers are not enough if you have long hair, only has three large curlers.  Also, doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other curlers, I would say warm curlers not hot takes a while to get warm not instant by any means.</li>
            <li> When the UPS guy handed me the box, I couldn&#x27;t believe how light it was!  I decided to try hot rollers again after years of using a curling iron.  I remembered my old electric rollers -- they were good, but heavy, and traveling with them was a big deal.  After trying these rollers, in their weightless, compact, soft plastic, zippered box, I knew why I loved them back in the day.  My fine hair stays full of body all day long (with the use of Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Spray.)  I like the way the crown doesn&#x27;t go flat anymore.  Eureka!  Leave the cover down while they heat up, which they do in 90 seconds.  I thought that was impressive.  These will fit in an 8&amp;#34; x 5&amp;#34; spot in your drawer or suitcase when you travel.  I like them!</li>
            <li> My hair got too long since I had no time to get to the salon, I needed a way to quickly give me some curl, these are quick &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact. I have really course shoulder length hair so the clips stayed in place for me. I still can&#x27;t believe my curls held up in all the humidity. I would say that I got a better result when I curled my hair over night but the curls were great.</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to store or take in a suitcase. I let them heat up for 20 minutes or so to guarantee they&#x27;re plenty hot. Put them in my hair and then finish getting ready. Results are great, full body and soft curls.</li>
            <li> Just received today rollers are fine but the clips are really bad so if you purchase know that you will need to purchase other clips so this hardly a deal  because of the added expense.</li>
            <li> Very nice . Heats up good and doesn&#x27;t burn your hands or hair</li>
            <li> I like the small size of this set for traveling and it works well too. Probably this works best for medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I have it for 2 years, still very good.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I only needed a few rollers for the top of my hair but I have found they never really hot enough to make any difference.  Not a good purchase.</li>
            <li> IT IS WORTH THE MONEY BUT DIDN&#x27;T COME WITH THE CLIPS</li>
            <li> Rollers didn&#x27;t heat evenly and were all much smaller than I needed/</li>
            <li> These are a great deal! I have naturally curly hair so when I blow dry it myself it is a little frizzy/not smooth. These curlers work fast and really smooth out my hair and produce long-lasting curls. My only complaint is the pins. They tend to pop out and I wish it came with a few extras.</li>
            <li> I just took these hot rollers on a vacation to Paris and they are compact and great for traveling (dual voltage). Ensure the rollers are inserted on the base unit correctly.  If the rollers are loose, they will not heat properly. This info is not included in the instructions.  Keep the rollers in the pink travel bag and keep the lid down while heating and in between using the rollers. The number of rollers were enough for my long hair and I was pleased with the results. A great buy for travel hot rollers.</li>
            <li> These are the best rollers I have ever used. I bought them for a trip to France and Italy and they worked great. All I needed was a plug adaptor for European plugs. I have long hair that hits mid-shoulder. I am able to curl all my hair with the 3 medium, and 3 large rollers. I left the 4 smaller rollers at home and used the extra space for socks.&lt;br /&gt;The curl lasts all day and the comb type grabbers in each roller makes for easy roll-up. There is a nice little pocket to store the clips.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use these as my everyday rollers since they give me a much longer lasting curl than my full-size rollers.</li>
            <li> the rollers arrived quickly   I have fine straight hair  I love the way they make my hair look (soft &amp; full)  The small case is great for travel &amp;  heat fast  i have used other hot rollers in the pass they all clip in about the same  After a few times they get easier to keep in</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter has little trouble rolling her own hair with these curlers. She has little experience so that shows how easy they are to use. You might consider ordering extra of the size you think you&#x27;ll need most if you have a lot of hair to curl.</li>
            <li> I have used them with 110V but I really bought them for international travel.  Can&#x27;t wait to see if they really auto switch the voltage as indicated.  The rollers did what they were made to do.  If you let the cool in your hair, the curl will stay longer as they will with all hot rollers.  I used the clips as instructed and they worked well.</li>
            <li> Wish these had a little more heat to them, but for my nieces thin hair, they worked for what we wanted them for.</li>
            <li> Curlers need additional clips</li>
            <li> I have a medium amount of fine hair about neck-length long. These curlers are not perfectly round - they are slightly oval in shape to accommodate a strip of small little pegs which are supposed to help grip the hair. This may work well for many people, but I find that it leaves a frizzy kink in the ends of my hair if they are anywhere near that strip when I roll them. Further, the non-round shape makes it a little harder to get the clips around the curlers. I found the clips included to be too large and inflexible. I bought an extra set of wire clips from my local beauty supply store that were narrower and springier - they hold much better. For the short hair in back, I may use still other clips with long teeth that clamp around the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plusses: they head up pretty fast (though I think 5 min. is better than 90 sec.) and they are very compact. There is a pocket inside the case in the back for wire clips. They do curl pretty well, but because of the little strip of pegs, the curls don&#x27;t come out as even or soft-looking as they do with my larger set of flocked curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thicker or less fine hair that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;kink\\&quot; easily, then these will probably work great. I will be looking for other travel curlers that allow my hair to lay flat and smooth against the curler when rolled up.</li>
            <li> My curlers arrived this morning (earlier than expected too, so that was a nice treat!) I used them this evening on slightly damp hair, and got fabulous results. They heated up fast, and i didn&#x27;t have to leave them in for very long either ( i get impatient )  And i got great results.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is on the Thick side, so i was skeptical that there may not be enough curlers for all of my hair, but they worked out fabulous. If i wanted a longer lasting curl i will leave them heat up longer and leave them in a bit longer, but i only had them in for 20 min and still got nice results.&lt;br /&gt;I may even order a second set of the medium sized one, they give super good curls to the hair!  I travel a lot, and these will fit nicely into my suitcase as well !</li>
            <li> The problem is that these weren&#x27;t what I wanted.  I was looking for a smaller set; but these only have a couple of each size so not enough to do my hair at once.  I&#x27;ll be more careful when I order in the future.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get hot enough to hold the curl. I threw them away.</li>
            <li> Greatest of rollers for use at home or travel. Like the different size rollers and quick heat up. Feminine pink color and soft case.</li>
            <li> I purchased them a few weeks ago and the past weekend I finally opened the box and started to use them, however there were NO clips in box or anywhere inside the little pouch.&lt;br /&gt;They are really cute, but no clips!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. The curls last for about 2 or 3 days</li>
            <li> Decent set of rollers when you consider the price. They heat up quickly, and work really well if you use mousse and hairspray on your hair before you roll each piece. I have long hair, past my arm pits, of medium thickness. And the curls hold up pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously owned a larger set with more rollers, but there are enough rollers in this set to do the trick. It&#x27;s also super compact and very convenient to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give these rollers 4/5 stars is because the curls don&#x27;t have a major WOW factor.  They fall pretty quickly but you are still left with nice body and bouncy waves. It might just depend on your preference though and what kind of effect you are going for.</li>
            <li> I have thick short hair, the curlers would not stay in my head and the clip to hold them would fly out of my head like missles.  I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I use these on my shoulder length hair just in the crown to give volume and style. They heat up effiecently and were great to travel with.</li>
            <li> I bought this hot rollers set because the compact size for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;It is a small set. I use just four rollers in the top of my hair that&#x27;s all I need.&lt;br /&gt;I use at home now because the size is so easy to use and put away.</li>
            <li> I was missing some clips so I have just been using my own.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t manage these on my fine head of hair. Velcro rollers are far superior. My stylist confirmed that Velro rollers don&#x27;t ruin your hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful - I use them all the time and now I have 3 sets!&lt;br /&gt;When I was in NY I looked all over for them and nobody carried them anymore . A relic !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Convenient and works great!! For the money, a good buy!!</li>
            <li> I was really confused between a curling iron and a hot roller. I researched a bit and after reading a few reviews, ordered this product. I was not sure if this is the right one so i ordered the travel pack. My hair is really straight, so i was skeptical if this would work, since its my first time with curls. The disappointing part is that the clips don&#x27;t hold my hair. My hair is thick and coarse. I had to put 2 clips to hold and still with the same result. Also, i put the rollers for about 10 min to get heated and did not get great curls. Instead of sticking good to my hair, i end up looking like a yak with rollers hanging loosely on my hair. My suggestion to you is, if you have tried this product before and it worked for you, then go for it. But, i would recommend not to buy if its your first time. Curling iron or a better brand of hot rollers might be more useful than this one.</li>
            <li> I have had this product a little over 24 months and i love this product all three sizes of roller form a beautiful curl that lasts all day and when youe sleep in them in the morning you have a nice wave. i need little to no hairspray to keep the curls I would reccommed to anyone who does not wnat the typical shir;y temple spiral curls this product gives you a more natural look since there are three different sizes.</li>
            <li> I love these hit rollers. They heat up fast and provide great soft curls. I would buy a second set.</li>
            <li> It works well if you understand it&#x27;s a small travel case. It heats quickly and the clips hold if you put threm in correctly. The sizes of the rollers is limited but for a quick curl it works really well.</li>
            <li> I like these rollers but the pins that come with them are too small too fit on the jumbo rollers so I had to use hair clips to get the roller to stay. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for. Not impressed at all. They never seemed to get hot enough to do anything. Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> Worked great! The soft, compact pouch made it easy to pack. Lightweight, so it didn&#x27;t add weight to my luggage. Finally I can travel with heat curlers</li>
            <li> I like the compact size for traveling. Also like the style of the rollers. They hold hair well while rolling yet don&#x27;t tangle when unrolling.</li>
            <li> works as described, fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is a great, very compact set. Wonderful for travel. Protective, but soft and squishy enough to shove in a bag.</li>
            <li> I had the Conair Curl n&#x27;Carry set previously - bought about 4 of them over a long stretch of years.  They were great.  I was looking for a small set that would be similar since I burned out my last set of Curl n&#x27; Carry and can&#x27;t find them anywhere.  I thought these might be comparable - wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curlers are awkwardly shaped and hard to hold onto.  There are not enough of the large and medium curlers and too many little ones.  They don&#x27;t stay on the heating elements, which is my number one issue, they take forever to heat, the pins don&#x27;t hold well, and curls fall out in minutes.  I was going to return them, but just didn&#x27;t get around to it.  They were certainly inexpensive, as were the Curl n&#x27; Carry set, but in this case, you get what you pay for.  I wish Conair would bring the Curl n&#x27; Carry back.  These are just useless - at least for me.</li>
            <li> Great size for traveling.I looked quite a long time for rollers since I was due for new ones and my old Conair ones where shot after 2o+ years of using. My hair holds a curl very well and so I just put these curlers in for about 1 minute and my hair is curled very nicely, if I leave them in too long its way to curly. The price was right and compact for traveling or small spaces. I like that it zips up. My old curlers had a hard top and after a few years the top got cracked then finally the whole lid broke off but I could still use them, or it still worked, its just that I needed an updated one that fit my needs. I use bigger clips and not the wire ones that come with my new one.</li>
            <li> The curls were nice but the clips were too loose I had to hold really still or the curlers would fall off.I couldn&#x27;t even walk with them in</li>
            <li> Took this product on an international trip and it was perfect when using a converter/adapter and it fits nicely in your travel bags.  The rollers warmed up nicely (need to keep the case zipped during heating process) and it curled my medium length hair the same as my regular hot curlers at home.  The only recommendation I would make is that more large curlers would be needed for longer hair.  Great product overall.</li>
            <li> These just don&#x27;t get very hot, so even after leaving them in over half an hour, my curls fell out as soon as the rollers came out. I had the lid closed when heating, too. Disappointing for sure. I was planning on taking them on a business trip since the size is so nice and compact, but I&#x27;ll have to stick with my curling iron.</li>
            <li> I would rather have all one size but that is not how they come.  To replace large ones with small ones it is less expensive to just buy another set.  Replacement rollers are way too high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these are probably a good product for some people out there, but they&#x27;re absolute rubbish if your hair is long and thick and curly like mine. I got these to try a vintage 1940s style for a party I was going to, but these were hopeless at holding my hair. Too many tiny rollers in relationship to the big ones, and they make you buy more of the big ones separately if you want them! Ended up returning these and just using my trusty curling iron for the hairdo, and it worked out fine.</li>
            <li> I use this while I&#x27;m living in Europe. I love that it has dual voltage so I can bring it back to the States. The rollers heat up fast, and do the trick for my very straight, Asian air. I don&#x27;t use the metal prongs that come with it, but bought the Conair Super Clips instead. I also don&#x27;t use the big rollers as much as they only roll my hair in, instead of making waves or curls. Mind you this is a definitely a set for traveling. Quite compact, but it means that you will definitely not have enough rollers to fit your entire head. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have 2 sets of these. My hair is short, straight and very fine. I ordered extra large rollers because they work the best for me. You should keep the case zipped close while heating.</li>
            <li> After ten minutes they were lukewarm. I tried 2 different times same results. Love the size of the unit, so I am disappointed they won&#x27;t work. Not having an on /off switch was a hassle since I would have to reach behind the chest to plug/unplug each time, but I would have put up with that inconvenience had they gotten hot enough to use.</li>
            <li> This product is compact so it can be taken every where without too much bulk! They also work well. I enjoy it every time I use it!</li>
            <li> Very little to no heat.</li>
            <li> Havent tried them for overseas, but i will now have a dual voltage set.  love the little carrying case</li>
            <li> These rollers do their job, more or less, but the problem with them is that they keep slipping out of my hair. Perhaps if I had a lot more hair, they&#x27;d stay in better, but I don&#x27;t. They&#x27;re constantly slipping out and I&#x27;m always having to roll them back up again. That&#x27;s annoying. Maybe if they came with twice as many clips, and I put two on each roller instead of one? Well, I&#x27;ve tried that a couple times, putting in half as many rollers, and that didn&#x27;t help, either. So I&#x27;m not crazy about them. But I do get SOME wave with them, so they&#x27;re not total failures. Not my best roller purchase. On a side note: they *do* heat up fast and don&#x27;t burn my scalp (probably because they don&#x27;t spend so much time on my head, huh?).</li>
            <li> Heats quickly.  Easy to use.  Great Curls even on thick strait hair.  Leave them in until completely cool.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy being able to throw my hair up in rollers rather than spending the extra time with the curling iron. I do wish there were more larger rollers. I could do without the four small ones, but I make do. Also, the instruction &amp; warranty docs state that clips are color coded by size. They are not. They are all white tipped.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for the first couple of weeks. However, I really needed it when I was overseas &amp; 1/2 of it refused to heat. I thought maybe it was the problem of 220 power. But when I returned home, the same thing. Only 1/2 of it heats at one time. Too late to return, the policy states. This set was nothing like the one I purchased in Walmart which lasted for YEARS. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love these things! I bought the travel rollers originally because it is a smaller container and doesn&#x27;t take up as much space in my bathroom. But, they work so much better than any other set of hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever had. They heat up quickly and my hair keeps its curl the entire day.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, esp for the price, but I don&#x27;t think they get hot enough...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last set, Remington H-1015&lt;br /&gt;(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPJNMW/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER)&lt;br /&gt;got hotter and I liked better in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the larger size rollers (1.25&amp;#34;) in this set are very nice, as for some reason I do not understand, it is hard to find hot rollers in that size.  The Remington set doesn&#x27;t include any as large.  Also I think this set heats more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, the 90 seconds is not accurate.  They do heat quickly, but take more like 5 min to really get uniformly heated.  And if I heat them for even longer, like 10+ minutes, they still don&#x27;t get as hot as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all though I am happy with these and continue to use them.</li>
            <li> LOVE these. They are compact and the design of the curler goes into your hair easily. I had reservations about plastic curlers but these are fine. They heat up quickly and they are easy to handle. They work! I have a lot of hair so I DO need to order extra curlers to replace the used ones to do all of my hair but that&#x27;s a minor issue. YAY! for Conair AGAIN! I&#x27;ve been using Conair products for many of my 59 years so it&#x27;s a great company.</li>
            <li> These are the worst hot rollers I have ever used.  They take forever to heat up and even when they do, it isnt very hot.  I have fine hair so it didnt hold curl worth anything.  On top of that, they aren&#x27;t comfortable.  I have another Conair set that are soft rollers but have just lost a couple rollers and clips over the years so thought I would get something compact.  If they work for you, the only positive thing I can say is that they are very portable.  I plan to return them.</li>
            <li> These rollers did a great job!  They heated up within just a few minutes and made beautiful curls.  My hair is long and thick, so I was concerned about how well they would do.  No problem!  They take up very little space in the suitcase, so will be easy to take along on those trips requiring light packing!  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this product.  Worked as advertised.  I just decided I did not like &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; rollers and will go back to the soft rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an expat living outside the US and I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase! I have thick shoulderblade-length hair, so I purchased two sets of these (I couldn&#x27;t find any other dual-voltage hot rollers that were this well-priced) and they were more than enough for my hair. The grip on the rollers is great -- it really holds the hair in place -- and I love the little pocket to stash your clips in. Here&#x27;s a tip: zip up the container and let it heat for 10 minutes, not 30 seconds, and they will be the perfect level of ultra-warm to curl your hair without scorching it or burning your fingers. Another tip: I bought two sets, when I travel, I take all the ones that I want (usually the small and medium-sized ones) and swap them out for a customized set on-the-go.</li>
            <li> These rollers get the job done. They heat up very fast and are reasonably easy to put in. The metals clips hold on to the hair well if you really stick it, if not they may fall out. They create tons of volume and the different variety of roller sizes makes for a natural looking head of curls. My only concerns would be that with only ten roller I am only able to do half of my head at a time. I also wish that the cord was longer. Other than that these are great rollers for an awesome price. I am considering buying another set of these so I can do my whole head at once.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and great for travel.  I&#x27;m only giving it four stars because the clips were NOT included!  I had to use some from another set.</li>
            <li> Not only were these hot rollers inexpensive, but they heat up in a hurry and don&#x27;t monopolize the entire bathroom counter.  The clip storage is a little awkward, so I stashed the clips in a little box next to the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;The case is compact enough for travel, another boon, and the large, med and small sizes come in the right distribution for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> These rollers are perfect for everyday use - and especially for travel.  The soft case makes them very easy to tuck into a suitcase, and they do a good job of heating up in 90 seconds as promised in the instructions.</li>
            <li> After reading previous reviews I was a little apprehensive to order this set.  I  use electric curlers just about every day. This set is perfect for travel. Small and light for your carry on. I found they heated very quickly . It is most important to make sure they are seated on the element correctly. You should feel them kind of snap in place. My only complaint is the holders. Go to your local beauty supply  and for a few dollars purchase plastic clips..the kind that would fit over the roller entirely..referred as alligator clips sometimes...one size fits all and hold the rollers in place perfectly.  I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> From the negative reviews I did not expect much from these, which I bought to use for travel, but I am perfectly happy with them. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have been using hot rollers since they first became available in the 70s, but I find nothing wrong with these. They are the smallest set I have ever seen, which is what I wanted. I chose only four stars because I would have preferred a set with all &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; rollers, and I only really need six or seven. I suppose the little ones will come in handy when I get my next haircut, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address the common complaints: The rollers do not have to feel blazing hot to your hand in order to work. The first time I used them I let them heat for about ten minutes, and they were only warm to the touch. I put them in anyway thinking I could always let them heat up longer if they didn&#x27;t work. They worked fine, giving me great bouncy long-lasting curls even though they weren&#x27;t hot enough to singe my ears like other sets I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take a second or two to actually LOOK at the clips (which are indeed all tipped in white) it is *obvious* that there are three distinct sizes. If you use a clip that is the wrong size for the roller, it will either fly across the room or the roller will fall out of your hair. Start with the biggest rollers and the biggest clips, and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have ignored the negative reviews and not bought the Conair super clips to go with them, because they are not needed. The wire clips work just fine. Put them in from UNDER the roller, going against the direction of the curl, with the rounded end close to your scalp and the open end (bent end on top) sticking up. I actually prefer the wire clips because the big clips on my regular set always leave crimps in my hair. The wire clips never do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, my hair is right at shoulder length and baby fine, and there&#x27;s a lot of it. I had no &amp;#34;frizzy ends&amp;#34; issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up: They&#x27;re small, they&#x27;re designed well, they&#x27;re perfect for travel (with dual voltage too!), they do the job, they won&#x27;t burn your ears, and for Maude&#x27;s sake, they only cost $11.58! You&#x27;d pay more than that for a premium martini.: They&#x27;re small, they&#x27;re designed well, they&#x27;re perfect for travel (with dual voltage too!), they do the job, they won&#x27;t burn your ears, and for Maude&#x27;s sake, they only cost $11.58!

            <li> I have heated curlers. But these travel curlers heat faster, curl tighter, and are so compact! I love them!  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> The rollers are great for traveling and heat up quickly. I use them on a regular basis and have bouncy curls in minutes.</li>
            <li> The Conair HS10W hot rollers heat up quickly and provide good curl but I wish the pins were color coded to tell the difference in sizes. The pins are also very difficult to fasten, the rollers have grooves in them and everything has to be perfectly aligned to fasten.  I am dissapointed in these rollers and wish I had got the same set of Remington&#x27;s that I had before.</li>
            <li> I got these to use with the hot roller set I already have, a full size set still never has enough rollers for my whole head, but I didn&#x27;t need 2 full size sets either, just a few extra. Also I like the idea of having a small travel option that will fit neatly in my carry on if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good deal on rollers and I&#x27;m frankly surprised at all the negative reviews. I made sure each roller was firmly clamped/snapped into place first, as you can clearly see that they have to be, plugged them in with the case zipped and gave them a decent amount of time to heat up, probably about 10 mins or so, they might have been hot before that, I didn&#x27;t check. They were just as hot as my more expensive set, all of them, and evenly heated as well. I really like the little comb along the side of the roller, its kind of cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have noticed that caused that made people give this product a bad review is that they don&#x27;t like the clips. I agree wholeheartedy, I really dislike this type of metal holder thing myself, which is why I went out and bought a cheap set of plastic clips  to hold them to my head. Some people may not want the extra &amp;#34;trouble&amp;#34;, but it isn&#x27;t really a big deal of a fix, even with the extra 3 bucks or so the clips cost me, it was cheaper than a lot of travel sets total. the clips have nothing to do with the performance of the product, the product is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all, just gave it some body.  Too much variation between sizes.  I like the 12-pack travel rollers from Conair much better.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this little Conair unit, I purchased the larger set, Conair Compact Hairsetter, Blue.  The roller itself is a great grasp and I do like the pins as opposed to the clasps, much more secure/tight.  Love both units and could not be happier and I have been at this for over forty years!  You go Conair!</li>
            <li> All curlers are smaller than I wanted for my hair.  Clips don&#x27;t stay in.  The whole unit is flimsy causing the curlers to keep falling out  of the case.  It seems that the rollers never get hot enough, but surprisingly, if I can get them to stay in my hair, the curls are great and long lasting.  Not worth the frustration in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really as it appears in Amazon. Delivery on time. Heats supersonic!</li>
            <li> This item is more a child&#x27;s toy than a useful toy.  Don&#x27;t waste time and money purchasing such a cheap item.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair.. but of course I straightened it before putting these on.&lt;br /&gt;anyway the curls look pretty. I like it.. but had a hard time getting the rollers on at first&lt;br /&gt;still do kinda lol // gonna master these rollers sometime this summer lol</li>
            <li> I bought this set of curlers to take on the road with me since they are in a nice soft carrying case. The reviews were pretty good, too. However, the curlers don&#x27;t stay on the stems, so I&#x27;m constantly having to push them down to heat up after the slightest jarring. Also, even after they&#x27;ve heated up for 10-15 minutes, they don&#x27;t seem hot enough. A cheap set... I won&#x27;t be buying from Conair again.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great, curl my hair nicely but the clips are a little annoying keep popping off besides that they&#x27;re good</li>
            <li> Product is terrible! Didn&#x27;t get hot at all and wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair. Amazon was awesome and refunded my money asap.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get as hot as I need them to get but okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Nice quality!</li>
            <li> This was my first time experimenting with hot rollers so I didn&#x27;t want to pay much. They work well and are compact, which is great for storage. My only complaint is the sizes of the curlers. I would have preferred to have more of the bigger sizes rather than the smallest curlers. Other than that, I am satisfied for what I paid.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these curlers!  I have thick hair and have a difficult time finding curlers that will work in my hair.  They heat up really fast and along with hair spray, my hair holds the curl all day.  They are the perfect size and can easily be packed in a suitcase for traveling!</li>
            <li> did not work well for my hair. Passed to a friend and she loved them.</li>
            <li> These are small, compact, and great for traveling.</li>
            <li> These hot roller heat up very fast and do a great job.</li>
            <li> love this product/fabulous</li>
            <li> Loved them I have long hair so I bought 2 sets they are so compact  great for travel. They heat up so fast and my curls last all day.</li>
            <li> After reading mixed reviews, I had very low expectations for these hot rollers.  But when they arrived, I was pleasantly surprised.  It&#x27;s a very cute set; much smaller than depicted online.    The rollers are durable, and come in three sizes: 4 small (3/4 inch), 3 medium (1 inch), and 3 large (1.25 inch).  The rollers themselves have a strip of teeth on one side, which helps to grip and hold the hair in place.  This is especially helpful if you have fine hair, or have problems with rollers falling out.    My rollers heat very fast, and get very hot.  When I heat the rollers, I keep the case and lid closed.  Using this method, my rollers are very hot within 5 minutes.  There are roller pins included with this set; they are located in a slip pocket on the back interior of the case.  If the pin does not secure my roller well, I turn the pin around, and position it facing the opposite direction. The rollers are a bit heavy, so if you don&#x27;t secure them well with the pin, they will drop out.    As other reviewers have mentioned, the rollers are not perfectly round; they are slightly oval due to the strip of teeth on one side.  But this does not affect the integrity of the curl you get.  Curls come out full and bouncy.  I deducted one star because you have to pay some attention to the roller base, and make sure each roller is pushed down onto it&#x27;s heating element.    I also purchased the popular [[ASIN:B001BLRYMO Conair Compact Hairsetter, Blue]] but did not like them nearly as much, as the rollers did not get hot enough, nor curl my hair well.      I live in an apartment with a small bathroom, and simply wanted a small unit that was easy to tuck away and store.  This roller set is well worth the money.  It&#x27;s of good quality, and has enough rollers to accommodate most heads of hair.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THEM AND THEY ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO TRAVEL WITH.  I WISH THE CLIPS STAYED IN BETTER BUT THEY DO A GOOD JOB FOR THIN HAIR.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets as I have a lot of hair and I&#x27;m glad I did.  You just need an adapter (not a converter) as this product is made to handle 220v, the adapter is so you can plug it into European outlets.  Works great, curls hold and is small enough for travel.  I put one in my carry-on and one in my checked bag to be safe ;)  Got to keep up that &amp;#34;bella figura&amp;#34; in Italia!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:  Be sure curlers are seated properly before using and keep lid zipped to heat.</li>
            <li> I like this little set but would find it a lot handier if a person could get all small rollers, medium, large or a mix.  Also, the pins are hard to access in the little pocket inside.  Still and all, it&#x27;s great to have for the modest price.</li>
            <li> Not a fan....they don&#x27;t get very hot at all, but the for the price it was not worth me returning.</li>
            <li> Cumbersome and awkward.</li>
            <li> VGreat size assortment of rollers. I have fine hair and the rollers did not stay in place</li>
            <li> I like how these heat and you can carry them with you.  I used to roll my hair everyday in high school.  These rollers are awesome!</li>
            <li> doest work the way should  be.</li>
            <li> For travel the best I&#x27;ve found.  Heats up fast. Curlers not small enough for short hair, takes a little practice.  Results great.</li>
            <li> They work well, like one would expect.  The clips are hard to reach and store in the bag.  Took me awhile to figure out how to clip the rollers with them, too.  The bag is a squishy thing that doesn&#x27;t work for me at home, on the dressing table. Nor for storing, protecting the rollers, or traveling.  I&#x27;ve seen a cute set a friend of mine bought second-hand that inspired me to buy these, but they&#x27;re not the great set to compare to that.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and rollers will only stay in when I purchased additional alligator clips.  I still have some issues of rollers staying in place.  I already purchased the same item so I now have two.  I did this to switch out some of the smallest rollers to the medium.  It was cheaper to buy the whole set than to buy additional rollers.  But I could not switch out all the medium rollers as there is not enough room on unit to do so.  I would of loved it if had just more space to accomodate the medium and larger rollers.  I do not use the small rollers.  This is great for travel as very compact.</li>
            <li> These are great hair rollers! They warm up quickly and are the perfect size for storage and travel. I am glad I bought them!</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up quick and do not take up a lot of space which is perfect for putting into a suitcase.  Also great at home in terms of being space saving.  The rollers work well in my wife&#x27;s hair.  Over a year later, still using them regularly and enjoying the results.</li>
