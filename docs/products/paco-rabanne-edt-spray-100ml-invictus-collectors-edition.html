            <li>Satisfied with product and packaging.  </li>
            <li>Definitely in my top 5.</li>
            <li>The bottle was in ok condition, had to shine it up a tad as it was covered in dust.</li>
            <li>The bottle is just fantastic!</li>
            <li>very clean smell, not musky at all and not over powering like Hollister.</li>
            <li>but has a distinct clean smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The smell is perfect but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Comes on pretty strong when you first spray it, but cools down to a very very clean scent with a touch of sweetness and spice.</li>
            <li>My friend ordered the same frangrance for her boyfriend at another site and paid quite a bit more.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much you made his Christmas.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this new frangrance for him.  </li>
            <li>The scent stands out, especially when compared to lighter scents like Aqua di gio, D&amp;G light blue, Prada Luna Rosa, etc..</li>
            <li>He was blown away for the quantity at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Everyone wants to know what my husband is wearing, he even has other men asking him what its called!</li>

            <li> just few hours</li>
            <li> Do not use casually, use when you dress to impress</li>

            <li> Would have given it 5 stars, but the packaging on both boxes I purchased were in horrid shape. I had to take them out of the box to give as gits.. I had to get creative! The description said &amp;#34;Large decorative box.&amp;#34; In my case, it was a half of box and ripped and tattered cellophane like stuff on the front. The bottle was in ok condition, had to shine it up a tad as it was covered in dust. Looked like it came from a scratch and dent sale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing though!</li>
