            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have stumbled upon this product on chickettes.com.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that it thins the product</li>

            <li>Good product.... does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job, so far.  </li>
            <li>Directions are easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>I put 4 drops in a gelish polish that had gotten too thick, and tested it, then put 4 more drops in and it was great!  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Gelos is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>but I know many people really like the product</li>
            <li>And the price is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>thank you very much!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would&#x27;ve performed right away.  </li>
            <li>is just right</li>
            <li>However, a week later the application was so smooth!  </li>
            <li>Worked exactly as I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>Got it fast!</li>
            <li>Works great to thin out gel polish</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t really say.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m astonish how well this worked and really made application of my gel polish much quicker since I didn&#x27;t have to fight the goopy-ness or wait for the polish to lay flat and smooth out once it was applied.  </li>
            <li>No harsh chemical smells.</li>
            <li>I could put nice thin coats with no brush strokes visible.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s saved several of my gels, I didn&#x27;t have to toss them and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but it seems to do exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>

            <li> This gel polish  thinner works great! I would totally recommend this to anyone that uses gel polish.</li>
            <li> I used this on some of my Gelish polishes from the Spring in Bloom collection that are thick and goopy (A Petal For Your Thoughts, A Mint of Spring). It works as it should and has not affected the curing of the polish.</li>
            <li> This thinner has saved me the cost of the product many times over by keeping me from having to replace thickened gels.</li>

            <li> I ordered the Gel&amp;ouml;s gel polish thinner and it works great for thinning the polish...BUT I have found it changes the color of the polish once cured. My mint green now is a deeper, darker green and my bright white now yellows, when it never used to before :( I am so disappointed in this product. I&#x27;m glad that it thins the product well so it applies easier and the cure times stays the same, but I don&#x27;t like that it changed the final colors.</li>
            <li> Got it fast! Good product ! Now i can make my gels that are very thick thinner  thank you very much! Very happy!</li>
