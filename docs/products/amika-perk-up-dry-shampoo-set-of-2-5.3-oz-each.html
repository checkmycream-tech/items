            <li> This maybe a fake.  Doesn&#x27;t feel it work like the Amika Perk Up from birchbox.</li>

            <li> Great scent, decent price.  If you spray far enough away and don&#x27;t over do it, no white residue.  I use it before bed so it all dissipates by morning.  Hard to find in the stores so I&#x27;m glad to find it on here.</li>
            <li> The ONLY dry shampoo I will use!! Changed my life and saves me hours of time per week. Smells great, leaves hair feeling soft and clean and no white residue. More pricey than I&#x27;d usually pay, but totally worth it!</li>
