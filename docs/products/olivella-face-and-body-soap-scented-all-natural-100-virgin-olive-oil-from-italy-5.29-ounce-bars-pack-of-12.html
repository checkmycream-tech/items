            <li>So happy to be able to purchase so much at one time</li>
            <li>i love this olivella face &amp; body soap.</li>
            <li>Wonderful soap, I bought a bar at the gift shop at a vineyard once, this was such a better price.</li>

            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feel so much better.</li>

            <li>Over the years we have tried many soap products including selling some.  </li>
            <li>Love it and recommended it to others.</li>
            <li>I am glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li>I also personally love the scent</li>
            <li>and I love that it is made from olives.</li>
            <li>Appears to have fewer allergy aggravating ingredients than most.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend buying and trying just one bar before ordering more.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Olivella Face and Body soap for about 2 years now and love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and everything about it.  </li>
            <li>WHAT MORE DO I NEED TO SAY.</li>
            <li>My husband said, &amp;#34;No more itchy skin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product a higher rating than Kiss My Face olive oil soap because of the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>This is a good olive oil soap at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have purchased pure olive oil soaps in both Greece and Italy, and they smelled quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The bar is a good size for hand washing and shower use and the product is great for all skin types, I have very dry skin</li>
            <li>Price is quite good for pure olive oil.</li>
            <li>Enjoy : )</li>
            <li>Soap has excellent moisture content for dry skin and a light fragence.</li>
            <li>A good high quality product makes it a great addition to a healthy lifestyle would definitely recommend for yourself, friends, and family.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a good quality olive soap.</li>
            <li>The bar is very long-lasting and has a pleasant fresh aroma.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth</li>
            <li>Overall just a great moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This might be a unique property of the olive-based soaps and others might be fine with it, however --</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product on QVC and found I could receive a much better deal from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have used this soap for several years and have found it to be the most wonderful facial soap!  </li>
            <li>even if it is unique property -- it&#x27;s unacceptable for us.</li>
            <li>The olive oil in the soap softens your skin and rinses off cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Face never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>It lathers and gets you squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using expensive skincare for a while now and am extremely happy to have found a better product at muchhhh better pricing!</li>
            <li>I liked how it is treated the skin which felt soft and moisture-balanced.</li>
            <li>Great for you skin and has a  light smell does not have a heavy perfume smell.do</li>
            <li>I receive many comments about my clear and smooth complexion.  </li>
            <li>It is mild without stripping out my skin or leaving it feeling caked with residue.</li>
            <li>We always buy from the same seller on Amazon and, we are obviously very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I use this soap once a week (dudu osun and alaffia the other 6 days) and this soap has amazing moisture!</li>
            <li>so i guess in the end you end up paying the same amount of money, but for a better product!    </li>
            <li>but most importantly my dry skin is much better.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the vendor shipped the product quickly .</li>
            <li>Love all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey however well worth it.</li>
            <li>Purchased this as a pack of 12 for $25.99 &amp; this price makes the soap worth the money.  </li>
            <li>When it comes to bath tub rings &amp; residue, it also leaves a bit more than usual, but at about $2 a bar it is a pretty good purchase.  </li>
            <li>We love this soap so much that we keep coming back for more.  </li>
            <li>Pure and clean plant-based soap.</li>
            <li>The soap leaves my face smooth and moist, no drying effect, which says something, as I live in Arizona!</li>
            <li>I found buying this soap on Amazon to be the cheapest because I get free shipping and no tax since I live in CA</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, no one in our family liked the smell: it&#x27;s too powdery and strong and definitely not refreshing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin or that has a contact allergy to many soaps like I do.  </li>
            <li>I tried many different kinds and types of soaps and lotions until a friend of mine referred me to this soap.</li>
            <li>Just after one use I felt my skin improve and after my first bar</li>
            <li>This soap works the same as Kiss-my-face but has a better smell.</li>
            <li>My skin always feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Cost of product is well below the QVC price, which is where I first heard of the item.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box I couldn&#x27;t wait to use the first bar I took out.  </li>
            <li>I first thought it will go away</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just the first use, but the sludge kept being generated over and over.</li>
            <li>I wish it smelled better and didn&#x27;t have the sludge, then I would definitely buy this soap and recommend others.</li>
            <li>Also, it produces a great lather but seems to last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>It has a faint pleasant scent &amp; does leave skin softer than most soaps.</li>
            <li>If you have dry or sensitive skin, you will love this!</li>
            <li>We cannot not stand the strong fragrances in regular bar soap.</li>
            <li>It was so strong I could smell it through both the outer and inner boxes.</li>
            <li>I certainly would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like most soaps I&#x27;ve used and leaves a pleasant and subtle scent on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is gentle, and pure.  </li>
            <li>This soap is really just for people with skin problems because they need pure olive oil.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a mild soap that is gentle on the skin and at the same time cleanses well, then this product is right for you.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>this soap is just as gentle.</li>
            <li>She really loves it and it helps her skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing to my skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require a lotion follow up and is very soothing on the skin...</li>
            <li>I have been useing this soap for some time now and really like its resaults</li>
            <li>so much for the benifits of olive oil.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect the soap to preserve well, but it really has.</li>
            <li>If you want a cute, pink, flowery perfumed soap this is not for you.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was neat and the delivery time was fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent.</li>
            <li>I bought a whole case.</li>
            <li>I usually use Kiss My Face products, but i like these soap bars even more!  </li>
            <li>It makes you feel clean and moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li>As we get older, our skin gets dryer and this soap really helps to eliminate the winter itchiness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite surprised it hasn&#x27;t developed a rancid odor since many olive oil mixed products do over time.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this soap online in an attempt to replicate the soaps I purchased abroad, and only after reading many reviews about similar soaps.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Olivella Face and Body Soap.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>I recommend highly</li>
            <li>I started using this for my mother who is in her eighties and suffers from skin sensitivities and found it to be very good.</li>
            <li>We live in Louisiana and I take 2 showers a day in the winter and 2 to 3 showers a day the rest of the year.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a natural way to cleanse and soften your skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels very natural and soothing to the skin even in wintertime.</li>
            <li>my dry and itchy skin was pretty much just a memory.</li>
            <li>Before discovering Olivella, my skin was so itchy, especially during the hot summer months, even though I thought I was using a moisturizing soap along with a post-shower slathering of a body lotion.  </li>
            <li>read ewww), I decided to try this Olivella soap, which is all natural and made out just of olive oil..   </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>We use only olive oil soap in our bathrooms, and these bars are very well priced.  </li>
            <li>-- I look young for my age and people always compliment my skin</li>
            <li>and it is all natural.</li>
            <li>It is 100% natural .</li>
            <li>It is also natural.</li>
            <li>It smells like old, musty clay.  </li>
            <li>I subscribed for this soap and was very excited that finally found something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; with a reasonable price, but it was a big disappointment right after the first usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We used another brand of olive oil soap in the past which was similar but had a better smell to it</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and hesitated to purchase a different soap.  </li>
            <li>This soap is the real thing, hardly any fragrance, and gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for me on it&#x27;s own (usually use coconut oil when I get out of the shower because I like my skin super soft), but my skin isn&#x27;t tight and dry if I decide skip the after-shower moisturizing, like it tends to be with other body washes.</li>
            <li>The olive oil does wonders for my older friends too, their skin had been helped by it not to be so dry.</li>
            <li>I have been trying different brands and like them all so far.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this when I was young instead of spending a fortune on expensive face cleansers</li>
            <li>It does not make the face dry and leaves the skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I only use natural, vegan, cruelty-free products and all other natural body washes made my skin itch, or gave me red bumps.</li>
            <li>They may be a little more expensive than regular soaps (I used to use Dove soap which was cheaper), but Olivella soap bars last like twice as much as Dove&#x27;s..</li>

            <li> I can tell you that my skin is much better now, and</li>
            <li> one more thing..</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  </li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and the way it suds.  </li>
            <li> So happy to be able to purchase so much at one time</li>
            <li> i love this olivella face &amp; body soap.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap, I bought a bar at the gift shop at a vineyard once, this was such a better price.</li>
            <li> love the fragrance, love the lather.  </li>

            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of these soaps.  </li>
            <li> They perform well as soaps, but the smell is what I love most.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feel so much better.</li>
            <li> Some people say the soap has a musty smell, but I love this  product.</li>
            <li> Over the years we have tried many soap products including selling some.  </li>
            <li> Love it and recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> I am glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li> I also personally love the scent</li>
            <li> and I love that it is made from olives.</li>
            <li> Appears to have fewer allergy aggravating ingredients than most.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend buying and trying just one bar before ordering more.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Olivella Face and Body soap for about 2 years now and love it.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent and everything about it.  </li>
            <li> WHAT MORE DO I NEED TO SAY.</li>
            <li> My husband said, &amp;#34;No more itchy skin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product a higher rating than Kiss My Face olive oil soap because of the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This is a good olive oil soap at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have purchased pure olive oil soaps in both Greece and Italy, and they smelled quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li> The bar is a good size for hand washing and shower use and the product is great for all skin types, I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Price is quite good for pure olive oil.</li>
            <li> Enjoy : )</li>
            <li> Soap has excellent moisture content for dry skin and a light fragence.</li>
            <li> A good high quality product makes it a great addition to a healthy lifestyle would definitely recommend for yourself, friends, and family.</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a good quality olive soap.</li>
            <li> The bar is very long-lasting and has a pleasant fresh aroma.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth</li>
            <li> Overall just a great moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This might be a unique property of the olive-based soaps and others might be fine with it, however --</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product on QVC and found I could receive a much better deal from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have used this soap for several years and have found it to be the most wonderful facial soap!  </li>
            <li> even if it is unique property -- it&#x27;s unacceptable for us.</li>
            <li> The olive oil in the soap softens your skin and rinses off cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Face never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> It lathers and gets you squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using expensive skincare for a while now and am extremely happy to have found a better product at muchhhh better pricing!</li>
            <li> I liked how it is treated the skin which felt soft and moisture-balanced.</li>
            <li> Great for you skin and has a  light smell does not have a heavy perfume smell.do</li>
            <li> I receive many comments about my clear and smooth complexion.  </li>
            <li> It is mild without stripping out my skin or leaving it feeling caked with residue.</li>
            <li> We always buy from the same seller on Amazon and, we are obviously very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I use this soap once a week (dudu osun and alaffia the other 6 days) and this soap has amazing moisture!</li>
            <li> so i guess in the end you end up paying the same amount of money, but for a better product!    </li>
            <li> but most importantly my dry skin is much better.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the vendor shipped the product quickly .</li>
            <li> Love all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey however well worth it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a pack of 12 for $25.99 &amp; this price makes the soap worth the money.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to bath tub rings &amp; residue, it also leaves a bit more than usual, but at about $2 a bar it is a pretty good purchase.  </li>
            <li> We love this soap so much that we keep coming back for more.  </li>
            <li> Pure and clean plant-based soap.</li>
            <li> The soap leaves my face smooth and moist, no drying effect, which says something, as I live in Arizona!</li>
            <li> I found buying this soap on Amazon to be the cheapest because I get free shipping and no tax since I live in CA</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, no one in our family liked the smell: it&#x27;s too powdery and strong and definitely not refreshing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin or that has a contact allergy to many soaps like I do.  </li>
            <li> I tried many different kinds and types of soaps and lotions until a friend of mine referred me to this soap.</li>
            <li> Just after one use I felt my skin improve and after my first bar</li>
            <li> This soap works the same as Kiss-my-face but has a better smell.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Cost of product is well below the QVC price, which is where I first heard of the item.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I couldn&#x27;t wait to use the first bar I took out.  </li>
            <li> I first thought it will go away</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just the first use, but the sludge kept being generated over and over.</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled better and didn&#x27;t have the sludge, then I would definitely buy this soap and recommend others.</li>
            <li> Also, it produces a great lather but seems to last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It has a faint pleasant scent &amp; does leave skin softer than most soaps.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or sensitive skin, you will love this!</li>
            <li> We cannot not stand the strong fragrances in regular bar soap.</li>
            <li> It was so strong I could smell it through both the outer and inner boxes.</li>
            <li> I certainly would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like most soaps I&#x27;ve used and leaves a pleasant and subtle scent on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is gentle, and pure.  </li>
            <li> This soap is really just for people with skin problems because they need pure olive oil.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a mild soap that is gentle on the skin and at the same time cleanses well, then this product is right for you.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> this soap is just as gentle.</li>
            <li> She really loves it and it helps her skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing to my skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require a lotion follow up and is very soothing on the skin...</li>
            <li> I have been useing this soap for some time now and really like its resaults</li>
            <li> so much for the benifits of olive oil.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t expect the soap to preserve well, but it really has.</li>
            <li> If you want a cute, pink, flowery perfumed soap this is not for you.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was neat and the delivery time was fast.  </li>
            <li> I really like the scent.</li>
            <li> I bought a whole case.</li>
            <li> I usually use Kiss My Face products, but i like these soap bars even more!  </li>
            <li> It makes you feel clean and moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li> As we get older, our skin gets dryer and this soap really helps to eliminate the winter itchiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite surprised it hasn&#x27;t developed a rancid odor since many olive oil mixed products do over time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this soap online in an attempt to replicate the soaps I purchased abroad, and only after reading many reviews about similar soaps.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Olivella Face and Body Soap.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I recommend highly</li>
            <li> I started using this for my mother who is in her eighties and suffers from skin sensitivities and found it to be very good.</li>
            <li> We live in Louisiana and I take 2 showers a day in the winter and 2 to 3 showers a day the rest of the year.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a natural way to cleanse and soften your skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels very natural and soothing to the skin even in wintertime.</li>
            <li> my dry and itchy skin was pretty much just a memory.</li>
            <li> Before discovering Olivella, my skin was so itchy, especially during the hot summer months, even though I thought I was using a moisturizing soap along with a post-shower slathering of a body lotion.  </li>
            <li> read ewww), I decided to try this Olivella soap, which is all natural and made out just of olive oil..   </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> We use only olive oil soap in our bathrooms, and these bars are very well priced.  </li>
            <li> -- I look young for my age and people always compliment my skin</li>
            <li> and it is all natural.</li>
            <li> It is 100% natural .</li>
            <li> It is also natural.</li>
            <li> It smells like old, musty clay.  </li>
            <li> I subscribed for this soap and was very excited that finally found something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; with a reasonable price, but it was a big disappointment right after the first usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We used another brand of olive oil soap in the past which was similar but had a better smell to it</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and hesitated to purchase a different soap.  </li>
            <li> This soap is the real thing, hardly any fragrance, and gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for me on it&#x27;s own (usually use coconut oil when I get out of the shower because I like my skin super soft), but my skin isn&#x27;t tight and dry if I decide skip the after-shower moisturizing, like it tends to be with other body washes.</li>
            <li> The olive oil does wonders for my older friends too, their skin had been helped by it not to be so dry.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different brands and like them all so far.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this when I was young instead of spending a fortune on expensive face cleansers</li>
            <li> It does not make the face dry and leaves the skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I only use natural, vegan, cruelty-free products and all other natural body washes made my skin itch, or gave me red bumps.</li>
            <li> They may be a little more expensive than regular soaps (I used to use Dove soap which was cheaper), but Olivella soap bars last like twice as much as Dove&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> It is the first soap I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t cause my face to break out with at least one big pimple after every wash</li>
            <li> A heavy bar, lathers well, leaves skin smooth; however, can&#x27;t get past the odor of it.  </li>
            <li> Good price for what us usually and expensive product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of olive oil soap, especially for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this soap especially in the winter when my skin gets dry.  </li>
            <li> Also it leaves my skin soft and not flakey or dried out like regular bar soap</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The soap lasts a really long time too.</li>
            <li> It keeps me from having dry, itchy skin all year long.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling dry and itchy.      </li>
            <li> I have severely dry itchy skin and</li>
            <li> This does have a faint olive oil smell - but coming out of the shower I smell nothing but clean.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I have had to use soap for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> If you want an ugly green soap with  gentle sudsing that is clean rinsing and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry, itchy, or feeling like it has been shrunk in the wash, this is your soap.  </li>
            <li> A must have for winter dry itchy feeling skin!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin partly from medications.</li>
            <li> My wife had dry skin from using other brands of soap and a friend suggested using this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful with what I use on my face.  </li>
            <li> For the past several years my skin had become dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tight and dry .</li>
            <li> Other soaps make my skin itch, but not Olivella.</li>
            <li> I gave a few away and the only complaint i got back</li>
            <li> Softer and no more white flaky skin.</li>
            <li> We wouldn&#x27;t use any other body soap after trying the 1st bar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, because the soap itself leaves skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> there is still a slight fragrance, but not at all overpowering.  </li>
            <li> the quality: the bar develops a thick layer of slime-like sludge after few minutes it is left on a soap dish.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your skin tight like soap does.</li>
            <li> This soap, this brand of olive oil soap, is one of the few things she found she can use.</li>
            <li> becuase it didn&#x27;t have all those harsh chemicals in it, so that didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m adding an update: I bought this in 2013 &amp; shared a few from the package with a friend.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I like it.  </li>
            <li> After a few minutes it began to give me a headache!  </li>
            <li> We use this as our basic soap -- antimicrobial due to the olive oil, so you don&#x27;t have to use that horrible hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> She is diabetic with bad allergies and skin that cracks and gets very rough and chapped looking.</li>
            <li> I guess I picked the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a day at an expensive spa.</li>
            <li> and I found it too dry and the scent is quite awful.</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed with the scent when I received these bars and opened the package.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Soap bar has a substantial olive oil feel when used in the shower.  The fragrance takes some getting used to and I&#x27;m not sure I like it.  We used another brand of olive oil soap in the past which was similar but had a better smell to it so I was disappointed with the scent when I received these bars and opened the package.  Bars seem to clean and moisturize fairly well.</li>
            <li> For the past several years my skin had become dry and itchy. I tried many different kinds and types of soaps and lotions until a friend of mine referred me to this soap. Just after one use I felt my skin improve and after my first bar my dry and itchy skin was pretty much just a memory. This was a welcome relief. I highly recommend Olivella Face and Body Soap.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and hesitated to purchase a different soap.  No concerns now that I have tried it.  My skin loves Olivella Face and Body Soap.  Also, it produces a great lather but seems to last a very long time.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this brand of olive oil soap after reading the great reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I was using Kiss-my-face olive oil soap before and its great but I didn&#x27;t really like the smell.  This soap works the same as Kiss-my-face but has a better smell.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a higher rating than Kiss My Face olive oil soap because of the pleasant smell. Although this product is similar in makeup to Kiss My Face, this one contains glycerin which is well known as a moisturizer. If I had to choose between the two when they are available at a good price, I would choose this one.</li>
            <li> Great value. Pure and clean plant-based soap.</li>
            <li> A good high quality product makes it a great addition to a healthy lifestyle would definitely recommend for yourself, friends, and family.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product on QVC and found I could receive a much better deal from Amazon.  The olive oil in the soap softens your skin and rinses off cleanly.  In the past, I have had to use soap for sensitive skin...this soap is just as gentle. What I like the best is that it can be used on both the face and body with the same great results. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a natural way to cleanse and soften your skin.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This soap is great!    When I found out that regular soaps were made out of animal&#x27;s fat (read ewww), I decided to try this Olivella soap, which is all natural and made out just of olive oil..   I can tell you that my skin is much better now, and I&#x27;m hearing that this product has also anti-aging properties.. wowwww !!!!    Oh yeah one more thing.. these bars of soap last forever! They may be a little more expensive than regular soaps (I used to use Dove soap which was cheaper), but Olivella soap bars last like twice as much as Dove&#x27;s.. so i guess in the end you end up paying the same amount of money, but for a better product!    5 stars!</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  It makes my skin smooth and I don&#x27;t itch anymore.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2-3 years.  I will continue to use this soap.</li>
            <li> Great all-natural soap. I can feel good using it knowing there are no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for several years and have found it to be the most wonderful facial soap!  I suffer with some skin allergies and this product has never irritated me.  I receive many comments about my clear and smooth complexion.  Try it! You&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my mom. She is diabetic with bad allergies and skin that cracks and gets very rough and chapped looking. This soap, this brand of olive oil soap, is one of the few things she found she can use. She really loves it and it helps her skin.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and the way it suds.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing to my skin.  So happy to be able to purchase so much at one time and I can share it with my friends and family.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used it for years it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps his skin from flaking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of olive oil soap, especially for dry winter skin. This soap is the real thing, hardly any fragrance, and gentle on sensitive skin. Price is quite good for pure olive oil.</li>
            <li> Olive oil is so healthful. We use this as our basic soap -- antimicrobial due to the olive oil, so you don&#x27;t have to use that horrible hand sanitizer. Bath bar, basin bar, at the kitchen sink. Moisturizes, too!</li>
            <li> 100% olive oil great condtioner for skin great over all body soap leaves skin feeling and smelling great, puts oil back in skin naturally</li>
            <li> i love this olivella face &amp; body soap. i have used this item for a year &amp; find it to be excellent for both face &amp; body use.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a mild soap that is gentle on the skin and at the same time cleanses well, then this product is right for you. I started using this for my mother who is in her eighties and suffers from skin sensitivities and found it to be very good. I too have begun using it and find it good for all seasons. It does not make the face dry and leaves the skin feeling soft. I would recommend Olivella to anyone looking for a good face and body soap.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap, I bought a bar at the gift shop at a vineyard once, this was such a better price.</li>
            <li> If you have skin allergies this is the soap for you! It is great and smells great and keeps the agitation away if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have ever used.It makes you feel clean and moisturizing at the same time.I have tried the kiss my face olive soap and I found it too dry and the scent is quite awful.So I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a good quality olive soap.I found buying this soap on Amazon to be the cheapest because I get free shipping and no tax since I live in CA</li>
            <li> love the fragrance, love the lather.  I usually use Kiss My Face products, but i like these soap bars even more!  Relatively good value for olive oil soap, too.</li>
            <li> I use this soap once a week (dudu osun and alaffia the other 6 days) and this soap has amazing moisture! It doesn&#x27;t require a lotion follow up and is very soothing on the skin... A must have for winter dry itchy feeling skin!</li>
            <li> The bar is a good size for hand washing and shower use and the product is great for all skin types, I have very dry skin and it does a great job for me. The olive oil does wonders for my older friends too, their skin had been helped by it not to be so dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have dry, sensitive skin.  I used it as my soap and it even replaced my shaving cream.  I even got my husband to use it in the shower as well.  We live in Louisiana and I take 2 showers a day in the winter and 2 to 3 showers a day the rest of the year.  This soap left my skin moisturized and hydrated.  Also, there is no offensive smell.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, we stopped using this soap because it clogged up our pipes.  We had to have a plumber come out and see what the problem was.  It was just the master bath shower and the pipes were coated with what looked like coagulated oil (like the coagulated fat in the frying pan after you fry bacon).  It was horrible!  We wanted to keep using this soap but if we did, it would clog up our plumbing at home.</li>
            <li> My wife had dry skin from using other brands of soap and a friend suggested using this soap. It was a hit and the only one she&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  This is the only bath soap my husband will use.  As we get older, our skin gets dryer and this soap really helps to eliminate the winter itchiness.</li>
            <li> Love all the natural ingredients. This is all my family has used for many, many years. We cannot not stand the strong fragrances in regular bar soap.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m careful with what I use on my face.  This is gentle, and pure.  It leaves my face feeling soft.  It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Face never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> Met my expections. A good product!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of these soaps.  They perform well as soaps, but the smell is what I love most.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years.  It keeps me from having dry, itchy skin all year long. The bars are long-lasting in the shower.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tight and dry . It also leaves no scent, even though the bar of soap itself has a musky smell. My skin looks and feel so much better. I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Some people say the soap has a musty smell, but I love this  product. Other soaps make my skin itch, but not Olivella. My skin always feels smooth and soft. No itching.</li>
            <li> We use only olive oil soap in our bathrooms, and these bars are very well priced.  The scent is very good, not overpowering, and the soap is gentile on our skin.  Good price for what us usually and expensive product.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or sensitive skin, you will love this! For your face and body! I have been using Olivella bar soap as a face and body wash since my mom bought it for the house -- must have been over 6 years ago. I only use natural, vegan, cruelty-free products and all other natural body washes made my skin itch, or gave me red bumps. It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for me on it&#x27;s own (usually use coconut oil when I get out of the shower because I like my skin super soft), but my skin isn&#x27;t tight and dry if I decide skip the after-shower moisturizing, like it tends to be with other body washes. It lathers and gets you squeaky clean. I&#x27;m so glad I found this when I was young instead of spending a fortune on expensive face cleansers -- I look young for my age and people always compliment my skin -- I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s only because of Olivella, but that&#x27;s the only thing that has remained constant throughout the years of my skincare regimen. Enjoy : )</li>
            <li> I have been useing this soap for some time now and really like its resaults and it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Soap has excellent moisture content for dry skin and a light fragence. Cost of product is well below the QVC price, which is where I first heard of the item. Overall just a great moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li> This product contians LYE... so much for the benifits of olive oil. It leaves your skin feeling dry and itchy.      Now I remember why I stopped buying things on the internet.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. Especially if you have dry skin. I gave a few away and the only complaint i got back was it didn&#x27;t lather. Well, i figure it didn&#x27;t lather up becuase it didn&#x27;t have all those harsh chemicals in it, so that didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I think it is a great product and i put a bar in each bathroom for the wonderful smell.  I certainly would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  It makes me feel refreshed.  Great value. Shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Over the years we have tried many soap products including selling some.  This by far is the best we ever used.  A bit pricey however well worth it.</li>
            <li> Great soap! I have severely dry itchy skin and this soap does what it says.  It is mild without stripping out my skin or leaving it feeling caked with residue. It does run brown in the water from the olives but I don&#x27;t mind.  I&#x27;ve been using expensive skincare for a while now and am extremely happy to have found a better product at muchhhh better pricing!</li>
            <li> My skin feels great since beginning to use this product.  Softer and no more white flaky skin. Love it and recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> Only soap that my husband can use that does not make him itch.</li>
            <li> Great product and I am glad I discovered it. It does not leave your skin tight like soap does. I also personally love the scent and I love that it is made from olives. It feels very natural and soothing to the skin even in wintertime. It also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great clean feel.  I&#x27;m hooked on this soap especially in the winter when my skin gets dry.  Try it and you&#x27;ll be hooked too.</li>
            <li> Great for you skin and has a  light smell does not have a heavy perfume smell.do not leave it in a soap dish with water it will dissolve.</li>
            <li> This is the only body soap I will ever use.  Before discovering Olivella, my skin was so itchy, especially during the hot summer months, even though I thought I was using a moisturizing soap along with a post-shower slathering of a body lotion.  The bar is very long-lasting and has a pleasant fresh aroma.</li>
            <li> I only buy this soap. It is 100% natural . The price is right and the vendor shipped the product quickly .</li>
            <li> This does have a faint olive oil smell - but coming out of the shower I smell nothing but clean.  I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s slimpy - simply soapy.  It lasts well but most importantly my dry skin is much better.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a pack of 12 for $25.99 &amp; this price makes the soap worth the money.  It has a faint pleasant scent &amp; does leave skin softer than most soaps. When it comes to bath tub rings &amp; residue, it also leaves a bit more than usual, but at about $2 a bar it is a pretty good purchase.  Appears to have fewer allergy aggravating ingredients than most.  After bathing you can skip moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4-21-15 I&#x27;m adding an update: I bought this in 2013 &amp; shared a few from the package with a friend.  I use it daily &amp; still have a couple of bars left. I&#x27;m quite surprised it hasn&#x27;t developed a rancid odor since many olive oil mixed products do over time.  My home is 80 degrees in Summer so I didn&#x27;t expect the soap to preserve well, but it really has.</li>
            <li> If you want a cute, pink, flowery perfumed soap this is not for you.  If you want an ugly green soap with  gentle sudsing that is clean rinsing and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry, itchy, or feeling like it has been shrunk in the wash, this is your soap.  I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin or that has a contact allergy to many soaps like I do.  It is the first soap I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t cause my face to break out with at least one big pimple after every wash and I&#x27;m 64 !  Oh, this is sold at a good price too.</li>
            <li> A heavy bar, lathers well, leaves skin smooth; however, can&#x27;t get past the odor of it.  After a few minutes it began to give me a headache!  The smell lingers on the skin also.  It&#x27;s too bad, because the soap itself leaves skin smooth.  I&#x27;d recommend buying and trying just one bar before ordering more.  I had to return it for the fragrance problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later update - I wrote a comment about this soap on Olivella&#x27;s facebook page and asked about unscented soap.  They do make it, so I bought some and it is very good.  there is still a slight fragrance, but not at all overpowering.  The soap leaves my face smooth and moist, no drying effect, which says something, as I live in Arizona!</li>
            <li> We love this soap so much that we keep coming back for more.  We always buy from the same seller on Amazon and, we are obviously very pleased.  We wouldn&#x27;t use any other body soap after trying the 1st bar.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Olivella Face and Body soap for about 2 years now and love it. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like most soaps I&#x27;ve used and leaves a pleasant and subtle scent on the skin. This is the only body soap I use now.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> keeps my skin moisturized with a pleasant earthy scent.  It&#x27;s a good value.  Love this product!  Would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Good service.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap because of the odor. It is a good soap for allergies to strong odors. It is also natural.</li>
            <li> The packaging was neat and the delivery time was fast.  When I opened the box I couldn&#x27;t wait to use the first bar I took out.  It smelled so nice and made my skin feel and look better.  I am happy that I bought this soap!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  No need for after bath moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  This is the second time I have bought and will keep buying from this vendor.  Great service and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This soap is really just for people with skin problems because they need pure olive oil.  I found the smell of this soap to be putridly offensive.  It smells like old, musty clay.  I have purchased pure olive oil soaps in both Greece and Italy, and they smelled quite pleasant.  I purchased this soap online in an attempt to replicate the soaps I purchased abroad, and only after reading many reviews about similar soaps.  I guess I picked the wrong one.  Does anyone have any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, very good for your skin. I recommend highly</li>
            <li> Olivella products are great.  Haven&#x27;t found any I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> The best of the best.  They produce both scented and unscented for those who don&#x27;t like the scent.  I love the scent and everything about it.  I give these bars to my friends to try (the really good ones).</li>
            <li> I use only olive oil soap. I have been trying different brands and like them all so far.  I am currently using this Italian olive oil soap on my face and in the shower.  This is a good olive oil soap at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This soap had a very strong, perfumed scent that didn&#x27;t quite agree with me. It was so strong I could smell it through both the outer and inner boxes. It&#x27;s definitely not Papoutsanis olive oil soap, and so I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I subscribed for this soap and was very excited that finally found something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; with a reasonable price, but it was a big disappointment right after the first usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, no one in our family liked the smell: it&#x27;s too powdery and strong and definitely not refreshing. In fact I would prefer if it was unscented instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the quality: the bar develops a thick layer of slime-like sludge after few minutes it is left on a soap dish. I first thought it will go away and it&#x27;s just the first use, but the sludge kept being generated over and over. I then thought it might be the soap-dish, thus left the bar on a wired shelf over night and found the sludge was still there in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be a unique property of the olive-based soaps and others might be fine with it, however -- even if it is unique property -- it&#x27;s unacceptable for us. I even have a notion that the sludge might build up inside the drainage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 2 stars then? I liked how it is treated the skin which felt soft and moisture-balanced. I wish it smelled better and didn&#x27;t have the sludge, then I would definitely buy this soap and recommend others.</li>
            <li> I like this soap because I&#x27;m allergic to sulfates and this soap doesn&#x27;t contain any. Also it leaves my skin soft and not flakey or dried out like regular bar soap does. I really like the scent. It smells like a day at an expensive spa. I think the price point makes it a good value. I bought a whole case. The soap lasts a really long time too.</li>
            <li> Almost nothing deserves 5 stars but this soap is really great. I have very dry skin partly from medications. This soap helps a good deal and it even makes and old-timer like me smell good!!</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL, SUPERB, WHAT MORE DO I NEED TO SAY. GREAT SKIN MOISTURIZER AND BODY MOISTURIZER. IT&#x27;S SOOTHING TO THE SKIN AND DOES NOT LEAVE A FILMSY AFTER EFFECT.</li>
            <li> Have really enjoyed the moisture received from the soap...very refreshing!  My husband said, &amp;#34;No more itchy skin&amp;#34;.  What else could you ask for?</li>
