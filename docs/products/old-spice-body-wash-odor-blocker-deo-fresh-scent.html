            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>Excellent product!!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a win for me!!</li>
            <li>best product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is especially good for those who workout and are concerned about body odor.  </li>
            <li>Great product,</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great.  </li>
            <li>Works great..</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and lasts.</li>
            <li>Great pruduct .</li>
            <li>I wake up smelling just as good as I did after getting out of the shower the night before.</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, this is not some miracle soap. \\&quot;Hotties\\</li>
            <li>My best friend prefers to the scent of \\&quot;Pure Sport\\&quot; but to each their own!</li>
            <li>A sure winner.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I personally love the smell of this one.  </li>
            <li>I used to LOVE the odor blocker and the scent lasted all day</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I think it does block some odor, but if you&#x27;re sweating a lot as I sometimes do, then it&#x27;s not going to magically make your sweat smell like honey.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this, and it does linger for a bit.  </li>
            <li>But this body wash is different - it smells absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li>It does foam up quite well like most of the Body Washes I have tried.</li>
            <li>Also this is a great price for two bottles and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Smelled great and not too much suds.</li>
            <li>Will get more.</li>
            <li>it smells so good and man when i first started using it..</li>
            <li>The great manly scent of Old Spice is unbeatable!</li>
            <li>it make my whole bathroom smell good and not i smell like i have cologne on....</li>
            <li>To my surprise it was very appealing to me, the scent is actually strong and positive (Something that is really needed after a good work out).</li>
            <li>Worry not, with this product you can leave the gym smelling just fine.  </li>
            <li>It does in fact leave your body smelling great for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>Lightly sweating?  </li>
            <li>Their stuff always had that cheap men&#x27;s-cologne scent.  </li>
            <li>This is what i would expect from a good brand like Old Spice.</li>
            <li>This stuff is a notch above the rest and is always handy to keep in my gym bag for a nice shower after a sweaty workout.  </li>
            <li>Make it nice and fresh to your meetings on a hot summer day</li>
            <li>The first time you use this body wash, the fragrance may be seem overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It cleans and smells good but doesn&#x27;t last like it used to</li>
            <li>it makes you smell so good and takes away that musky smell totally away.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and spicy with a fresh \\&quot;green\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>The scent however, just seems to elude me and is rather non distinct, yet very powerful.</li>
            <li>After the amazing Social Media Ads (Silverfish Hand Catch!)</li>
            <li>To my surprise, the Old Spice Deoderant was the first Deoderant to work effectively on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my son commented on how it keeps him fresh.</li>
            <li>&quot; are not going to pounce you where you stand in aww of your scent.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend uses this product, and while the fragrance is strong, (to the guy who gave this product 1 star for having an overly strong scent) that is what makes it last the \\&quot;16</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s sort of the purpose of the product, right?  </li>
            <li>It is almost like the Pure Sport but has a sweet aroma to it.</li>
            <li>However, it definitely does make you smell better</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product was when I bought it on lack of options at an Airport.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal to me, but it can be to others if the bottle had leaked more than just 15%.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I asked for...</li>
            <li>But it goes away quickly and you are left with a clean fresh scent that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to assume that it&#x27;s good for the skin (at least not bad...).  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you&#x27;re hopping into bed with someone right after your shower, they may very well compliment you.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite body wash and by far Old Spice&#x27;s</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big guy at 6&#x27;1 and over 200 lbs and this keeps me smelling fresh and clean all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know a lot about skin care, but I know that if my skin feels dry before my shower, it certainly feels better afterwards</li>
            <li>Using this product will permeate the whole house with it&#x27;s overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you can&#x27;t handle the scent of a real man this might not be for you.</li>
            <li>Really lasts all day.</li>
            <li>but this time it is not any better than any other body wash.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s pretty far fetched.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is, however, going to get you clean, and if you have unique odor problems that other washes from the likes of Axe, Gillette, or Molton-Brown simply do not address, this just might be the wash for you.</li>
            <li>It really does not seem that is in the Old Spice traditional, but it is powerful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through a half-dozen brands or so of \\&quot;Male Centric Body Washes and Deoderants\\&quot; trying to find something that would actually work my own body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Old Spice is unbeatable!</li>
            <li>Just a bit from that small bottle was enough to keep him smelling amazing through out the day.</li>
            <li>on the part of Old Spice I decided to give their products a try despite the, well, stigma that Old Spice is what my Grandfather used.</li>
            <li>But it definitely doesn&#x27;t live up to the number of hours it sates on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have to use two times as much product as with the Gillette Dry Skin Hydrator Body Wash.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different soaps out there, including Axe, Dove, etc, and Old Spice is the one to beat!&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the Old Spice Body Wash has a nice scent, I am disappointed in how much I have to use each shower.  </li>

            <li> I ordered this 2 pack since shopping around local stores for this specific product is tedious.</li>
            <li> My only ding on the product is its relatively weak lathering ability.  </li>
            <li> I usually shower twice a day (on gym days at least) and this has no problem taking care of any odor.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s tough to say.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely go crazy when he uses this.</li>
            <li> Too bad if so.</li>

            <li> While the Old Spice Body Wash has a nice scent, I am disappointed in how much I have to use each shower.  I feel like I have to use two times as much product as with the Gillette Dry Skin Hydrator Body Wash.  I&#x27;ve tried different types of ways to apply it too.  I&#x27;m going back to the Gillette body wash.</li>
            <li> Using this product will permeate the whole house with it&#x27;s overpowering scent. I guess their idea of odor blocking is to burn out everyone&#x27;s sense of smell with this industrial strength aroma. I don&#x27;t think this strategy has been used since the eighteenth century.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses this product, and while the fragrance is strong, (to the guy who gave this product 1 star for having an overly strong scent) that is what makes it last the \\&quot;16 hours\\&quot;. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Awesome! The great manly scent of Old Spice is unbeatable! A sure winner. Don&#x27;t leave home without it! Awesome! Old Spice is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> For some reason this is not a product that the chain stores carry. However with 3 teenage boys living in my home I love this product. I use it myself now as well. I do not like wearing deodorant to bed after showering at night, with this body wash I no longer have too. I wake up smelling just as good as I did after getting out of the shower the night before. Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s sort of the purpose of the product, right?  It does in fact leave your body smelling great for the entire day.  I usually shower twice a day (on gym days at least) and this has no problem taking care of any odor.  My room will have a pile of dirty gym smell funk to it, and after my shower, I leave the bathroom door open and my room smells amazing for at least an hour, perhaps longer (if I keep the door closed).  I don&#x27;t know a lot about skin care, but I know that if my skin feels dry before my shower, it certainly feels better afterwards so I&#x27;m going to assume that it&#x27;s good for the skin (at least not bad...).  Great product, and I personally love the smell of this one.  My best friend prefers to the scent of \\&quot;Pure Sport\\&quot; but to each their own!</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE the odor blocker and the scent lasted all day but this time it is not any better than any other body wash. It cleans and smells good but doesn&#x27;t last like it used to</li>
            <li> This is what i would expect from a good brand like Old Spice. It smells good and my son commented on how it keeps him fresh. I also ordered the Deo Sport Scent. He likes them both. That&#x27;s a win for me!! Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great.  Does it work for 16 hours?  Maybe for someone but that&#x27;s pretty far fetched.  However, it definitely does make you smell better and it does work for several hours.  My girlfriend even thinks I&#x27;m wearing cologne sometimes after I&#x27;ve used it.  This is definitely my favorite body wash and by far Old Spice&#x27;s best product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how well it actually BLOCKS odor?  That&#x27;s tough to say.  I think it does block some odor, but if you&#x27;re sweating a lot as I sometimes do, then it&#x27;s not going to magically make your sweat smell like honey.  Lightly sweating?  Yup, it&#x27;ll definitely help.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this, and it does linger for a bit.  Perhaps if you&#x27;re hopping into bed with someone right after your shower, they may very well compliment you.  But it definitely doesn&#x27;t live up to the number of hours it sates on the bottle.  Gillette has a similar product, I&#x27;ve noticed its scent lasts longer than this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for years. Works great..</li>
            <li> In this day in age be it body wash or deodorant, your body&#x27;s bacteria will adapt and you&#x27;ll stink regardless.  This stuff is a notch above the rest and is always handy to keep in my gym bag for a nice shower after a sweaty workout.  My fiance especially likes when I use this stuff after a long night of crown royal and miller lite.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and lasts. Its getting harder to get. They might of discontinued it. Too bad if so.</li>
            <li> i like that it smells so good and man when i first started using it..it make my whole bathroom smell good and not i smell like i have cologne on....it makes you smell so good and takes away that musky smell totally away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a half-dozen brands or so of \\&quot;Male Centric Body Washes and Deoderants\\&quot; trying to find something that would actually work my own body chemistry. After the amazing Social Media Ads (Silverfish Hand Catch!) on the part of Old Spice I decided to give their products a try despite the, well, stigma that Old Spice is what my Grandfather used. To my surprise, the Old Spice Deoderant was the first Deoderant to work effectively on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body wash? It works too. Since I started using it I&#x27;ve had multiple people comment that they can indeed smell a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, this is not some miracle soap. \\&quot;Hotties\\&quot; are not going to pounce you where you stand in aww of your scent. It is, however, going to get you clean, and if you have unique odor problems that other washes from the likes of Axe, Gillette, or Molton-Brown simply do not address, this just might be the wash for you.</li>
            <li> I have never liked the scent of any Old Spice products over the years. Their stuff always had that cheap men&#x27;s-cologne scent.  Yuk. But this body wash is different - it smells absolutely wonderful! Very fresh and spicy with a fresh \\&quot;green\\&quot; scent. My husband loves it because it works on deodorizing his \\&quot;parts,\\&quot; without leaving a soap film on the inside of the shower (and on him) like bar soaps do. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product was when I bought it on lack of options at an Airport. To my surprise it was very appealing to me, the scent is actually strong and positive (Something that is really needed after a good work out). So as a follow up I ordered this 2 pack since shopping around local stores for this specific product is tedious. The issue was when I got the package one of the bottles opened in transit, due to no extra measures were taken to assure their seal. I lost about 15% of one bottle, the other was unopened. Not a big deal to me, but it can be to others if the bottle had leaked more than just 15%.</li>
            <li> Great pruduct . Odor blocks for the sweaty days. No mor sweat marks under your oksels. Make it nice and fresh to your meetings on a hot summer day</li>
            <li> This Body Wash has an ethereal scent. It is almost like the Pure Sport but has a sweet aroma to it. It really does not seem that is in the Old Spice traditional, but it is powerful. It does foam up quite well like most of the Body Washes I have tried. The scent however, just seems to elude me and is rather non distinct, yet very powerful.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I asked for...</li>
            <li> This review is from a girl&#x27;s perspective. I initially bought a trial size of this for my boyfriend and so he tried it out. Just a bit from that small bottle was enough to keep him smelling amazing through out the day. I absolutely go crazy when he uses this. Personally I don&#x27;t find the smell over powering. Maybe if you can&#x27;t handle the scent of a real man this might not be for you. If you want to smell like a man, use this! Ladies, if you want your boyfriend/husband to smell irresistible, have him use this! Also this is a great price for two bottles and the shipping was fast. I will be buying from here again.</li>
            <li> The first time you use this body wash, the fragrance may be seem overwhelming. But it goes away quickly and you are left with a clean fresh scent that lasts all day.  This is especially good for those who workout and are concerned about body odor.  Worry not, with this product you can leave the gym smelling just fine.  My only ding on the product is its relatively weak lathering ability.  But it&#x27;s enough to do the job.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a year and will continue to use it.  It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores so thanks to Amazon for carrying this!</li>
            <li> Product was on time and worked as expected. Smelled great and not too much suds. Really lasts all day. Will get more.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different soaps out there, including Axe, Dove, etc, and Old Spice is the one to beat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big guy at 6&#x27;1 and over 200 lbs and this keeps me smelling fresh and clean all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend over and over again!</li>
