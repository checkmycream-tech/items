            <li>Super nice color and texture....</li>
            <li>The color is also very flattering on someone that is fair skinned with light colored hair.</li>
            <li>I tried it on and it looked a lot better on me since my skin is a lot darker, the color is kind of a natural lip color but better.</li>
            <li>I love it;):)</li>
            <li>but I use a light brown lips liner so</li>
            <li>Because this is a color that honestly will only look good on certain skin tones.</li>
            <li>Now its mine number one go to lipstick, most definitely I will be buying more :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love matte colors, and this mauve is almost exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not a bad color.</li>
            <li>I wanted a bit more of a darker color, but it comes out a little more lighter on my lips; however, I still love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect matte dusty pink and has great staying power for the price.</li>
            <li>i suggest looking up some swatches first.</li>
            <li>I got because I wanted a mauve color and this product is EXACTLY what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It is really matte, I&#x27;ve never used matte lipstick before</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>very creamy lipstick.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Frequently dupes for higher priced name brands.</li>
            <li>I bought this lipstick for my sister and i to share, my sister is a lot more pale than me</li>
            <li>Long lasting color, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>so when she tried it on she looked like an old 70&#x27;s grandma.</li>
            <li>Haha the color was just to pink for her.</li>

            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips and it stays all day</li>
            <li> it is a browny mauve colour with a hint of pink.</li>
            <li> but it turned out to be a little darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> A little bit on the pink side.</li>
            <li> It suits my slightly darker skin tone but its a little pink</li>
            <li> So disappointed as that shade is so good, this one is a fail.</li>

            <li> I love the color and the the texture of this lipstick.</li>
            <li> Wrong color.  This is not the color from the nude palette that I read it was.  So disappointed as that shade is so good, this one is a fail.</li>

            <li> So I have never tried matte lipstick, but I can say now I absolutely love matte lipsticks I am now going to purchase more of them. The color is great it goes with my skin tone, it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips and it stays all day, I don&#x27;t have to be reapplying it throughout the day. Now its mine number one go to lipstick, most definitely I will be buying more :)</li>

            <li> I bought this lipstick for my sister and i to share, my sister is a lot more pale than me so when she tried it on she looked like an old 70&#x27;s grandma. Haha the color was just to pink for her. I tried it on and it looked a lot better on me since my skin is a lot darker, the color is kind of a natural lip color but better. If your gonna get this lipstick i suggest looking up some swatches first. Because this is a color that honestly will only look good on certain skin tones.</li>

I wanted a bit more of a darker color, but it comes out a little more lighter on my lips; however, I still love it. I seem to find myself putting it on even on no makeup days.....Which is almost everyday now. Haha.</li>
