            <li>Awesome!  </li>
            <li>Smells great!  </li>
            <li>Maybe the very best house deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It pains me not to give these bricks 5 stars because they smell so wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product because it smells wonderful</li>
            <li>Perfect refill for the smoker</li>

            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>This is very good incense that I use often.</li>
            <li>nose may not recognize the pine as well as yours, so if you want to give this a try, I can at l;east promise you that this is otherwise a very good quality incense.</li>
            <li>The product is well packed and the quality is very good.</li>
            <li>Once you use this product, you will know it will be used for years to come -- it&#x27;s that good!</li>

            <li>These give a great ambiance.  </li>
            <li>The smell of pinon burning in a fireplace or camp fire is just amazing; delicious.  </li>
            <li>What a great smell.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>All of the products from Incienso de Santa Fe are AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I love pinon incense and this is the best ever!</li>
            <li>Really nice smell!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to describe the pleasant aroma this Pinon incense has.  </li>
            <li>I use it with my electric fireplace and the effect is so pleasant and calming.  </li>
            <li>If you like the smell of pi単on, this is a good buy</li>
            <li>Smells so good though I would buy again .</li>
            <li>There was a fair amount of wood dust in the bottom of the bag, but I haven&#x27;t had any problem with any bricks disintegrating.  </li>
            <li>After it was burned out, the odor was no longer good.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>These smell good, but they will NOT stay lit no matter what I do.</li>
            <li>They smell good, makes you feel like you&#x27;re camping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with both purchases.  </li>
            <li>My very favorite incense and</li>
            <li>We have burned this brand for over 30 years and are still very pleased with its aroma.</li>
            <li>GREAT incense, LOVE this, burns well, smells like you are camping or a fireplace.</li>
            <li>A reorder favorite!</li>
            <li>Another favorite!  </li>
            <li>I have dogs that run in and out of the house and this incense helps keep my house enjoyable!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this scent!  </li>
            <li>The pi単on is my favorite scent !  </li>
            <li>and I am absolutely in love with them!</li>
            <li>She was very excited and loves the scent too!</li>
            <li>I liked the ones in the sample box</li>
            <li>Wintery &amp; warm.    </li>
            <li>Still, the scent is nice and woodsy.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t buy incense often, preferring to burn my own herbs for smudge.  </li>
            <li>I realize that most people loved this incense which is why I got it</li>
            <li>This has a nice woody scent, like a campfire.  </li>
            <li>Does anyone know pine incense with nice smell?</li>
            <li>I always have a box of this handy.</li>
            <li>I had purchased some of the Pinon incense many years ago while on a trip out west and am very glad to find it again.  </li>
            <li>The bricks also break very easily.</li>
            <li>Burns completely and provides a wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li>Good incense, but it did not burn as evenly as the supply that came with the &amp;#34;Incense of the west&amp;#34; burner originally.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it in Amazon, I&#x27;ve missed it, such a great scent.</li>
            <li>I can see why someone may think this smells too much like a campfire, but if you enjoy the smell of pinion burning, this stuff is wonderful and authentic.</li>
            <li>Great southwest scent that fills the whole house with a relaxing aroma...wish each brick lasted longer!</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this brand I was in Santa Fe; I am so happy to be able to purchase it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>All blocks were easy to ignite and burned completely with a wonderful aroma of desert pine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my inlaws commented on the great smell of a real fire</li>
            <li>Love these incense sticks - they smell just like burning pinon wood and remind me of my home away from home, Santa Fe.  </li>
            <li>Will order more when running out of them.</li>
            <li>Love you, dear &amp;#34;land of enchantment&amp;#34; and I always will.</li>
            <li>It smells like a more refined version of a campfire in the desert.</li>
            <li>husband sets one in front of the air intake so that the air conditioner blows the lovely smell through the house.</li>
            <li>I found this incense and from all the reviews hoped that I would get that authentic NM aroma.</li>
            <li>I will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>For me, while this stuff is burning it&#x27;s ok, smells alot like a wood</li>
            <li>I love this incense.</li>
            <li>You use to be able to buy it at Pier 1 but not anymore.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>Oh I just love them.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Gave to a friend of mine in Yoga, who love&#x27;s NM.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s going, it&#x27;s got a really lovely fragrance</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to find it again!</li>
            <li>Have had these for years love the smell of pinion wood burning</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>but once I run out, I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>The flowing robes, the grace, bald... striking.</li>
            <li>I love this incense.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>scent is just OK.</li>
            <li>once again, what I have come to love.</li>
            <li>although I&#x27;m really satisfied with both products, this one is the winner.</li>
            <li>There is better incense out there.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this product until the day that I die.</li>
            <li>This scent smells like wood more than the scent of Pinon.</li>
            <li>My favorite to burn on rainy days in az.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed them.</li>
            <li>They r intoxicating love the scent and the feel.</li>
            <li>The saving grace for this product is that it has a pretty good (pine) smell.</li>
            <li>and I felt in love with it, I&#x27;m not one for cones as much, but this smells so earthy good</li>
            <li>The incense smells just like a fire with natural wood and is great.  </li>
            <li>Light this on a rainy day and magic amplifies.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be real pinon wood.</li>
            <li>And the bricks fall over easily because of the shape .</li>
            <li>shipped very quickly</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of fresh pi&amp;ntilde;on--you will love this incense.  </li>
            <li>When they do get going they burn very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Too often incense smells strongly of a chemical perfume</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong.</li>
            <li>but also it is STRONG.  </li>
            <li>So many great real wood choices for real wood smells.  </li>
            <li>This brings back so many wonderful memories of living in Albuquerque, New Mexico......</li>
            <li>The best way around this is to use an incense burner with little charcoal briquettes and place the pinon brick on that.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;Pinon\\&quot; incense makes you feel like you&#x27;re in a mountainous cabin in a forest with a huge fire burning in the hearth.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Incense of the West fan.</li>
            <li>Great product - the same as I had bought in Santa F.  </li>
            <li>Now, I just light up this incense and the atmosphere becomes,</li>
            <li>If you enjoy the smell of burning wood like I do...</li>
            <li>The bricks do not always burn completely (95% burn) but the aroma is really good.</li>
            <li>Just bought one box last week, and I just ordered two more!!</li>
            <li>It reminds me of going sledding on a beautiful winter&#x27;s day and taking in the smell of cozy, indoor fires burning as we played. :)</li>
            <li>(A bit more &amp;#34;crumbly.&amp;#34;)  </li>
            <li>Great all winter long here in Wisconsin.</li>
            <li>We bought some of this when we traveled to the Grand Canyon last year - ran out and had to have more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s unique fragrance eliminates household odors and makes the house feel clean.</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely amazing, very natural with no chemical scent I could pick up.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how many positive reviews this has gotten.</li>
            <li>I love the completely pure smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like what most people would call incense.  </li>
            <li>that I don&#x27;t mind, you may have to keep relighting it, as it can go out quick.</li>
            <li>Words cannot adequately describe their smell.  </li>
            <li>Once it does burn it is quickly gone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong so use in a well ventilated space and make certain you have something on which to burn bricks of incense.  </li>
            <li>I live in an apartment without a fireplace, but this adds the smell and enjoyable qualities of a fireplace.</li>
            <li>you can easily buy some charcoal and after it&#x27;s lit, sprinkle the dust on top of the red coal.  </li>
            <li>The little adobe house to burn this in is great too.</li>
            <li>Also the smell won&#x27;t linger super long in your space which is a benefit for many people as not everyone likes strong earthy smells.</li>
            <li>4 stars because it is tricky to get them to light sufficiently to smoke without burning them too much.  </li>
            <li>When I turn on the gas fireplace I light this incense to make it smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li>one brick usually clears the air of any pet or cooking scents and replaces with this beautiful pinon (without leaving me smelling like the firepit, I might add).</li>
            <li>But this one has an authentic, natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>each brick is well lit as per the instructions before inserting into the burner, but even still they rarely burn all the way through.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The crumbs, burnt all at once on a charcoal disk, give a nice if brief burst of aromatic smoke.</li>
            <li>A perfect reminder of past trips to New Mexico.</li>
            <li>Light this incense, close your eyes, and you will think you are in New Mexico!</li>
            <li>, it smells more like a campfire with a little pitch and tar, sounds gross, but smells great.</li>
            <li>Makes the whole house smell like a sweet, smoky campfire.</li>
            <li>I like them, especially for the price, buy they don&#x27;t have the rich smell I&#x27;ve experienced with other incense sticks that are made with a rougher texture.</li>
            <li>I find they are easier to light on the broken edge (more surface area and nooks and crannies to burn) and they still fill up the entire room with the great scent without being too smoky.  </li>
            <li>Next time, I should just buy a case of these! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been, it really smells like this there!</li>
            <li>I love the scent and couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere locally in the Northwest US.</li>
            <li>This incense takes me back to the southwest where i lived for many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this was has a peaceful calming affect I feel.</li>
            <li>but I also realize most of those same people mentioned Santa Fe.  </li>
            <li>A first quality product.</li>
            <li>This product brought back many memories.</li>
            <li>I made my first purchase of it on the Cherokee Reservation in SC.  </li>
            <li>The fireplace is nice, and has a heater and remote control.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m on the first tee with him.</li>
            <li>The incense smells wonderful, but each small cube only burns for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It smells like that first smell of winter from people lighting their wood burning fireplaces.</li>
            <li>I love these dearly, but what on earth can replace the rarity altogether of New Mexico&#x27;s evenings, storms, early dawn, snow, starlight, etc?  </li>
            <li>how about a little something, you know, for the effort, you know.&amp;#34; And he says, &amp;#34;Oh, uh, there won&#x27;t be any money, but when you die, on your deathbed, you will receive total consciousness.&amp;#34; So I got that goin&#x27; for me, which is nice, and these wonderful little insense bricks.</li>
            <li>The other scents are also nice.</li>
            <li>Such warm soft smells wash over your soul in sacred ceremony</li>
            <li>I ordered three different scents of this product and enjoyed each one till I noticed the cones left in the plastic bag in the box were disintegrating into fine sawdust.</li>
            <li>The full brick is also much harder to light.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of Pinon incense and these are exactly what I expected and the bricks burn evenly.</li>
            <li>These transport me back to New Mexico every time I light one up!</li>
            <li>Finding good incense is hard.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not as smoky and overly aromatic like other products, and they light up rather quickly.</li>
            <li>These burn SO fast.</li>
            <li>Much faster than the ones that come in the sampler</li>
            <li>and I had to explain that they were really gas logs and that i was burning incense.</li>
            <li>Bought these Pinon bricks to burn while my electric fireplace is on...works just wonderful...makes it seem like a real fire..</li>
            <li>Blocks emit real smoke, the scent of pine .</li>
            <li>I got really fast service from the supplier.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to anyone who loves incense and woodsy, campfire scents!</li>
            <li>Also this always arrives relatively fast.</li>
            <li>If you do not know what a brick of incense is, then you may not be ready for Incensio.</li>
            <li>Scent was ok but cone wouldn&#x27;t put out the expected smokey scent.</li>
            <li>Was fast.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t produce too much smoke.</li>
            <li>I got this in Arizona when i was hiking near the Grand Canyon last winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for this for such a long time, so I am so glad to have found it here on Amazon! 8^)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a unique smell.</li>
            <li>I also like other incense but found this one is enjoyed by a wider range of people.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use charcoal made for incense or hookah, you should never use BBQ charcoal inside of a home due to the high amount of carbon monoxide it</li>
            <li>Personally, I find that it burns up too quickly at 15 min per \\&quot;cone\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>lights up fine, smokes like cray cray and gets all up in my business as I expected it would.</li>
            <li>The aroma is not unpleasant, but to me it simply is not reminiscent of pinon wood I smelled burning in New Mexico.</li>
            <li>When you walk into my house after lighting one, the aroma is very homey and natural smelling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been to the southwest, nor know exactly how Pinon wood should smell like when it burns, but it definitely smells better than your average campfire in Indiana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not an everyday enjoyable incense.</li>
            <li>I put the incense in an incense holder right next to the insert.  </li>
            <li>The bricks don&#x27;t come with any kind of holder, and laying them on a flat surface like a typical cone burner is a guarantee that any part touching the surface won&#x27;t burn (unlike a cone, which burns down completely).</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t had time to open up the box and use it (I still have some left over from my last stash), but I believe this to be the exact same kind I was trying to match.</li>
            <li>it makes me recall a trip to the New Mexico desert.</li>
            <li>I grew up with a wood burning fireplace but now live in a house with gas fireplace.</li>
            <li>If you love the cozy smell of a fire burning in a fireplace, get these!</li>
            <li>I just hope the formula gets fixed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for something that smells like fresh pine without being chemical based.</li>
            <li>These are small little incense that burn and give of a very nice smell as it burns in our chimenea.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love incense, and usually burn it at least once or more every day.  </li>
            <li>Like many, I stumbled on this in a gift shop in New Mexico, then found it a few times in a local hardware store but have resorted to buying online to save the hassle of driving all over town.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last long, but they are worth it!</li>
            <li>I lived in New Mexico for 25 years, and after moving away missed the autumn and winter smells of roasting green chilis and the unique smell of pinon burning in a fire place.</li>
            <li>While I am happy to not be out in the snow and cold for wood, I have missed that heavenly pinion fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It has a natural aroma to it, no hint of chemicals or perfumes.</li>
            <li>(it is actually rectangular) and produces a bit too much smoke.</li>
            <li>but I had a wild idea to check amazon</li>
            <li>They are very, very hard to light, and don&#x27;t stay lit very well.</li>
            <li>The bricks do seem a tad smaller and most importantly and most frustratingly they hardly ever burn all the way down anymore!</li>
            <li>Fills the entire house with a relaxing smell of a fireplace in the mountains of New Mexico.</li>
            <li>Definitely acceptable for New Mexicans.  </li>
            <li>I thought they would be larger and would last much longer.</li>
            <li>The incense smoke is thick and strong, which I like sometimes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other brick and brick like incense products like Paine&#x27;s Fir Balsam Incense which take forever to burn and actually go out a lot, so you need to have a lighter or candle around, but these Pinon Santa Fe incense are, in my opinion, a higher quality product!</li>
            <li>I bought this incense a few years ago when visiting New Mexico for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Hard to light.</li>
            <li>These are hard to light and keep going.  </li>
            <li>With a full brick, they are quite smoky and can be a little overpowering in a smaller area.  </li>
            <li>Ok, but not great.</li>
            <li>I love it because it really smells like Santa Fe on a cold evening, stepping into a front parlor with the kiva burning pinon.</li>
            <li>and I have traveled to New Mexico and smelt the real deal and have had other other  incense that smelt like pinon</li>
            <li>Over half of the cones in each box are unusable unless I can learn how to smolder sawdust with out making a huge mess.</li>

            <li> Maybe the very best house deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> It pains me not to give these bricks 5 stars because they smell so wonderful.</li>

            <li> Perfect.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is very good incense that I use often.</li>
            <li> nose may not recognize the pine as well as yours, so if you want to give this a try, I can at l;east promise you that this is otherwise a very good quality incense.</li>
            <li> The product is well packed and the quality is very good.</li>
            <li> Once you use this product, you will know it will be used for years to come -- it&#x27;s that good!</li>

            <li> This stuff smells great.</li>

            <li> These give a great ambiance.  </li>
            <li> The smell of pinon burning in a fireplace or camp fire is just amazing; delicious.  </li>
            <li> What a great smell.</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> All of the products from Incienso de Santa Fe are AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I love pinon incense and this is the best ever!</li>
            <li> Really nice smell!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to describe the pleasant aroma this Pinon incense has.  </li>
            <li> I use it with my electric fireplace and the effect is so pleasant and calming.  </li>
            <li> If you like the smell of pi単on, this is a good buy</li>
            <li> Smells so good though I would buy again .</li>
            <li> There was a fair amount of wood dust in the bottom of the bag, but I haven&#x27;t had any problem with any bricks disintegrating.  </li>
            <li> After it was burned out, the odor was no longer good.  </li>
            <li> Smells good but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> These smell good, but they will NOT stay lit no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> They smell good, makes you feel like you&#x27;re camping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with both purchases.  </li>
            <li> My very favorite incense and</li>
            <li> We have burned this brand for over 30 years and are still very pleased with its aroma.</li>
            <li> GREAT incense, LOVE this, burns well, smells like you are camping or a fireplace.</li>
            <li> A reorder favorite!</li>
            <li> Another favorite!  </li>
            <li> I have dogs that run in and out of the house and this incense helps keep my house enjoyable!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this scent!  </li>
            <li> The pi単on is my favorite scent !  </li>
            <li> and I am absolutely in love with them!</li>
            <li> She was very excited and loves the scent too!</li>
            <li> I liked the ones in the sample box</li>
            <li> Wintery &amp; warm.    </li>
            <li> Still, the scent is nice and woodsy.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t buy incense often, preferring to burn my own herbs for smudge.  </li>
            <li> I realize that most people loved this incense which is why I got it</li>
            <li> This has a nice woody scent, like a campfire.  </li>
            <li> Does anyone know pine incense with nice smell?</li>
            <li> I always have a box of this handy.</li>
            <li> I had purchased some of the Pinon incense many years ago while on a trip out west and am very glad to find it again.  </li>
            <li> The bricks also break very easily.</li>
            <li> Burns completely and provides a wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li> Good incense, but it did not burn as evenly as the supply that came with the &amp;#34;Incense of the west&amp;#34; burner originally.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find it in Amazon, I&#x27;ve missed it, such a great scent.</li>
            <li> I can see why someone may think this smells too much like a campfire, but if you enjoy the smell of pinion burning, this stuff is wonderful and authentic.</li>
            <li> Great southwest scent that fills the whole house with a relaxing aroma...wish each brick lasted longer!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this brand I was in Santa Fe; I am so happy to be able to purchase it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> All blocks were easy to ignite and burned completely with a wonderful aroma of desert pine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my inlaws commented on the great smell of a real fire</li>
            <li> Love these incense sticks - they smell just like burning pinon wood and remind me of my home away from home, Santa Fe.  </li>
            <li> Will order more when running out of them.</li>
            <li> Love you, dear &amp;#34;land of enchantment&amp;#34; and I always will.</li>
            <li> It smells like a more refined version of a campfire in the desert.</li>
            <li> husband sets one in front of the air intake so that the air conditioner blows the lovely smell through the house.</li>
            <li> I found this incense and from all the reviews hoped that I would get that authentic NM aroma.</li>
            <li> I will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> For me, while this stuff is burning it&#x27;s ok, smells alot like a wood</li>
            <li> I love this incense.</li>
            <li> You use to be able to buy it at Pier 1 but not anymore.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> Oh I just love them.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Gave to a friend of mine in Yoga, who love&#x27;s NM.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s going, it&#x27;s got a really lovely fragrance</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to find it again!</li>
            <li> Have had these for years love the smell of pinion wood burning</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> but once I run out, I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> The flowing robes, the grace, bald... striking.</li>
            <li> I love this incense.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> scent is just OK.</li>
            <li> once again, what I have come to love.</li>
            <li> although I&#x27;m really satisfied with both products, this one is the winner.</li>
            <li> There is better incense out there.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this product until the day that I die.</li>
            <li> This scent smells like wood more than the scent of Pinon.</li>
            <li> My favorite to burn on rainy days in az.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed them.</li>
            <li> They r intoxicating love the scent and the feel.</li>
            <li> The saving grace for this product is that it has a pretty good (pine) smell.</li>
            <li> and I felt in love with it, I&#x27;m not one for cones as much, but this smells so earthy good</li>
            <li> The incense smells just like a fire with natural wood and is great.  </li>
            <li> Light this on a rainy day and magic amplifies.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be real pinon wood.</li>
            <li> And the bricks fall over easily because of the shape .</li>
            <li> shipped very quickly</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of fresh pi&amp;ntilde;on--you will love this incense.  </li>
            <li> When they do get going they burn very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Too often incense smells strongly of a chemical perfume</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong.</li>
            <li> but also it is STRONG.  </li>
            <li> So many great real wood choices for real wood smells.  </li>
            <li> This brings back so many wonderful memories of living in Albuquerque, New Mexico......</li>
            <li> The best way around this is to use an incense burner with little charcoal briquettes and place the pinon brick on that.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;Pinon\\&quot; incense makes you feel like you&#x27;re in a mountainous cabin in a forest with a huge fire burning in the hearth.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Incense of the West fan.</li>
            <li> Great product - the same as I had bought in Santa F.  </li>
            <li> Now, I just light up this incense and the atmosphere becomes,</li>
            <li> If you enjoy the smell of burning wood like I do...</li>
            <li> The bricks do not always burn completely (95% burn) but the aroma is really good.</li>
            <li> Just bought one box last week, and I just ordered two more!!</li>
            <li> It reminds me of going sledding on a beautiful winter&#x27;s day and taking in the smell of cozy, indoor fires burning as we played. :)</li>
            <li> (A bit more &amp;#34;crumbly.&amp;#34;)  </li>
            <li> Great all winter long here in Wisconsin.</li>
            <li> We bought some of this when we traveled to the Grand Canyon last year - ran out and had to have more!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s unique fragrance eliminates household odors and makes the house feel clean.</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely amazing, very natural with no chemical scent I could pick up.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many positive reviews this has gotten.</li>
            <li> I love the completely pure smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like what most people would call incense.  </li>
            <li> that I don&#x27;t mind, you may have to keep relighting it, as it can go out quick.</li>
            <li> Words cannot adequately describe their smell.  </li>
            <li> Once it does burn it is quickly gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong so use in a well ventilated space and make certain you have something on which to burn bricks of incense.  </li>
            <li> I live in an apartment without a fireplace, but this adds the smell and enjoyable qualities of a fireplace.</li>
            <li> you can easily buy some charcoal and after it&#x27;s lit, sprinkle the dust on top of the red coal.  </li>
            <li> The little adobe house to burn this in is great too.</li>
            <li> Also the smell won&#x27;t linger super long in your space which is a benefit for many people as not everyone likes strong earthy smells.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it is tricky to get them to light sufficiently to smoke without burning them too much.  </li>
            <li> When I turn on the gas fireplace I light this incense to make it smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li> one brick usually clears the air of any pet or cooking scents and replaces with this beautiful pinon (without leaving me smelling like the firepit, I might add).</li>
            <li> But this one has an authentic, natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> each brick is well lit as per the instructions before inserting into the burner, but even still they rarely burn all the way through.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The crumbs, burnt all at once on a charcoal disk, give a nice if brief burst of aromatic smoke.</li>
            <li> A perfect reminder of past trips to New Mexico.</li>
            <li> Light this incense, close your eyes, and you will think you are in New Mexico!</li>
            <li> , it smells more like a campfire with a little pitch and tar, sounds gross, but smells great.</li>
            <li> Makes the whole house smell like a sweet, smoky campfire.</li>
            <li> I like them, especially for the price, buy they don&#x27;t have the rich smell I&#x27;ve experienced with other incense sticks that are made with a rougher texture.</li>
            <li> I find they are easier to light on the broken edge (more surface area and nooks and crannies to burn) and they still fill up the entire room with the great scent without being too smoky.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I should just buy a case of these! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been, it really smells like this there!</li>
            <li> I love the scent and couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere locally in the Northwest US.</li>
            <li> This incense takes me back to the southwest where i lived for many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this was has a peaceful calming affect I feel.</li>
            <li> but I also realize most of those same people mentioned Santa Fe.  </li>
            <li> A first quality product.</li>
            <li> This product brought back many memories.</li>
            <li> I made my first purchase of it on the Cherokee Reservation in SC.  </li>
            <li> The fireplace is nice, and has a heater and remote control.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m on the first tee with him.</li>
            <li> The incense smells wonderful, but each small cube only burns for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It smells like that first smell of winter from people lighting their wood burning fireplaces.</li>
            <li> I love these dearly, but what on earth can replace the rarity altogether of New Mexico&#x27;s evenings, storms, early dawn, snow, starlight, etc?  </li>
            <li> how about a little something, you know, for the effort, you know.&amp;#34; And he says, &amp;#34;Oh, uh, there won&#x27;t be any money, but when you die, on your deathbed, you will receive total consciousness.&amp;#34; So I got that goin&#x27; for me, which is nice, and these wonderful little insense bricks.</li>
            <li> The other scents are also nice.</li>
            <li> Such warm soft smells wash over your soul in sacred ceremony</li>
            <li> I ordered three different scents of this product and enjoyed each one till I noticed the cones left in the plastic bag in the box were disintegrating into fine sawdust.</li>
            <li> The full brick is also much harder to light.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of Pinon incense and these are exactly what I expected and the bricks burn evenly.</li>
            <li> These transport me back to New Mexico every time I light one up!</li>
            <li> Finding good incense is hard.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as smoky and overly aromatic like other products, and they light up rather quickly.</li>
            <li> These burn SO fast.</li>
            <li> Much faster than the ones that come in the sampler</li>
            <li> and I had to explain that they were really gas logs and that i was burning incense.</li>
            <li> Bought these Pinon bricks to burn while my electric fireplace is on...works just wonderful...makes it seem like a real fire..</li>
            <li> Blocks emit real smoke, the scent of pine .</li>
            <li> I got really fast service from the supplier.</li>
            <li> highly recommend to anyone who loves incense and woodsy, campfire scents!</li>
            <li> Also this always arrives relatively fast.</li>
            <li> If you do not know what a brick of incense is, then you may not be ready for Incensio.</li>
            <li> Scent was ok but cone wouldn&#x27;t put out the expected smokey scent.</li>
            <li> Was fast.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t produce too much smoke.</li>
            <li> I got this in Arizona when i was hiking near the Grand Canyon last winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for this for such a long time, so I am so glad to have found it here on Amazon! 8^)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a unique smell.</li>
            <li> I also like other incense but found this one is enjoyed by a wider range of people.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use charcoal made for incense or hookah, you should never use BBQ charcoal inside of a home due to the high amount of carbon monoxide it</li>
            <li> Personally, I find that it burns up too quickly at 15 min per \\&quot;cone\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> lights up fine, smokes like cray cray and gets all up in my business as I expected it would.</li>
            <li> The aroma is not unpleasant, but to me it simply is not reminiscent of pinon wood I smelled burning in New Mexico.</li>
            <li> When you walk into my house after lighting one, the aroma is very homey and natural smelling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been to the southwest, nor know exactly how Pinon wood should smell like when it burns, but it definitely smells better than your average campfire in Indiana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not an everyday enjoyable incense.</li>
            <li> I put the incense in an incense holder right next to the insert.  </li>
            <li> The bricks don&#x27;t come with any kind of holder, and laying them on a flat surface like a typical cone burner is a guarantee that any part touching the surface won&#x27;t burn (unlike a cone, which burns down completely).</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t had time to open up the box and use it (I still have some left over from my last stash), but I believe this to be the exact same kind I was trying to match.</li>
            <li> it makes me recall a trip to the New Mexico desert.</li>
            <li> I grew up with a wood burning fireplace but now live in a house with gas fireplace.</li>
            <li> If you love the cozy smell of a fire burning in a fireplace, get these!</li>
            <li> I just hope the formula gets fixed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for something that smells like fresh pine without being chemical based.</li>
            <li> These are small little incense that burn and give of a very nice smell as it burns in our chimenea.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love incense, and usually burn it at least once or more every day.  </li>
            <li> Like many, I stumbled on this in a gift shop in New Mexico, then found it a few times in a local hardware store but have resorted to buying online to save the hassle of driving all over town.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last long, but they are worth it!</li>
            <li> I lived in New Mexico for 25 years, and after moving away missed the autumn and winter smells of roasting green chilis and the unique smell of pinon burning in a fire place.</li>
            <li> While I am happy to not be out in the snow and cold for wood, I have missed that heavenly pinion fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It has a natural aroma to it, no hint of chemicals or perfumes.</li>
            <li> (it is actually rectangular) and produces a bit too much smoke.</li>
            <li> but I had a wild idea to check amazon</li>
            <li> They are very, very hard to light, and don&#x27;t stay lit very well.</li>
            <li> The bricks do seem a tad smaller and most importantly and most frustratingly they hardly ever burn all the way down anymore!</li>
            <li> Fills the entire house with a relaxing smell of a fireplace in the mountains of New Mexico.</li>
            <li> Definitely acceptable for New Mexicans.  </li>
            <li> I thought they would be larger and would last much longer.</li>
            <li> The incense smoke is thick and strong, which I like sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other brick and brick like incense products like Paine&#x27;s Fir Balsam Incense which take forever to burn and actually go out a lot, so you need to have a lighter or candle around, but these Pinon Santa Fe incense are, in my opinion, a higher quality product!</li>
            <li> I bought this incense a few years ago when visiting New Mexico for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Hard to light.</li>
            <li> These are hard to light and keep going.  </li>
            <li> With a full brick, they are quite smoky and can be a little overpowering in a smaller area.  </li>
            <li> Ok, but not great.</li>
            <li> I love it because it really smells like Santa Fe on a cold evening, stepping into a front parlor with the kiva burning pinon.</li>
            <li> and I have traveled to New Mexico and smelt the real deal and have had other other  incense that smelt like pinon</li>
            <li> Over half of the cones in each box are unusable unless I can learn how to smolder sawdust with out making a huge mess.</li>
            <li> That may well be, but I can only review the product I received, not a hypothetical better product...and the product I received was very poor quality.</li>
            <li> In the absence of their dear reality, this is the closest I can get.....</li>
            <li> The cedar ones I have from the same brand do though, not sure why these ones suck so much.</li>
            <li> I had it in our hallway in our 2 flat</li>
            <li> The little bricks are extremely hard to light, requiring a flame held on them for a long time to ignite.</li>
            <li> BUT They don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Someone broke the seal, opened the box and the inner plastic bag, removed one log, did not reseal the inner bag, closed the box and then packaged and shipped it to me.  </li>
            <li> They are not what we expected and we will not purchase them in the future.  </li>
            <li> The box lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Hard to light; hard to keep lit.</li>
            <li> Love The scent but extremely difficult to keep lit !</li>
            <li> Smell it in your place this winter if you do not live out in the woods.</li>
            <li> Usually I only find these in tourist shops in down town Santa Fe</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the 1 log, but I thought it was odd enough to mention.</li>
            <li> you have a small to medium room, I HIGHLY suggest breaking the bricks in half.  </li>
            <li> Instead I&#x27;m out the money I spent on this junk.</li>
            <li> They burn a long time but the odor is not very strong.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and, to me, very nostalgic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased pinon incense from other vendors that didn&#x27;t have this scent.</li>
            <li> I like Incienso de Santa Fe other incense lines</li>
            <li> Even after I rigged an burner setup that kept the bricks upright, they still only burned halfway through, leaving a stub of a brick too small to be re-ignited without burning my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of half a brick as it&#x27;s pretty difficult to get them going again when they&#x27;re tiny half inch stubs.</li>
            <li> But alas, I fear the popularity of this brand has grown exponentially in the last couple of years and as such perhaps the formula or production methods have changed.</li>
            <li> He hauls off and whacks one - big hitter, the Lama - long, into a ten-thousand foot crevasse, right at the base of this glacier.</li>
            <li> Living on the East Coast it is difficult to find the real thing to burn in the fire pit, so I have to resort to incense to satisfy my cravings for the smell of the Southwest.</li>
            <li> A few bricks had ends rounded off due, I assume, to being bounced around in shipping.</li>
            <li> but i feel like they burned through in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I burn half a brick at a time.</li>
            <li> without all the mess and cleanup.</li>
            <li> Thank you for bringing a little of Santa Fe to me.</li>
            <li> The little briquettes look like compressed sawdust.</li>
            <li> These are not cone shaped but rather rectangular and do not fit in typical smoker houses with round circular bases.</li>
            <li> It can be a little hard to keep it burning, that&#x27;s really the only bad thing.</li>
            <li> Had to relight the cone every few minutes.</li>
            <li> Nothing wasted.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s gonna stiff me.</li>
            <li> It is a little smoky and it is hard to keep it burning.</li>
            <li> Hard to get going and the smell is a little overpowering on smelling just like</li>
            <li> They are very small and burn in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It really smelled like a bad burnt out fire.  </li>
            <li> Cozy!  </li>
            <li> I tried and tried and got a small smokey smell before they died.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these burning in a shot glass hidden behind holiday decotations on the mantle.</li>
            <li> Should have listened to the previous reviews as cones performed poorly.</li>
            <li> but, as other people have said, they are rather difficult to get lit</li>
            <li> Also, they are very small.</li>
            <li> It does smell like pinon, but has a weak and stale quality to it compared to other pinon incenses I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I burn one brick at least every two days!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in this product and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> but these were a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> Others seem to think that I received a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; box of the incense, as they&#x27;ve never experienced the problems I did.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not deliver the aroma I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong,</li>
            <li> Smells faintly of pinon.  </li>
            <li> Stinks like a burned wood.</li>
            <li> but I got frustrated trying to get it going.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed in the size of the cones.</li>
            <li> Save your money, these are worthless.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this incense is that it makes me want to hop on a train to Santa Fe real bad.</li>
            <li> The worst incense I ever tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I received 4 boxes of 3 scents and I like them all.  However, the seal on the box containing the Pinon incense, which was packaged and shipped by itself, was open and the plastic bag containing the logs of incense was open.  There were only 39 logs of incense in that bag.  Someone broke the seal, opened the box and the inner plastic bag, removed one log, did not reseal the inner bag, closed the box and then packaged and shipped it to me.  I don&#x27;t care about the 1 log, but I thought it was odd enough to mention.</li>
            <li> These burn SO fast. Much faster than the ones that come in the sampler box- they even look and feel different. I liked the ones in the sample box but these were a little disappointing. They still had a great scent but i feel like they burned through in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had one of these burning in a shot glass hidden behind holiday decotations on the mantle. One of my inlaws commented on the great smell of a real fire and I had to explain that they were really gas logs and that i was burning incense. Now, if they would just make something you could toss in there for the crackel.</li>
            <li> Love these incense sticks - they smell just like burning pinon wood and remind me of my home away from home, Santa Fe.  Easy to use and, to me, very nostalgic.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this pine incense years ago at Pier One Imports and they stopped carrying it. I asked where they bought it from and began buying it from the manufacturer in Arizona. This \\&quot;Pinon\\&quot; incense makes you feel like you&#x27;re in a mountainous cabin in a forest with a huge fire burning in the hearth. There&#x27;s something so comforting about it. Makes a great gift! Next time, I should just buy a case of these! :)</li>
            <li> Bought these Pinon bricks to burn while my electric fireplace is on...works just wonderful...makes it seem like a real fire..without all the mess and cleanup.</li>
            <li> These are not cone shaped but rather rectangular and do not fit in typical smoker houses with round circular bases. They are also not pine smelling but rather burnt wood smoke. They appear to be made out of pressed 2x4 (pine) sawdust. Not as advertised.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered three different scents of this product and enjoyed each one till I noticed the cones left in the plastic bag in the box were disintegrating into fine sawdust. Over half of the cones in each box are unusable unless I can learn how to smolder sawdust with out making a huge mess.</li>
            <li> Have you ever been to Taos, or Santa Fe?  This is what it smells like when you walk around in the winter evening and smell the scent of peoples fireplaces burning the local pinon wood.  Awesome!  Cozy!  Wintery &amp; warm.    I can&#x27;t buy enough of this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> Blocks emit real smoke, the scent of pine . Each brick lasts about 25minutes.  Will order more when running out of them.</li>
            <li> These are small little incense that burn and give of a very nice smell as it burns in our chimenea. BUT They don&#x27;t last very long. I thought they would be larger and would last much longer. When we use them, we are constantly dropping these into the chimenea. They are not what we expected and we will not purchase them in the future.  This was almost a one start.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  A reorder favorite!</li>
            <li> Fills the entire house with a relaxing smell of a fireplace in the mountains of New Mexico.</li>
            <li> I love these dearly, but what on earth can replace the rarity altogether of New Mexico&#x27;s evenings, storms, early dawn, snow, starlight, etc?  In the absence of their dear reality, this is the closest I can get.....Love you, dear &amp;#34;land of enchantment&amp;#34; and I always will. I remember my home up the dirt road at Milepost 13 off of Route 44........  You were my &amp;#34;Eden&amp;#34;........</li>
            <li> I got really fast service from the supplier. The price including S&amp;H was unbeatable. The bricks do not always burn completely (95% burn) but the aroma is really good. I will definitely buy this product again from this supplier. If you like the smell of pi単on, this is a good buy</li>
            <li> Love The scent but extremely difficult to keep lit ! And the bricks fall over easily because of the shape . Smells so good though I would buy again .</li>
            <li> I am always on the look out for Pinon Pine incense. Living on the East Coast it is difficult to find the real thing to burn in the fire pit, so I have to resort to incense to satisfy my cravings for the smell of the Southwest. I saw this product and decided to give it a try. I like the smell. It has a natural aroma to it, no hint of chemicals or perfumes. I was a bit disappointed in the size of the cones. They are very small and burn in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Maybe the very best house deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried. Like many, I stumbled on this in a gift shop in New Mexico, then found it a few times in a local hardware store but have resorted to buying online to save the hassle of driving all over town. Still, I have to have this in my home at all times. one brick usually clears the air of any pet or cooking scents and replaces with this beautiful pinon (without leaving me smelling like the firepit, I might add).</li>
            <li> Smells like the Plaza in Santa Fe. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this incense several times and the last batch of cones was shaped differently and had a slightly different scent and burn time.  (A bit more &amp;#34;crumbly.&amp;#34;)  Still, the scent is nice and woodsy. A perfect reminder of past trips to New Mexico.</li>
            <li> woodsy scent but not pinon scent to me and I have traveled to New Mexico and smelt the real deal and have had other other  incense that smelt like pinon</li>
            <li> scent never lasted. Hard to light.</li>
            <li> Another favorite!  I have all of this company&#x27;s product .  It&#x27;s like an incense buffet.  So many great real wood choices for real wood smells.  Great all winter long here in Wisconsin.</li>
            <li> The saving grace for this product is that it has a pretty good (pine) smell. Personally, I find that it burns up too quickly at 15 min per \\&quot;cone\\&quot; (it is actually rectangular) and produces a bit too much smoke. After this box, I am going to try incense sticks instead.</li>
            <li> I had purchased some of the Pinon incense many years ago while on a trip out west and am very glad to find it again.  I have dogs that run in and out of the house and this incense helps keep my house enjoyable!</li>
            <li> I feel like I am in Santa Fe when I burn this. I&#x27;ve been, it really smells like this there! I burn half a brick at a time. The box lasts a long time. It&#x27;s such a unique smell. I like that it&#x27;s not floral or musky. It smells like a more refined version of a campfire in the desert.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this incense is that it makes me want to hop on a train to Santa Fe real bad. It smells like the air in Santa Fe when people are burning pinon in their fireplaces and woodstoves. It does not have the fakey pine smell that some people might be used to in candles, incense etc.&lt;br /&gt;My husband sets one in front of the air intake so that the air conditioner blows the lovely smell through the house. It can be a little hard to keep it burning, that&#x27;s really the only bad thing.</li>
            <li> Great product - the same as I had bought in Santa F.  I love the scent and couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere locally in the Northwest US.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love incense, and usually burn it at least once or more every day.  This has become one of my favorites!  It smells absolutely amazing, very natural with no chemical scent I could pick up.  I&#x27;ve never been to the southwest, nor know exactly how Pinon wood should smell like when it burns, but it definitely smells better than your average campfire in Indiana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shipped very quickly and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the seller nor the bricks themselves.  There was a fair amount of wood dust in the bottom of the bag, but I haven&#x27;t had any problem with any bricks disintegrating.  If anyone has that problem (one review mentions it) you can easily buy some charcoal and after it&#x27;s lit, sprinkle the dust on top of the red coal.  Make sure to use charcoal made for incense or hookah, you should never use BBQ charcoal inside of a home due to the high amount of carbon monoxide it produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a small to medium room, I HIGHLY suggest breaking the bricks in half.  I find they are easier to light on the broken edge (more surface area and nooks and crannies to burn) and they still fill up the entire room with the great scent without being too smoky.  With a full brick, they are quite smoky and can be a little overpowering in a smaller area.  The full brick is also much harder to light.  Using a butane torch lighter makes it easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to anyone who loves incense and woodsy, campfire scents!</li>
            <li> I bought this incense a few years ago when visiting New Mexico for the first time.  I love it because it really smells like Santa Fe on a cold evening, stepping into a front parlor with the kiva burning pinon. Too often incense smells strongly of a chemical perfume so I don&#x27;t buy incense often, preferring to burn my own herbs for smudge.  But this one has an authentic, natural fragrance. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you love the cozy smell of a fire burning in a fireplace, get these! They don&#x27;t last long, but they are worth it!</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong. The bricks also break very easily.</li>
            <li> Thank you for bringing a little of Santa Fe to me. Also this always arrives relatively fast.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a day well spent in old Santa Fe. This is very good incense that I use often. The other scents are also nice.</li>
            <li> I have bought since 1990.  Period.  It&#x27;s a bit strong so use in a well ventilated space and make certain you have something on which to burn bricks of incense.  If you do not know what a brick of incense is, then you may not be ready for Incensio.</li>
            <li> Good incense, but it did not burn as evenly as the supply that came with the &amp;#34;Incense of the west&amp;#34; burner originally. Had to keep re-lighting some of the bricks, and some would go out when I put them inside the burner, thus needing to burn them free-standing.</li>
            <li> If you have ever been to Santa Fe in the colder months, this is what it smells like....ahhh, childhood memories</li>
            <li> I am a huge Incense of the West fan. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have 4 or 5 different incense burners sitting around the house. It pains me not to give these bricks 5 stars because they smell so wonderful. But alas, I fear the popularity of this brand has grown exponentially in the last couple of years and as such perhaps the formula or production methods have changed. The bricks do seem a tad smaller and most importantly and most frustratingly they hardly ever burn all the way down anymore! I spend several minutes ensuring each brick is well lit as per the instructions before inserting into the burner, but even still they rarely burn all the way through. It&#x27;s a waste of half a brick as it&#x27;s pretty difficult to get them going again when they&#x27;re tiny half inch stubs. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product because it smells wonderful and I want to continue to support the company. I just hope the formula gets fixed!</li>
            <li> I lived in New Mexico for 25 years, and after moving away missed the autumn and winter smells of roasting green chilis and the unique smell of pinon burning in a fire place. I found this incense and from all the reviews hoped that I would get that authentic NM aroma. Unfortunately, this product did not deliver the aroma I was expecting. The aroma is not unpleasant, but to me it simply is not reminiscent of pinon wood I smelled burning in New Mexico.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Pinon incense and these are exactly what I expected and the bricks burn evenly. I will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Perfect refill for the smoker</li>
            <li> This incense takes me back to the southwest where i lived for many years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unique fragrance eliminates household odors and makes the house feel clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for something that smells like fresh pine without being chemical based. These come close but aren&#x27;t quite what I&#x27;d call pine scented. I&#x27;d definitely recommend having a mini-torch lighter for quicker lighting.</li>
            <li> Smells like sawdust. Made me choke.</li>
            <li> These were not what I was expecting, as I used to buy some pine incense from a store, but these are GREAT!! They burn well and they smell SO good!!</li>
            <li> I was at a local spot where this was burning and I felt in love with it, I&#x27;m not one for cones as much, but this smells so earthy good that I don&#x27;t mind, you may have to keep relighting it, as it can go out quick. Also the smell won&#x27;t linger super long in your space which is a benefit for many people as not everyone likes strong earthy smells. But this was has a peaceful calming affect I feel. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of fresh pi&amp;ntilde;on--you will love this incense.  It is every bit as aromatic and invigorating as I remember from my middle school years in Colorado.  It reminds me of going sledding on a beautiful winter&#x27;s day and taking in the smell of cozy, indoor fires burning as we played. :)</li>
            <li> Should have listened to the previous reviews as cones performed poorly. Scent was ok but cone wouldn&#x27;t put out the expected smokey scent. Had to relight the cone every few minutes. Would not recommend these cones.</li>
            <li> I burned my fingers, holding a lighter to these and they never lit.  I tried and tried and got a small smokey smell before they died.  Save your money, these are worthless.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I love pinon incense and this is the best ever!</li>
            <li> Smells too smokey to use inside, in my opinion. Blocks put off a lot of smoke. Ok, but not great.</li>
            <li> This incense has a smell that reminds me of burning paper. I&#x27;ve purchased pinon incense from other vendors that didn&#x27;t have this scent. I like Incienso de Santa Fe other incense lines, so I will be buying from them again, just not the pinon.</li>
            <li> I realize that most people loved this incense which is why I got it but I also realize most of those same people mentioned Santa Fe.  For me, while this stuff is burning it&#x27;s ok, smells alot like a wood fireplace- but also it is STRONG.  I had it in our hallway in our 2 flat and I had to crack the hall window.  After it was burned out, the odor was no longer good.  It really smelled like a bad burnt out fire.  I would not buy this again.  Finding good incense is hard.</li>
            <li> This incense takes me to Santa Fe and Mesa Verde. I use as an aroma in my meditation part of yoga classes. Terrific!</li>
            <li> I love this incense. It smells like being in the southwest. You use to be able to buy it at Pier 1 but not anymore. I was so glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> My family is from NM but I buy these whenever I can.  Usually I only find these in tourist shops in down town Santa Fe but I had a wild idea to check amazon and I lucked out!  These things are soooo delicious smelling; just like a wood fire in your home.  Oh I just love them.  Words cannot adequately describe their smell.  :)  I encourage you to buy them!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this brand I was in Santa Fe; I am so happy to be able to purchase it through Amazon.  The price is a good value and the incense is excellent.  A first quality product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smelling pi単on incense!  I&#x27;m adding an item to my bucket list to take a tour of the factory -- how could this possibly be made?!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to describe the pleasant aroma this Pinon incense has.  I use it with my electric fireplace and the effect is so pleasant and calming.  Once you use this product, you will know it will be used for years to come -- it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> These transport me back to New Mexico every time I light one up!</li>
            <li> This has a nice woody scent, like a campfire.  The incense smoke is thick and strong, which I like sometimes.  Even though the incense is pleasing enough, this does not smell like pine.  Or if it ever does, it has HINTS of a pine-like smell, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nose may not recognize the pine as well as yours, so if you want to give this a try, I can at l;east promise you that this is otherwise a very good quality incense.</li>
            <li> This product brought back many memories. The product is well packed and the quality is very good. Burns completely and provides a wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li> has no scent whatsoever.  i could have just used twigs in the alley way</li>
            <li> I can see why someone may think this smells too much like a campfire, but if you enjoy the smell of pinion burning, this stuff is wonderful and authentic.</li>
            <li> A few bricks had ends rounded off due, I assume, to being bounced around in shipping. I assume that&#x27;s when it happened because there were plenty of crumbs in the bag with the bricks. No big deal, I managed to balance them and burn them. All blocks were easy to ignite and burned completely with a wonderful aroma of desert pine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crumbs, burnt all at once on a charcoal disk, give a nice if brief burst of aromatic smoke. Nothing wasted.</li>
            <li> We bought some of this when we traveled to the Grand Canyon last year - ran out and had to have more! Shipped incredibly fast, I received it within a few days of ordering. Love this stuff! Makes the whole house smell like a sweet, smoky campfire. Great for cleaning the air!</li>
            <li> lights up fine, smokes like cray cray and gets all up in my business as I expected it would. seventeen.</li>
            <li> Such warm soft smells wash over your soul in sacred ceremony</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t had time to open up the box and use it (I still have some left over from my last stash), but I believe this to be the exact same kind I was trying to match. I&#x27;d been looking for this for such a long time, so I am so glad to have found it here on Amazon! 8^)</li>
            <li> Great product.  Shipping. Was fast.  I will recommend</li>
            <li> The worst incense I ever tried. Stinks like a burned wood. I would not recommend it.  Does anyone know pine incense with nice smell?</li>
            <li> Reminds me of home in NM. Gave to a friend of mine in Yoga, who love&#x27;s NM. She was very excited and loves the scent too!</li>
            <li> Great southwest scent that fills the whole house with a relaxing aroma...wish each brick lasted longer!</li>
            <li> Hard to light; hard to keep lit. Once it&#x27;s going, it&#x27;s got a really lovely fragrance but I got frustrated trying to get it going.</li>
            <li> I love this scent!  I made my first purchase of it on the Cherokee Reservation in SC.  I was so excited to be able to find it again!</li>
            <li> Have had these for years love the smell of pinion wood burning</li>
            <li> I purchased these the same day I purchased an electric fireplace insert (had no idea they even existed).  I am very pleased with both purchases.  The fireplace is nice, and has a heater and remote control.  The incense smells just like a fire with natural wood and is great.  I put the incense in an incense holder right next to the insert.  Works well, would recommend.</li>
            <li> They burn a long time but the odor is not very strong. I was looking for a stronger pine odor when I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Really nice smell!  Definitely acceptable for New Mexicans.  4 stars because it is tricky to get them to light sufficiently to smoke without burning them too much.  I would buy again though!</li>
            <li> I got this in Arizona when i was hiking near the Grand Canyon last winter. It definitely reminds me of the lodges at the Canyon that burn this type of wood. I live in an apartment without a fireplace, but this adds the smell and enjoyable qualities of a fireplace. I burn one brick at least every two days! I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. It isn&#x27;t overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t produce too much smoke. It is going to last me a while but once I run out, I will be purchasing more. 5/5</li>
            <li> This incense had absolutly no smell and was NOT Pinon but was just wood chips.  Don&#x27;t but from this product from this person.</li>
            <li> The pi単on is my favorite scent !  2 years ago I had purchased  this brand of pi単on cones in Santa Fe and used them all up. I was so happy to find the product on Amazon and received them ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be real pinon wood. The little briquettes look like compressed sawdust. They are very, very hard to light, and don&#x27;t stay lit very well. The best way around this is to use an incense burner with little charcoal briquettes and place the pinon brick on that. It will eventually catch, and stay lit. I&#x27;d probably order these again because I do like the smell of pinon smoke.</li>
            <li> My very favorite incense and I don&#x27;t really like what most people would call incense.  This smells like the pinon fires of the southwest, woodsy and no sweetness at all.  If you like this you might also like the Paines balsam incense, it smells more like a campfire with a little pitch and tar, sounds gross, but smells great.</li>
            <li> These give a great ambiance.  We have used them for years.</li>
            <li> I love this and it smells just like a fireplace. It is a little smoky and it is hard to keep it burning. Once it does burn it is quickly gone.</li>
            <li> smell is not what I thought</li>
            <li> I ordered pinion pine but got cedar instead.  Smells good but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Brought back memories of my childhood!</li>
            <li> Hard to get going and the smell is a little overpowering on smelling just like some sort of wood is burning in your house. &amp;#34;stings the nostrils&amp;#34; as my husband stated. Would only ever use around the holidays. Not an everyday enjoyable incense.</li>
            <li> Pinon Incense Box with 40 Bricks burning and that wonderful smell remind of the time I jumped  ship in Hong Kong and I make my way over to Tibet, and I get on as a looper at a course over in the Himalayas. A looper, you know, a caddy, a looper, a jock. So, I tell them I&#x27;m a pro jock, and who do you think they give me? The Dalai Lama, himself. Twelfth son of the Lama. The flowing robes, the grace, bald... striking. So, I&#x27;m on the first tee with him. I give him the driver. He hauls off and whacks one - big hitter, the Lama - long, into a ten-thousand foot crevasse, right at the base of this glacier. Do you know what the Lama says? Gunga galunga... gunga, gunga-lagunga. So we finish the eighteenth and he&#x27;s gonna stiff me. And I say, &amp;#34;Hey, Lama, hey, how about a little something, you know, for the effort, you know.&amp;#34; And he says, &amp;#34;Oh, uh, there won&#x27;t be any money, but when you die, on your deathbed, you will receive total consciousness.&amp;#34; So I got that goin&#x27; for me, which is nice, and these wonderful little insense bricks.</li>
            <li> This brings back so many wonderful memories of living in Albuquerque, New Mexico......I was happy to find it in Amazon, I&#x27;ve missed it, such a great scent.</li>
            <li> These smell good, but they will NOT stay lit no matter what I do. The cedar ones I have from the same brand do though, not sure why these ones suck so much.</li>
            <li> I love this incense. I always have a box of this handy. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> They smell good, makes you feel like you&#x27;re camping but, as other people have said, they are rather difficult to get lit and they sometimes go out so you have to relight.  Also, they are very small.</li>
            <li> The incense smells wonderful, but each small cube only burns for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many positive reviews this has gotten. It&#x27;s a terrible product. The little bricks are extremely hard to light, requiring a flame held on them for a long time to ignite. Once ignited, I have to keep an eye on it because it will probably go out in 30 seconds and need to be lit again. The bricks don&#x27;t come with any kind of holder, and laying them on a flat surface like a typical cone burner is a guarantee that any part touching the surface won&#x27;t burn (unlike a cone, which burns down completely). Even after I rigged an burner setup that kept the bricks upright, they still only burned halfway through, leaving a stub of a brick too small to be re-ignited without burning my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is just OK. It does smell like pinon, but has a weak and stale quality to it compared to other pinon incenses I&#x27;ve tried. Overall I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in this product and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. If I had kept the box I&#x27;d return it to Amazon. Instead I&#x27;m out the money I spent on this junk. I&#x27;d never buy again from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  Others seem to think that I received a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; box of the incense, as they&#x27;ve never experienced the problems I did. That may well be, but I can only review the product I received, not a hypothetical better product...and the product I received was very poor quality.</li>
            <li> The incense brings back fond memories of sitting by a bonfire in my youth.....just a wonderful fragrance of pi単on wood.</li>
            <li> The smell of pinon burning in a fireplace or camp fire is just amazing; delicious.  We have replaced our fireplaces with gas inserts. While I am happy to not be out in the snow and cold for wood, I have missed that heavenly pinion fragrance.  Now, I just light up this incense and the atmosphere becomes, once again, what I have come to love.</li>
            <li> Each time I burn one of these incense bricks it makes me recall a trip to the New Mexico desert. When you walk into my house after lighting one, the aroma is very homey and natural smelling. I also like other incense but found this one is enjoyed by a wider range of people.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell.  Perfect.  Reminds me of the Chisos Mountain Basin, Big Bend, Tx.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like pi単on wood to me but has a definate smoky wood smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other brick and brick like incense products like Paine&#x27;s Fir Balsam Incense which take forever to burn and actually go out a lot, so you need to have a lighter or candle around, but these Pinon Santa Fe incense are, in my opinion, a higher quality product! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, although I&#x27;m really satisfied with both products, this one is the winner. They&#x27;re not as smoky and overly aromatic like other products, and they light up rather quickly. Just bought one box last week, and I just ordered two more!!</li>
            <li> These are hard to light and keep going.  When they do get going they burn very quickly.  There is better incense out there.</li>
            <li> You will be transported to a forest in southwest America. I love the completely pure smell. Light this on a rainy day and magic amplifies.</li>
            <li> All of the products from Incienso de Santa Fe are AMAZING! I received these once as a gift for Christmas and I am absolutely in love with them! If you enjoy the smell of burning wood like I do... then this product is for you! I will be buying more of this product until the day that I die.</li>
            <li> This scent smells like wood more than the scent of Pinon. It&#x27;s nothing to run home about. I guess if you want incense you should plan to be actual incense from the store.</li>
            <li> What a great smell. The little adobe house to burn this in is great too. It smells like that first smell of winter from people lighting their wood burning fireplaces.</li>
            <li> Light this incense, close your eyes, and you will think you are in New Mexico! We have burned this brand for over 30 years and are still very pleased with its aroma.</li>
            <li> GREAT incense, LOVE this, burns well, smells like you are camping or a fireplace.</li>
            <li> My favorite to burn on rainy days in az. Reminds me of camping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed them. They r intoxicating love the scent and the feel.</li>
            <li> Out in the mountains by the camp fire. Smell it in your place this winter if you do not live out in the woods. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I grew up with a wood burning fireplace but now live in a house with gas fireplace. When I turn on the gas fireplace I light this incense to make it smell like the real thing. I even fool myself!</li>
            <li> Smells faintly of pinon.  I like them, especially for the price, buy they don&#x27;t have the rich smell I&#x27;ve experienced with other incense sticks that are made with a rougher texture.</li>
