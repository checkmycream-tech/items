            <li>The trimmer is very loud and the flat trimmer does not cut anything and actually pulls the hair.</li>

            <li> It cleans the nose trill unbelievably.I t removed all the hair from my nose trill.It&#x27;s size is really amazing,which you can carry with any where.</li>
            <li> has a design flow - the shaving head disconnects often and unexpectedly...</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very loud and the flat trimmer does not cut anything and actually pulls the hair.</li>
            <li> It was fine. It dfoes what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  The nose hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to pull my husbands hairs, and also works well in the ear.  I really like the wider side burn trimmer for getting those long hairs that seems to appear out of nowhere on his neck.  I can get those off of him without any pulling or pain.  We have had it for a couple of months and everything is fine so far.</li>
            <li> Works well, the light could be better but is an improvement over no light.</li>

            <li> was a gift. He is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This clipper works as advertised with no problems. It is easy to clean with no difficulty in changing heads. As an old guy overcome with nose hair growth, I just wish the nose clipper head were just a little (an eighth of an inch?) longer.</li>
            <li> The item I received fits my need perfectly. It is reat for trimming the hair at my nostrils and in my ears.</li>
            <li> I think that this was completely worth what I paid. Works great, was a good price.</li>
            <li> Works ok. breaks easily</li>

            <li> nice product, growing my mustache again., now I can trim all sides of my mustache.,trims side burns straight across nicely too, do not fear if the nose trimmer binds and stops, just make sure the blade inside the trimmer is repositioned, it will start spinning once again.</li>
            <li> purchases based on good reviews - received it - put new battery in - twisted end back on - nothing! very inconvenienced by this - DO NOT BUY!</li>
