            <li>Good sun protection</li>
            <li>Smells good as well</li>
            <li>After trying many from the drug stores, this site helped me decide that Thinksport is the best product for SAFE sun protection.  </li>
            <li>It held up amazingly, we did not get sunburned at all.</li>
            <li>It even requires a but of scrub to get it off in the shower if I haven&#x27;t worn it many hours, which to me is a good sign of it&#x27;s longevity.</li>
            <li>Perfect product and fast service</li>
            <li>Product blends easily on skin and smells subtly nice, not overly fragrant.</li>
            <li>Great product and is rated very highly by the EWG.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite sunscreens.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is a top choice according to EWG.  </li>
            <li>He was able to spend a lot of time in the water and then reapplied when he got out.  </li>
            <li>but because it&#x27;s safe and non-toxic.</li>
            <li>It did tend to clog my pores in my elbow crease, but I made sure to adjust the amount that I put there.</li>
            <li>Spend your money on a better product.</li>
            <li>Safe product for my boys.</li>
            <li>They need safe because of all the UV exposure my twins get as life guards at a waterpark.</li>
            <li>Yes, I know you are supposed to reapply every 80 minutes, but I sure wasn&#x27;t going to get all slimed up again out on the road.</li>
            <li>your money, there is better products out there.</li>
            <li>I came home with a pretty good burn.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are top notch as someone with a lot of skin reactions, this product has been just fine.</li>
            <li>This seems to fulfill its primary purpose of protecting skin from sunburn, hence more than one star.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a week and have been really happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Thinksport is easy to apply, goes on clear &amp; has a pleasant sent.</li>
            <li>if your a man just b sure u shave before using it because it sticks to facial hair and will leave a cast, overall this is an amazing product and could be a great tool in anyones anti aging arsenal!</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, great coverage, fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t appear white on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read others have experienced the same issue.  </li>
            <li>When people are visiting they buy cheap brands</li>
            <li>It worked ok on my fair skin (red hair), but not as well as I had hoped!  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a high SPF, non-greasy, non-smelly product that blocks the sun effectively but doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.  </li>
            <li>It stand the test of my fun!</li>
            <li>but clean product is a must too.</li>
            <li>I buy it mainly because it doesn&#x27;t have the toxic chemicals that are in most sunscreens you buy at retail.  </li>
            <li>best mix of durable protection, easy application, and as few harmful chemicals as possible.</li>
            <li>Takes a little bit to smear on but it&#x27;s got a great consistency to it.</li>
            <li>Both my sons do a lot of water sports, fresh and salt water, and it doesn&#x27;t come off.  </li>
            <li>Love the product as it has a high concentration of zinc oxide and doesn&#x27;t leave me too white like most.</li>
            <li>It has great protection and the ingredients present a low health concern.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen, not only for it&#x27;s protection</li>
            <li>I moved up to the 6oz bottle from 3oz and have enjoyed it immensely.</li>
            <li>I lather before I head out for the day, touch up my nose ever few hours... and Good to stay.</li>
            <li>-it does go very white so be sure to really rub it in.</li>
            <li>Maybe high temperatures are to blame, but if that&#x27;s the case it is an obvious defect as sunscreen is used most in hot weather.  </li>
            <li>It meets all of my criteria, blocks the sun much better than those products my doc recommended, my skin hasn&#x27;t had issues with it and what little odor I smell is not unpleasant and seems to dissipate after application.  </li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t really care about that, so it wasn&#x27;t an issue for him.  </li>
            <li>A great non reactive, non irritating sunscreen.</li>
            <li>If you sweat much do not put this stuff anywhere around your eyes, as it stings like the dickens if any sweat runs into your eye.</li>
            <li>Applies white and rubs in cleanly without residue.  </li>
            <li>And it has a distinct smell (not too strong, neither good or bad).</li>
            <li>Its rated 1 on the EWG, the ingredients are pure, this is the best physical/healthy sunscreen on the market, it does not leave to bad of a whitecast and it rubs in quite well</li>
            <li>Reviews convinced me to purchase this brand but the truth is that drug store brands cost 75% less and work much better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend on efficacy alone</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great effing sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I ended up switching to less natural SPF 70 which seemed to work much better for my skin in the sun and water.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time under sweaty or wet conditions, much longer than many brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have been using plain old Neutrogena but thought I could find something better.</li>
            <li>Complete joke, will never order this again!</li>
            <li>Other brand sunscreen was easier to apply, but this was not bad either.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what ingredient this is caused by, but this itching certainly interfered with my daily life for days after application.  </li>
            <li>I use it myself &amp; send a bottle to daycare with my 10 year old...</li>
            <li>A couple of times this item has arrived as complete liquid in a tube.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;ll keep me from getting old...</li>
            <li>As I have had basal cell carcinoma, sun protection for me is vital.</li>
            <li>The products my dermatologist recommended (Neutrogena SPF 60 sensitive skin and Vanicream SPF 50) weren&#x27;t working</li>
            <li>Yet in spring 2015 it is completely liquified.</li>
            <li>and it smells natural.</li>
            <li>I can only highly recommend this for outdoor activity !</li>
            <li>And the Neutrogena seems to last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>This one was a large tube that lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, leaves a white film, but we would rather have that than getting sunburned.</li>
            <li>It worked when new but 8 months later it has zero value.</li>
            <li>We live in Hawaii so sunscreen is a big deal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend that you try a small amount of this sunscreen first before committing to purchasing a large bottle.  </li>
            <li>The Thinkbaby that I purchased at the same time for my 2yr old has not liquified but has zero protection only 8 months after purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Also, the itching would be worse in the areas where I was applying more sunscreen (e.g. on the outer side of the arms and legs vs. on the inner side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The itching was happening only in the exact areas to which the sunscreen was applied (e.g. if I applied it to my forearms, then my upper arms would be fine, but forearms would itch crazily).  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most chemical sunscreens &amp; other natural brands I&#x27;ve used have been difficult to apply &amp; left white residue on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than your average sunscreen, which is a little more watery.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of sunscreen in the tube and can last a long time.  </li>
            <li> We did not not burn in the tropical sun, even though we snorkeled for long stretches at a time.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if I have any issues with wearing this product for long term use.</li>
            <li> how long I tried.</li>
            <li> Goes on non-greasy and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It will probably leave you with a slight white sheen when wearing</li>
            <li> A little white</li>
            <li> Well, I average over 4 long bike rides a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I use at least some sunscreen on more than half of my rides, and I purchased this sunscreen three weeks ago, so that&#x27;s at least half-dozen times that I had at least some amount of this sunscreen on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SPF is only for UVA, and does very little for UVB.</li>
            <li> Stays on extremely well all day sweating while rock climbing, surfing, kayaking, hiking, biking...</li>
            <li> Goes on very white and thick.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> rubs in well, smells great, and gets a 1 on the environmental working groups sunscreen report.  great product</li>
            <li> Great for water sports for kids and adults.  A little white but it does eventually rub in.</li>
            <li> This seems to fulfill its primary purpose of protecting skin from sunburn, hence more than one star.  Unfortunately, unlike ANY other sunscreen I have ever tried, this one leaves me with a really annoying itching and a mild rash wherever it is applied to my skin -- itching that takes a couple days before it goes away.  I have never experienced this with any other skincare product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I know this is caused by the sunscreen?  Well, I average over 4 long bike rides a week.  Depending on how cold it is and depending on how sunny it is, I may go either without wearing sunscreen at all, or just applying it to the back of my neck, or covering my arms, or also covering my legs.  I&#x27;d say I use at least some sunscreen on more than half of my rides, and I purchased this sunscreen three weeks ago, so that&#x27;s at least half-dozen times that I had at least some amount of this sunscreen on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The itching inevitably started the evening of the ride, got bad next day, and really bad the day after.  Then it would typically go away.  The itching was happening only in the exact areas to which the sunscreen was applied (e.g. if I applied it to my forearms, then my upper arms would be fine, but forearms would itch crazily).  Also, the itching would be worse in the areas where I was applying more sunscreen (e.g. on the outer side of the arms and legs vs. on the inner side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what ingredient this is caused by, but this itching certainly interfered with my daily life for days after application.  This may or may not affect you, but I&#x27;d definitely recommend that you try a small amount of this sunscreen first before committing to purchasing a large bottle.  Personally, I would never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> A recent consumer magazine rated this very poorly.  It&#x27;s SPF is only for UVA, and does very little for UVB. It alsot seems to exude a vapor that lasts all day and irritates my eyes.  I can&#x27;t wait to scrub it off at the end of the day. Get something else.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try mineral sunscreens, but we were going snorkeling and I read that the chemical sunscreens are bleaching out coral reefs. Since chemical sunscreens can bleach coral, I rather not think what it does applied to human skin. I ordered several mineral sunscreens. This one was a large tube that lasted a long time. We did not not burn in the tropical sun, even though we snorkeled for long stretches at a time. The instructions say how often to re-apply, but we were not very good with reapplying often, and still no sunburns. After applying sunscreen, you can tell you have it on. Water does not wash it off easily, so makes it perfect for snorkeling. Mineral sunscreen will stain your clothes immediately after applying, but it washes out in a washing machine. Other brand sunscreen was easier to apply, but this was not bad either. Would buy again for tube size and the SPF value.</li>
            <li> Good sun protection but I ended up with a rash all over my arms, legs and feet.</li>
            <li> Great sunblock- just know this is a sport sunblock and does not work well for daily use under make-up</li>
            <li> Thinksport is awesome sunscreen.  Non-greasy, great coverage, fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t appear white on your skin.  I buy it mainly because it doesn&#x27;t have the toxic chemicals that are in most sunscreens you buy at retail.  I use it myself &amp; send a bottle to daycare with my 10 year old...</li>
            <li> good service and good product!</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen, though be forewarned.  A couple of times this item has arrived as complete liquid in a tube.  Not sure what has happened.  Maybe high temperatures are to blame, but if that&#x27;s the case it is an obvious defect as sunscreen is used most in hot weather.  I&#x27;ve read others have experienced the same issue.  Hopefully, the manufacturer will do something to fix this.  Until then, I recommend buying this at a store or trying something else.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Both my sons do a lot of water sports, fresh and salt water, and it doesn&#x27;t come off.  Highly recommend, leaves a white film, but we would rather have that than getting sunburned.</li>
            <li> Bought this to take to the Dominican Republic.  It worked ok on my fair skin (red hair), but not as well as I had hoped!  Took a lot of extra rubbing to get it all rubbed in. Goes on very white and thick. I ended up switching to less natural SPF 70 which seemed to work much better for my skin in the sun and water.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sunscreens. Stays on extremely well all day sweating while rock climbing, surfing, kayaking, hiking, biking... It stand the test of my fun! I lather before I head out for the day, touch up my nose ever few hours... and Good to stay. I stay as white as Casper! Perhaps it&#x27;ll keep me from getting old... This could be the fountain of youth people!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a top choice according to EWG.  It has great protection and the ingredients present a low health concern.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband when we were heading out for a beach vacation.  Since he spends so much time in the water, I wanted to find something that would hold up when swimming, but yet didn&#x27;t have all the dangerous chemicals.  This stuff works great!  He was able to spend a lot of time in the water and then reapplied when he got out.  A couple of times, he even forgot to reapply.....and, still, no sunburn at all. The only downside to this product, and we knew this, is that it leaves a white residue on the skin.  My husband doesn&#x27;t really care about that, so it wasn&#x27;t an issue for him.  However, if that is a problem for you, and it overrides the pluses of keeping your from being sunburned and not containing harmful ingredients, then maybe this isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> A great non reactive, non irritating sunscreen. I apply it daily and do not burn. It has a side benefit of moisturising my face and arms. As I have had basal cell carcinoma, sun protection for me is vital. After trying many from the drug stores, this site helped me decide that Thinksport is the best product for SAFE sun protection.  http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is made in USA.</li>
            <li> Great effing sunscreen. I fished offshore yesterday sun up to sundown and had zero sunburn anywhere I put this. I regularly fish inshore,again all stinking day and this stuff protects like none other.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE-it does go very white so be sure to really rub it in. It will probably leave you with a slight white sheen when wearing but I&#x27;d rather have that than awful sunburn or skin cancer. The sun is serious and this is serious protection.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality!  Used it while on the Gulf coast - no sunburn!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen, not only for it&#x27;s protection but because it&#x27;s safe and non-toxic. I thought it went on well and wasn&#x27;t greasy. It did tend to clog my pores in my elbow crease, but I made sure to adjust the amount that I put there. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works incredibly and not smearing chemicals all over my body when I&#x27;m about to go do hardcore workout.  Highly recommend on efficacy alone but clean product is a must too.</li>
            <li> Works very good.  Applies white and rubs in cleanly without residue.  NO sunburn!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a high SPF, non-greasy, non-smelly product that blocks the sun effectively but doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.  I also don&#x27;t like to feel like I&#x27;m wearing sunblock.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product as it meets all of my needs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some info about me: I have Lupus and with that comes photo sensitivity.  As such, I have to wear sunscreen on a daily basis (even indoors).  The products my dermatologist recommended (Neutrogena SPF 60 sensitive skin and Vanicream SPF 50) weren&#x27;t working so I went to the EWG 2015 sunscreen guide and ran across this product.  So far, I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a week and have been really happy with it.  It meets all of my criteria, blocks the sun much better than those products my doc recommended, my skin hasn&#x27;t had issues with it and what little odor I smell is not unpleasant and seems to dissipate after application.  Its also one of the few sunscreens (not meant for the face) that seem to go on with a matte finish and doesn&#x27;t leave a yucky residue feeling after wearing it all day.  I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if I have any issues with wearing this product for long term use.</li>
            <li> Great...doesnt smell. Lasts</li>
            <li> best mix of durable protection, easy application, and as few harmful chemicals as possible. found from EWG sunscreen recommendation site. Smells good as well so my kid likes it</li>
            <li> Did not prevent sunburn</li>
            <li> this is the best sunscreen ever.  Goes on easily, smells great and works!</li>
            <li> Its rated 1 on the EWG, the ingredients are pure, this is the best physical/healthy sunscreen on the market, it does not leave to bad of a whitecast and it rubs in quite well, it has vitamin c and hyluaronic acid inside it so it has some serious anti aging benefits! if your a man just b sure u shave before using it because it sticks to facial hair and will leave a cast, overall this is an amazing product and could be a great tool in anyones anti aging arsenal!</li>
            <li> Purchased in late Aug 2014 with an expiration date of 2016. Yet in spring 2015 it is completely liquified. Shaking it did not bring back any consistency. Obviously defective. It worked when new but 8 months later it has zero value. The Thinkbaby that I purchased at the same time for my 2yr old has not liquified but has zero protection only 8 months after purchasing it. Reviews convinced me to purchase this brand but the truth is that drug store brands cost 75% less and work much better. My conclusion is that a lot of the reviews out there are fake or paid for. Contacted the manufacturer but they never responded. Spend your money on a better product.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of sunscreen in the tube and can last a long time.  This product definitely keeps your skin protected.</li>
            <li> We live in Hawaii so sunscreen is a big deal! When people are visiting they buy cheap brands then they get sunburn and pollute the oceans. I feel happy to buy this product it goes on and stays all dang day and it smells natural. Keep that skin looking beautiful and help the oceans and its creatures win win!!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for around five months now and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It lasts a long time under sweaty or wet conditions, much longer than many brands I&#x27;ve tried. It even requires a but of scrub to get it off in the shower if I haven&#x27;t worn it many hours, which to me is a good sign of it&#x27;s longevity. The ingredients are top notch as someone with a lot of skin reactions, this product has been just fine. I moved up to the 6oz bottle from 3oz and have enjoyed it immensely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than your average sunscreen, which is a little more watery. And it has a distinct smell (not too strong, neither good or bad). It works great as both a skin protector and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Perfect product and fast service</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever! I&#x27;m allergic to most chemical sunscreens &amp; other natural brands I&#x27;ve used have been difficult to apply &amp; left white residue on me. Thinksport is easy to apply, goes on clear &amp; has a pleasant sent.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant because we planned to ride our motorcycle in Sturgis and then on to Montana and Wyoming with short sleeves. It held up amazingly, we did not get sunburned at all. I can only highly recommend this for outdoor activity !</li>
            <li> Love the product as it has a high concentration of zinc oxide and doesn&#x27;t leave me too white like most. Product blends easily on skin and smells subtly nice, not overly fragrant. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great product and is rated very highly by the EWG.  Takes a little bit to smear on but it&#x27;s got a great consistency to it.</li>
            <li> Great sunblock - not greasy and awesome coverage.</li>
            <li> Safe product for my boys. They need safe because of all the UV exposure my twins get as life guards at a waterpark.</li>
            <li> I was looking for sunscreen for bicycling. I have been using plain old Neutrogena but thought I could find something better. This product IS NOT it. It comes out of the tube thick &amp; greasy. It did not rub in no matter how long I tried. So I left on my Saturday ride all white &amp; slimey. If you sweat much do not put this stuff anywhere around your eyes, as it stings like the dickens if any sweat runs into your eye. In my case, protection is mediocre. I came home with a pretty good burn. Yes, I know you are supposed to reapply every 80 minutes, but I sure wasn&#x27;t going to get all slimed up again out on the road. And the Neutrogena seems to last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, there is better products out there.</li>
            <li> Ordered 3 tubes of Thinksport mineral based and all it is is water.  No zine oxide, just tubes of water.  Complete joke, will never order this again!</li>
            <li> The best sport sunblock on the market. Used it in Punta Can while on vacation. We took several variety of sunblocks and none of the others came close to the protection and the coverage this provided. Highly recommend. Goes on non-greasy and lasts a long time.</li>
