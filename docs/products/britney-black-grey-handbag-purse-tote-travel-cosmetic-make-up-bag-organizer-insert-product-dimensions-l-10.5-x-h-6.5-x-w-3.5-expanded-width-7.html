            <li>I still load stuff on top, causing me to dig to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Many of the pressure points are riveted.</li>

            <li>This one has an almost mesh-like material on the inside that looks like it will hold up superbly well.&lt;br /&gt;Right now I have it in my bigger tote purse.  </li>

            <li>I love the looks of it</li>
            <li>I received my organizer just a couple of days ago and love it.  </li>
            <li>As I said in my title, I&#x27;m going to sew my own purses to fit this organizer.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;ll work for now since I don&#x27;t want to spend more than Jackson to get it.</li>
            <li>Couldnt ask for more.</li>

            <li>I have already showed many people and recommended this supplier.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great quality product.  </li>

            <li>other items by poking around once or twice (5 seconds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are excellent DIY instructions on the internet to make your own</li>
            <li>It fits most of my bags and the light color of the inside makes it easy to locate items!</li>
            <li>Loved it very much....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to be able to find the things in the bag quickly.</li>
            <li>Loved it at first.</li>
            <li>She carries a large purse that causes more harm than good.  </li>
            <li>It fits in most of my handbags and keeps everything easy to find.</li>
            <li>it fits in most of her purses and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love the handles that can be used to easily remove the organizer from one handbag and put into another bag.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to measure your purse and make sure it&#x27;ll fit inside expanded.</li>
            <li>Adjustable sizing will make it fit many of your favorite bags.</li>
            <li>It expands if needed and holds more than an adequate amount of purse stuf!</li>
            <li>Great organizer I use this in my large everyday bag and its perfect since I do carry everything but</li>
            <li>It has helped me keep my things together and more importantly, helped me find them when I needed them.</li>
            <li>and I was also able to fit it into a medium size bag.  </li>
            <li>The bag is adjustable to fit many size bags.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this would fit in my purse because the height was ~1/2\\&quot; taller than my purse (satchel-style), but I took a chance (figuring there is some &#x27;give&#x27; in the shape of the purse).  </li>
            <li>I travel to and fro once a week, and It works great and has held up well so far.  </li>
            <li>If you have a purse with soft, floppy sides, this is a great solution.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit this in my purse and everything is organized so well.  </li>
            <li>I loved this organizer so much I had to show it to my mom and sisters.  </li>
            <li>very easy to use to switch purses quickly.</li>
            <li>it helps make the bag more sturdy and there are more than enough pockets to keep everything is a fairly logic order, plus has room for the more bulky things like wallet or glass case holder.</li>
            <li>What you are reading in reviews is true!</li>
            <li>Probably its most unique feature is how the size can be adjusted, using snaps to pull it shut, or opening zippers to expand it.</li>
            <li>The best thing about it may be the price; I&#x27;m just not sure that if I buy something that costs more than my two handbags put together, it would also BE better than this.  </li>
            <li>pockets are on the INSIDE so it is easy to change from purse to purse because your items aren&#x27;t IN THE WAY.  </li>
            <li>so it is easy to grab &amp; use to transfer but are NOT in the way.  </li>
            <li>Great for big purses where you tend to never be able to find what you&#x27;re looking for or you just like organization</li>
            <li>Easy to change purses.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to switch purses in a hurry.</li>

            <li>some candy sticks so that I could chew either one easily</li>
            <li>Plenty pockets and easily transfers from bag to bag.</li>
            <li>There are handles along the inside of each side that make lifting the tote out easy.  </li>
            <li>it keep my stuff in the purse ORGANIZED and easy to find.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to pull it out and put it in another purse.  </li>

            <li>Everything is together &amp; easy to find</li>
            <li>Now it is easy to find everything.</li>
            <li>Makes keeping all your purse necessities within easy reach.  </li>
            <li>It is holding up well and can be easily cleaned if needed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to miss the pocket(s) if you are not using two hands to do so.</li>
            <li>Made it so easy to change purses</li>
            <li>I have not used the zipper expansion option yet, as I want to control how much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; I carry with me, but it&#x27;s nice to know I could add more if I want.  </li>
            <li>everything fits in one easy to transfer tote.</li>
            <li>Although, I would have chosen much prettier fabric :)y purse has a nice cell phone pocket</li>

            <li>Well made product, has a nice feel to it, and is doing exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li>I liked this organizer at first, but the problem is the color.  </li>
            <li>Makes it very fast and easy to change bags or purses and very easy to find things when on the run.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to see what is in the organizer because of the light interior.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to change purses so quickly and all my \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; goes with it every time.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I like being able to access my phone quickly.</li>
            <li>The handles are great because they make it easy to grab the bag and transfer to my next handbag, yet don&#x27;t stick out and get in the way of removing the items stored in the organizer.</li>
            <li>For overseas trips I use a large purse/handbag so I can have things handy that i need during the flights.</li>

            <li>Someone recommended the light colored interior and they were *</li>

            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Another nice feature is that the tote holds it shape and actually adds shape to purses that tend to not have any on their own - like hobos.  </li>

            <li>Fits in all my large handbags and now I switch my purses out more because it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li>Really helps keep things organized in &amp;#34;hobo&amp;#34; bags, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so easy to be able to &amp;#34;SEE&amp;#34; what you are looking for in your handbag.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>My LL Bean small &#x27;Boat Tote&#x27; bag was the perfect size, but had no pockets or inserts to help keep things from getting lost.  </li>
            <li>I usually carry a medium L. L. Bean tote and the organizer fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for a purse insert.  </li>
            <li>I am going on a trip and have a new purse without dividers so am very excited to use this to keep my bag more organized and easier to find things.</li>
            <li>- light colored interior makes items very visible and easy to find  - lightweight organizer doesn&#x27;t make the purse heavy  - lots of nicely sized, gusseted pockets  - interior pockets are great on this organizer (vs exterior pockets that would be smushed against the purse)  </li>
            <li>I wanted to be up- to-date by carrying one of the popular large, colorful bags that it seems everyone has these days.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and easy to put in and out of your purse!</li>
            <li>There are so many ways to customize this great little tote travel bag.  </li>
            <li>It makes switching out purses fast and easy!  </li>
            <li>Also this makes buying purses so much easier because you don&#x27;t need to pay attention to the pockets, just make sure your organizer will fit inside.</li>
            <li>Nice big compartments and can fit in any purse!</li>
            <li>Well, this organizer is just the right size, holds up great without calapsing in your handbag &amp; has just enough pockets .</li>
            <li>Great handles, easy to remove from one purse to the next.  too large for some of my purses</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would fit into, and in my larger purses, it&#x27;s ok that it isn&#x27;t a perfect fit because I can put other things in between!  </li>
            <li>I love using these in a large bag where everything falls to the bottom, etc.</li>
            <li>It could spread out in width more but the purse isn&#x27;t quite large enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just love the functionality, it turned a large fashion bag into a bag I can use every day w/o frustration.  </li>
            <li>Love the large zipper compartment inside and the pockets to hold whatever i need.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect, love  extra pockets but it needs more stiff side supports in order to keep it from collapsing inward.</li>
            <li>If you have a large handbag you will love this organizer.</li>
            <li>It fits well in all my bags - they are mostly medium or large bags though.  </li>
            <li>who in their right mind designs a bag with three pockets?!</li>
            <li>and I got it right this time!</li>
            <li>and I have to pull it right sde up before  can begin to look for anything!</li>
            <li>I tried to put this in a medium size purse and it was too big, but this is a great product for organizing your large purse!</li>
            <li>This color is even pretty enough that it would work great in a designer bag.  </li>
            <li>Would have liked if the side ends were more firm to give the insert more support.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was fair, and it was exactly what I needed, and it has held up well so far.</li>
            <li>This is really cool.  </li>
            <li>Several of her friends have since purchased this and they too have all loved it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it most highly Thank you!  </li>
            <li>I love it so much that i bought additional organizers as gifts.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaging was appropriate.  </li>
            <li>I love it and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This would make a good present too.</li>
            <li>This product is a dream come true.  </li>
            <li>maybe i didn&#x27;t have enough good luck</li>
            <li>Still, the design is good, it adjusts to different purse sizes within reason.</li>
            <li>Although, I would have chosen much prettier fabric :)</li>
            <li>I have another type, but I really like this one better.</li>
            <li>I am not one to over-stuff a purse, however, so I thought it would be OK if I treated it gently.</li>
            <li>and this has made the job much, much easier, on top of that I ALWAYS know where to find the item I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li>Good solid nylon fabric with well stitched seams that should hold up well.  </li>
            <li>I am a bit of a purse problem - I love them all - and I REALLY needed this organizer.  </li>
            <li>My life is much improved :)</li>
            <li>- I just got it yesterday, but it seems good enough.  </li>
            <li>Because the Mossimo is made of soft leathery material, it needs this kind of organizer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all women! :-)</li>
            <li>Price is not bad for its purpose</li>
            <li>I can now switch purses very fast and easily.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY enjoyed the fact that this has zippers on that side that expand to let you use more space, this is way way better than other purse organizers that ive tried and the quality literally lasted a month before breaking.</li>
            <li>Fit my purse just right.</li>
            <li>and clutch wallets fit just right in it.  </li>
            <li>This organizer is built okay on the outside and very cheap and flimsy on the inside.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time-this is a great help in keeping your purse organized-would definitely recommend it for anyone who carries a large purse.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it was not there.  </li>
            <li>Gave them to several friends and they were most pleased.</li>
            <li>The order arrived quickly and I had no issues with damage, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, I love this insert enough that I am considering thinking of ordering 2-4 more.  </li>
            <li>Would make a super gift item, too.</li>
            <li>I like it so much I have left it in the purse/handbag permanently now, but its great to know</li>
            <li>I have a Speedy 30 and it fits perfectly with spare room for larger items such as a book or iPad.</li>
            <li>She has since added this organizer to her bag, it&#x27;s made a difference to how quickly she can find what she&#x27;s looking for.</li>
            <li>It makes for quick changes &amp; I change mine alot</li>
            <li>The best thing about this is that I have a smaller purse, and if I keep both sides (or even one side) zipped up, it fits in my smaller purses.  </li>
            <li>Its great and a good alternative to those expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I think the design is good: the handles are low and don&#x27;t get in the way but are useful for pulling the organizer out.</li>
            <li>Look like they are best for flat cell phones, cards or very short pens.</li>
            <li>Once I filled my organizer the first time and tried to pick it up using the handles, two of the rivets popped off.  </li>
            <li>Overall very pleased and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>This is a very useful item and at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It certainly holds all my &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and it makes my purse neat and things easy to find.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recomend this product for someone who like to change bags often or wants handbag more organized as I can now find everything easily instead of having to search through bag.</li>
            <li>It appears to be really well made, and it&#x27;s super easy to change from purse to purse because it&#x27;s lightweight and adjustable.</li>
            <li>A very good organizer with rightly sized pockets and enough of them to fit in all regular accessories.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best solution I&#x27;ve ever found for keeping my purse from becoming a total mess.  </li>
            <li>So fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>It is very functional and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is very well made and services as an easy way to organize one&#x27;s purse or suitcase</li>
            <li>Perfect size so up can still fit other bits and pieces but main contents stay in this and get transferred whenever a new handbag calls</li>
            <li>the separate pockets are great &amp; I can slip my phone down in the little front pocket - which is great because I lose my phone all the time.</li>
            <li>My bag arrived within a couple of days and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now 1.5 years later and time to review this - I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I first saw these totes on home shopping in another brand, and was pleased to find this a lot cheaper on Amazon and many kinds of various prices, sizes and quality.  </li>
            <li>Also, I didn&#x27;t sense any funky smell that previous reviewers had mentioned and as far as quality, I&#x27;m truly impressed.</li>
            <li>Great little thing.</li>
            <li>This is a great little tool for keeping the purse organized.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is fairly light, so it doesn&#x27;t add too much weight to your bag.  </li>
            <li>The lining in my purse ripped out and I needed an insert, and this fit the bill very well.</li>
            <li>This purse organizer fit perfectly inside my bag, it does not slide around - and I am not dainty with tossing my bag!  </li>
            <li>so far, they love it too.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of a light blue.</li>
            <li>It also expands which is useful.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a must own or gift</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been very sturdy and it&#x27;s nice that it expands</li>
            <li>so worth what I paid for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice &amp; sturdy so it doesn&#x27;t slide back &amp; forth &amp; has pockets everywhere.</li>
            <li>All the zippers operate smoothly, and I love the opportunity for expanding the size for even larger bags.  </li>
            <li>The things I like most about it is the material and stitching quality, and it is deep enough that most items aren&#x27;t sticking out over the top where they can be bumped.  </li>
            <li>I even like the Britney better because the light solid colored lining makes things easier to find.  </li>
            <li>This is really a nice organizer, but I&#x27;ve only had it in my purse one day and the stitching is already coming undone.</li>
            <li>This insert has two zippers that opens it up to make it bigger, which is a nice plus.  </li>
            <li>well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>She has wanted one for a while and had done some research on her own prior to telling me what she wanted.</li>
            <li>a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I am careful to take good care of my things</li>
            <li>A nice number of compartments and overall size.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased the organizer has lasted this long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nevertheless, so far, I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>There are cheaper alternatives, but this one is worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something where you can change purses, I think this organizer would be useful to you.  </li>
            <li>This item is very useful, it fits my handbag very well.</li>
            <li>they can&#x27;t make a more durable interior because other than that , I really love it&#x27;s features.</li>
            <li>The problem  was that the inside was a silky/satiny material that did not hold up at the seams and ripped pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using mine for a few years and it is very handy.</li>
            <li>I like the zippered pocket and the other pockets are a good size for my aluma wallet..  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all right there for you.</li>
            <li>So, I measured it and set out to find the right size and type for my satchel bag.</li>
            <li>Holds everything I need and fits right into my purse</li>
            <li>3\\&quot; is about the right length to peek out of those locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>3\\&quot; is about the right length to peek out of those locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was just right.</li>
            <li>contacts keys and anything else I would need is right at my fingertips.</li>
            <li>I checked it right away when it arrived so I could see about airing it out before Christmas</li>
            <li>This organizer was delivered right on time.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s stretchy pockets at each end, just the right size to stand a water bottle in, which I didn&#x27;t realize before I bought it, so that&#x27;s an added bonus for me.</li>
            <li>Everything is is right there when I need it, not in the corners of the purse.</li>
            <li>I now can pull the tote right out of my purse and put it in my carryon bag.  </li>
            <li>I will just drop this organizer in and whatever I need will be right there, in view.  </li>
            <li>Now I need a new purse to put it in, but that will be the easy part.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to order another Britney for me - and they are my new latest gift idea for family and friends - useful and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I got this insert last week, and so far I am LOVING it!</li>
            <li>It fits in my purse nicely, but I guess I tend to carry around more smaller things and would like smaller (or narrower) pockets.</li>
            <li>I simply love the organizer , the quality is good and it is expandable so fits into small hobos as well expands to fit into the larger bags.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Downside is that I can&#x27;t ever find them as the seem to disappear into my large bag!  </li>
            <li>So far, however, this size has been perfect – not too large, not too small.  </li>
            <li>I really like the little handles you use to lefit it out -- very handy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is just right sized for the tote bags I carry, not too heavy and the light interior makes everything very easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in my Land&#x27;s End medium zip tote and now I can find my loose items without dumping everything out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well-made and very reasonably priced for the quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It delivered very fast.</li>
            <li>shipment arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>The item itself is very cheaply made and of low quality material.</li>
            <li>But I have to say I like this organizer very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It was a good little organizer.</li>
            <li>It kind of folds in a little at the top (not with a magnet or a snap, just naturally), which I like.</li>
            <li>Shipping was lightning fast!  </li>
            <li>(I leave it zipped up, and it is more than enough space for me).</li>
            <li>This is the first organizer I&#x27;ve ever ordered.</li>
            <li>Most of the smell was gone by then, and is now (28 hrs later) not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to switch out purses in a hurry!</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as it is value-for-money and a God-send !!</li>
            <li>I got this first</li>
            <li>: I forgot to mention that it looks exactly like it does in the pictures.</li>
            <li>Now I know exactly where everything is.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!&lt;br</li>
            <li>mine is not as shown,  does not have the key holder but is ok</li>
            <li>I like the outside pockets that are made from the more rigid exterior material because I can tuck my iPhone in and it stays put.</li>
            <li>The pockets are well sized so they can be used in many different ways; rather then one size fits all.  </li>
            <li>Well, first of all, it was delivered before I had even given a thought that it was time to receive it--in a jiffy,</li>
            <li>really!</li>
            <li>The first time that I had to find something in my bag</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>I love how all I have to do is pull this out of my purse and sit it inside the next purse I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>This was purchased as a gift and would have gotten a higher rating  </li>
            <li>It fits in many different sizes of purses.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I can still access the built-in purse pockets, but gives you so many more, and allows you to still have an open compartment in the middle.</li>
            <li>I have more than enough room.</li>
            <li>Got this for my girlfriend for Christmas as she wanted a way to organize her purse and move stuff between them (exactly what this was made for).</li>
            <li>They sent another bag without hesitation and didn&#x27;t even ask to return the first one.</li>
            <li>Its perfect for my day-to-day purses and for my larger travel or spa bags because I can put larger items in and still keep my smaller items organized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it in a Coach tote (Madison) and it does exactly what I wanted this for -</li>
            <li>My purse is so much more functional, and is STAYING orderly without constant reorganizing.  </li>
            <li>I love looking in and instantly seeing everything!</li>
            <li>I really like this bag/organizer!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>It is especially helpful in slouchy hobo ( my favorite ) style handbags.</li>
            <li>at first.  </li>
            <li>The reason I rate this as 3 stars is because it was a amazing (5 star worthy) at first but now that it&#x27;s fallen apart a little</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend buying this, it is good quality and you won&#x27;t be let down.  </li>
            <li>Great item and was a lot larger than expected, but still works with my purse.</li>
            <li>The one thing I miss from my old purse organizer is a lobster claw clip for my keyring, but there are enough pockets that my keys could get their own space.</li>
            <li>The handles are stitched in, so it would seem the rivets are more decorative, but really, the handles aren&#x27;t even necessary</li>
            <li>Really makes things easier to find and was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really clear from the pictures or the description how much more flexible it is because of the two zippers that allow for expansion and the set of snaps at each end that aren&#x27;t described at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Internal pockets: a good sizes for wallets, checkbooks, small notebooks and sunglasses cases (those really large ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internal \\&quot;handles\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has a zippered pocket for your most personal or loose-fitting items as well as 6 other compartments facing inside towards a large middle-pocket.</li>
            <li>It keeps everything organized and easy to find regardless of how big my purse is.</li>
            <li>The inner handles make it easy to grab to switch from one purse to another.</li>
            <li>It fits snugly into her larger bag and gives her easy access to everything.  </li>
            <li>such an easy tool to organize our handbags.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t changed purses since buying this, but I can see it&#x27;s going to be an easy transition: just move the organizer from one purse to the next.  </li>
            <li>It is somewhat flexible and would easily squish into a regular purse (read the dimensions of course).</li>
            <li>There are little handles to make it easy to pull out of the purse, even though it&#x27;s a snug fit.  </li>
            <li>I have a large D&amp;B hobo type bag and without an organizer</li>
            <li>I carry a rather large purse to accommodate my iPad.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep my large leather purse upright as well as organized,</li>
            <li>This organized  inside of my large bag.</li>
            <li>I was worried that it may be too large for my purse</li>
            <li>(I would add that I bought a large that stated that it is a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; size.  </li>
            <li>I carry fairly large handbags.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to my family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT IT FOR A LARGE COACH BAG</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too large for my purses, so I am using it in my weekend travel bag.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift to go in a large purse I also bought.</li>
            <li>I like a large hand bag, but can never find what I need.</li>
            <li>It is a large purse</li>
            <li>This bag will accommodate a medium or large handbag, plus it is quite sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>large.  </li>
            <li>It holds my big headphone case ds case wallet and camera in its case and a lot more can&#x27;t wait to use it in my new purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i would recommentd it because it is firm, dosnt collapse and is light colored on the inside to easily identify your items.&lt;br /&gt;fits</li>
            <li>So right now, as I peruse what&#x27;s out there, I&#x27;m really torn between just buying a new one of these</li>
            <li>If my bag was any smaller this wouldn&#x27;t fit - so pay attention to the dimensions, it is large.</li>
            <li>The tote works best in purses that are totally open inside, but I have used it with a purse that had a center interior pocket and that still worked out okay as long as I didn&#x27;t try to use the other side.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my medium bags and even a few of my larger ones and my totes.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be bigger because the purse I got for Christmas is huge, but it has no bearing on the organizer itself.</li>
            <li>My suggestion with anyone looking at these is to definitely stick with the light colors for the interior like this one has because it makes it a snap to find your stuff.</li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>but it looks really WELL MADE.  </li>
            <li>works really well and everything has its spot.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and has a lot of room.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time reading purse organizer reviews (can&#x27;t believe how many are out there) and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>The Bag Organizer is very well made.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a real</li>
            <li>It also takes the abuse I give it really</li>
            <li>I purchased this product not expecting such great quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Much easier to find everything.  </li>
            <li>I really like the concept of this organizer.</li>
            <li>Fits in my purse very well.</li>
            <li>This organizer fits a medium-sized handbag very well.  </li>
            <li>Very functional for shopping but just try finding anything in there.</li>
            <li>Really like this organizer.  </li>
            <li>Very practical as an organizer</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Product is very helpful to organize your belongings.  </li>
            <li>It makes it much easier to locate items rather than having to dig all around in your purse.  </li>
            <li>It hold so much.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Really, you just have to decide how you want to use it.  </li>
            <li>This bag really helped get everything in order so that I don&#x27;t have to go hunting for items every time I go in my purse.</li>
            <li>It really helps to keep things organized.</li>
            <li>This really helped me to organize me purse.</li>
            <li>I really like the convenience of this purse insert.</li>
            <li>My mom has already ordered one for herself, and both of my sisters may very well order one too.  </li>
            <li>It is somewhat light weight but sturdy enough to stand up and not collapse.</li>
            <li>This organizer works very well in my Miche handbag -</li>
            <li>I really like this insert.</li>
            <li>It gives some structure to my floppy purse and is very convenient for organizing the myriad items I keep in my purse.</li>
            <li>but I really shouldn&#x27;t have to this soon.</li>
            <li>I did not consider either of these issues important enough to bother with returning the product, but there did appear to be some concerns with manufacturing \\&quot;quality control.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>MUCH easier for me to find stuff.</li>
            <li>I got this very promptly, and was amaze at the quality.</li>
            <li>my purse is really organized.</li>
            <li>This item is better than I expected for the price, and I want to buy another one for my mom.  </li>
            <li>This came fast and was everything that was described.</li>
            <li>I like it because it can fit different sized bags.</li>
            <li>My mother loves it because she switches purses so much and this makes it easier for her</li>
            <li>The purse organizer arrived in 9 days (if you include weekend days); so much for 2-6 days, but I digress.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use the outer pockets much since the organizer (un-expanded) JUST fits in my Mossimo crossbody handbag.  </li>
            <li>The tote has made switching purses so much easier.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Just not made very well.</li>
            <li>It holds so much</li>
            <li>I have knocked my tote over sideways on the car seat and the open top is not a disaster, plus the elastized pockets on each end hold things more firmly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made and sleek.  </li>
            <li>thanks you</li>
            <li>It is a great idea, but it does not hold much, not that well organized, and adds unnecessary weight.</li>
            <li>The pockets are roomy and there is plenty of room for my large wallet, coupon keeper and camera in the large main compartment.</li>
            <li>I am pocketbook obsessed, MUST have the right amount of pockets, as I like organizations, this is great.</li>
            <li>This one stays up right, the fabric is a soft yet very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The pockets on this organizer are large, so things kind of flop around, even my smart phone (screen size is 5&amp;#34;) seems to flop over and keep the pocket it sits in open, so I still have to &#x27;dig around&#x27; to access the other things inside the organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really wouldn&#x27;t have cared if it was lime green as long as it does such a great job!</li>
            <li>The 2 slim little handle straps make it very easy to pull in and out</li>
            <li>I am so glad I listened to the other reviewers and purchased this one.</li>
            <li>The Britney organizer has more rigid sides, allowing it to retain its shape in my purse and the pockets are deeper, which means my pens, gloss sticks, and other items don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>excited that I can now use different bags and still be organized.</li>
            <li>The product has a million pockets of various sizes and is very simply to clean.</li>
            <li>It fits great in almost any purse, big or small.</li>
            <li>This would make a nice little gift for anyone who likes to often change purses depending on their outfits!</li>
            <li>next to eachother in the main compartment, otherwise they will only fit on top of one another when used without expansion and in the American West bag.  </li>
            <li>Also, the light grey interior color makes it easier to find items.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted to add extra pockets and organization to a very large purse that I have!  </li>
            <li>I put it in a hobo bag and it gave it more shape and less slouchiness</li>
            <li>sometimes less is more.</li>
            <li>These cost less than many on the market</li>
            <li>I had it less than 5 month and the inside lining ripped in the corner seam from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>i like that this one has visible pockets, so I can quickly peek into my purse and find what I need in a second!</li>
            <li>Would love to find a smaller version for my smaller purses.</li>
            <li>Make this bag in fashion colors and I&#x27;ll be back for several more.</li>
            <li>It does not stay steady in the purse, but tends to flip over</li>
            <li>I played around with placing my phone vs. keys in a particular spot, but now, I know before opening my bag (from the front, always) where everything is (without even looking).  </li>
            <li>I can find anything in a heartbeat, and I can return items to their proper location quickly.</li>
            <li>It is also designed to make smaller or larger which I love.  </li>
            <li>I love all the pockets it has, but I especially like tha feature that allows me to make the Britany Organizer larger if I need to.</li>
            <li>My purse  was a mess, everything  piled on top of  itself.  </li>
            <li>the quality is high.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this purse organizer based on the product photos.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Nice bag organizer, lining seems to be made of a more inexpensive nylon, so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who likes to stay organized.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves purses.</li>
            <li>I liked this one in particular because it has hard sides and that keeps it upright in my bag instead of falling over.</li>
            <li>ok, so its not so little.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to measure your average handbags!</li>
            <li>A little stretch in the handles would have been better, and prettier colors.</li>
            <li>so much I bought a smaller one to fit into my smaller bags.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the quality was not not as great as the price.  </li>
            <li>I had a different organizer, but it had too many \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; pockets and it took me just as long to find things.</li>
            <li>I normally like.</li>
            <li>But having an organized purse has made my life so much more productive, that I don&#x27;t give a damn (excuse my french).</li>
            <li>received the bag in two days the seller also sent me a solar powered flashlight that attaches to your key ring as a complimentary gift.</li>
            <li>This Organizer is firm enough to stand up nicely in the tote, and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge deal for me, but lighter would be better.  </li>
            <li>tight compact organization with the top down view allows organization combined with easy search and retrieval.</li>
            <li>Get some of those clever key clips and you&#x27;ll have a handy rail for little items that would get lost in the pockets.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can find everything in my big bag right away</li>
            <li>The side compartments fit all of my other necessities with room to spare.</li>
            <li>I give this product a three star because at first I love it but a few weeks later it broke.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is also a nice little pocket on the outside.  </li>
            <li>The Britney Black &amp; Grey Handbag Purse Tote Organizer truly helps keeping things more organized in my purse!</li>
            <li>Now I can easily spot my black phone and lipstick tube beause</li>
            <li>My previous organizer collapsed easily and was a nuisance to work with.</li>
            <li>I put everything away and the middle is still available to hold water bottles, hats, or the occasional paperback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased a few of the purse inserts, and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>zippers don&#x27;t seem that good of quality (small and plastic) and the grey fabric that it expands with can get caught in the zipper</li>
            <li>I have a large Louis Vuitton and this makes finding small items easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything as advertised, satin outside, grey inside for easy searching.  </li>
            <li>So, either due to fast transit time or just getting lucky (or perhaps they fixed the problem)</li>
            <li>It only fits in big bags, not cross body, but more like bucket bags, hobo bags, and messenger bags.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>, this organizer is meant for a medium sized purse, not a small hand bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made pretty well, held up with daily use.</li>
            <li>Friends say they are amazed at what I keep in my purse, including eye drops and a toothbrush and paste, so I usually choose bags with many pockets and dividers.</li>
            <li>Only was there for about 5 seconds if that when I first took it out of the plastic bag it was</li>
            <li>Also, I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and chose one with a light inside.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, you just lift the whole thing when you move to a new bag.</li>
            <li>I love this organizer and how it has helped fix my big mess of a purse.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well as a purse organizer but the side pockets are hard to access in a deep bag, so everything ends up in the middle section any way, It would be fantastic as a travel kit (night table item, miscellaneous chargers, cords, tissues, medications, etc with two additional features: 1) a snap to hold it closed; 2) roomer top straps</li>
            <li>I also have enough room to put my day planner (size of a large tablet) on one of the sides, where it is supported between the bag and the insert.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought a large purse which I wanted to keep neat and organized.  </li>
            <li>things\\&quot; into all of the compartments including my large wallet and sunglasses in the middle, and just admired it for a minute or two, and I did find that in the corner cubbies, I could and did put in my pens (standing up) and</li>
            <li>Hobo bags are big, but it is like throwing everything into a large sack.</li>
            <li>It has 2 spacious outside pockets, 6 large pockets and a zippered compartment on the inside.</li>
            <li>Theirs is a little smaller &amp; too many credit card pockets on the side that I wouldn&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li>that said, a little over ten bucks I&#x27;m OK with ordering another.</li>
            <li>Most purses have a couple little pockets inside, but this organizes everything in the Bermuda Triangle middle area.  </li>
            <li>was surprised at all of the compartments,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I bought this because I frequently switch bags and wanted something to make it easier.  </li>
            <li>Well, it completely disintegrated at this point.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants a big purse</li>
            <li>If I were to use a smaller or larger bag, I would definitely continue using a purse organizer, something to fit.  </li>
            <li>Now I am very organized and never have to dig through everything to find my phone, or key.</li>
            <li>keeps my big purse very organized</li>
            <li>The tote fixed that problem.</li>
            <li>If I had a second bag for this to fit into, I think I would ultimately just order a second organizer.</li>
            <li>I can tell this is very well made and overall</li>
            <li>I can also find and remove my wallet (or whatever) so much quicker, and then put it back faster too</li>
            <li>I wish it cost a little less, but if it holds up well, I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>so* right, it is easier to see everything in the organizer despite sitting low in my big tote.</li>
            <li>I use this in a large business tote with a flat bottom.</li>
            <li>The other reviews were very helpful in that regard, so thanks.</li>
            <li>I just love all the extra little pockets and now when I change bags I always know where everything is!</li>
            <li>This worked differently than I expected, although it was very well-made and pretty.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised this fit into a small tote.</li>
            <li>I like my bag to be highly organized but often feel restricted in my style choices because I needed several partitions.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived I saw this normal, like picture, not any emotion, I only settled of my stuff inside</li>
            <li>However, through normal use, the stitching in one of the middle pockets has become undone</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that I wish that the ends were stiff so that it would stay open better.  </li>
            <li>I notice in the product description that the company makes the following claim: &amp;#34;As of January 2013, improved Quality Control Standards implemented.&amp;#34; If this is true, either the standards are still not adequate or they sent me the old model.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I did throw away a few stray papers and fuzzies that were lurking in the corners of my Coach, so it got a little cleanup too, but now everything is JUST where I want it.  </li>
            <li>only complaint is that the pockets are not sewn very securely and the seams have loosened a bit with use -- only the inside pockets though, The outside is very well constructed and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Between my wallet, tissues, gum, business cards, paper pad and pens, I needed something to organize since my new tote only had two side pockets and one zipper pocket.</li>
            <li>Cant really say anything bad, this was a good buy and helpful.</li>
            <li>This is essential for any guy/gal who wants to organize their multiple items in a neat, orderly fashion.</li>
            <li>Others complained about the same things, yet they were pleased with their purchase.  </li>
            <li>The straps make it easy to pull it in and out of my purse and the cream colored interior makes things much easier to see compared to other organizers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>And now that my bag is clean I still have those pockets made into the purse itself to use, not to mention if your bag is a little bigger than the organizer, you have room to the sides for things like water bottles.</li>
            <li>It would not fit a little bag, but is fantastic for a large tote/hobo style.  </li>
            <li>a zipper pocket &#x3D; total 7) and the large open area in the middle that holds my wallet, ipad mini and makeup bag!!</li>
            <li>It could be a little larger to fit in larger handbags.</li>
            <li>For those still in disbelief or think they are fine with their purse the way it is; I can fit my Wallet, a small zipper bag of personal items, A cosmetic zip bag, cell phone for personal and work, iPod, headphones, Kindle, car charger, keys(neatly hooked), tissues, mini lotion, mini spray, mini deodorant, mini bug spray, lip balm, travel umbrella, Medication bottle, small flashlight, pens and notebook.</li>
            <li>(though to be honest, I wish it was a little bigger, as I tend to carry enormous purses -- or if I should just break down and buy a pricier one on Etsy that&#x27;s custom made and/or try one of the cheaper models on here.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that it got such positive reviews by other buyers...  </li>
            <li>Clearly, I needed a second bag, or cargo pants.</li>
            <li>Clearly, I needed a second bag, or cargo pants.</li>
            <li>the whole organizer is durable, but the inside pouches are not really...</li>
            <li>I may not put everything in it, but it helps considerably with overall organization.</li>
            <li>What I found most frustrating is that all of the items I carried would gather at the bowels of the bottomless pit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be bookmarking this brand since my first baby is due soon, and I think something like this can make a &amp;#34;non-diaper bag&amp;#34; into just what I need!  </li>
            <li>: one category for pocket, easy pockets for storage and for take of them, eight internal pockets (six big and two small) and two external pockets, a big space in the middle for large stuff like wallet or glasses box, you can enlarge this space open one or two of zippers for that.</li>
            <li>It looks so much nicer than any other bag organizer I found at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Also, after using the organizer for only a couple of days, one of the metal double cap rivets came off of one of the handles, and upon closer inspection, both sides of the rivet were found to be clearly bent and misshapen, which likely occurred in assembly.  </li>
            <li>I am always in a hurry, therefore I am a pretty messy purse person</li>
            <li>This organizer helps the bag keep its shape and stand-up straight when I set the bag down.  </li>
            <li>Actually I tried this one first in black with yellow zippers.  </li>
            <li>Recipient also loved this product which is very difficult to find locally.  </li>
            <li>so when I went to open the pouch one whole slot opened down the length of the seam.</li>
            <li>So, I went on Amazon and spotted this pretty sturdy looking organizer, the Britney Black &amp; Grey, and I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>(this company also makes ones for small and large bags, I will be ordering!)</li>
            <li>There is also a little place that a pen slips into &amp; that really works for me too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purse dimensions: Mine is 14\\&quot; long, 9\\&quot; high, 5\\&quot; wide (at the bottom).</li>

            <li> Holds more than we had thought</li>
            <li> Over all, I am glad that I have to use.  </li>
            <li> They like the versitility of being able to change it&#x27;s size.  </li>
            <li> I finally got a purse to accommodate an organizer like this, and it works great!</li>
            <li> It has helped my purse stay more oraganized, which makes it easier to find stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a great organizer, very roomy, fits well in my Steve Madden handbag.  </li>
            <li> I holds everything and has room for more.  </li>
            <li> I love the looks of it</li>
            <li> I received my organizer just a couple of days ago and love it.  </li>
            <li> As I said in my title, I&#x27;m going to sew my own purses to fit this organizer.  </li>
            <li> She is now able to find things faster now.</li>
            <li> I love to carry around totes for flexibility of adding things and access to things.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;ll work for now since I don&#x27;t want to spend more than Jackson to get it.</li>
            <li> Couldnt ask for more.</li>
            <li> It has so many places to put things</li>

            <li> other items by poking around once or twice (5 seconds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are excellent DIY instructions on the internet to make your own</li>
            <li> It fits most of my bags and the light color of the inside makes it easy to locate items!</li>
            <li> Loved it very much....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to be able to find the things in the bag quickly.</li>
            <li> Loved it at first.</li>
            <li> She carries a large purse that causes more harm than good.  </li>
            <li> It fits in most of my handbags and keeps everything easy to find.</li>
            <li> it fits in most of her purses and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love the handles that can be used to easily remove the organizer from one handbag and put into another bag.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to measure your purse and make sure it&#x27;ll fit inside expanded.</li>
            <li> Adjustable sizing will make it fit many of your favorite bags.</li>
            <li> It expands if needed and holds more than an adequate amount of purse stuf!</li>
            <li> Great organizer I use this in my large everyday bag and its perfect since I do carry everything but</li>
            <li> It has helped me keep my things together and more importantly, helped me find them when I needed them.</li>
            <li> and I was also able to fit it into a medium size bag.  </li>
            <li> The bag is adjustable to fit many size bags.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would fit in my purse because the height was ~1/2\\&quot; taller than my purse (satchel-style), but I took a chance (figuring there is some &#x27;give&#x27; in the shape of the purse).  </li>
            <li> I travel to and fro once a week, and It works great and has held up well so far.  </li>
            <li> If you have a purse with soft, floppy sides, this is a great solution.</li>

            <li> I loved this organizer so much I had to show it to my mom and sisters.  </li>
            <li> very easy to use to switch purses quickly.</li>
            <li> it helps make the bag more sturdy and there are more than enough pockets to keep everything is a fairly logic order, plus has room for the more bulky things like wallet or glass case holder.</li>
            <li> What you are reading in reviews is true!</li>
            <li> Probably its most unique feature is how the size can be adjusted, using snaps to pull it shut, or opening zippers to expand it.</li>
            <li> The best thing about it may be the price; I&#x27;m just not sure that if I buy something that costs more than my two handbags put together, it would also BE better than this.  </li>
            <li> pockets are on the INSIDE so it is easy to change from purse to purse because your items aren&#x27;t IN THE WAY.  </li>
            <li> so it is easy to grab &amp; use to transfer but are NOT in the way.  </li>

            <li> some candy sticks so that I could chew either one easily</li>
            <li> Plenty pockets and easily transfers from bag to bag.</li>

            <li> Made it so easy to change purses</li>
            <li> I have not used the zipper expansion option yet, as I want to control how much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; I carry with me, but it&#x27;s nice to know I could add more if I want.  </li>
            <li> everything fits in one easy to transfer tote.</li>

            <li> I liked this organizer at first, but the problem is the color.  </li>
            <li> Makes it very fast and easy to change bags or purses and very easy to find things when on the run.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to see what is in the organizer because of the light interior.</li>

            <li> It arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I like being able to access my phone quickly.</li>
            <li> The handles are great because they make it easy to grab the bag and transfer to my next handbag, yet don&#x27;t stick out and get in the way of removing the items stored in the organizer.</li>

            <li> She always used to carry a &amp;#34;hand bag&amp;#34; that looked like she must be a proficient shoplifter, carrying a huge purse.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>

            <li> I can find important items immediately (2 seconds) and</li>
            <li> The design has some really thoughtful touches not found on the DIY instructions.</li>

            <li> Fits great in a messenger bag and holds everything a guy (or girl) could possibly need.  </li>
            <li> I have bought six of these now for gifts and they get fantastic reception.</li>
            <li> It also expands to your liking - fit up almost any purse except the skinny ones.</li>
            <li> I might eventually try to find a bigger one, but if you need an organizer for a medium sized purse - this one is great.</li>
            <li> It even fit into a purse</li>
            <li> Someone recommended the light colored interior and they were *</li>
            <li> I love all the pockets and am able to find things much easier now.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Another nice feature is that the tote holds it shape and actually adds shape to purses that tend to not have any on their own - like hobos.  </li>
            <li> glasses, the side pockets are perfect for those loose papers/receipts and plenty of room for my large wallet!  </li>
            <li> fits right in purse and  love all the pockets  </li>
            <li> and I found it very useful and time saving.</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>

            <li> Very very useful.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it; she&#x27;s able to keep everything organized and free up enough space to keep her Kindle with her at all times, not to mention that she&#x27;s able to use as many of her handbags as she&#x27;d like now since it&#x27;s so easy to change from one to another.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how easy it is to find anything I need and so quickly, too.  </li>
            <li> Switching bags is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> Fits in all my large handbags and now I switch my purses out more because it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li> Really helps keep things organized in &amp;#34;hobo&amp;#34; bags, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so easy to be able to &amp;#34;SEE&amp;#34; what you are looking for in your handbag.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> My LL Bean small &#x27;Boat Tote&#x27; bag was the perfect size, but had no pockets or inserts to help keep things from getting lost.  </li>
            <li> I usually carry a medium L. L. Bean tote and the organizer fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for a purse insert.  </li>
            <li> I am going on a trip and have a new purse without dividers so am very excited to use this to keep my bag more organized and easier to find things.</li>
            <li> - light colored interior makes items very visible and easy to find  - lightweight organizer doesn&#x27;t make the purse heavy  - lots of nicely sized, gusseted pockets  - interior pockets are great on this organizer (vs exterior pockets that would be smushed against the purse)  </li>
            <li> I wanted to be up- to-date by carrying one of the popular large, colorful bags that it seems everyone has these days.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and easy to put in and out of your purse!</li>
            <li> There are so many ways to customize this great little tote travel bag.  </li>
            <li> It makes switching out purses fast and easy!  </li>
            <li> Also this makes buying purses so much easier because you don&#x27;t need to pay attention to the pockets, just make sure your organizer will fit inside.</li>
            <li> Nice big compartments and can fit in any purse!</li>
            <li> Well, this organizer is just the right size, holds up great without calapsing in your handbag &amp; has just enough pockets .</li>
            <li> Great handles, easy to remove from one purse to the next.  too large for some of my purses</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would fit into, and in my larger purses, it&#x27;s ok that it isn&#x27;t a perfect fit because I can put other things in between!  </li>
            <li> I love using these in a large bag where everything falls to the bottom, etc.</li>
            <li> It could spread out in width more but the purse isn&#x27;t quite large enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just love the functionality, it turned a large fashion bag into a bag I can use every day w/o frustration.  </li>
            <li> Love the large zipper compartment inside and the pockets to hold whatever i need.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect, love  extra pockets but it needs more stiff side supports in order to keep it from collapsing inward.</li>
            <li> If you have a large handbag you will love this organizer.</li>
            <li> It fits well in all my bags - they are mostly medium or large bags though.  </li>
            <li> who in their right mind designs a bag with three pockets?!</li>
            <li> and I got it right this time!</li>
            <li> and I have to pull it right sde up before  can begin to look for anything!</li>
            <li> I tried to put this in a medium size purse and it was too big, but this is a great product for organizing your large purse!</li>
            <li> This color is even pretty enough that it would work great in a designer bag.  </li>
            <li> Would have liked if the side ends were more firm to give the insert more support.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was fair, and it was exactly what I needed, and it has held up well so far.</li>
            <li> This is really cool.  </li>
            <li> Several of her friends have since purchased this and they too have all loved it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it most highly Thank you!  </li>
            <li> I love it so much that i bought additional organizers as gifts.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaging was appropriate.  </li>
            <li> I love it and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This would make a good present too.</li>
            <li> This product is a dream come true.  </li>
            <li> maybe i didn&#x27;t have enough good luck</li>
            <li> Still, the design is good, it adjusts to different purse sizes within reason.</li>
            <li> Although, I would have chosen much prettier fabric :)</li>
            <li> I have another type, but I really like this one better.</li>
            <li> I am not one to over-stuff a purse, however, so I thought it would be OK if I treated it gently.</li>
            <li> and this has made the job much, much easier, on top of that I ALWAYS know where to find the item I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li> Good solid nylon fabric with well stitched seams that should hold up well.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit of a purse problem - I love them all - and I REALLY needed this organizer.  </li>
            <li> My life is much improved :)</li>
            <li> - I just got it yesterday, but it seems good enough.  </li>
            <li> Because the Mossimo is made of soft leathery material, it needs this kind of organizer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all women! :-)</li>
            <li> Price is not bad for its purpose</li>
            <li> I can now switch purses very fast and easily.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY enjoyed the fact that this has zippers on that side that expand to let you use more space, this is way way better than other purse organizers that ive tried and the quality literally lasted a month before breaking.</li>
            <li> Fit my purse just right.</li>
            <li> and clutch wallets fit just right in it.  </li>
            <li> This organizer is built okay on the outside and very cheap and flimsy on the inside.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time-this is a great help in keeping your purse organized-would definitely recommend it for anyone who carries a large purse.</li>
            <li> Luckily, it was not there.  </li>
            <li> Gave them to several friends and they were most pleased.</li>
            <li> The order arrived quickly and I had no issues with damage, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, I love this insert enough that I am considering thinking of ordering 2-4 more.  </li>
            <li> Would make a super gift item, too.</li>
            <li> I like it so much I have left it in the purse/handbag permanently now, but its great to know</li>
            <li> I have a Speedy 30 and it fits perfectly with spare room for larger items such as a book or iPad.</li>
            <li> She has since added this organizer to her bag, it&#x27;s made a difference to how quickly she can find what she&#x27;s looking for.</li>
            <li> It makes for quick changes &amp; I change mine alot</li>
            <li> The best thing about this is that I have a smaller purse, and if I keep both sides (or even one side) zipped up, it fits in my smaller purses.  </li>
            <li> Its great and a good alternative to those expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I think the design is good: the handles are low and don&#x27;t get in the way but are useful for pulling the organizer out.</li>
            <li> Look like they are best for flat cell phones, cards or very short pens.</li>
            <li> Once I filled my organizer the first time and tried to pick it up using the handles, two of the rivets popped off.  </li>
            <li> Overall very pleased and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful item and at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It certainly holds all my &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and it makes my purse neat and things easy to find.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recomend this product for someone who like to change bags often or wants handbag more organized as I can now find everything easily instead of having to search through bag.</li>
            <li> It appears to be really well made, and it&#x27;s super easy to change from purse to purse because it&#x27;s lightweight and adjustable.</li>
            <li> A very good organizer with rightly sized pockets and enough of them to fit in all regular accessories.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best solution I&#x27;ve ever found for keeping my purse from becoming a total mess.  </li>
            <li> So fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> It is very functional and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is very well made and services as an easy way to organize one&#x27;s purse or suitcase</li>
            <li> Perfect size so up can still fit other bits and pieces but main contents stay in this and get transferred whenever a new handbag calls</li>
            <li> the separate pockets are great &amp; I can slip my phone down in the little front pocket - which is great because I lose my phone all the time.</li>
            <li> My bag arrived within a couple of days and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now 1.5 years later and time to review this - I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I first saw these totes on home shopping in another brand, and was pleased to find this a lot cheaper on Amazon and many kinds of various prices, sizes and quality.  </li>
            <li> Also, I didn&#x27;t sense any funky smell that previous reviewers had mentioned and as far as quality, I&#x27;m truly impressed.</li>
            <li> Great little thing.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool for keeping the purse organized.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is fairly light, so it doesn&#x27;t add too much weight to your bag.  </li>
            <li> The lining in my purse ripped out and I needed an insert, and this fit the bill very well.</li>
            <li> This purse organizer fit perfectly inside my bag, it does not slide around - and I am not dainty with tossing my bag!  </li>
            <li> so far, they love it too.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more of a light blue.</li>
            <li> It also expands which is useful.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a must own or gift</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been very sturdy and it&#x27;s nice that it expands</li>
            <li> so worth what I paid for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice &amp; sturdy so it doesn&#x27;t slide back &amp; forth &amp; has pockets everywhere.</li>
            <li> All the zippers operate smoothly, and I love the opportunity for expanding the size for even larger bags.  </li>
            <li> The things I like most about it is the material and stitching quality, and it is deep enough that most items aren&#x27;t sticking out over the top where they can be bumped.  </li>
            <li> I even like the Britney better because the light solid colored lining makes things easier to find.  </li>
            <li> This is really a nice organizer, but I&#x27;ve only had it in my purse one day and the stitching is already coming undone.</li>
            <li> This insert has two zippers that opens it up to make it bigger, which is a nice plus.  </li>
            <li> well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> She has wanted one for a while and had done some research on her own prior to telling me what she wanted.</li>
            <li> a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I am careful to take good care of my things</li>
            <li> A nice number of compartments and overall size.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased the organizer has lasted this long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nevertheless, so far, I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> There are cheaper alternatives, but this one is worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something where you can change purses, I think this organizer would be useful to you.  </li>
            <li> This item is very useful, it fits my handbag very well.</li>
            <li> they can&#x27;t make a more durable interior because other than that , I really love it&#x27;s features.</li>
            <li> The problem  was that the inside was a silky/satiny material that did not hold up at the seams and ripped pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for a few years and it is very handy.</li>
            <li> I like the zippered pocket and the other pockets are a good size for my aluma wallet..  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all right there for you.</li>
            <li> So, I measured it and set out to find the right size and type for my satchel bag.</li>
            <li> Holds everything I need and fits right into my purse</li>
            <li> 3\\&quot; is about the right length to peek out of those locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 3\\&quot; is about the right length to peek out of those locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was just right.</li>
            <li> contacts keys and anything else I would need is right at my fingertips.</li>
            <li> I checked it right away when it arrived so I could see about airing it out before Christmas</li>
            <li> This organizer was delivered right on time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s stretchy pockets at each end, just the right size to stand a water bottle in, which I didn&#x27;t realize before I bought it, so that&#x27;s an added bonus for me.</li>
            <li> Everything is is right there when I need it, not in the corners of the purse.</li>
            <li> I now can pull the tote right out of my purse and put it in my carryon bag.  </li>
            <li> I will just drop this organizer in and whatever I need will be right there, in view.  </li>
            <li> Now I need a new purse to put it in, but that will be the easy part.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to order another Britney for me - and they are my new latest gift idea for family and friends - useful and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I got this insert last week, and so far I am LOVING it!</li>
            <li> It fits in my purse nicely, but I guess I tend to carry around more smaller things and would like smaller (or narrower) pockets.</li>
            <li> I simply love the organizer , the quality is good and it is expandable so fits into small hobos as well expands to fit into the larger bags.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Downside is that I can&#x27;t ever find them as the seem to disappear into my large bag!  </li>
            <li> So far, however, this size has been perfect – not too large, not too small.  </li>
            <li> I really like the little handles you use to lefit it out -- very handy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is just right sized for the tote bags I carry, not too heavy and the light interior makes everything very easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in my Land&#x27;s End medium zip tote and now I can find my loose items without dumping everything out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well-made and very reasonably priced for the quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> shipment arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> The item itself is very cheaply made and of low quality material.</li>
            <li> But I have to say I like this organizer very much.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It was a good little organizer.</li>
            <li> It kind of folds in a little at the top (not with a magnet or a snap, just naturally), which I like.</li>
            <li> Shipping was lightning fast!  </li>
            <li> (I leave it zipped up, and it is more than enough space for me).</li>
            <li> This is the first organizer I&#x27;ve ever ordered.</li>
            <li> Most of the smell was gone by then, and is now (28 hrs later) not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to switch out purses in a hurry!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as it is value-for-money and a God-send !!</li>
            <li> I got this first</li>
            <li> : I forgot to mention that it looks exactly like it does in the pictures.</li>
            <li> Now I know exactly where everything is.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!&lt;br</li>
            <li> mine is not as shown,  does not have the key holder but is ok</li>
            <li> I like the outside pockets that are made from the more rigid exterior material because I can tuck my iPhone in and it stays put.</li>
            <li> The pockets are well sized so they can be used in many different ways; rather then one size fits all.  </li>
            <li> Well, first of all, it was delivered before I had even given a thought that it was time to receive it--in a jiffy,</li>
            <li> really!</li>
            <li> The first time that I had to find something in my bag</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I love how all I have to do is pull this out of my purse and sit it inside the next purse I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift and would have gotten a higher rating  </li>
            <li> It fits in many different sizes of purses.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I can still access the built-in purse pockets, but gives you so many more, and allows you to still have an open compartment in the middle.</li>
            <li> I have more than enough room.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend for Christmas as she wanted a way to organize her purse and move stuff between them (exactly what this was made for).</li>
            <li> They sent another bag without hesitation and didn&#x27;t even ask to return the first one.</li>
            <li> Its perfect for my day-to-day purses and for my larger travel or spa bags because I can put larger items in and still keep my smaller items organized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it in a Coach tote (Madison) and it does exactly what I wanted this for -</li>
            <li> My purse is so much more functional, and is STAYING orderly without constant reorganizing.  </li>
            <li> I love looking in and instantly seeing everything!</li>
            <li> I really like this bag/organizer!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It is especially helpful in slouchy hobo ( my favorite ) style handbags.</li>
            <li> at first.  </li>
            <li> The reason I rate this as 3 stars is because it was a amazing (5 star worthy) at first but now that it&#x27;s fallen apart a little</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend buying this, it is good quality and you won&#x27;t be let down.  </li>
            <li> Great item and was a lot larger than expected, but still works with my purse.</li>
            <li> The one thing I miss from my old purse organizer is a lobster claw clip for my keyring, but there are enough pockets that my keys could get their own space.</li>
            <li> The handles are stitched in, so it would seem the rivets are more decorative, but really, the handles aren&#x27;t even necessary</li>
            <li> Really makes things easier to find and was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really clear from the pictures or the description how much more flexible it is because of the two zippers that allow for expansion and the set of snaps at each end that aren&#x27;t described at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Internal pockets: a good sizes for wallets, checkbooks, small notebooks and sunglasses cases (those really large ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internal \\&quot;handles\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has a zippered pocket for your most personal or loose-fitting items as well as 6 other compartments facing inside towards a large middle-pocket.</li>
            <li> It keeps everything organized and easy to find regardless of how big my purse is.</li>
            <li> The inner handles make it easy to grab to switch from one purse to another.</li>
            <li> It fits snugly into her larger bag and gives her easy access to everything.  </li>
            <li> such an easy tool to organize our handbags.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed purses since buying this, but I can see it&#x27;s going to be an easy transition: just move the organizer from one purse to the next.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat flexible and would easily squish into a regular purse (read the dimensions of course).</li>
            <li> There are little handles to make it easy to pull out of the purse, even though it&#x27;s a snug fit.  </li>
            <li> I have a large D&amp;B hobo type bag and without an organizer</li>
            <li> I carry a rather large purse to accommodate my iPad.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep my large leather purse upright as well as organized,</li>
            <li> This organized  inside of my large bag.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it may be too large for my purse</li>
            <li> (I would add that I bought a large that stated that it is a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; size.  </li>
            <li> I carry fairly large handbags.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to my family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT IT FOR A LARGE COACH BAG</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too large for my purses, so I am using it in my weekend travel bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to go in a large purse I also bought.</li>
            <li> I like a large hand bag, but can never find what I need.</li>
            <li> It is a large purse</li>
            <li> This bag will accommodate a medium or large handbag, plus it is quite sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> large.  </li>
            <li> It holds my big headphone case ds case wallet and camera in its case and a lot more can&#x27;t wait to use it in my new purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would recommentd it because it is firm, dosnt collapse and is light colored on the inside to easily identify your items.&lt;br /&gt;fits</li>
            <li> So right now, as I peruse what&#x27;s out there, I&#x27;m really torn between just buying a new one of these</li>
            <li> If my bag was any smaller this wouldn&#x27;t fit - so pay attention to the dimensions, it is large.</li>
            <li> The tote works best in purses that are totally open inside, but I have used it with a purse that had a center interior pocket and that still worked out okay as long as I didn&#x27;t try to use the other side.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my medium bags and even a few of my larger ones and my totes.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be bigger because the purse I got for Christmas is huge, but it has no bearing on the organizer itself.</li>
            <li> My suggestion with anyone looking at these is to definitely stick with the light colors for the interior like this one has because it makes it a snap to find your stuff.</li>
            <li> Very well made.  </li>
            <li> but it looks really WELL MADE.  </li>
            <li> works really well and everything has its spot.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and has a lot of room.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time reading purse organizer reviews (can&#x27;t believe how many are out there) and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> The Bag Organizer is very well made.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a real</li>
            <li> It also takes the abuse I give it really</li>
            <li> I purchased this product not expecting such great quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Much easier to find everything.  </li>
            <li> I really like the concept of this organizer.</li>
            <li> Fits in my purse very well.</li>
            <li> This organizer fits a medium-sized handbag very well.  </li>
            <li> Very functional for shopping but just try finding anything in there.</li>
            <li> Really like this organizer.  </li>
            <li> Very practical as an organizer</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Product is very helpful to organize your belongings.  </li>
            <li> It makes it much easier to locate items rather than having to dig all around in your purse.  </li>
            <li> It hold so much.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Really, you just have to decide how you want to use it.  </li>
            <li> This bag really helped get everything in order so that I don&#x27;t have to go hunting for items every time I go in my purse.</li>
            <li> It really helps to keep things organized.</li>
            <li> This really helped me to organize me purse.</li>
            <li> I really like the convenience of this purse insert.</li>
            <li> My mom has already ordered one for herself, and both of my sisters may very well order one too.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat light weight but sturdy enough to stand up and not collapse.</li>
            <li> This organizer works very well in my Miche handbag -</li>
            <li> I really like this insert.</li>
            <li> It gives some structure to my floppy purse and is very convenient for organizing the myriad items I keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> but I really shouldn&#x27;t have to this soon.</li>
            <li> I did not consider either of these issues important enough to bother with returning the product, but there did appear to be some concerns with manufacturing \\&quot;quality control.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> MUCH easier for me to find stuff.</li>
            <li> I got this very promptly, and was amaze at the quality.</li>
            <li> my purse is really organized.</li>
            <li> This item is better than I expected for the price, and I want to buy another one for my mom.  </li>
            <li> This came fast and was everything that was described.</li>
            <li> I like it because it can fit different sized bags.</li>
            <li> My mother loves it because she switches purses so much and this makes it easier for her</li>
            <li> The purse organizer arrived in 9 days (if you include weekend days); so much for 2-6 days, but I digress.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use the outer pockets much since the organizer (un-expanded) JUST fits in my Mossimo crossbody handbag.  </li>
            <li> The tote has made switching purses so much easier.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Just not made very well.</li>
            <li> It holds so much</li>
            <li> I have knocked my tote over sideways on the car seat and the open top is not a disaster, plus the elastized pockets on each end hold things more firmly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made and sleek.  </li>
            <li> thanks you</li>
            <li> It is a great idea, but it does not hold much, not that well organized, and adds unnecessary weight.</li>
            <li> The pockets are roomy and there is plenty of room for my large wallet, coupon keeper and camera in the large main compartment.</li>
            <li> I am pocketbook obsessed, MUST have the right amount of pockets, as I like organizations, this is great.</li>
            <li> This one stays up right, the fabric is a soft yet very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The pockets on this organizer are large, so things kind of flop around, even my smart phone (screen size is 5&amp;#34;) seems to flop over and keep the pocket it sits in open, so I still have to &#x27;dig around&#x27; to access the other things inside the organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really wouldn&#x27;t have cared if it was lime green as long as it does such a great job!</li>
            <li> The 2 slim little handle straps make it very easy to pull in and out</li>
            <li> I am so glad I listened to the other reviewers and purchased this one.</li>
            <li> The Britney organizer has more rigid sides, allowing it to retain its shape in my purse and the pockets are deeper, which means my pens, gloss sticks, and other items don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> excited that I can now use different bags and still be organized.</li>
            <li> The product has a million pockets of various sizes and is very simply to clean.</li>
            <li> It fits great in almost any purse, big or small.</li>
            <li> This would make a nice little gift for anyone who likes to often change purses depending on their outfits!</li>
            <li> next to eachother in the main compartment, otherwise they will only fit on top of one another when used without expansion and in the American West bag.  </li>
            <li> Also, the light grey interior color makes it easier to find items.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted to add extra pockets and organization to a very large purse that I have!  </li>
            <li> I put it in a hobo bag and it gave it more shape and less slouchiness</li>
            <li> sometimes less is more.</li>
            <li> These cost less than many on the market</li>
            <li> I had it less than 5 month and the inside lining ripped in the corner seam from top to bottom.</li>
            <li> i like that this one has visible pockets, so I can quickly peek into my purse and find what I need in a second!</li>
            <li> Would love to find a smaller version for my smaller purses.</li>
            <li> Make this bag in fashion colors and I&#x27;ll be back for several more.</li>
            <li> It does not stay steady in the purse, but tends to flip over</li>
            <li> I played around with placing my phone vs. keys in a particular spot, but now, I know before opening my bag (from the front, always) where everything is (without even looking).  </li>
            <li> I can find anything in a heartbeat, and I can return items to their proper location quickly.</li>
            <li> It is also designed to make smaller or larger which I love.  </li>
            <li> I love all the pockets it has, but I especially like tha feature that allows me to make the Britany Organizer larger if I need to.</li>
            <li> My purse  was a mess, everything  piled on top of  itself.  </li>
            <li> the quality is high.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this purse organizer based on the product photos.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Nice bag organizer, lining seems to be made of a more inexpensive nylon, so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone who likes to stay organized.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves purses.</li>
            <li> I liked this one in particular because it has hard sides and that keeps it upright in my bag instead of falling over.</li>
            <li> ok, so its not so little.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to measure your average handbags!</li>
            <li> A little stretch in the handles would have been better, and prettier colors.</li>
            <li> so much I bought a smaller one to fit into my smaller bags.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the quality was not not as great as the price.  </li>
            <li> I had a different organizer, but it had too many \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; pockets and it took me just as long to find things.</li>
            <li> I normally like.</li>
            <li> But having an organized purse has made my life so much more productive, that I don&#x27;t give a damn (excuse my french).</li>
            <li> received the bag in two days the seller also sent me a solar powered flashlight that attaches to your key ring as a complimentary gift.</li>
            <li> This Organizer is firm enough to stand up nicely in the tote, and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge deal for me, but lighter would be better.  </li>
            <li> tight compact organization with the top down view allows organization combined with easy search and retrieval.</li>
            <li> Get some of those clever key clips and you&#x27;ll have a handy rail for little items that would get lost in the pockets.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can find everything in my big bag right away</li>
            <li> The side compartments fit all of my other necessities with room to spare.</li>
            <li> I give this product a three star because at first I love it but a few weeks later it broke.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is also a nice little pocket on the outside.  </li>
            <li> The Britney Black &amp; Grey Handbag Purse Tote Organizer truly helps keeping things more organized in my purse!</li>
            <li> Now I can easily spot my black phone and lipstick tube beause</li>
            <li> My previous organizer collapsed easily and was a nuisance to work with.</li>
            <li> I put everything away and the middle is still available to hold water bottles, hats, or the occasional paperback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few of the purse inserts, and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> zippers don&#x27;t seem that good of quality (small and plastic) and the grey fabric that it expands with can get caught in the zipper</li>
            <li> I have a large Louis Vuitton and this makes finding small items easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything as advertised, satin outside, grey inside for easy searching.  </li>
            <li> So, either due to fast transit time or just getting lucky (or perhaps they fixed the problem)</li>
            <li> It only fits in big bags, not cross body, but more like bucket bags, hobo bags, and messenger bags.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> , this organizer is meant for a medium sized purse, not a small hand bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made pretty well, held up with daily use.</li>
            <li> Friends say they are amazed at what I keep in my purse, including eye drops and a toothbrush and paste, so I usually choose bags with many pockets and dividers.</li>
            <li> Only was there for about 5 seconds if that when I first took it out of the plastic bag it was</li>
            <li> Also, I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and chose one with a light inside.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, you just lift the whole thing when you move to a new bag.</li>
            <li> I love this organizer and how it has helped fix my big mess of a purse.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well as a purse organizer but the side pockets are hard to access in a deep bag, so everything ends up in the middle section any way, It would be fantastic as a travel kit (night table item, miscellaneous chargers, cords, tissues, medications, etc with two additional features: 1) a snap to hold it closed; 2) roomer top straps</li>
            <li> I also have enough room to put my day planner (size of a large tablet) on one of the sides, where it is supported between the bag and the insert.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought a large purse which I wanted to keep neat and organized.  </li>
            <li> things\\&quot; into all of the compartments including my large wallet and sunglasses in the middle, and just admired it for a minute or two, and I did find that in the corner cubbies, I could and did put in my pens (standing up) and</li>
            <li> Hobo bags are big, but it is like throwing everything into a large sack.</li>
            <li> It has 2 spacious outside pockets, 6 large pockets and a zippered compartment on the inside.</li>
            <li> Theirs is a little smaller &amp; too many credit card pockets on the side that I wouldn&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> that said, a little over ten bucks I&#x27;m OK with ordering another.</li>
            <li> Most purses have a couple little pockets inside, but this organizes everything in the Bermuda Triangle middle area.  </li>
            <li> was surprised at all of the compartments,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I bought this because I frequently switch bags and wanted something to make it easier.  </li>
            <li> Well, it completely disintegrated at this point.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants a big purse</li>
            <li> If I were to use a smaller or larger bag, I would definitely continue using a purse organizer, something to fit.  </li>
            <li> Now I am very organized and never have to dig through everything to find my phone, or key.</li>
            <li> keeps my big purse very organized</li>
            <li> The tote fixed that problem.</li>
            <li> If I had a second bag for this to fit into, I think I would ultimately just order a second organizer.</li>
            <li> I can tell this is very well made and overall</li>
            <li> I can also find and remove my wallet (or whatever) so much quicker, and then put it back faster too</li>
            <li> I wish it cost a little less, but if it holds up well, I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> so* right, it is easier to see everything in the organizer despite sitting low in my big tote.</li>
            <li> I use this in a large business tote with a flat bottom.</li>
            <li> The other reviews were very helpful in that regard, so thanks.</li>
            <li> I just love all the extra little pockets and now when I change bags I always know where everything is!</li>
            <li> This worked differently than I expected, although it was very well-made and pretty.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised this fit into a small tote.</li>
            <li> I like my bag to be highly organized but often feel restricted in my style choices because I needed several partitions.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived I saw this normal, like picture, not any emotion, I only settled of my stuff inside</li>
            <li> However, through normal use, the stitching in one of the middle pockets has become undone</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that I wish that the ends were stiff so that it would stay open better.  </li>
            <li> I notice in the product description that the company makes the following claim: &amp;#34;As of January 2013, improved Quality Control Standards implemented.&amp;#34; If this is true, either the standards are still not adequate or they sent me the old model.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I did throw away a few stray papers and fuzzies that were lurking in the corners of my Coach, so it got a little cleanup too, but now everything is JUST where I want it.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that the pockets are not sewn very securely and the seams have loosened a bit with use -- only the inside pockets though, The outside is very well constructed and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Between my wallet, tissues, gum, business cards, paper pad and pens, I needed something to organize since my new tote only had two side pockets and one zipper pocket.</li>
            <li> Cant really say anything bad, this was a good buy and helpful.</li>
            <li> This is essential for any guy/gal who wants to organize their multiple items in a neat, orderly fashion.</li>
            <li> Others complained about the same things, yet they were pleased with their purchase.  </li>
            <li> The straps make it easy to pull it in and out of my purse and the cream colored interior makes things much easier to see compared to other organizers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> And now that my bag is clean I still have those pockets made into the purse itself to use, not to mention if your bag is a little bigger than the organizer, you have room to the sides for things like water bottles.</li>
            <li> It would not fit a little bag, but is fantastic for a large tote/hobo style.  </li>
            <li> a zipper pocket &#x3D; total 7) and the large open area in the middle that holds my wallet, ipad mini and makeup bag!!</li>
            <li> It could be a little larger to fit in larger handbags.</li>
            <li> For those still in disbelief or think they are fine with their purse the way it is; I can fit my Wallet, a small zipper bag of personal items, A cosmetic zip bag, cell phone for personal and work, iPod, headphones, Kindle, car charger, keys(neatly hooked), tissues, mini lotion, mini spray, mini deodorant, mini bug spray, lip balm, travel umbrella, Medication bottle, small flashlight, pens and notebook.</li>
            <li> (though to be honest, I wish it was a little bigger, as I tend to carry enormous purses -- or if I should just break down and buy a pricier one on Etsy that&#x27;s custom made and/or try one of the cheaper models on here.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that it got such positive reviews by other buyers...  </li>
            <li> Clearly, I needed a second bag, or cargo pants.</li>
            <li> Clearly, I needed a second bag, or cargo pants.</li>
            <li> the whole organizer is durable, but the inside pouches are not really...</li>
            <li> I may not put everything in it, but it helps considerably with overall organization.</li>
            <li> What I found most frustrating is that all of the items I carried would gather at the bowels of the bottomless pit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be bookmarking this brand since my first baby is due soon, and I think something like this can make a &amp;#34;non-diaper bag&amp;#34; into just what I need!  </li>
            <li> : one category for pocket, easy pockets for storage and for take of them, eight internal pockets (six big and two small) and two external pockets, a big space in the middle for large stuff like wallet or glasses box, you can enlarge this space open one or two of zippers for that.</li>
            <li> It looks so much nicer than any other bag organizer I found at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Also, after using the organizer for only a couple of days, one of the metal double cap rivets came off of one of the handles, and upon closer inspection, both sides of the rivet were found to be clearly bent and misshapen, which likely occurred in assembly.  </li>
            <li> I am always in a hurry, therefore I am a pretty messy purse person</li>
            <li> This organizer helps the bag keep its shape and stand-up straight when I set the bag down.  </li>
            <li> Actually I tried this one first in black with yellow zippers.  </li>
            <li> Recipient also loved this product which is very difficult to find locally.  </li>
            <li> so when I went to open the pouch one whole slot opened down the length of the seam.</li>
            <li> So, I went on Amazon and spotted this pretty sturdy looking organizer, the Britney Black &amp; Grey, and I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> (this company also makes ones for small and large bags, I will be ordering!)</li>
            <li> There is also a little place that a pen slips into &amp; that really works for me too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purse dimensions: Mine is 14\\&quot; long, 9\\&quot; high, 5\\&quot; wide (at the bottom).</li>
            <li> Two problems: the zippered expansions are made of light grey fabric which had become a little stained from being folded into the black material when packaged.</li>
            <li> My Coach is an Ashley satchel which is \\&quot;medium\\&quot; and it fits tightly so that I cannot put items on the outsideof the organizer, which is just fine with me (who needs all that weight anyway), but when I buy one of these for my smallish-medium bags, I will buy the small and have space around it for \\&quot;extras\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Bought this in January 2013 as I purchased a large satchel type bag that I could lose several small pets in, if I were so inclined to let them in.</li>
            <li> , I actually have more stuff in my purse than usual and still have a few empty pockets!  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago, purchased a new bag at the same time, locally.</li>
            <li> It is small and does not make my purse feel huge or heavy.  </li>
            <li> The quality is decent; I have only used it for a few weeks, but it seems like it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I needed help with organizing the mess in the new bag and found this item here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it expands to fit larger purses, and it didn&#x27;t have the awful stink that comes with most of these types of products.</li>
            <li> It is well made and should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this one long enough</li>
            <li> so I found the same organizer with grey zippers...</li>
            <li> i can find in 2 seconds flat.</li>
            <li> yet they lay flat along the sides and stay out of your way.</li>
            <li> worries how long this product will last before seams come undone</li>
            <li> My new Coach bag which is a cavernous pit with the exception of two small pockets, had all of my items so jumbled that I could never catch my phone in time, never find a pen, a piece of gum, my comb or any essential that I needed to grab in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has stood up to pretty serious use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, my other organizer bags (the ones with the side view of multiple pockets) was only marginally helpful</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, my other organizer bags (the ones with the side view of multiple pockets) was only marginally helpful</li>
            <li> How about a purple, pink, blue, etc?</li>
            <li> --I thought the inside was going to be grey</li>
            <li> It was minor.</li>
            <li> It could benefit from a material that doesn&#x27;t slide around inside the bag, but that is a minor drawback.</li>
            <li> There was a minor defect with one of the side zippered areas (which is supposed to expand the organizer) where the lining had been stitched to itself with 3 or 4 stitches, and I had to cut through the stitches with scissors so that it would expand.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought one a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> There was an area where the zipper was not completely sewn on.</li>
            <li> I was starting to hate my purse - it was not that big, had two nice size pockets separated by a zippered pocket, but no matter where I thought I \\&quot;placed\\&quot; my phone, whenever it would ring I would struggle to get my hands on it.  </li>
            <li> They even tossed in a small unexpected gift!  </li>
            <li> I really like that the straps are very small and don&#x27;t get in the way of anything.  </li>
            <li> The long, inner zipper is ripped and the fabric is shredded after two weeks of use and I only unzipped the pocket one time, to store a few coupons when I went shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This tote adds only a little extra weight.  </li>
            <li> It actually came earlier than it suppose to come, i use this everyday now</li>
            <li> The only thing missing is a key fob.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crafty enough to make an organizer this well done but can do a simple bag for carrying it.  </li>
            <li> The first bag came on time but had a broken snap and a zipper that didn&#x27;t work correctly.</li>
            <li> It is not LARGE, but it definitely would not fit in a smaller satchel or hobo.  </li>
            <li> It had loose threading throughout.</li>
            <li> Only down side is</li>
            <li> Left out of one purse and plop down in another.</li>
            <li> I typically buy big bags even though I don&#x27;t have a lot of stuff to put in it.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought a fabric tote style purse, lined, but with only one small interior pocket.</li>
            <li> (I really only tracked my cell phone and pens); my tote-style bags were black holes.</li>
            <li> (I really only tracked my cell phone and pens); my tote-style bags were black holes.</li>
            <li> It holds all MY stuff (wallet, phone, personal items, chapstick, tissue, pens and small notebook, sunglasses, etc), and I still have room in my bag outside the organizer to hold a spare change of clothes for my toddler.</li>
            <li> My phone, or glasses, or whatever I needed, would disappear into a black hole until I finally would upend the purse</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super flimsy and don&#x27;t hold shape which makes it difficult to just slide/toss things in them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a big mess, I can&#x27;t find a thing.</li>
            <li> The interior pockets were not stitched with a tight enough stitch</li>
            <li> I like the little handles for removing it to use it in a different purse.</li>
            <li> I would use different size cosmetic bags to contain the little stuff.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d change is to lose the little rivets where the handles are attached at the side.  </li>
            <li> but I was looking for something a little bigger.  </li>
            <li> When I started looking for a purse organizer, I was shocked at how many there are on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was really worried about the smell that a few of the reviewers complained about.  </li>
            <li> I also have a few totes that I like to use for outings like picnics and such, but things keep getting lost.  </li>
            <li> well - I am not gentle with my purses.</li>
            <li> my purse became really heavy, even though the tote was the only thing added.</li>
            <li> It is well structured, so it will keep the form of your purse and not \\&quot;flop\\&quot; over when empty.</li>
            <li> No thanks</li>
            <li> BIG waste of $$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for months for a purse that would hold everything I want to carry but not leave me having to empty a bag to find what I need.  </li>
            <li> It has quite a few pocktses, plus a zippered compartment along one side, and some pockets outside for pads of paper and whatnot.</li>
            <li> Although all the components of this item are exactly as expected, the quality and workmanship of the inside pockets are questionable.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I have several other purse organizers, but chose this one to try because of the little handles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stiff enough to stand up in the bag but not so weighty and bulky that it affects the outward appearance of the bag.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Black &amp; Grey.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to go with the Britney Black and Grey Purse Organizer.  </li>
            <li> Read other reviews carefully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a number of other purse organizers that just did not meet my needs with too many small unusable pockets, poor construction and shoddy materials.  </li>
            <li> so glad i spent this money because i needed this so desperately!</li>
            <li> My friend says it&#x27;s the ugly bag hidden inside the cute one &amp; said I&#x27;m cheating on my purse.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s large and holds all of my crap in my large leather tote purse.</li>
            <li> The inside side pocket that extends the length of the bag will carry my check book &amp; other misc.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy this due to the cost.</li>
            <li> With this insert, sunscreen bottles and other sundries would stay put</li>
            <li> I still managed to put in my bluetooth on one of those sides and a charger for my phone on the other.</li>
            <li> but other than that i do like it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had other organizer bags</li>
            <li> Was stuck with stuff in both my hands trying to reach the wallet the other day.</li>
            <li> Was stuck with stuff in both my hands trying to reach the wallet the other day.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any smell or other issues some reported in their reviews.</li>
            <li> And I can transfer my bags way easier, just pull this out and put it in other bag</li>
            <li> B008PGTAXE Outback Leatherette Pouchee Purse Organizer]]for the other compartment.  </li>
            <li> Since my purse is on the deep side, it helps that I don&#x27;t have to keep digging around and searching for small items.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I don&#x27;t like organizer purses.  </li>
            <li> These inconveniences are outweighed by the fact that my purse is extremely well organized now.</li>
            <li> This purse organizer is extremely well made, both in terms of quality as well as design.  </li>
            <li> Also, moving my things from one purse to another is a snap; just take the organizer from one bag and put it in the other.</li>
            <li> That being said, I don&#x27;t take it in and out at all - so if you are planning to do so, you may want to read other reviews where that&#x27;s what the user does.</li>
            <li> turned my Coach bag upside down and let everything fall to the carpet--totally empty</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for daughters, and it was just a little too big for one of them to use in her everyday purse.  </li>
            <li> When I put my glasses case into one of those pockets, half of the case is exposed leaving it to the possibility of slipping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At 10.5 inches, it is also a little wide, but I usually carry larger purses, so this isn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li> As for the internal elastisized pockets, I use them for my two sets of glasses (in hard cases).  </li>
            <li> My only negative is for myself</li>
            <li> This organizer was not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Just not worth it.</li>
            <li> It is too dark in my purse to see where to replace something.  </li>
            <li> , you won&#x27;t have to get your face down in it to find what you need.  </li>
            <li> it adds structure to the bag so when I place it down, it doesn&#x27;t puddle into a heap.</li>
            <li> It has zippers so that you can expand or make smaller if you are carrying around a small bag!</li>
            <li> Before, I felt like my purse was a black hole -</li>
            <li> From the pictures, I thought the side had a hidden pocket with a zipper, but that is just there to expand the purse width-wise if needed.</li>
            <li> It was like my car keys disappeared into a black hole.</li>
            <li> On the one hand, I paid less than 20.00 for it, and I am *</li>
            <li> In less then a week, the pockets inside are falling apart.  </li>
            <li> The mine is black.</li>
            <li> Then I saw the Britney on Amazon for way less and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> My bag is black</li>
            <li> so I got the black color,</li>
            <li> and when I get it home I&#x27;m faced with the interior being a mess to deal with,</li>
            <li> It was a continual struggle, and the message it sent me was, “I am not well organized” – not a good thing to hear several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My purse was a continues mess.</li>
            <li> However, those bags can turn into a jumble mess of things and it takes me forever to find something.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to mess up the inside, plus it didn&#x27;t have all the little pockets and organization</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little concern on the durability of the material used on the inside.</li>
            <li> I just got a Furla Satchel handbag with 1 little pocket inside</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expandable but could be a little wider for some hobo type purses.</li>
            <li> Then I put all of my \\&quot;little</li>
            <li> There is plenty of space for phone, wallet, kindle, comb, a little pad, outgoing mail, glasses and sunglasses, keys and some makeup essentials, and that&#x27;s with the zippers</li>
            <li> Plenty of pockets for all the little things.</li>
            <li> just wish was a LITTLE taller  </li>
            <li> very* hard on bags -- on the other, I see a lot of new \\&quot;bag organizers\\&quot; out there that have gotten worse reviews.</li>
            <li> After few weeks&#x27; use, the little pockets inside started tearing off...</li>
            <li> I have used other organizers before, the less expensive ones are alright, but you definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few purse inserts</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot; and after a few months of heavy use, without it stuffed to the gills, it seems to just collapse a wee bit into itself.</li>
            <li> It was too flimsy and poorly constructed to hold up well with daily use.  </li>
            <li> Guess i put something heavy??</li>
            <li> I can find things easier now and it does not look messy anymore.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat it for the money, in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> The animal print satin lining that forms the inner pockets is EXTREMELY thin</li>
            <li> the inner fabric and sections were made of a heavier material than the thin satin</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using it, one side of the packet fell off, and the lining tear.</li>
            <li> I am stilling it because I fix it by staple the broken pocket and lining back with a stapler.</li>
            <li> This allows it to slide into purses that have narrow opening tops.  </li>
            <li> it was just to much trouble.</li>
            <li> it has firm sides to keep each item in place.  </li>
            <li> A few friends have asked about it and ordered them too for their bags.</li>
            <li> The extra pockets meant a separate cosmetic bag was unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Things can get trapped on the sides or under the organizer.</li>
            <li> No more endless searches for lost items in the abyss of my bag!</li>
            <li> My other organizer also had a horrible, scratchy polyester feel, and this one is satin smooth!</li>
            <li> The stiff sides of the organizer would offer your cell phone some protection.</li>
            <li> I wanted something small but with pockets that could hold all the little things.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is that the interior material is very thin and not very durable.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little bit sturdy!</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because after very little use some of the stitching has started to unravel.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned the odor, it really isn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> I also like all the compartments to keep hand sanitizer, lip glass, small comb, tissues, etc.</li>
            <li> not sure about it...</li>
            <li> I have everything where it should be and the disorganized handbag is a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell anything weird unless if I actually sniff it.</li>
            <li> The organizer has a place for everything I usually carry and there are pockets that I haven&#x27;t even used yet.  </li>
            <li> No more digging in the bottom of my purse for anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more fighting to find something in my bag.  </li>
            <li> but these ads all time exaggerate and usually create and delusion about the product and until sometimes you can see the lie.</li>
            <li> BUT I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> The expensive one is going back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still thinking of getting one for myself because I think it was just a one time flaw that just happened that the seam had that small tear.</li>
            <li> No more rummaging around to find my wallet..</li>
            <li> I can organize things in all the pockets, so no more fishing around in the bottom of my purse, hoping to find something.  </li>
            <li> that work well in my small bags</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> No more searching through the bottom of my purse for an item.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, it looked really thin, but there are snaps and zippers to expand it out so that it can be very wide too.  </li>
            <li> The walls of the organizer are very stiff.</li>
            <li> One poor review mentioned an unpleasant scent, mine did not have this scent, it smelled like newly packaged things usually do.</li>
            <li> Now, hardly at all.  </li>
            <li> Before it was hard to find things.</li>
            <li> In the end, this is sitting on the shelf and a hard plastic purse organizer is in my purse of a lighter color.  </li>
            <li> I like large handbags &amp; hate not knowing where everything is.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy (the sides stand up inside the bad and the bottom creates a nice base inside my floppy hobo.</li>
            <li> I change purses at least once a week</li>
            <li> and I was forced to search every pocket.</li>
            <li> The inner zip is broken, the outer zips that close it up to slimline, and the elastic sections inside are very tired.</li>
            <li> no more searching around!</li>
            <li> No more worries about leaving something out !</li>
            <li> No more digging for my keys or wallet!</li>
            <li> No more digging through my purse again!  </li>
            <li> The tote smelled rather awful immediately after opening it, so I left it open to air out for 12-15 hours.  </li>
            <li> They are weak and fall onto them selves.</li>
            <li> I had to take everything out just to find my keys-so frustrating.</li>
            <li> (overloaded the poor thing).</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried the zipper of the inside pocket I could see it was broken.</li>
            <li> non broken.</li>
            <li> The handle was broken as well.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product because it is poorly made.  </li>
            <li> No more searching and going crazy looking for things in my purse, now everything i need</li>
            <li> just ends up in a massive jumble in the bottom of the bag, very annoying.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Saw the expensive ($50+) version at a store and purchased it online.  </li>
            <li> unable to repair it, it is sooo bad.</li>
            <li> I always got sick of everything falling to the bottom of my bags now</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was disappointed to see how flimsy the sections are; they just sort of… flop.</li>
            <li> Buy this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate looking for things in my purse</li>
            <li> I have a somewhat firm-sided tote because I hate sticking my hand in and getting it scratched by a zipper, or having to push the sides apart while I dig for things).</li>
            <li> I have no issues changing out purses to match outfits, something I use to hate doing.</li>
            <li> and I hated to transfer purses before now.</li>
            <li> Smells plasticky and horrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This organizer is nice. Many pockets. Enough space for your stuff. It only fits in big bags, not cross body, but more like bucket bags, hobo bags, and messenger bags. Easy to wipe clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this purse organizer for over a week now and I must say my purse is in beautiful shape!  I am always in a hurry, therefore I am a pretty messy purse person but now it is organized and I know where everything is! The straps make it easy to pull it in and out of my purse and the cream colored interior makes things much easier to see compared to other organizers I&#x27;ve had in the past. The organizer itself is sturdy and doesnt slouch with the bag which gives it a BIG A+ and I love the plethora of pockets (6 and a zipper pocket &#x3D; total 7) and the large open area in the middle that holds my wallet, ipad mini and makeup bag!! Also, I didn&#x27;t sense any funky smell that previous reviewers had mentioned and as far as quality, I&#x27;m truly impressed. I hope in the future I do not eat my words but at this moment I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> My bag arrived within a couple of days and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> My big floppy tote bag is now standing tall with pride!  This organizer fits perfectly and holds everything I need with room left over.  It is well made and should last a long time.  Shipping was lightning fast!  It would not fit a little bag, but is fantastic for a large tote/hobo style.  My only negative is for myself--why didn&#x27;t I get this organizer years ago??</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I decided to purchase this item.  I read the reviews and was really worried about the smell that a few of the reviewers complained about.  Luckily, it was not there.  Before, I felt like my purse was a black hole - I kept digging for my keys or phone and I could not find them...unless I dumped everything out.  With this organizer, there is no struggle.  It has helped me keep my things together and more importantly, helped me find them when I needed them. Tip: I would recommend that you measure your purse before purchasing this.</li>
            <li> These are great.  Use it every day, just pull it from my handbag and plop it in another.  Now it is NO LONGER time consuming to change handbags.  Gave them to several friends and they were most pleased. Really helps keep things organized in &amp;#34;hobo&amp;#34; bags, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so easy to be able to &amp;#34;SEE&amp;#34; what you are looking for in your handbag.</li>
            <li> Great item. Great size. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> will lose it&#x27;s shape overtime but still a great product</li>
            <li> Wow!  This is really cool.  Anyone of any age will love it. I have never been able to change purses so quickly and all my \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; goes with it every time.  It&#x27;s the most ideal insert for almost any purse.  fill it and pull it out any time you want to use any of those purses in your collection.  So fast and easy.  Gave one to a friend and she loves it too.  Best gadget ever!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Well, this organizer is just the right size, holds up great without calapsing in your handbag &amp; has just enough pockets . Only negative is that the interior material is very thin and not very durable. I&#x27;ve had it about a week , and the seems are unraveling . Shame they can&#x27;t make a more durable interior because other than that , I really love it&#x27;s features. Hopefully they will read enough reviews &amp; modify it.</li>
            <li> Absolutly Awesome!  My wife purchased this about 6 months ago and can&#x27;t stop raving about it.  It gives her flexiability to change purses at a moments notice and has made her more organized.  I can vouch for that, prior to this, she was always rummaging through her purse looking for something.  Now, hardly at all.  Several of her friends have since purchased this and they too have all loved it.</li>
            <li> I got this organizer last year and I found it very useful and time saving. I bought one for my sister this year and knowing how many purse she has, I am sure she will be thrilled with this.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  Works great for large hobo style bags and I was also able to fit it into a medium size bag.  I have recommended this to several friends and family members.  I just love all the extra little pockets and now when I change bags I always know where everything is!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased a bag insert before so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work for what I needed, but it turned out to be PERFECT!  I have a bag that I love, except it is a &#x27;sling&#x27; bag and everything just ends up in a massive jumble in the bottom of the bag, very annoying.  This purse organizer fit perfectly inside my bag, it does not slide around - and I am not dainty with tossing my bag!  There are pockets for makeup (now I don&#x27;t need an extra make-up bag) for your cell phone, glasses, the side pockets are perfect for those loose papers/receipts and plenty of room for my large wallet!  This color is even pretty enough that it would work great in a designer bag.  I absolutely recommend buying this, it is good quality and you won&#x27;t be let down.  My suggestion with anyone looking at these is to definitely stick with the light colors for the interior like this one has because it makes it a snap to find your stuff.</li>
            <li> I can use this organizer in several different sized bags. I didn&#x27;t realize how versatile it was going to be.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed. Makes it very fast and easy to change bags or purses and very easy to find things when on the run. I</li>
            <li> My search is over.  I love this purse organizer. It is perfect for my needs. I recommend it most highly Thank you!  MW</li>
            <li> love this! I had a different organizer, but it had too many \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; pockets and it took me just as long to find things. i like that this one has visible pockets, so I can quickly peek into my purse and find what I need in a second! My other organizer also had a horrible, scratchy polyester feel, and this one is satin smooth! Please note the dimensions though, this organizer is meant for a medium sized purse, not a small hand bag.From the pictures, I thought the side had a hidden pocket with a zipper, but that is just there to expand the purse width-wise if needed. (I leave it zipped up, and it is more than enough space for me). I love it so much that i bought additional organizers as gifts. The supplier ships fast, and the quality is great! I would buy again!!</li>
            <li> This is the first organizer I&#x27;ve ever ordered. This is perfect for totes. I always got sick of everything falling to the bottom of my bags now I know where everything is. Will be very easy to switch out with the sturdy handles. This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> What you are reading in reviews is true! This thing is awesome! You can literally fit everything in here and it&#x27;s all right there for you. I always fall in love with a purse and when I get it home I&#x27;m faced with the interior being a mess to deal with, who in their right mind designs a bag with three pockets?! This solves my issues, truly. It&#x27;s great for my medium bags and even a few of my larger ones and my totes. (this company also makes ones for small and large bags, I will be ordering!) One poor review mentioned an unpleasant scent, mine did not have this scent, it smelled like newly packaged things usually do. I did however spritz it with a body mist just to make it smell nicer. For those still in disbelief or think they are fine with their purse the way it is; I can fit my Wallet, a small zipper bag of personal items, A cosmetic zip bag, cell phone for personal and work, iPod, headphones, Kindle, car charger, keys(neatly hooked), tissues, mini lotion, mini spray, mini deodorant, mini bug spray, lip balm, travel umbrella, Medication bottle, small flashlight, pens and notebook. And now that my bag is clean I still have those pockets made into the purse itself to use, not to mention if your bag is a little bigger than the organizer, you have room to the sides for things like water bottles. Once you use it you won&#x27;t be able to use a bag without one! Also this makes buying purses so much easier because you don&#x27;t need to pay attention to the pockets, just make sure your organizer will fit inside.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this organizer!!!! It&#x27;s perfect for everything! Very sturdy and easy to put in and out of your purse! I would recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT purse insert.  Very well made.  IF YOU PAY A LOT FOR YOUR BAGS, GET ONE OF THESE - IT KEEPS THE INSIDE OF YOUR PURSE PRISTINE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pockets are on the INSIDE so it is easy to change from purse to purse because your items aren&#x27;t IN THE WAY.  The bag is adjustable to fit many size bags. It is adjustable by snaps on the end in addition to zippers that can open it up even further.  I&#x27;ve used quite a few purse inserts and they have continued to rip &amp; tear.  I haven&#x27;t had this one long enough so I can&#x27;t attest to the quality but it looks really WELL MADE.  The inside is light so you can see your stuff.  The handles are close to the top of the bag so it is easy to grab &amp; use to transfer but are NOT in the way.  There is also a nice little pocket on the outside.  The inside side pocket that extends the length of the bag will carry my check book &amp; other misc. papers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS WOULD ALSO MAKE A GREAT MAKE UP BAG OR TRAVEL BAG since all of your items would be stored upright.</li>
            <li> Great for big purses where you tend to never be able to find what you&#x27;re looking for or you just like organization</li>
            <li> I love this, I searched for weeks.  I traded and got a Yukon XL and the console is a bottomless pit, and the console organizers would not fit.&lt;br /&gt;This works really well and everything has its spot.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and has a lot of room.  Easy to change purses.</li>
            <li> I love using these in a large bag where everything falls to the bottom, etc. I liked this one in particular because it has hard sides and that keeps it upright in my bag instead of falling over. Nice one!</li>
            <li> It fits in most of my handbags and keeps everything easy to find. When my husband was in the hospital it was great to have this in my bag with his and my things seperate and I was able to keep everything organized. I will never buy a bag that is not big enough for this organizer.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy this due to the cost. However, I read the reviews and decided to take a chance. I&#x27;m glad that I did! I like that it expands to fit larger purses, and it didn&#x27;t have the awful stink that comes with most of these types of products. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase as it transformed my bottomless pit of a purse into something organized so I no longer have to \\&quot;dig\\&quot; to find what I need. I will look forward to using it in may different purses that don&#x27;t come with compartments built in.  It&#x27;s well made (which I would hope so for the cost!) so I can only hope that it will last a while. The order arrived quickly and I had no issues with damage, etc. Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> This is a great organizer with lots of pockets and space to expand, if needed.  It makes it easy to switch purses in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this purse organizer.  When I started looking for a purse organizer, I was shocked at how many there are on Amazon.  I am so glad I listened to the other reviewers and purchased this one. The quality is fantastic and the design is perfect.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Keeps my purse organized so I can find everything easily.  Nice that it&#x27;s expandable for wider purses.  Would love to find a smaller version for my smaller purses.</li>
            <li> My LL Bean small &#x27;Boat Tote&#x27; bag was the perfect size, but had no pockets or inserts to help keep things from getting lost.  Although I have only used the insert for one working day, I am absolutely thrilled to be able to keep everything organized and handy.  Shipping was fast and packaging was appropriate.  They even tossed in a small unexpected gift!  The tote smelled rather awful immediately after opening it, so I left it open to air out for 12-15 hours.  Most of the smell was gone by then, and is now (28 hrs later) not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This insert (not expanded) fits exactly into the confines of the small bag.  I also have enough room to put my day planner (size of a large tablet) on one of the sides, where it is supported between the bag and the insert.  \\&quot;A place for everything and everything in its place&#x27; applies to this insert.  I put everything away and the middle is still available to hold water bottles, hats, or the occasional paperback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I love this insert enough that I am considering thinking of ordering 2-4 more.  I like the idea of using it as a console organizer for my van like another review suggested.  I also have a few totes that I like to use for outings like picnics and such, but things keep getting lost.  With this insert, sunscreen bottles and other sundries would stay put and I could still use the rest of the vertical space to hold the bulky items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the luxury of time to wait out the smell for a day or so before using it, this insert will do the job for you!</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few of the purse inserts, and this is by far my favorite.  I love it and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time reading purse organizer reviews (can&#x27;t believe how many are out there) and decided on this one.  It just arrived today and I&#x27;m thrilled.  I fits perfectly in my purse, holds all of my things and seems very well made.  I typically buy big bags even though I don&#x27;t have a lot of stuff to put in it.  This organizer makes my purse seem more full while allowing me to easily find all my things quickly.  I really like that the straps are very small and don&#x27;t get in the way of anything.  Also, I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and chose one with a light inside.  Now I can easily spot my black phone and lipstick tube beause it&#x27;s on a tan background.</li>
            <li> The Bag Organizer is very well made.&lt;br /&gt;It is a real help.&lt;br /&gt;It has a place for just about&lt;br /&gt;everything.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at all of the compartments,&lt;br /&gt;and it unzips to expand.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;purse tote\\&quot; is a great help for those of us who love large handbags. It is sturdy (the sides stand up inside the bad and the bottom creates a nice base inside my floppy hobo. The pockets are roomy and there is plenty of room for my large wallet, coupon keeper and camera in the large main compartment. The side compartments fit all of my other necessities with room to spare. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself &amp; loved it...use it from bag to bag.  Now give as gifts to friends who comment on it &amp; so far, they love it too.  Great product..seller was great as it was received quick without any problem.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised. It also takes the abuse I give it really well - I am not gentle with my purses. No rips yet! Be sure to measure your purse and make sure it&#x27;ll fit inside expanded. It JUST fit in mine. The walls of the organizer are very stiff. I put it in a hobo bag and it gave it more shape and less slouchiness (depends on your view if that&#x27;s a good thing or not). I dropped my bag on the ground and, to my surprise, the stuff in this pouch didn&#x27;t fall out. It kind of folds in a little at the top (not with a magnet or a snap, just naturally), which I like. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> This bag fits inside all of my hobo hand bags!  It is very convenient to switch out purses in a hurry! Great bag!</li>
            <li> I have several other purse organizers, but chose this one to try because of the little handles. I&#x27;m very pleased. It holds everything I need it to and adds nice structure to handbags.  The handles are great because they make it easy to grab the bag and transfer to my next handbag, yet don&#x27;t stick out and get in the way of removing the items stored in the organizer. The only way to make this a 5 star item for me would be to offer it in fashion colors. How about a purple, pink, blue, etc? Keep the interior lining a light color please, that&#x27;s one of the best features. Make this bag in fashion colors and I&#x27;ll be back for several more.</li>
            <li> I ordered the purse organizer on June 18 in the afternoon and got it Wed, June 20!  Unbelieveable service! It&#x27;s everything as advertised, satin outside, grey inside for easy searching.  Expands on both sides and has so many pockets I couldn&#x27;t fill them all, but I will!!  This will make a great gift for those ladies who are always fussing in their handbags.</li>
            <li> Terrific bag organiser that stands up and does not fall in at the sides.  Lots of rooms and handles make it easier to move from bag to bag.</li>
            <li> It was a good little organizer. It lived a great life, until I tried to wash it. The Inside panels are made of light weight cardboard. When I took it out of the washing machine, the inside panels came apart and were stuck in a mushy clump on the inside of the liner. I tried to salvage, but ended up throwing it away. Since then I have gone with much smaller purses and only the essentials, like my wallet and keys. Simply life.... sometimes less is more.</li>
            <li> Love it, wore one out and bought another.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this at all.  Gave it away.  It was not what I had thought it would be.  Too too ridged.</li>
            <li> The insert is the perfect size and weight.  It&#x27;s stiff enough to stand up in the bag but not so weighty and bulky that it affects the outward appearance of the bag.  The only drawback, a big one for me, is the odor of the bag.  I find that a lot of items that are shipped from overseas has this same odor.  It&#x27;s offensive but I&#x27;m still airing the bag out and hope that the smell will dissipate.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC ORGANIZER! Best ever for my gigantic black-hole Coach Tote/ purse!</li>
            <li> Well, it almost lasted a year.  I bought this because I frequently switch bags and wanted something to make it easier.  I also wanted it to protect the inside of my bags.  Well, it completely disintegrated at this point.  I would not recommend it.  It&#x27;s flimsy and not made well.</li>
            <li> Arrive on time. The exterior is made well. Would have liked if the side ends were more firm to give the insert more support. I&#x27;m a little concern on the durability of the material used on the inside. Time will tell. It&#x27;s a great value for the money and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have a large D&amp;B hobo type bag and without an organizer it&#x27;s just a big mess, I can&#x27;t find a thing. The purse itself only has 3 pockets on it, not nearly enough. Now with this awesome organizer there is a spot for everything and it&#x27;s transformed my purse. If my bag was any smaller this wouldn&#x27;t fit - so pay attention to the dimensions, it is large. But for my D&amp;B it fits perfectly. And the quality and amount of pockets is great. Very fair price and good quality - highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This bag organizer is perfect!!! It actually came earlier than it suppose to come, i use this everyday now and i have NO complaints.. definitely purchase this!</li>
            <li> Love it! Very useful!!! Nice big compartments and can fit in any purse! I put it in my new Speedy 30, its awesome!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product not expecting such great quality for such a low price. I was very pleasantly surprised when I saw that the purse tote was so well made, and it fit perfectly in my medium sized handbag. The dimensions were described perfectly! I would recommend this product to anyone searching for a way to organize an unruly purse or bag. The product has a million pockets of various sizes and is very simply to clean. The attached straps make it really simple to just pull it out of your purse and place it in another. Great product!</li>
            <li> Keeps everything organized and easy to find in the Longchamp bag and balances the weight too.  Bought one for my sister I liked it so much!</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago, purchased a new bag at the same time, locally. I was really surprised this fit into a small tote. I just slid it in there and started to fill all the pockets. I just wish it had a key thing, but, besides that it&#x27;s perfect! I can easily take it out and switch bags in a minute. I like that it will expand with a larger purse, but I just have it snapped up on the sides. I still managed to put in my bluetooth on one of those sides and a charger for my phone on the other. Between my wallet, tissues, gum, business cards, paper pad and pens, I needed something to organize since my new tote only had two side pockets and one zipper pocket. It&#x27;s made pretty well, held up with daily use. I bought the one with the lighter color inside so I can see everything, even darker things. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I recently bought a fabric tote style purse, lined, but with only one small interior pocket. Friends say they are amazed at what I keep in my purse, including eye drops and a toothbrush and paste, so I usually choose bags with many pockets and dividers. I needed help with organizing the mess in the new bag and found this item here on Amazon. It fits perfectly in the bag and it holds all my stuff. I like the little handles for removing it to use it in a different purse. It seems well made and is somewhat adjustable. I wish it cost a little less, but if it holds up well, I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> This organizer is perfect for my large purse. I love all the pockets and am able to find things much easier now. Do not be fooled by the picture--I thought the inside was going to be grey but it&#x27;s more of a light blue. Oh well, no one looks at the inside of my purse anyway! I tried to put this in a medium size purse and it was too big, but this is a great product for organizing your large purse!</li>
            <li> This organizer is fairly rigid compared to others of its type.  It also expands which is useful.  The bag that I like to use this in is by American West and is one of my larger handbags.  This organizer helps the bag keep its shape and stand-up straight when I set the bag down.  My wallet (check-book style) and my sunglass case have to be stood upright (verticle) next to eachother in the main compartment, otherwise they will only fit on top of one another when used without expansion and in the American West bag.  Wider bottom bags with the organizer expanded allows those types of items to sit side by side horizontally.  I also like all the compartments to keep hand sanitizer, lip glass, small comb, tissues, etc. in their own spot and easily seen and accessed.  This organizer doesn&#x27;t work well for handbags that have a lower profile or bags designed to have that slouchy look because of the height and rigidity of the organizer.</li>
            <li> I love this organizer and how it has helped fix my big mess of a purse. I like it so much I bought a smaller one to fit into my smaller bags.</li>
            <li> BEST INVENTION EVER!!!! I can actually find things in my purse now.</li>
            <li> This is my secong purse organizer and I got it right this time! My previous organizer collapsed easily and was a nuisance to work with. The Britney organizer has more rigid sides, allowing it to retain its shape in my purse and the pockets are deeper, which means my pens, gloss sticks, and other items don&#x27;t fall out. Also, the light grey interior color makes it easier to find items. Great product at a reasonable price. Shipping was fast. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great item and was a lot larger than expected, but still works with my purse. I really liked the purple too.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect way to organize an un-rigid pocketbook - helps keep it standing up.  Much easier to find everything.  Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This was the perfect fix for the tote bag style bags I prefer. This product was exactly as described. Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I am the queen of purses and purse organizers.  I need a purse that is all pockets of various sizes and shapes to hold all my items.  Since I haven&#x27;t found that yet, and the purse organizers I have never quite do it for me, I tried this.  Actually I tried this one first in black with yellow zippers.  I love the organizer and the fact that it can expand to fit a wider purse and then snap shut to fit a narrower one.  I didn&#x27;t like the look of the yellow zippers in my Kate Spade bags so I found the same organizer with grey zippers... much much better!  These cost less than many on the market and they work better.  What&#x27;s not to like about that?</li>
            <li> I just got a Furla Satchel handbag with 1 little pocket inside and I could never find anything in it. It was like my car keys disappeared into a black hole. I had to take everything out just to find my keys-so frustrating. This organizer is awesome has ALOT of pockets for everything and really more than i have found a use for. I always can find my keys now. I love the fact that it is expandable. One of the best things I ever bought.</li>
            <li> This purse organizer is a godsend. It&#x27;s well-made and very reasonably priced for the quality. It&#x27;s adjustable (with snaps and zippers) to fit different-sized purses. It&#x27;s one of my favorite purchases ever. The other reviews were very helpful in that regard, so thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought this purse organizer for a friend as well as for myself. Since I have received it, I have placed mine in my purse. This is essential for any guy/gal who wants to organize their multiple items in a neat, orderly fashion. I love the fact that it has a zippered pocket for your most personal or loose-fitting items as well as 6 other compartments facing inside towards a large middle-pocket. I highly recommend this product as it is value-for-money and a God-send !!This would make a good present too.</li>
            <li> I really like the concept of this organizer. It has many pockets fits well in my tote. I gave it 4 stars because after very little use some of the stitching has started to unravel.</li>
            <li> I have not had the opportunity to use it.  It seems like it will do the trick.  I have not used the purse for which I bought this.</li>
            <li> I carry a rather large purse to accommodate my iPad.  What I found most frustrating is that all of the items I carried would gather at the bowels of the bottomless pit and I couldn&#x27;t find anything.  This product is a dream come true.  I feel like I have my sanity back - it features a place for everything.  Packs of tissues, iPhone, hand sanitizer, credit card case, shammy, etc, etc.  I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me a beautiful new purse. I didn&#x27;t want to mess up the inside, plus it didn&#x27;t have all the little pockets and organization I normally like. But I was going to carry it!!! So, I measured it and set out to find the right size and type for my satchel bag. This one fit the bag nicely. So far so good.  I just got it installed and filled and it works. and at a good price!! It arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would fit in my purse because the height was ~1/2\\&quot; taller than my purse (satchel-style), but I took a chance (figuring there is some &#x27;give&#x27; in the shape of the purse).  It fits perfectly and works really well!  It seems to be well-made.  There are little handles to make it easy to pull out of the purse, even though it&#x27;s a snug fit.  Lots of pockets to organize my stuff.  I&#x27;m really happy with it!</li>
            <li> I do like this organizer but the lining i was hoping would be the same material as the outside.  it is not and a bit thinner.  but other than that i do like it.  it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Bought this in January 2013 as I purchased a large satchel type bag that I could lose several small pets in, if I were so inclined to let them in. Pros: It does have a ton of pockets, lots of space and seemed to fit everything I needed. Cons: It&#x27;s not that \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot; and after a few months of heavy use, without it stuffed to the gills, it seems to just collapse a wee bit into itself. On the one hand, I paid less than 20.00 for it, and I am *very* hard on bags -- on the other, I see a lot of new \\&quot;bag organizers\\&quot; out there that have gotten worse reviews. So right now, as I peruse what&#x27;s out there, I&#x27;m really torn between just buying a new one of these (though to be honest, I wish it was a little bigger, as I tend to carry enormous purses -- or if I should just break down and buy a pricier one on Etsy that&#x27;s custom made and/or try one of the cheaper models on here.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has never been easier for me keep my handbag neat and tidy!  This item is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a purse that I also ordered... lol.. I got this first and it seems great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor everyone talked about... Only was there for about 5 seconds if that when I first took it out of the plastic bag it was in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It delivered very fast. It was estimated **Wednesday August 15, 2012 - Monday August 20, 2012** but got here **Monday August 13th**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in Ohio it came from Florida. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zippers don&#x27;t seem that good of quality (small and plastic) and the grey fabric that it expands with can get caught in the zipper so BE CAREFUL!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I like it. It holds my big headphone case ds case wallet and camera in its case and a lot more can&#x27;t wait to use it in my new purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants a big purse organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I forgot to mention that it looks exactly like it does in the pictures.</li>
            <li> Love the organization the bag gives me and the ease of switching handbags is amazing. Definitely a must own or gift</li>
            <li> Love this helpful item!!!  Just wish I&#x27;d purchased one years ago.  I cannot believe how easy it is to find anything I need and so quickly, too.  Would make a super gift item, too.</li>
            <li> This organizer was not worth the price.  I would have maybe paid $5-6 for it.  It was too flimsy and poorly constructed to hold up well with daily use.  I am surprised that it got such positive reviews by other buyers...  I returned the item after receiving it, but had to pay for return shipping.</li>
            <li> Fit my purse just right. So far it&#x27;s been very sturdy and it&#x27;s nice that it expands</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using the Britney handbag organizer. I usually carry a medium L. L. Bean tote and the organizer fits perfectly. It&#x27;s so nice to be able to find the things in the bag quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very handy, lots of pockets, fits most purses. I like it and am using it.&lt;br /&gt;It is expandable but could be a little wider for some hobo type purses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.  Holds everything I need and fits right into my purse and I can find everything I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> The interior pockets were not stitched with a tight enough stitch so when I went to open the pouch one whole slot opened down the length of the seam.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little bit sturdy! Cant really say anything bad, this was a good buy and helpful.</li>
            <li> Bought this per everyone&#x27;s review on Amazon. After few weeks&#x27; use, the little pockets inside started tearing off...Guess i put something heavy?? not sure about it...the whole organizer is durable, but the inside pouches are not really...maybe i didn&#x27;t have enough good luck</li>
            <li> Very nice quality. Fits in my purse very well. Easy to transfer to another purse. Makes changing handbags very easy now!</li>
            <li> I often had to dump everything out of my purse to find one thing.  It was a continual struggle, and the message it sent me was, “I am not well organized” – not a good thing to hear several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have everything where it should be and the disorganized handbag is a thing of the past.  I bought the same item for my daughter.  This organizer fits a medium-sized handbag very well.  If I were to use a smaller or larger bag, I would definitely continue using a purse organizer, something to fit.  So far, however, this size has been perfect – not too large, not too small.  In addition, it is holding up beautifully.  I am delighted with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Very useful. Material is easy to clean...the expandable option is great to adjust it to different purse sizes. Price is not bad for its purpose</li>
            <li> the organizer fits my purse nicely and lets me keep it much more organized so I can find what I need.</li>
            <li> I have had this purse organizer for about six months and I love it. It&#x27;s a great size and makes a pushes change out quick and easy.</li>
            <li> My purse is the tote bag style. Very functional for shopping but just try finding anything in there. I&#x27;d gotten to the point where I would toss in 2 of everything. Then it hit me that I was just making the problem worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had other organizer bags but I never used them properly. The stuff just kept wandering from pocket to pocket and I was forced to search every pocket. Plus, every time I changed bags, I&#x27;d confuse myself as it all changed places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tight compact organization with the top down view allows organization combined with easy search and retrieval. Obviously, you just lift the whole thing when you move to a new bag. Now I wish my bag were just two inches wider and longer and that would allow this organizer to expand to it&#x27;s full potential. Still, the design is good, it adjusts to different purse sizes within reason. There are snaps on the side that helps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke the zipper in the side pocket yesterday (overloaded the poor thing). But having an organized purse has made my life so much more productive, that I don&#x27;t give a damn (excuse my french). The rest of the organizer is holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here is my summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purse dimensions: Mine is 14\\&quot; long, 9\\&quot; high, 5\\&quot; wide (at the bottom). The purse width narrows at it approaches the top. The organizer fits easily. It could spread out in width more but the purse isn&#x27;t quite large enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internal pockets: a good sizes for wallets, checkbooks, small notebooks and sunglasses cases (those really large ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internal \\&quot;handles\\&quot;: I guess these are for lifting the organizer from purse to purse but I find it handy to hang keys and usb drives there. Get some of those clever key clips and you&#x27;ll have a handy rail for little items that would get lost in the pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;External pockets: Look like they are best for flat cell phones, cards or very short pens. The stiff sides of the organizer would offer your cell phone some protection. My purse has a nice cell phone pocket so I slip in some travel size lotions in the flattest tubes I can find. 3\\&quot; is about the right length to peek out of those locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest downside: My purse is supposed to be a shopping tote/purse. I still load stuff on top, causing me to dig to the bottom. Was stuck with stuff in both my hands trying to reach the wallet the other day. Clearly, I needed a second bag, or cargo pants. I need to rethink my purse/shopping tote strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, excellent service. Order arrived within one day, even though I chose 2 day delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my other organizer bags (the ones with the side view of multiple pockets) was only marginally helpful (I really only tracked my cell phone and pens); my tote-style bags were black holes. This one fulfills my expectations. I can find important items immediately (2 seconds) and other items by poking around once or twice (5 seconds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are excellent DIY instructions on the internet to make your own and I thought about it. Seemed simple enough. But this is well constructed. The design has some really thoughtful touches not found on the DIY instructions. Many of the pressure points are riveted. I&#x27;m really happy I paid instead of trying to make my own. Although, I would have chosen much prettier fabric :)y purse has a nice cell phone pocket so I slip in some travel size lotions in the flattest tubes I can find. 3\\&quot; is about the right length to peek out of those locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest downside: My purse is supposed to be a shopping tote/purse.

            <li> A very good organizer with rightly sized pockets and enough of them to fit in all regular accessories. A good item for gift as well</li>
            <li> Not over priced....so worth what I paid for. I am pocketbook obsessed, MUST have the right amount of pockets, as I like organizations, this is great. I never buy any of those cute, inexpensive &amp;#34;hobo&amp;#34; bags type purses, ...cus they never have pockets...Now I have, and this fits great into any medium sized, or larger bag. Good organization. One month, ..no issues, hope it holds up.</li>
            <li> It could be a little larger to fit in larger handbags.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly in my purse.....no more searching around! Now I know exactly where everything is. :) I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Love this.  Fits in all my large handbags and now I switch my purses out more because it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li> It certainly holds all my &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and it makes my purse neat and things easy to find.  Only down side is my purse became really heavy, even though the tote was the only thing added.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, great price. Excellent material. Love It!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy some more for my sisters!</li>
            <li> Really like this organizer.  I have a large Louis Vuitton and this makes finding small items easy.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.  Where has this been all my life?  As soon as it arrived, I cleared out my purse, reorganized and put it to use.  It arrived in the time frame promised, and was well packaged.  It helps keep my large leather purse upright as well as organized, a plus!</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ordered. It&#x27;s nice &amp; sturdy so it doesn&#x27;t slide back &amp; forth &amp; has pockets everywhere. I don&#x27;t smell anything weird unless if I actually sniff it. Recommended!</li>
            <li> It does not stay steady in the purse, but tends to flip over and I have to pull it right sde up before  can begin to look for anything!</li>
            <li> For overseas trips I use a large purse/handbag so I can have things handy that i need during the flights. Downside is that I can&#x27;t ever find them as the seem to disappear into my large bag!  Purchased this prior to my last flight recently and what a difference. 1st it helps make the bag more sturdy and there are more than enough pockets to keep everything is a fairly logic order, plus has room for the more bulky things like wallet or glass case holder. I like it so much I have left it in the purse/handbag permanently now, but its great to know I can just remove it for another bag. Good buy!</li>
            <li> Purchase this purse organizer!!! You won&#x27;t be sorry. You&#x27;ll forever be organized. It&#x27;s excellent for Medium and Large Purses because it will expand via zippers on each side. I&#x27;m reorganizing and organizing everything from closets to cabinets,drawers and cable cords so why not my purse? This easily transfers from one purse to another and I hated to transfer purses before now. Now I will give all my purses equal wear time.</li>
            <li> I simply love the organizer , the quality is good and it is expandable so fits into small hobos as well expands to fit into the larger bags.&lt;br /&gt;It also gives a shape to the bags which sag. Has plenty of pockets. A must have for all the girls !</li>
            <li> mine is not as shown,  does not have the key holder but is ok</li>
            <li> Very practical as an organizer</li>
            <li> Extremely handy purse organizer.  Easy to change purses as everything is all in this one organizer.  I like the expandable side zipper options.  The only thing missing is a key fob.</li>
            <li> I purchased this organizer for my sister. I have another type, but I really like this one better. So does my sis.&lt;br /&gt;Classy and sleek, but has capacity to hold a lot of items. NICE!</li>
            <li> this is an excellent bag full of pockets. the quality is high.  shipment arrived very fast. I can organize everything with this bag and I can also extend the size with the zippers.  highly recommended.</li>
            <li> after my wife figured out how to use it she loves it.  it fits in most of her purses and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love my handbag organizer. Everythig stays where I put it. There are more pockets than even I can fill. I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Product is very helpful to organize your belongings.  It makes it much easier to locate items rather than having to dig all around in your purse.  I did not notice any smell or other issues some reported in their reviews.</li>
            <li> This organized  inside of my large bag. I can find things easier now and it does not look messy anymore. And I can transfer my bags way easier, just pull this out and put it in other bag I want to carry.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s a great addition to a purse that does not have many pockets. I love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this organizer! I have a Speedy 30 and it fits perfectly with spare room for larger items such as a book or iPad. It is well structured, so it will keep the form of your purse and not \\&quot;flop\\&quot; over when empty. The pockets are a good size, and the straps that are made to help pull it out of your bag are great to hang keys, sunglasses, hair clips, etc. from. The quality is decent; I have only used it for a few weeks, but it seems like it will last for a long time. Also, it is fairly light, so it doesn&#x27;t add too much weight to your bag.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the money, in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> I have used other organizers before, the less expensive ones are alright, but you definitely get what you pay for. They are weak and fall onto them selves. This one stays up right, the fabric is a soft yet very sturdy. The pockets hold everything my portable cell phone charger to my lipsticks, pens, my powder and myself on. The zippers are nice and smooth, great value for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> Falls apart easily. Lasted a couple months. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The outside of this product seems sturdy, but I bought it for the pockets inside.  In less then a week, the pockets inside are falling apart.  The stitching holding the pockets to the shell are coming unstitched.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this purse organizer based on the product photos. When it arrived I was disappointed to see how flimsy the sections are; they just sort of… flop. The animal print satin lining that forms the inner pockets is EXTREMELY thin and I suspected that this wasn&#x27;t a product that would hold up well over time. I am not one to over-stuff a purse, however, so I thought it would be OK if I treated it gently. On the plus side, It fits perfectly inside my Michael Kors tote and provides much-needed structure. I like the outside pockets that are made from the more rigid exterior material because I can tuck my iPhone in and it stays put. I like being able to access my phone quickly. On the con side - and this is a deal-breaker for me - the ultra-thin satin lining material that forms the inner pockets started to rip and shred within two weeks of use. The long, inner zipper is ripped and the fabric is shredded after two weeks of use and I only unzipped the pocket one time, to store a few coupons when I went shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the inner fabric and sections were made of a heavier material than the thin satin this organizer would be perfect. I notice in the product description that the company makes the following claim: &amp;#34;As of January 2013, improved Quality Control Standards implemented.&amp;#34; If this is true, either the standards are still not adequate or they sent me the old model. My purchase was made in October of 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted the company and will update this review after my issue is resolved.</li>
            <li> It is a great idea, but it does not hold much, not that well organized, and adds unnecessary weight. No thanks</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful organizer that is very well made.  The pockets are well sized so they can be used in many different ways; rather then one size fits all.  All the zippers operate smoothly, and I love the opportunity for expanding the size for even larger bags.  I change purses at least once a week and this has made the job much, much easier, on top of that I ALWAYS know where to find the item I&#x27;m looking for.  This would also be a great product for organizing a car console.  In fact I may well order another one soon just for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this purse organizer.  It keeps everything in its designated place, and I&#x27;m not wasting time digging in the bottom of my \\&quot;big\\&quot; purse for my keys, sunglasses, lip gloss, nailfile, tissue, yada, yada, yada.  And it even helps keep the shape of my purse.  I just love it.  I don&#x27;t routinely change purses, but it would be perfect to just remove the organizer, holding all of its contents, and placing it in another purse, ready to hit the door!  A great investment.</li>
            <li> it fits perfectly into my purse and has enough compartments to fit everything i need! so perfect!!! so glad i spent this money because i needed this so desperately!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and sturdy.  It has many compartments and it is a good quality. I was worried that it may be too large for my purse but it can change it&#x27;s size by using the zippers on the sides.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a large purse which I wanted to keep neat and organized.  This purse organizer is absolutely perfect.The organizer has a place for everything I usually carry and there are pockets that I haven&#x27;t even used yet.  My purse has never been so neat and well organized.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This organizer is very nicely constructed. Fits into purse easily and all items&lt;br /&gt;are within view and reach. No more digging in the bottom of my purse for anything.&lt;br /&gt;It is also lightweight.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to find everything &amp; switching bags is a breeze!</li>
            <li> I got this insert last week, and so far I am LOVING it! It appears to be really well made, and it&#x27;s super easy to change from purse to purse because it&#x27;s lightweight and adjustable. I would definitely order this product again!</li>
            <li> I love this purse organizer.  I hate looking for things in my purse and this insert has lots of pockets and is sturdy in its construction.</li>
            <li> This was the answer to my prayers.  It hold so much.  And the best thing, I can change purses easily.</li>
            <li> My new Coach bag which is a cavernous pit with the exception of two small pockets, had all of my items so jumbled that I could never catch my phone in time, never find a pen, a piece of gum, my comb or any essential that I needed to grab in a hurry.  So, I went on Amazon and spotted this pretty sturdy looking organizer, the Britney Black &amp; Grey, and I decided to try it.  Well, first of all, it was delivered before I had even given a thought that it was time to receive it--in a jiffy, as my mom would say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have noted an odor--I did not have ANY.  I am allergic to everything and my ability to smell rivals a hound dog in heat!  So, either due to fast transit time or just getting lucky (or perhaps they fixed the problem), I did not experience this stinkola problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned my Coach bag upside down and let everything fall to the carpet--totally empty and I already felt some relief.  Then I put all of my \\&quot;little things\\&quot; into all of the compartments including my large wallet and sunglasses in the middle, and just admired it for a minute or two, and I did find that in the corner cubbies, I could and did put in my pens (standing up) and some candy sticks so that I could chew either one easily :o)  Honestly, I did throw away a few stray papers and fuzzies that were lurking in the corners of my Coach, so it got a little cleanup too, but now everything is JUST where I want it.  I played around with placing my phone vs. keys in a particular spot, but now, I know before opening my bag (from the front, always) where everything is (without even looking).  YAY!!!  Great product.  Quality made.  Fast shipping.  If you know me, you will probably be getting this from me for Christmas!!!  (I would add that I bought a large that stated that it is a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; size.  It is not LARGE, but it definitely would not fit in a smaller satchel or hobo.  My Coach is an Ashley satchel which is \\&quot;medium\\&quot; and it fits tightly so that I cannot put items on the outsideof the organizer, which is just fine with me (who needs all that weight anyway), but when I buy one of these for my smallish-medium bags, I will buy the small and have space around it for \\&quot;extras\\&quot;.  Really, you just have to decide how you want to use it.  I am very pleased with the product, Amazon, the price, fast shipping and that I can now control the contents of my purses.  Amen!</li>
            <li> I have 3 pairs of glasses, wallet, makeup bag, phone, snacks for my kid, etc. This bag really helped get everything in order so that I don&#x27;t have to go hunting for items every time I go in my purse. Very pleased with product, good quality materials and good price.</li>
            <li> No more fighting to find something in my bag.  It keeps the bag from folding over, which makes is easier to shop and have access to your belongings.  Love this product</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried the zipper of the inside pocket I could see it was broken. Disappointied as I liked everything else about this item; light color of the lining, all the pockets. I contacted the seller who replied promptly saying they would send a replacement and that I wouldn&#x27;t have to return the defective item. However, the replacement never arrived. This was over 6 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> This is a great purse organizer with all the pockets/room I could ask for.  I love the discrete handles that help transferring it from one purse to another.  Helps give shape and organization to the popular \\&quot;slouch\\&quot; bags.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> The Britney Organizer is great for organizing medium to large handbags.  I carry fairly large handbags.  Most of my bags have 2 or 3 compartments.  I bought this Britney organizer for one compartment and [[ASIN:B008PGTAXE Outback Leatherette Pouchee Purse Organizer]]for the other compartment.  My handbags have never been so organized and neat. I love all of the pockets.  It seems durable.  I love the handles that can be used to easily remove the organizer from one handbag and put into another bag.  Switching bags is quick and easy.  I bought the Black &amp; Grey.  It&#x27;s easy to see what is in the organizer because of the light interior. I have a very good sense of smell and I don&#x27;t notice any odor with my organizer.  Similar to another customer, I did have an initial problem with the zipper which is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  I got the zipper working correctly now.  Even if it breaks again, I&#x27;m not returning this.  I love it with or without the zippered compartment!</li>
            <li> This organizer is great. It expands, so it fits lots of different bag sizes. Plenty pockets and easily transfers from bag to bag.</li>
            <li> Great little thing. A colleague recommended it after noticing I didn&#x27;t swap handbags all that often. Perfect size so up can still fit other bits and pieces but main contents stay in this and get transferred whenever a new handbag calls</li>
            <li> I give this product a three star because at first I love it but a few weeks later it broke.&lt;br /&gt;I only have my wallent, business card holder, lipstics, keys, badge, sunglasses inside. I don&#x27;t carry a lot of stuff like the rest of the ladies who bought this organizer. After a few weeks of using it, one side of the packet fell off, and the lining tear. I am stilling it because I fix it by staple the broken pocket and lining back with a stapler. Good luck!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I like large handbags &amp; hate not knowing where everything is. I would use different size cosmetic bags to contain the little stuff. This bag organizer makes it so easy to just reach in &amp; get what I need! The product is well made. I feel I made the correct choice on which one to buy. I would certainly recommend this product to my family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> I use this purse tote in my purses that do not have compartments. It really helps to keep things organized.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS AND IT WORKS GREAT. I BOUGHT IT FOR A LARGE COACH BAG AND IT WAS JUST PERFECT. I FEEL SO ORGANIZED AND WHAT A GREAT FEELING THAT IS!!</li>
            <li> This really helped me to organize me purse. Before it was hard to find things. Hobo bags are big, but it is like throwing everything into a large sack.</li>
            <li> I received this item yesterday and already using it. The size is great and I love the fact that it has large pockets inside.</li>
            <li> Just got this product today. Perfect size for my Dooney and Bourke purses. Everything fits in nicely even my kindle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this organizer.  It&#x27;s the best solution I&#x27;ve ever found for keeping my purse from becoming a total mess.  Well made product, has a nice feel to it, and is doing exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> fiuts in most of my hand bags, and i love the organizational areas within this organizer. i would recommentd it because it is firm, dosnt collapse and is light colored on the inside to easily identify your items.&lt;br /&gt;fits an amazing amount of stuff. really!</li>
            <li> You does not know how incredible it is until you have not one in your hands or inside your bag. I had seen TV ads about this but these ads all time exaggerate and usually create and delusion about the product and until sometimes you can see the lie. BUT, in this case, this item is marvelous. I bought this in middle size and, although I am a neat person, the different is big: one category for pocket, easy pockets for storage and for take of them, eight internal pockets (six big and two small) and two external pockets, a big space in the middle for large stuff like wallet or glasses box, you can enlarge this space open one or two of zippers for that. It has two handles for take it out or in your bag. The mine is black. When it arrived I saw this normal, like picture, not any emotion, I only settled of my stuff inside and then it inside my bag. The first time that I had to find something in my bag the magic began and after a week of use still continues. This is a great gift too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sorry for my english)</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for a purse insert.  It&#x27;s too large for my purses, so I am using it in my weekend travel bag. I travel to and fro once a week, and It works great and has held up well so far.  There are many compartments for all the accessories I like to have with me (camera, kleenex, keys, cords, gum, lipstick,makeup, medications, etc.).  It keeps items well organized and handy.  The things I like most about it is the material and stitching quality, and it is deep enough that most items aren&#x27;t sticking out over the top where they can be bumped.  Also it expands when you open the zipper on each side; that is a very nice feature.  I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Fits great in a messenger bag and holds everything a guy (or girl) could possibly need.  Perfect gift for the organizer.</li>
            <li> Never having used an organizer like this before I had no idea how easy finding things in my bags could be!  There is plenty of space for phone, wallet, kindle, comb, a little pad, outgoing mail, glasses and sunglasses, keys and some makeup essentials, and that&#x27;s with the zippers closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just right sized for the tote bags I carry, not too heavy and the light interior makes everything very easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great purchase overall, would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> The size and design of the purse organizer make it the perfect addition to any purse.  I no longer have to go all the way to the bottom of my bag to find the smaller items that invariably went there before I got organized with the Britney organizer.  It is exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I really like the convenience of this purse insert. It is very functional and easy to use.  It is a perfect size for most medium purses.  If you change your purse often, you will love this.  It has a zipper on both lengthwise sides of the tote which unzip and allow the tote to expand about three more inches on each side.  The outside is a satin material.  There are six pockets inside and two outside. There are pockets at each end inside that have elastic tops which allow them to expand when the tote is opened to it fullest unzipped size.  There are handles along the inside of each side that make lifting the tote out easy.  This tote adds only a little extra weight.  What I like the best about this tote is that the pockets are primarily on the inside.  This allows the tote to slide in and out without the interference that outside pockets would cause.  This allows it to slide into purses that have narrow opening tops.  The tote works best in purses that are totally open inside, but I have used it with a purse that had a center interior pocket and that still worked out okay as long as I didn&#x27;t try to use the other side.  Another nice feature is that the tote holds it shape and actually adds shape to purses that tend to not have any on their own - like hobos.  This tote keeps all the contents in place with no dumping into the middle.  It&#x27;s nice to put your hand in and easily find exactly what you&#x27;re looking for without looking.  These are a terrific gift idea.  I have bought six of these now for gifts and they get fantastic reception.</li>
            <li> I loved this organizer so much I had to show it to my mom and sisters.  My mom has already ordered one for herself, and both of my sisters may very well order one too.  It looks so much nicer than any other bag organizer I found at Amazon.  It fits nicely in my Land&#x27;s End medium zip tote and now I can find my loose items without dumping everything out.  Thanks for the great pruduct!</li>
            <li> This product deserves &amp;#34;the best purchase of the year&amp;#34; from me. This perfectly organizes gazillions of items I carry in my purse so now I don&#x27;t have to dig through my purse to look for an item. I am so content with this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my daughter in law.  She carries a large purse that causes more harm than good.  She has since added this organizer to her bag, it&#x27;s made a difference to how quickly she can find what she&#x27;s looking for. I just need to get one for myself!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this organizer.  It has made looking for things in my purse a snap.  I highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for a medium sized purse.  There&#x27;s multiple pockets for your phone, cosmetics, pens, and a zippered pocket as well for stashing away money or coupons as well.</li>
            <li> The Britney Black &amp; Grey Handbag Purse Tote Organizer truly helps keeping things more organized in my purse! Since my purse is on the deep side, it helps that I don&#x27;t have to keep digging around and searching for small items. It is somewhat light weight but sturdy enough to stand up and not collapse. The price was just right. It met all my expectations and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of being able to lift out one pocket to change purses.  It expands if needed and holds more than an adequate amount of purse stuf!</li>
            <li> I love the ease of changing purses with this.  I just put all my stuff in it and when I want to switch purses, I just pull it out and put it in another purse. It keeps everything organized and easy to find regardless of how big my purse is.</li>
            <li> Just love the functionality, it turned a large fashion bag into a bag I can use every day w/o frustration.  My friend says it&#x27;s the ugly bag hidden inside the cute one &amp; said I&#x27;m cheating on my purse.  I can reach in &amp; find what I need while driving w/o taking my eyes off the road b/c I know where everything is.</li>
            <li> I love how all I have to do is pull this out of my purse and sit it inside the next purse I&#x27;m using. It makes for quick changes &amp; I change mine alot lol It holds everything i need and then some. Several ladies I work with are even wanting it.</li>
            <li> This was a gereat price.  Unfortunately the quality was not not as great as the price.  i have already discarded this item.</li>
            <li> Loved it very much....it keep my stuff in the purse ORGANIZED and easy to find.  The only drawback is the stitches used to divide those interior pockets, they somehow become un-stitched but I stitched them back up. It also expands to your liking - fit up almost any purse except the skinny ones.</li>
            <li> This organizer works very well in my Miche handbag - it keeps items in their own separate places instead of at the bottom of my bag.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in the Louis Vuitton Palermo that I use for a baby bag. I wish the interior pockets were more structured. They&#x27;re super flimsy and don&#x27;t hold shape which makes it difficult to just slide/toss things in them. The item itself is very cheaply made and of low quality material. But it wipes up well. It does the trick but it&#x27;s nothing great.</li>
            <li> Was perfect BUT I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. Smells plasticky and horrible. Made everything in my purse have the same smell. Just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I don&#x27;t like organizer purses.  But I have to say I like this organizer very much. I have one purse that would just collapse when input stuff in it.  But this handy organizer helps to hold up the sides.  My purse is now organized and you can&#x27;t tell the organizer is in it.  It&#x27;s also easy to pull it out and put it in another purse.  If you have a purse with soft, floppy sides, this is a great solution.</li>
            <li> Now I am very organized and never have to dig through everything to find my phone, or key. Don&#x27;t have to worry about scratching my sunglasses or iPad any more, because they all have their own places in my bag, safe from the keys.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I imagined it to be.  It looks a lot better in the photograph.  It&#x27;s just not well made.</li>
            <li> Great organizer I use this in my large everyday bag and its perfect since I do carry everything but the kitchen sink LOL</li>
            <li> Saw the expensive ($50+) version at a store and purchased it online.  Then I saw the Britney on Amazon for way less and ordered it.  Received both and they are almost identical - the more expensive one has a bit thicker silkier lining, but not enough of a difference to warrant a $40 price difference.  The basic construction and outside sturdiness appear to the be same.  I even like the Britney better because the light solid colored lining makes things easier to find.  The expensive one is going back and I&#x27;m going to order another Britney for me - and they are my new latest gift idea for family and friends - useful and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I really like this insert. It gives some structure to my floppy purse and is very convenient for organizing the myriad items I keep in my purse. I like that the insert expands, and I like all the pockets. My only issue is that some of the inside pockets are a bit flimsy. I find that things like my phone, lipstick, and eye drops fall out of the pockets quite often. These inconveniences are outweighed by the fact that my purse is extremely well organized now. I can find anything in a heartbeat, and I can return items to their proper location quickly. All in all, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I change out my purses so often and I wanted something that would organize and also I would not forget something. This also helps keep the bottoms of my purses clean!! It has zippers so that you can expand or make smaller if you are carrying around a small bag! Big fan if you want to declutter your bag!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to go in a large purse I also bought. This added extra touch was perfect and my friend loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this sectional insert.  I no longer have to be concerned about changing purses , which I never did until finding this.  Its sturdy enough to stand up in any purse, yet not bulky or flimsy, and it has zippered sections. No more worries about leaving something out !</li>
            <li> This is really a nice organizer, but I&#x27;ve only had it in my purse one day and the stitching is already coming undone. Going to try to fix it myself but I really shouldn&#x27;t have to this soon. Other than that, it has the perfect number of pockets in just the right places and is the perfect size for my favorite Coach bag.</li>
            <li> I love this purse organizer! Only downside is that the inside zipper broke. If not for that I would have given 5 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous purse organizers, and this is one of the best. Really nicely made, with lots of pockets in usable sizes. The inner handles make it easy to grab to switch from one purse to another. Probably its most unique feature is how the size can be adjusted, using snaps to pull it shut, or opening zippers to expand it. The one thing I miss from my old purse organizer is a lobster claw clip for my keyring, but there are enough pockets that my keys could get their own space. At 10.5 inches, it is also a little wide, but I usually carry larger purses, so this isn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted to add extra pockets and organization to a very large purse that I have!  Really makes things easier to find and was exactly what I was looking for.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I had bought one from a different company about 6 months ago and it was very similar to this.  The problem  was that the inside was a silky/satiny material that did not hold up at the seams and ripped pretty quickly.  This one has an almost mesh-like material on the inside that looks like it will hold up superbly well.&lt;br /&gt;Right now I have it in my bigger tote purse.  This insert has two zippers that opens it up to make it bigger, which is a nice plus.  Then, for my smaller purse, I just keep the sides zipped up and then it fits in there well too.&lt;br /&gt;This keeps all my items nice and organized.  I couldn&#x27;t have a tote purse without it!</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift and would have gotten a higher rating  but it came with a tear in a seam that i was unaware of until after it was given. Thankfully the recipient had sewing skills and repair was her choice rather than return. Otherwise it would have gotten a 5 star rating. Holds more than we had thought and she loves it. I&#x27;m still thinking of getting one for myself because I think it was just a one time flaw that just happened that the seam had that small tear. It was minor.</li>
            <li> This is awesome, I would have given a 5 star but this makes my purse heavier than I would like.  Over all, I am glad that I have to use.  It fits in many different sizes of purses.</li>
            <li> My purse was a continues mess. I never switched bags it was just to much trouble. I now can find anything for example lip pencils. contacts keys and anything else I would need is right at my fingertips. non broken. I just lift it out if I want to switch bags. I am also impressed with the way the bag opens up as it breaths. There are zippers to make the bag wider if you need to. Thank you Spirit&lt;br /&gt;  It is after Xmas now so these gifts have been opened. What a hit I bought three. I just wish I had invented them everyone loves them including myself. Spirit</li>
            <li> Arrived fast&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be good quality with alot of the right size pockets for everything I need to carry.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;m excited that I can now use different bags and still be organized.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! it keeps everything neat and organized, the size is as described, and it&#x27;s great for travel and if you switch bags a lot!  The best thing about this is that I have a smaller purse, and if I keep both sides (or even one side) zipped up, it fits in my smaller purses.  it holds EVERYTHING! and clutch wallets fit just right in it.  I bought one for my mother and my sister and I suggest them to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Bought this purse insert for a gift.  The person I got it for has been very pleased with it.  They like the versitility of being able to change it&#x27;s size.  Also like the zipper pocket.  Very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> Organizes my purse, holds a lot of stuff, and I can move it to another purse if necessary. I always wanted to get one of these. I finally got a purse to accommodate an organizer like this, and it works great!</li>
            <li> I am going on a trip and have a new purse without dividers so am very excited to use this to keep my bag more organized and easier to find things.</li>
            <li> This was a great find and well worth the price.  It is very well made and services as an easy way to organize one&#x27;s purse or suitcase</li>
            <li> Easier to find thing in my purse.</li>
            <li> It has helped my purse stay more oraganized, which makes it easier to find stuff. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> great for what I needed it for.  one of the inner pocket has become unstitched so I will need to reinforce it.  but overall...it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job in my purse!</li>
            <li> keeps my big purse very organized&lt;br /&gt;my only complaint is that the pockets are not sewn very securely and the seams have loosened a bit with use -- only the inside pockets though, The outside is very well constructed and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I use this in every purse I own. No more rummaging around to find my wallet..checkbook..lighter..pen...&lt;br /&gt;This holds everything I need in my purse..and more!  LOL</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom for Christmas. She has wanted one for a while and had done some research on her own prior to telling me what she wanted. Some reviewers stated that the item arrived smelling of formaldehyde but this one did not. I checked it right away when it arrived so I could see about airing it out before Christmas but I had no problems with any odors at all. My mom loves it; she&#x27;s able to keep everything organized and free up enough space to keep her Kindle with her at all times, not to mention that she&#x27;s able to use as many of her handbags as she&#x27;d like now since it&#x27;s so easy to change from one to another.</li>
            <li> This organizer is built okay on the outside and very cheap and flimsy on the inside. I had it less than 5 month and the inside lining ripped in the corner seam from top to bottom. unable to repair it, it is sooo bad. Also the zipper inside sticks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I am careful to take good care of my things and I am anal about my purses. I would NOT buy it again. BIG waste of $$.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organizer for my designer purse.  I wanted something small but with pockets that could hold all the little things.  This is the perfect organizer.  It is small and does not make my purse feel huge or heavy.  It is also designed to make smaller or larger which I love.  Great product</li>
            <li> There are so many ways to customize this great little tote travel bag.  ok, so its not so little.  Its a great mid-sized organizer.</li>
            <li> This organizer is perfect sized for a medium bag.  No more digging for my keys or wallet! It holds all MY stuff (wallet, phone, personal items, chapstick, tissue, pens and small notebook, sunglasses, etc), and I still have room in my bag outside the organizer to hold a spare change of clothes for my toddler.</li>
            <li> This item is very useful, it fits my handbag very well. Now I don&#x27;t worry about where I put my staffs anymore. It is time saver item!</li>
            <li> The purse organizer worked like a charm. I like a large hand bag, but can never find what I need. The tote fixed that problem. It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is a great organizer, very roomy, fits well in my Steve Madden handbag.  I would buy it again. The expansion zippers are great!</li>
            <li> I like the product, price and excellent customer service. It could benefit from a material that doesn&#x27;t slide around inside the bag, but that is a minor drawback. I would recommend purchasing this item from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I  just got this today and immediately emptied everything  from my purse  into it.  I holds everything and has room for more.  I like that  it has firm sides to keep each item in place.  My purse  was a mess, everything  piled on top of  itself.  I wondered how can people stand to carry this type of bag.  I love the looks of it but the functionality stunk.  This purse organizer changed all of that. Everything has its place and it stays put!</li>
            <li> I received my organizer just a couple of days ago and love it.  I&#x27;ve been looking for months for a purse that would hold everything I want to carry but not leave me having to empty a bag to find what I need.  This organizer is perfect.  As I said in my title, I&#x27;m going to sew my own purses to fit this organizer.  I&#x27;m not crafty enough to make an organizer this well done but can do a simple bag for carrying it.  It&#x27;s not really clear from the pictures or the description how much more flexible it is because of the two zippers that allow for expansion and the set of snaps at each end that aren&#x27;t described at all.  The only thing I&#x27;d change is to lose the little rivets where the handles are attached at the side.  Once I filled my organizer the first time and tried to pick it up using the handles, two of the rivets popped off.  I&#x27;d suggest, skip using the handles, just pick the bag up by the sides.  The handles are stitched in, so it would seem the rivets are more decorative, but really, the handles aren&#x27;t even necessary, you aren&#x27;t going to use the organizer as a purse by itself.  Another reviewer mentioned the odor, it really isn&#x27;t that bad.  My daughters and I both thought it smells like a shoe store, a sort of vinyl/rubber type smell.  Unless you put your face up against the organizer, you can&#x27;t smell it, and you shouldn&#x27;t have to as it will be so easy to see where each of your items are in your purse, you won&#x27;t have to get your face down in it to find what you need.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Loved the product and the size. I can now rotate from purse to purse and use my insert to organize all my stuff. Very fast delivery. I ordered on Friday afternoon and received it by Monday afternoon. 3 days later. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be bigger because the purse I got for Christmas is huge, but it has no bearing on the organizer itself. the separate pockets are great &amp; I can slip my phone down in the little front pocket - which is great because I lose my phone all the time. There is also a little place that a pen slips into &amp; that really works for me too. I might eventually try to find a bigger one, but if you need an organizer for a medium sized purse - this one is great.</li>
            <li> This purse organizer is extremely well made, both in terms of quality as well as design.  I&#x27;ve purchased a number of other purse organizers that just did not meet my needs with too many small unusable pockets, poor construction and shoddy materials.  This item is just perfect.  Good solid nylon fabric with well stitched seams that should hold up well.  Holds all my stuff and makes changing handbags a snap.</li>
            <li> i ordered this for myself but as soon as my mom saw it took it and has been using it ever since.  from what she says, it works great.  great seller too!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to be up- to-date by carrying one of the popular large, colorful bags that it seems everyone has these days. So I bought one, only to be faced with digging through all the contents to find one item. The problem? Only a couple pockets! The solution? Add pockets! I didn&#x27;t see any purse organizers in stores, so I checked out Amazon. They carry plenty to choose from, but the Britany Organizer is perfect for me. I love all the pockets it has, but I especially like tha feature that allows me to make the Britany Organizer larger if I need to. Also, moving my things from one purse to another is a snap; just take the organizer from one bag and put it in the other. I&#x27;d buy this again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a purse problem - I love them all - and I REALLY needed this organizer.  My life is much improved :)</li>
            <li> Great product, this insert helped clean up the clutter of my wife&#x27;s purse. She is now able to find things faster now.</li>
            <li> Good organizer.  There was a minor defect with one of the side zippered areas (which is supposed to expand the organizer) where the lining had been stitched to itself with 3 or 4 stitches, and I had to cut through the stitches with scissors so that it would expand.  Also, after using the organizer for only a couple of days, one of the metal double cap rivets came off of one of the handles, and upon closer inspection, both sides of the rivet were found to be clearly bent and misshapen, which likely occurred in assembly.  I did not consider either of these issues important enough to bother with returning the product, but there did appear to be some concerns with manufacturing \\&quot;quality control.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This organizer is great! It fits great in my bag! I love that it can be switched easily! This bag meets all my expectations!</li>
            <li> This organizer was delivered right on time. Its great and a good alternative to those expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time-this is a great help in keeping your purse organized-would definitely recommend it for anyone who carries a large purse.</li>
            <li> Great for large wider handbags! Very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my tote obsession! I love to carry around totes for flexibility of adding things and access to things. However, those bags can turn into a jumble mess of things and it takes me forever to find something. This organizer turned out to be PERFECT! Now I have everything nicely organized and easy to access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a regular basis, I carry my wallet, re-usable grocery bag, ibuprofin, an umbrella, pen and pad, tissue, my cell phone, sunglasses, and a scarf.</li>
            <li> This insert is good size and all of my stuff does fit.  It is one of the best purchases I have made, it makes it so easy to change handbags.  Product is of good quality and easy to remove from one bag into another.  Would highly recomend this product for someone who like to change bags often or wants handbag more organized as I can now find everything easily instead of having to search through bag.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that I wish that the ends were stiff so that it would stay open better.  Otherwise, this is a really good product.  I can organize things in all the pockets, so no more fishing around in the bottom of my purse, hoping to find something.  There&#x27;s stretchy pockets at each end, just the right size to stand a water bottle in, which I didn&#x27;t realize before I bought it, so that&#x27;s an added bonus for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now 1.5 years later and time to review this - I LOVE IT! I have a Michael Kors satchel style bag, and this keeps me so organized. I can still access the built-in purse pockets, but gives you so many more, and allows you to still have an open compartment in the middle. I use each and every pocket and feel so organized all the time. A few friends have asked about it and ordered them too for their bags. My bag is black so I got the black color, but I really wouldn&#x27;t have cared if it was lime green as long as it does such a great job! That being said, I don&#x27;t take it in and out at all - so if you are planning to do so, you may want to read other reviews where that&#x27;s what the user does. If I had a second bag for this to fit into, I think I would ultimately just order a second organizer. I&#x27;ll be bookmarking this brand since my first baby is due soon, and I think something like this can make a &amp;#34;non-diaper bag&amp;#34; into just what I need!  I&#x27;m a woman on the go, and this suits my lifestyle :)</li>
            <li> It works pretty well as a purse organizer but the side pockets are hard to access in a deep bag, so everything ends up in the middle section any way, It would be fantastic as a travel kit (night table item, miscellaneous chargers, cords, tissues, medications, etc with two additional features: 1) a snap to hold it closed; 2) roomer top straps so it is easier to pick up and move.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Nice construction. Wish they made it in three sizes for various sizes of purses. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  Purchased a second one for a gift.  Recipient also loved this product which is very difficult to find locally.  Delivery time was great.</li>
            <li> The lining in my purse ripped out and I needed an insert, and this fit the bill very well. MUCH easier for me to find stuff. It has quite a few pocktses, plus a zippered compartment along one side, and some pockets outside for pads of paper and whatnot. I thought the price was fair, and it was exactly what I needed, and it has held up well so far.</li>
            <li> Really nice organizer for the price!  Good size!  Be sure to measure your average handbags!</li>
            <li> great for a large tote bag so everything doesn&#x27;t get lost.  just lift it out to change purses.  like that it is expanable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted my purse to be organized but never knew how to do it without a bunch of separate plastic zip lock bags - so this got 5 stars because of organization.  This is so much better!  It even fit into a purse I didn&#x27;t think it would fit into, and in my larger purses, it&#x27;s ok that it isn&#x27;t a perfect fit because I can put other things in between!  Changing purses is so easy now!  I do not know about it&#x27;s durability - I just got it yesterday, but it seems good enough.  I&#x27;m just stoked that my purse is ORGANIZED!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool for keeping the purse organized.  It also makes switching purses a breeze.  Plenty of pockets for all the little things.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to organize my tote bag! No more endless searches for lost items in the abyss of my bag!</li>
            <li> It fits snugly into her larger bag and gives her easy access to everything.  She says it is the best design she has ever seen</li>
            <li> Thank you what a great idea. It is perfect for my large bag. Everything is together &amp; easy to find</li>
            <li> Love this in my purse. It is a large purse and I could never find anything. Now it is easy to find everything. Lots of pockets and even expands larger with gussets on the sides. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have not received my item yet. I will be happy to post another review once I have the item.</li>
            <li> I got this very promptly, and was amaze at the quality. Fits my MUNDI big fat wallet, my makeup bag, glasses case, phone, etc. My boyfriend even said that it was nice and very handy. No more searching and going crazy looking for things in my purse, now everything i need i can find in 2 seconds flat. Love the large zipper compartment inside and the pockets to hold whatever i need. This even came with a free smartphone pen which i thought was awesome. I REALLY enjoyed the fact that this has zippers on that side that expand to let you use more space, this is way way better than other purse organizers that ive tried and the quality literally lasted a month before breaking. I can tell this is very well made and overall i am beyond thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Makes keeping all your purse necessities within easy reach.  Adjustable sizing will make it fit many of your favorite bags.</li>
            <li> What a great organizer. Buy this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I can find everything in my big bag right away and it transfers all my junk in one movement.</li>
            <li> I love it! Since I bought it I have my purse is really organized. My problema con las carteras es que nunca podia encontrar mi cellphone, las llaves , y los labiales, eran tres cosas que pasaba minutos y minutos buscando dentro de mi cartera.  Ahora  con este organizer puedo encontrar muy facilmente y muy rapido cualquier cosa que busco. Puedo cambiar de cartera muy rapido, solo sacando el organizador de cartera a cartera.  Me necanta! no lo dejo mas!</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d gotten one of these years ago. The 2 slim little handle straps make it very easy to pull in and out yet they lay flat along the sides and stay out of your way. There are more pockets than I even need. This would make a nice little gift for anyone who likes to often change purses depending on their outfits!</li>
            <li> I was able to fit this in my purse and everything is organized so well.  I have more than enough room.</li>
            <li> THIS POUCH HAS LOADS OF ROOM AND LOTS OF POCKETS. HOLDS EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> Nice bag organizer, lining seems to be made of a more inexpensive nylon, so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last. It fits in my purse nicely, but I guess I tend to carry around more smaller things and would like smaller (or narrower) pockets. The pockets on this organizer are large, so things kind of flop around, even my smart phone (screen size is 5&amp;#34;) seems to flop over and keep the pocket it sits in open, so I still have to &#x27;dig around&#x27; to access the other things inside the organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would work well in a larger tote or hobo style bag, or for someone who carries larger items around in their bag. I switched back to using a smaller bag organizer (Pouchee). I think I will use this organizer in a bag to hold my toiletry items when I travel.</li>
            <li> Although all the components of this item are exactly as expected, the quality and workmanship of the inside pockets are questionable.&lt;br /&gt;One worries how long this product will last before seams come undone and it begins to rip from daily use.</li>
            <li> As of 9/25/14 I am still using this in whatever purse I am using and it is still in great shape. Does what advertised, keeps everything organized and in one place.</li>
            <li> just can&#x27;t find the key attacher</li>
            <li> I first saw these totes on home shopping in another brand, and was pleased to find this a lot cheaper on Amazon and many kinds of various prices, sizes and quality.  Pros:  A nice number of compartments and overall size.  Great &amp;#34;light-colored interior so you can actually see what&#x27;s in the purse. I am impressed with the excellent material and construction.  It is holding up well and can be easily cleaned if needed.  I don&#x27;t care for the silky interiors used in some I looked at.  Handles work well to pull in and out to switch purses and that&#x27;s one of the points of it.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It does add weight to the purse which may be an issue for some.  It&#x27;s not a huge deal for me, but lighter would be better.  Measure your purses before buying.  Length is critical.  I bought two of these for daughters, and it was just a little too big for one of them to use in her everyday purse.  It fits most of mine.  Overall very pleased and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This worked differently than I expected, although it was very well-made and pretty.  I must need a different purse, I think.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend for Christmas as she wanted a way to organize her purse and move stuff between them (exactly what this was made for). The first bag came on time but had a broken snap and a zipper that didn&#x27;t work correctly. Emailed customer service and sent them a picture. They sent another bag without hesitation and didn&#x27;t even ask to return the first one.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for what I needed.  Now I don&#x27;t have to dig deep into the purse.  Everything is is right there when I need it, not in the corners of the purse.</li>
            <li> I love this purse organizer. I don&#x27;t know what I dd before I had this organizer.  PRO:  - light colored interior makes items very visible and easy to find  - lightweight organizer doesn&#x27;t make the purse heavy  - lots of nicely sized, gusseted pockets  - interior pockets are great on this organizer (vs exterior pockets that would be smushed against the purse)  - it stands up by itself - won&#x27;t slouch inside the purse and &amp;#34;hide&amp;#34; all your organization  CON:  - the strip &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; riveted &amp; stitched to the interior edge of the organizer - 2 of the 4 rivets fell off when I received the organizer (I still gave the organizer 5 stars - this doesn&#x27;t affect my usage of the organizer.)  FINAL: I love this organizer.  The quality is comparable to the price. This item is better than I expected for the price, and I want to buy another one for my mom.  UPDATE: 06/15/15  I have used this item for 2+ years. I am very pleased the organizer has lasted this long.</li>
            <li> I got this organizer for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.  She can simply lift the organizer out to change purses and go.  We ended up ordering a second one for a relative.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Miche Prima bag because I didn&#x27;t like the one they sold.  Theirs is a little smaller &amp; too many credit card pockets on the side that I wouldn&#x27;t use.  This one is PERFECT.  Now everything in my purse has a place!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. I love this organizer and even throw it into my carry on bag when I travel. Its perfect for my day-to-day purses and for my larger travel or spa bags because I can put larger items in and still keep my smaller items organized. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes to stay organized.</li>
            <li> This came fast and was everything that was described. I like it because it can fit different sized bags. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The organizer came as described and even arrived faster than I thought it would. My mother loves it because she switches purses so much and this makes it easier for her</li>
            <li> I like my bag to be highly organized but often feel restricted in my style choices because I needed several partitions.  No more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve looked at some others and purchased another one, but this one is the very best.  I appreciate the size, flexibility and number of partitions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has stood up to pretty serious use.  It does show some wear already after 3 months, or I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, so far, I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I can now switch purses very fast and easily.  This has more pockets than anything else I&#x27;ve seen.  Very very useful.</li>
            <li> The purse organizer arrived in 9 days (if you include weekend days); so much for 2-6 days, but I digress.  I only mention this since you may not get the item as soon as advertised.  As for the interior, non-elastisized pockets, they seem a bit floppy.  It&#x27;s easy to miss the pocket(s) if you are not using two hands to do so. As for the internal elastisized pockets, I use them for my two sets of glasses (in hard cases).  It&#x27;s a bit easier to slide them in each pocket, BUT, I believe that it should have been taller.  When I put my glasses case into one of those pockets, half of the case is exposed leaving it to the possibility of slipping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the outer pockets much since the organizer (un-expanded) JUST fits in my Mossimo crossbody handbag.  Because the Mossimo is made of soft leathery material, it needs this kind of organizer.  Even so, the handbag can tip over, contents spilling out if placed a tad precariously. When that happens, anything that is in the floppy pockets falls out.  If you ask me, the material needs elastic too.  The best thing about it may be the price; I&#x27;m just not sure that if I buy something that costs more than my two handbags put together, it would also BE better than this.  It&#x27;ll work for now since I don&#x27;t want to spend more than Jackson to get it.</li>
            <li> The tote has made switching purses so much easier.  There are plenty of interior pockets that allow me to keep everything organized.  I used to find myself avoiding changing purses or trying to figure out where to put things when traveling.  I now can pull the tote right out of my purse and put it in my carryon bag.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Loved it at first. Made it so easy to change purses but it soon started to fall apart. Just not made very well.</li>
            <li> This was the answer to my purse problems! It sits upright, doesn&#x27;t spill, it&#x27;s large and holds all of my crap in my large leather tote purse. I will order more for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Couldnt ask for more. such an easy tool to organize our handbags. Loving it more than 2 yrs now, so nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size for my coach purse.  It makes switching out purses fast and easy!  I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I like this! It does make my handbag heavier, but I&#x27;m adding to it so obviously that&#x27;s gonna happen. Mine had no odor that some others&#x27; did.  I&#x27;m using it in a Coach tote (Madison) and it does exactly what I wanted this for - it adds structure to the bag so when I place it down, it doesn&#x27;t puddle into a heap. I can also find and remove my wallet (or whatever) so much quicker, and then put it back faster too (the structure again helps with that).  Really a nice product and way way cheaper than what I almost ordered on Etsy. Can&#x27;t wait to use it with my summer bag also.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect, love  extra pockets but it needs more stiff side supports in order to keep it from collapsing inward.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time.  Left out of one purse and plop down in another. I may not put everything in it, but it helps considerably with overall organization. I really like the little handles you use to lefit it out -- very handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for a few years and it is very handy. The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get five stars is that it was expensive when I bought it (way more than it is now), and it has not lasted well. The inner zip is broken, the outer zips that close it up to slimline, and the elastic sections inside are very tired. If it cannot hold its shape it then it becomes too floppy to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, a little over ten bucks I&#x27;m OK with ordering another. In an ideal world I&#x27;d buy this sort of item once and it would last.</li>
            <li> This purse tote is wonderful.  Change your bag in a second and stay totally organized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at the difference this thing made.  Most purses have a couple little pockets inside, but this organizes everything in the Bermuda Triangle middle area.  It has so many places to put things, I actually have more stuff in my purse than usual and still have a few empty pockets!  My purse is so much more functional, and is STAYING orderly without constant reorganizing.  I haven&#x27;t changed purses since buying this, but I can see it&#x27;s going to be an easy transition: just move the organizer from one purse to the next.  I love that this frees me up to buy those cute bags that have *nothing* inside, and I know I&#x27;ll still be just as organized.</li>
            <li> These purse organizers are great.  I have a couple of smaller organizer&#x27;s that work well in my small bags but I was looking for something a little bigger.  After reading the reviews I decided to go with the Britney Black and Grey Purse Organizer.  What I like about this bag is the fact that it&#x27;s expandable. It has 2 spacious outside pockets, 6 large pockets and a zippered compartment on the inside. This bag will accommodate a medium or large handbag, plus it is quite sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the bag in two days the seller also sent me a solar powered flashlight that attaches to your key ring as a complimentary gift. The packaging was great which makes it very suitable if you wanted to give this item as a gift to someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I wish this bag had was a key strap to hook your keys on. What I did was attached a key loop to the handle to hang my keys on.  Overall I would recommend this product and plan to purchase additional bags to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> If you have a large handbag you will love this organizer. Has many pockets on the inside and out as well as a zipper pocket. I love the way it expands out.</li>
            <li> I was starting to hate my purse - it was not that big, had two nice size pockets separated by a zippered pocket, but no matter where I thought I \\&quot;placed\\&quot; my phone, whenever it would ring I would struggle to get my hands on it.  It was like Hermione&#x27;s bag (from Harry Potter) - endlessly deep - however Hermione found whatever she needed immediately.  My phone, or glasses, or whatever I needed, would disappear into a black hole until I finally would upend the purse and it would spill out.  This organizer is wonderful - has a place for everything.  Now I need a new purse to put it in, but that will be the easy part.  I will just drop this organizer in and whatever I need will be right there, in view.  There are cheaper alternatives, but this one is worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> This thing fits all of my things, and I can see everything in my unstructured hobo bag.  No more digging through my purse again!  When I opened it, it looked really thin, but there are snaps and zippers to expand it out so that it can be very wide too.  I am so glad I found this organizer!</li>
            <li> I use this in a large business tote with a flat bottom. I love looking in and instantly seeing everything! It holds makeup, phone, eyeglasses, pens, tissues, mints,small brush, wallet and keys, and I can put larger items like calendar or laptop, next to it. I have a somewhat firm-sided tote because I hate sticking my hand in and getting it scratched by a zipper, or having to push the sides apart while I dig for things). This Organizer is firm enough to stand up nicely in the tote, and is very lightweight. It holds so much I haven&#x27;t used the extra space by unzipping the ends. Someone recommended the light colored interior and they were *so* right, it is easier to see everything in the organizer despite sitting low in my big tote. It is somewhat flexible and would easily squish into a regular purse (read the dimensions of course). I have knocked my tote over sideways on the car seat and the open top is not a disaster, plus the elastized pockets on each end hold things more firmly. Two problems: the zippered expansions are made of light grey fabric which had become a little stained from being folded into the black material when packaged. And I thought the handles might stretch and pulled one end out of the fastener. I think the design is good: the handles are low and don&#x27;t get in the way but are useful for pulling the organizer out. A little stretch in the handles would have been better, and prettier colors. Love this thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great organizer with adequate space for everything. The extra pockets meant a separate cosmetic bag was unnecessary. My handbag stays cleaner and doesn&#x27;t sag (from my stuff settling or sliding to one corner).  Good value for a fair price!</li>
            <li> I really like this bag/organizer! It has lots of space and pockets! It fits most of my bags and the light color of the inside makes it easy to locate items! I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is a very useful item and at a very reasonable price.  I highly recommend it to all women! :-)</li>
            <li> I liked it but it was hust too big for my bag.  When I get a different bag I will use it that one</li>
            <li> I use this insert organizer in several purses. It is especially helpful in slouchy hobo ( my favorite ) style handbags. Things can get trapped on the sides or under the organizer. Otherwise it is a big help in locating things.</li>
            <li> Great idea!  I wish I would have bought one a long time ago.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves purses.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to put this in my handbag. Everything always ends up on the bottom and takes a while to find. This should make life a bit easier from now on and goes from one bag to another with ease.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the quality of this product.  It arrived damaged. It had loose threading throughout. There was an area where the zipper was not completely sewn on. Once zipped, there was a portion of the zipper that would come apart. The handle was broken as well.  The bag also had a very strong chemical odor.  I will be sending this back. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product because it is poorly made.  Read other reviews carefully. Others complained about the same things, yet they were pleased with their purchase.  If you don&#x27;t mind stapling handles and stitching together parts, then this bag is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, holds everything.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can find what i need without looking like an unorganized klutz.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on purse organizers.  I love this purse organizer!  It&#x27;s very well made and sleek.  There are enough pockets.  It fits well in all my bags - they are mostly medium or large bags though.  I have not used the zipper expansion option yet, as I want to control how much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; I carry with me, but it&#x27;s nice to know I could add more if I want.  My favorite part are the handles - They are unobtrusive, but it&#x27;s very easy to grasp them and lift the organizer in and out of my bags.  I would not change a thing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product... at first.  It fits great in almost any purse, big or small. It has a tone of pockets that are a good size. However, through normal use, the stitching in one of the middle pockets has become undone so I can&#x27;t use two of the inside pockets at all. The reason I rate this as 3 stars is because it was a amazing (5 star worthy) at first but now that it&#x27;s fallen apart a little it&#x27;s more like a 2. I&#x27;ll probably invest in a more expense and sturdier version soon.</li>
            <li> very easy to use to switch purses quickly. everything fits in one easy to transfer tote. No more searching through the bottom of my purse for an item.</li>
            <li> I liked this organizer at first, but the problem is the color.  It is too dark in my purse to see where to replace something.  In the end, this is sitting on the shelf and a hard plastic purse organizer is in my purse of a lighter color.  If you are looking for something where you can change purses, I think this organizer would be useful to you.  That is not what I wanted I found, but it may meet your needs.  Well-constructed.</li>
            <li> It is better then I thought!  There is a place for everything, and everything stays in its place.  I have already showed many people and recommended this supplier.  Fast shipping, great quality product.  I will be purchasing more to give as gifts.  I have no issues changing out purses to match outfits, something I use to hate doing.</li>
            <li> I like this because it fits well in my bucket style purse. It helps to keep things contained in it&#x27;s pockets and it allows me find things when I need them.&lt;br /&gt;Good purchase and good price.</li>
            <li> veriable durable  ,  fits right in purse and  love all the pockets  just wish was a LITTLE taller  thanks you</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this. She always used to carry a &amp;#34;hand bag&amp;#34; that looked like she must be a proficient shoplifter, carrying a huge purse.&lt;br /&gt;Now she can carry a smaller bag and still have all her stuff &amp;#34;on board.&amp;#34; Peachy.</li>
            <li> Sleek.  large.  Great handles, easy to remove from one purse to the next.  too large for some of my purses but I prefer my larger purses anyway.  I like the zippered pocket and the other pockets are a good size for my aluma wallet..  Could use a pen sized pocket.</li>
