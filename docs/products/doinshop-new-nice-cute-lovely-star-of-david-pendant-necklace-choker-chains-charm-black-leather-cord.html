            <li> its kind of hard to make it tight around my neck, but i dont really mind.</li>
            <li> I especially like how I can resize it to be a choker or a really long necklace.</li>
            <li> but It is small, the cording has sliders so it is adjustable.</li>
            <li> and I recommend this product, shipping is slow</li>
            <li> If I could give negative stars, I so would !!!!</li>

            <li> How dare you. Take it back right now. This is satan&#x27;s symbol and NOT the Star of David. If I could give negative stars, I so would !!!!</li>
            <li> Not a star of david, but a very nice pentagram necklace.</li>
            <li> This is a pentacle, not a star of David.</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied with product &amp; price</li>
            <li> Very nice necklace and love it so much but shipping took forever and it&#x27;s a Satan sign not star of David just to let you know.but I wanted the Satan one so I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite chokers I&#x27;ve had so far and it&#x27;s not the Star of David because it&#x27;s a 5 pointed star, not 6. (:&lt;br /&gt;I love it personally and I recommend this product, shipping is slow but it&#x27;s still awesome</li>
            <li> It is smaller then i thought but still awesome!</li>
            <li> super cute pentagram necklace. its kind of hard to make it tight around my neck, but i dont really mind.</li>
            <li> Good quality cord and pendant</li>
            <li> really nice quality necklace and great price too</li>
            <li> Star pentacle not Star of David!</li>
            <li> This is a five pointed star and, thus, NOT a Star of David!</li>
            <li> I like its so cute ^-^</li>
            <li> Very nice &amp; love it for what it is but It is small, the cording has sliders so it is adjustable. I would say the price WAS kind of fair. More of a Dollar store $1 item but I paid $2.40 &amp; free shipping from doinshop. I see they has now added $2.00 shipping &amp; handling &amp; that makes this..for me, too much. The star is about the size of my thumbnail &amp; the cording is very light &amp; smooth. NOT braided as shown in image.</li>
