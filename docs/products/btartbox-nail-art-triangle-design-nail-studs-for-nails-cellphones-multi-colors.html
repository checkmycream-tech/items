            <li>I love that these come in gold and silver, and they are the perfect size!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very cute, perfect to fit on your nails, &amp; did I mention a great price?</li>
            <li>Had to separate good from silver</li>
            <li>The quality is good and I would re Purchase from this buyer again.</li>
            <li>It is really good</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s still good for the price</li>
            <li>My Duaghter loved these for her nails.  </li>
            <li>They stayed on a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I didn&#x27;t count them but it does look like a fair amount.&lt;br /&gt;-They&#x27;re durable material.</li>
            <li>So good</li>
            <li>They were very cute.</li>
            <li>Looks great on the nails, cant wait to do more art with them.</li>
            <li>:) lol.</li>
            <li>I used them to do my nails tonight and they look really cute!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love them all!</li>
            <li>this was so cheap and great quality.</li>
            <li>and they look amazing</li>
            <li>then I glued them on and it looks really nice</li>
            <li>These are such a great value, and are the perfect size.</li>
            <li>I got all the pieces and liked that the gold and silver were in separate packages.</li>
            <li>Although they look like they would be good for nail designs they bend way too easily.</li>
            <li>My friends love digging through my nail stuff and these are their favorite!</li>
            <li>( 3 to 5 weeks early is awesome).</li>
            <li>Either way, it&#x27;s worth the great price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the right glue, so they didn&#x27;t stick, but they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>which is definitely fine by me!</li>
            <li>I guess the package presentation bugged me, but all in all I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Oh and did I mention these are so cute.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thinking it was more like 100.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on them.</li>
            <li>so many possibilities</li>
            <li>They were cute and all, but they just wouldn&#x27;t stay on my nail and kept getting stuck on my hair when I would put it in a ponytail.</li>
            <li>I recommend these for cute geometric nail design.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for nails and I have gotten numerous compliments and requests to do my friend&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>but i still love em</li>
            <li>Fantastic price!</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re patient enough to wait for the delivery, then this is perfect!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I love to do my nails</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a tweezer to put them on easily without messing up your polish.</li>
            <li>Came in really early and so so inexpensive worth every sent ( literally) but a wonderful product I&#x27;ve used them already</li>
            <li>They also stay on for a very long time and look very nice!</li>
            <li>Easy to work with...</li>
            <li>They loook super cute when you put them on</li>
            <li>But they were really cheap</li>
            <li>all you need is nail glue or clear polish to stick it onto your nails and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>fun and cheap  love it</li>
            <li>These are really cool, but they come off of your nails really easy because they don&#x27;t lay on tour nails.</li>
            <li>So just use a topcoat over them and put it on kind of thick to make sure they&#x27;re on really good.</li>
            <li>Product idea is awesome, unless you have small finger nails like my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to get these.</li>
            <li>I am excited to leave feedback on each one.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to buy, it is extremely affordable, and it is really easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Very nice but doesn&#x27;t stay on long</li>
            <li>She has slightly smaller nails than most teenagers though :)</li>
            <li>They are so pretty!</li>
            <li>Cute, super cute, really cute, lol came on time and the material is not some cheap little thin thing.</li>
            <li>I got many compliments on them at work.they sayer on for longer than I expected :)</li>
            <li>It would&#x27;ve been nice if they actually separated the gold and silver</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying if you like nail art and have the time.</li>
            <li>Bigger than I expected, but love them!!!</li>
            <li>However, with the right tools/glue, patience, and practice this could be no problem for you.</li>
            <li>Super product 2nd purchase, love these and my nails look great!&lt;br /&gt;No need to have a plan Jane nail use these to jazz up your look.</li>
            <li>They are all true to their colors and separated very well.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to put on and stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li>but first I put on sone nail polish</li>
            <li>There were not 250 total though, I would say 100 at most.</li>
            <li>I got these stud for my nails first of it took forever to get here, but then again I believe they came from Asia</li>
            <li>I used these on my nails for the first time recently &amp; am quite pleased with the quality.  </li>
            <li>Many pieces for a low price!</li>
            <li>I have been able to re-use most of mine at least another two times, then eventually the gold ones start to fade</li>
            <li>I found that when I wanted to change my nail color, with a little pull (thanks to my amazing nail sealant)</li>
            <li>I really wanted these never got them</li>
            <li>but it also wasn&#x27;t very speedy.</li>
            <li>but they come off really quik</li>
            <li>&amp; i can only fit about 3 on my nails.</li>
            <li>Thanks and will buy again.</li>
            <li>Not noticeable really, but they do get caught in my hair, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely buy again given how cheap they are.</li>
            <li>And the quantity of the studs were more than I expected.</li>
            <li>if I received the entire amount mentioned but.. quick service and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>There were even a few more in the bag than what it said.</li>
            <li>I got these a few days before expected and they are pretty nice.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly down on nail.</li>
            <li>The shipping was long but it wasnt like I needed the studs right away.</li>
            <li>but they did travel pretty far on standard shipping.</li>
            <li>but the price is way too low for that to really be a problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-They&#x27;re tricky to use at first if you&#x27;re inexperienced.</li>
            <li>I got my package before expected with a small free gift and my package was very well packed.</li>
            <li>However, I will say that on nails that don&#x27;t have a lot of flat space (ie natural nails with a natural curve) these won&#x27;t bend to shape.</li>
            <li>I have long natural nails</li>

            <li> However, I will say that on nails that don&#x27;t have a lot of flat space (ie natural nails with a natural curve) these won&#x27;t bend to shape.</li>
            <li> I have long natural nails</li>
            <li> and they just don&#x27;t sit flat and aren&#x27;t flexible.</li>
            <li> 2) they don&#x27;t lay flat and get snagged and pulled</li>
            <li> If you put it on the center of the nail, for example, it isn&#x27;t going to lay flat and the sides will actually stick off the nail.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a long wait for these</li>
            <li> but that became very tedious, but there &#x27;appears&#x27; to be more gold than silver (I wont say there is since I didn&#x27;t count all the silver) but there are definitely 200</li>
            <li> A little hard to use this item for nail art since it does not always stick on the first time.</li>
            <li> They do stick up a little on the sides though since fingernails are not completely flat.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;d be near impossible to get it in just the right spots and</li>
            <li> the triangles come off and seem unscathed from the daily wear and tear (which I had on for a little over 2 weeks).</li>
            <li> Wish they were a little smaller</li>
            <li> When it arrived I thought it was empty</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t mind it only took a few minutes.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered them on 0ctober 16th &amp; they arrived November 1st , when it was expected to be here between November 12th &amp; 28th</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected and not sure</li>
            <li> My only little issue is they arrive in a little plastic baggie.</li>
            <li> I have small short nails.</li>
            <li> usually i would play close to $8 at the local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li> I only got one or two small bags.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really wanted these never got them</li>
            <li> They were very cute. I got many compliments on them at work.they sayer on for longer than I expected :)</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised. I love the item and it was at a very great price. Great to add character&lt;br /&gt;to your nails.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the right glue, so they didn&#x27;t stick, but they&#x27;re great. They came when they were supposed to, and I use the gold ones to make a triforce symbol on my nails. So they definitely serve their purpose. They&#x27;re very nice.</li>
            <li> Came in really early and so so inexpensive worth every sent ( literally) but a wonderful product I&#x27;ve used them already and they make my nails look fantastic !!!</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected, but love them!!! Looks great on the nails, cant wait to do more art with them.</li>
            <li> Got them wayyyyy before the estimated delivery and they are great. I already have them on my nails. There were even a few more in the bag than what it said.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a long wait for these but it also wasn&#x27;t very speedy. When it arrived I thought it was empty (lol) but it was just in a big package, wrapped in a lot of bubble wrap. I didn&#x27;t take time out to count all of the pieces but tit looks like there are 250 pieces or around that amount. It would&#x27;ve been nice if they actually separated the gold and silver but the price is way too low for that to really be a problem.</li>
            <li> I received the items and they are great. Great product, arrived on time (maybe even before time as I didn&#x27;t keep track). My only little issue is they arrive in a little plastic baggie. Not great for storage. I don&#x27;t know how I thought they would arrive. It looked like there weren&#x27;t enough there, but I counted them and there is 250 pieces. I guess the package presentation bugged me, but all in all I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> These are really cool, but they come off of your nails really easy because they don&#x27;t lay on tour nails. They stick up on the sides. They are so pretty!</li>
            <li> Just as pictured! Had to separate good from silver but I didn&#x27;t mind it only took a few minutes. The quality is good and I would re Purchase from this buyer again. There definitely was at least 250 pieces.</li>
            <li> Super product 2nd purchase, love these and my nails look great!&lt;br /&gt;No need to have a plan Jane nail use these to jazz up your look.</li>
            <li> They loook super cute when you put them on but they come off really quik they will last half a day :( well I put them on on my regular nail but first I put on sone nail polish then I glued them on and it looks really nice but they come offf</li>
            <li> I got my package before expected with a small free gift and my package was very well packed. It is really good</li>
            <li> These are such a great value, and are the perfect size. They also stay on for a very long time and look very nice!</li>
            <li> Cute, super cute, really cute, lol came on time and the material is not some cheap little thin thing. Oh and did I mention these are so cute.</li>
            <li> I got these a few days before expected and they are pretty nice. They came in an envelope with two little bags of studs, one bag of each color. There were not 250 total though, I would say 100 at most. But they were really cheap so that&#x27;s alright! I used them to do my nails tonight and they look really cute! They do stick up a little on the sides though since fingernails are not completely flat. So just use a topcoat over them and put it on kind of thick to make sure they&#x27;re on really good. I like these a lot!</li>
            <li> I like these. But there kinda big. I have small short nails. &amp; i can only fit about 3 on my nails.</li>
            <li> it came earlier than it said it&#x27;d be here. it says it comes with 250 but I&#x27;m thinking it was more like 100. but that&#x27;s still good for the price</li>
            <li> These were just what I had pictured them to be. Easy to work with...all you need is nail glue or clear polish to stick it onto your nails and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> These triangle metal studs are a great addition to my collection! I have gotten so many compliments on them. My friends love digging through my nail stuff and these are their favorite! They are very easy to put on and stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected and not sure if I received the entire amount mentioned but.. quick service and inexpensive. Thanks and will buy again.</li>
            <li> great items.  look beautiful when applied</li>
            <li> fun and cheap  love it so many possibilities</li>
            <li> Too big for nails. I have long natural nails and they just don&#x27;t sit flat and aren&#x27;t flexible. Shame.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly down on nail. worst thing i ever bought</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, very happy buyer! (:</li>
            <li> actually, I got these for my husband to go on his 40k miniatures, not my fingernails.  lol  But, he says they work great.</li>
            <li> I got these stud for my nails first of it took forever to get here, but then again I believe they came from Asia so it&#x27;s expected. They were cute and all, but they just wouldn&#x27;t stay on my nail and kept getting stuck on my hair when I would put it in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> I used these on my nails for the first time recently &amp; am quite pleased with the quality.  I recommend these for cute geometric nail design.</li>
            <li> My Duaghter loved these for her nails.  They stayed on a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Product idea is awesome, unless you have small finger nails like my daughter.  That was the only problem we had with the product.  She has slightly smaller nails than most teenagers though :)</li>
            <li> I love these! They are perfect for nails and I have gotten numerous compliments and requests to do my friend&#x27;s nails. I found that when I wanted to change my nail color, with a little pull (thanks to my amazing nail sealant) the triangles come off and seem unscathed from the daily wear and tear (which I had on for a little over 2 weeks). I have been able to re-use most of mine at least another two times, then eventually the gold ones start to fade (so I&#x27;m ending up with all silver)....which is definitely fine by me!</li>
            <li> A little hard to use this item for nail art since it does not always stick on the first time.</li>
            <li> Really Jazzed up my nails but are difficult to place.  Wish they were a little smaller but i still love em</li>
            <li> I got these a few months ago and I&#x27;ve only used them a couple of times but I do like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I didn&#x27;t count them but it does look like a fair amount.&lt;br /&gt;-They&#x27;re durable material. They hold up. I tried bending with no luck. However, I will say that on nails that don&#x27;t have a lot of flat space (ie natural nails with a natural curve) these won&#x27;t bend to shape. If you put it on the center of the nail, for example, it isn&#x27;t going to lay flat and the sides will actually stick off the nail. Not noticeable really, but they do get caught in my hair, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-They&#x27;re tricky to use at first if you&#x27;re inexperienced. I use tweezers to pick up a stud by the edge and drop a tad of nail glue into the underside. I then stick it on my nail. This is a bit difficult because sometimes they stick to the tweezers or I don&#x27;t get them to drop/lay how I&#x27;d like. However, with the right tools/glue, patience, and practice this could be no problem for you. You will need those three things.&lt;br /&gt;-I also bought stars and they work just as nice.&lt;br /&gt;-I only use these for a day or two at a time because 1) I think even if I got stronger glue it&#x27;d be near impossible to get it in just the right spots and 2) they don&#x27;t lay flat and get snagged and pulled off.&lt;br /&gt;-They took a bit to get here but they did travel pretty far on standard shipping. Maybe a month? It&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;-Great price! I&#x27;d definitely buy again given how cheap they are. I can stand for them to fall off after a couple days cause it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m selling an arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all:&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re tricky but doable. Definitely worth buying if you like nail art and have the time. Fantastic price!</li>
            <li> i LOVE this product!! usually i would play close to $8 at the local beauty supply store. this was so cheap and great quality. if you&#x27;re patient enough to wait for the delivery, then this is perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to buy, it is extremely affordable, and it is really easy to work with. Awesome!</li>
            <li> #1. They look just like the advertized picture. #2. I ordered them on 0ctober 16th &amp; they arrived November 1st , when it was expected to be here between November 12th &amp; 28th ( 3 to 5 weeks early is awesome). #3. I tried to count them all but that became very tedious, but there &#x27;appears&#x27; to be more gold than silver (I wont say there is since I didn&#x27;t count all the silver) but there are definitely 200+ I&#x27;m sure. Either way, it&#x27;s worth the great price. They&#x27;re very cute, perfect to fit on your nails, &amp; did I mention a great price? :) lol.</li>
            <li> I was sent stars not triangles............ Boooo.... that was not what I ordered.... Geez..... what a waste of my money....</li>
            <li> Just receiced these on Wednesday, I simply love them, they&#x27;re the perfect size. I got all the pieces and liked that the gold and silver were in separate packages.</li>
            <li> Many pieces for a low price! The shipping was long but it wasnt like I needed the studs right away. Great price for a nice addition to my nail art collection!</li>
            <li> I love to do my nails and I&#x27;ve been dying to get studs to use when I do manicures, I was never able to find any anywhere. I love that these come in gold and silver, and they are the perfect size! Not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li> Very nice but doesn&#x27;t stay on long but I still like them. So good yupp and I would recommend theis</li>
            <li> I only got one or two small bags. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I think I will like them. They arrived on time which is a plus.</li>
            <li> had a great amount of studs. looks like over 250 pieces. just decorated a set of nails with these and they look amazing</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get these. They are all true to their colors and separated very well. And the quantity of the studs were more than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather small but it&#x27;s okay. I will be buying again from this person. Probably gonna use  it for embellishing my cell phone covers.</li>
            <li> Love it! Can&#x27;t wait to use for my nail art designs!</li>
            <li> Although they look like they would be good for nail designs they bend way too easily. They only last a  couple days before they bend and fall off</li>
            <li> So this is my third review on a similar product from this seller. I am excited to leave feedback on each one. Along with these I bought the star and square shapes. I love them all! They are not too big and not too small. Just make sure you use a tweezer to put them on easily without messing up your polish.</li>
