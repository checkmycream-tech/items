            <li>I love what it does to my hair..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad Amazon sent me some free samples of these products.</li>

            <li>I always use gels and hairspray and when I wish it out my hair feels really clean.</li>

            <li>Makes your hair very shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>My Pureology products are awesome but definitely much more expensive than the Sebastian line.</li>
            <li>Love it makes you hair so soft</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it if your hair is anything like mine.</li>
            <li>Wanted more body and control for my 60+ year old shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very light blonde highlights</li>
            <li>I have chemically treated hair that is very light blonde</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Yes the conditioner is thick but just make sure the spout is lined up correctly and it flows just fine when you squeeze!</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic and makes my normally frizzy hair soft and straight.  </li>
            <li>It moisturized my hair very well.</li>

            <li>Switched to Sebastian Drench after using Sebastian Light for several years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to shampoo and conditioner, but this brand really worked well for me.</li>

            <li>My hair was easy to comb after washing and was very soft when dry.</li>
            <li>Dried out my hair very cheap stuff</li>

            <li>I used it a few years ago and enjoyed the fragrance and the way it made my hair manageable and shiny, so I thought I would try it again.</li>
            <li>Ive tried many different shampoos and after a while my hair starts to feel dry.</li>
            <li>I normally have super dry hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s naturally curly and often frizzy and unmanagable at times, I started using Sebastian products and immediately saw a change!</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s really hard for me to style it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I usually have my hair in a bun or down with my natural curls, but it gets so boring</li>
            <li> but the conditioner is nearly impossible to squeeze out of the rigid bottle once you&#x27;ve used up even just a little.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I do love this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get dried out looking when I use it.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I never thought I would actually like an expensive brand for shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I used to go with cheap brands but I&#x27;m glad Amazon sent me some free samples of these products. I&#x27;m not using anything else now.</li>
            <li> I like the person that makes this product but this one was not that great, it smells good but does not leave your hair that soft!</li>
            <li> I was told that this shampoo would help my hair not feel so dry.  I thought I would give it a try.  I was greatful that Amazon.com had it.  I personally thought it worked just as well as any other brand name shampoo at the grocery store but was triple the price.&lt;br /&gt;My opinion....save your money.</li>
            <li> I normally have super dry hair and it&#x27;s really hard for me to style it. I usually have my hair in a bun or down with my natural curls, but it gets so boring and I want to straighten it, but it never looks good straight because it&#x27;s so brittle and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one use my hair was easy, breezy, and beautiful. I could do things to my hair that I couldn&#x27;t before. It moisturized my hair very well. I am very please with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would hands down recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored every 6 weeks, so I am always searching for a moisturizing shampoo.  These two products work beautifully together!</li>
            <li> Product itself works well but the conditioner is nearly impossible to squeeze out of the rigid bottle once you&#x27;ve used up even just a little.  You need the strength of Hercules just to squeeze some product into your hand or hair!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair really soft and clean feeling in the shower but unfortunately made my hair feel and look like a grease pit when dry. I have very light blonde highlights but this seemed to over condition my brown highlights causing weight and a greasy look.</li>
            <li> best ever. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic and makes my normally frizzy hair soft and straight.  Best shampoo &amp; conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These products are great! Makes hair soft. I love the scent too! Great for curly or straight hair. Helps me to use less product in my hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I have dry very curly hair that feels like straw a day after washing it.  Drench makes my hair very soft, i really am not used to the softness. yet.  I love this product and plan on buying it again.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look and feel healthy, my only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t lather up as nice as I&#x27;m used to and I have to use more to get it to spread through all my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using drug store shampoo and conditioners for years. At a recent haircut appointment, the staff used Sebastian Drench products and I was incredibly impressed with the smoothness and lightness of my hair. I bought these products online for ongoing use, hoping that my luck wasn&#x27;t just a product of my great hairstylist and it wasn&#x27;t! This product is fantastic. I would note that repeated use causes build-up on my hair, but it&#x27;s been great as a 2x a week refresh to my hair.</li>
            <li> For years and years I suffered through horrible, fuzzy hair. I hated my hair my entire life. Until I started using this product. Now my hair is 90% less frizzy and soft enough to run my fingers through it. This is the only product I will use for the rest of my life! And the Amazon price is half of what my local salon charges for it!</li>
            <li> I purchased at the recommendation of my hairdresser.  I have color-treated hair and some very unruly grays that can be hard to style.  I need to use longer to determine whether I see any change/benefits with this line.  My Pureology products are awesome but definitely much more expensive than the Sebastian line.</li>
            <li> love this brand was excatly what i wanted</li>
            <li> I love this product, noticeable difference</li>
            <li> Love it makes you hair so soft</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Great for color-treated hair. My hair is fine and gets dry in the winter months. This shampoo/conditioner from Sebastian is wonderful at protecting and revitalizing while it keeps my hair light and voluminous.</li>
            <li> good price for a good product</li>
            <li> Nice product and shipping!</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and not every product works for me. This does.</li>
            <li> The only thing that got &amp;#34;drenched&amp;#34; was the shower drain. I was left with rough, straw-like hair and an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this product actually made my hair worse. Sadly, this is a highly recommended brand but my hair felt like straw and I saw more breakage after using it for a few weeks. I am going back to my store brand…disappointed.</li>
            <li> 1/2 the price of my salon!  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> These products are awesome for both my husband&#x27;s  and my hair, leaving the hair soft and easy to manage. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works great,  smells great, good price!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very fine hair.This winter I started having an irritating amount of static and started looking for something that might help. I remembered this shampoo. I used it a few years ago and enjoyed the fragrance and the way it made my hair manageable and shiny, so I thought I would try it again. It is helping.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many different shampoos and after a while my hair starts to feel dry. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and my hair feels great!  I always use gels and hairspray and when I wish it out my hair feels really clean.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. I wish it weren&#x27;t so pricey but it&#x27;s worth it if your hair is anything like mine.</li>
            <li> Really great product! Makes your hair very shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping! Thank you. This product didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; me, but I have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it works so good on my dry and damaged hair, and I love the smell</li>
            <li> Switched to Sebastian Drench after using Sebastian Light for several years.  Wanted more body and control for my 60+ year old shoulder length hair.  I don&#x27;t color it but do swim and play tennis 5 days a week.  I find I can now go four days between washing and my hair remains soft and not at all greasy or stringy.  Yes the conditioner is thick but just make sure the spout is lined up correctly and it flows just fine when you squeeze!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to shampoo and conditioner, but this brand really worked well for me. I have thick, wavy hair. My hair was easy to comb after washing and was very soft when dry.</li>

I love what it does to my hair.. And it smells so great and last through out the day. This has made my hair strengthen and bring out my color. Definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Shipped super quick and I absolutely love it! Leaves my hair feeling clean and not weighty.</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair very cheap stuff</li>
            <li> Used this shampoo for years</li>
            <li> This product is awesome I have been using it for months now. It has made my hair shiny and less frizzy way better to handle. It smells awesome! I just ordered the sebastian volumpt to get some more body and volume!</li>
