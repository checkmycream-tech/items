            <li>Great price!</li>

            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I just gargled with warm salty water and/or diluted warm hydrogen peroxide for about 5 minutes twice a day to loosen the stones while I waited for the syringes to come in the mail.</li>
            <li>and i am sure would be good for whatever else they are used for.</li>

            <li>Easy to use for tooth cleansing oral pick.</li>
            <li>Using the oral syringe to raise my mouth after menus is easy to use and convenient.</li>
            <li>The bulb syringe is only good for a turkey baster.the bathroom sink, run some body temperature water into the sink basin, plug the sink, use the tap to fill a syringe with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Yummy.&lt;br /&gt;The syringe plungers glide smoothly in the chamber and seem to hold up well after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I had amazing results immediately for a good three months - my mouth felt clean, healthy, and back to normal again.  </li>

            <li>end of my review unless you want to know how to clean your ear</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, these syringes are a great deal because a nearby dentist&#x27;s office wanted $30 for ONE of these that they give patients after wisdom teeth extraction to wash out the empty tooth socket.</li>
            <li>I imagine that this holds true for their intended purpose as well.</li>

            <li>Make sure you stick the tip in the tonsil crypts at as many different angles as you can and squirting the cap outta them.</li>
            <li>But they are super</li>
            <li>will want to disassemble and hand-wash these after each use with a mild soap and rinse</li>
            <li>Much cheaper and more effective than the special devices they sell for the same job.</li>
            <li>, if it was not for that broken syringe I would have been very very happy.</li>
            <li>I squirted some water right into one of my crypts and alllllll kinds of stuff came flowing right out.</li>
            <li>It came right away</li>

            <li>Fast shipping!</li>

            <li>: If you plug your sink you can see how much wax is removed during this process.&lt;br /&gt;Step 7:</li>
            <li>3: After a few minutes walk with your head tilted to the bathroom sink, run some body temperature water into the sink basin, plug the sink, use the tap to fill a syringe with warm water.  </li>
            <li>I am sure they work like a charm for other things</li>
            <li>If feeding one larger canary, budgie or parrotlet, one syringe full is all you need for a feeding.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>They clear out the tonsile stones very well.</li>
            <li>Then another 3 came out and few more.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it really worked a lot better than q tip.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it overall.</li>
            <li>Tonsil Stones came right back to my tonsil.</li>
            <li>Tea oil eventually degrades the rubber on the plunger, so every six months a new one is needed.  </li>
            <li>These really help to clean out the little holes in my tonsils and get what my bobby pins can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>These are exactly the same the oral surgeon office gives you.</li>
            <li>The first occasion on which I used them, I had stones come out after several syringe-fuls.</li>
            <li>Five minutes with this and dozens of tiny stones and a few large ones were easily flushed out.  </li>
            <li>Once you can hear better and see a bunch of little (or big) wax fragments in the sink you will be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Once you can hear better and see a bunch of little (or big) wax fragments in the sink you will be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>If you break through the wax you will know because your ear drum will be sensitive to the water stream and it will get loud.  </li>
            <li>If you break through the wax you will know because your ear drum will be sensitive to the water stream and it will get loud.  </li>
            <li>These were also useful when I had wisdom teeth removed and could not really brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>They will last a very long time if you rinse with super hot water after each use, and separate the two parts to dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li>but I buy these because they keep me from visiting a doctor every few weeks to clean my ears out.</li>
            <li>It hold enough food so that one syringe full will feed several younger, tiny birds.</li>
            <li>in water for 5 minutes can potentially deform syringes (not likely) but much quicker.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and product is what I expected.</li>
            <li>I love these Syringe but one was receive broken</li>

            <li> Then another 3 came out and few more.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it really worked a lot better than q tip.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it overall.</li>
            <li> Tonsil Stones came right back to my tonsil.</li>
            <li> Tea oil eventually degrades the rubber on the plunger, so every six months a new one is needed.  </li>
            <li> These really help to clean out the little holes in my tonsils and get what my bobby pins can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> These are exactly the same the oral surgeon office gives you.</li>
            <li> The first occasion on which I used them, I had stones come out after several syringe-fuls.</li>
            <li> Five minutes with this and dozens of tiny stones and a few large ones were easily flushed out.  </li>
            <li> Once you can hear better and see a bunch of little (or big) wax fragments in the sink you will be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>

            <li> but I buy these because they keep me from visiting a doctor every few weeks to clean my ears out.</li>

            <li> then I highly suggest you make an appointment with your nearest doctor and have him or her give you the royal &#x27;ear wax removal&#x27; treatment.&lt;br /&gt;How about sticking a hard vacuum tube in your ear, rubbing the insides of your head raw while simultaneously damaging your eardrum due to the 1000 decibel sound from the ear wax vacuum cleaner?  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I cannot love syringes but these are great. Shipped quick and discreet.</li>
            <li> So far have had zero luck getting the tonsil stones from deep in throat out :( Any tips are happily appreciated. I find there is no power in the water being pushed out. I might be better off with a water pik. Ugh...</li>
            <li> I bought these to help help keep between my teeth clean and my gums healthy. They&#x27;re just like the one I got from my dentist a decade ago.</li>
            <li> I ride road bicycles, and on some of the county roads around me there are lots of goatheads. There are times during the season where I run Stans (or some similar latex sealant) in my inner tubes. These tubes have removable cores, and are very small. Trying to inject sealant into the tube has always been a pain (and a mess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try these syringes and they work great! I remove the core of the presta valve, suck some sealant up in the syringe, and then squirt it into the tube. I can get exactly the right amount in there without spilling a drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a traditional use, I realize, but they do work great in this application.</li>
            <li> I have used these syringes for years to feel small baby birds. I have used them with canaries, budgies and parrotlets. The curved tip can be snipped to allow more food to flow. It hold enough food so that one syringe full will feed several younger, tiny birds. If feeding one larger canary, budgie or parrotlet, one syringe full is all you need for a feeding. I love them!</li>
            <li> I use these to squirt colored soap into tiny detailed molds. works great and for my purposes, reusable.</li>
            <li> These are amazing. They clear out the tonsile stones very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in lieu of an expensive water pik and it works just as well and is also convenient, as I can stick it in my purse on the go.</li>
            <li> I use these for flushing out or injecting paste, glue, wood filler, paint, joint compound, etc. into places I cannot otherwise access.  I have used many of these.  I used to get them from my dentist, but he quit carrying them.  These seem to be exactly like the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Helps relieve pressure build up in my ears. Works wonderful with warm water couple of times per week when I shower.</li>
            <li> I am unfortunate to be prone to having tonsil stones. When I ordered it I received 2 instead of the 4, but the seller took care of that with an email. These really help to clean out the little holes in my tonsils and get what my bobby pins can&#x27;t (yeah it&#x27;s gross and it sucks but whatever) These were also useful when I had wisdom teeth removed and could not really brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I fill these with tea tree oil to use on nail fungus.  The small tip allows oil to be applied under the nail, and one applicator holds enough for several weeks use.  Tea oil eventually degrades the rubber on the plunger, so every six months a new one is needed.  It seems ( in my experience) fungus can be controlled, but not eliminated. Guess my husband and I will be using both plunger and oil for the rest of our lives.  I don&#x27;t mind as long as my nails look healthy.</li>
            <li> For the same price you get get 3 sets of these with ling blunt needle for refilling ink cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;These once dont even last long, they are so tight they get jammed after 1 use once dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy once for ink refill.&lt;br /&gt;In both cases dont forget to disinfect prior to use.&lt;br /&gt;Sterilization can be done my submerging them into alcohol for 24 hrs (this is a low temperature method)&lt;br /&gt;Boil in water for 5 minutes can potentially deform syringes (not likely) but much quicker.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I used one of these to remove tonsil stones. It worked wonderfully! I put a towel underneath a makeup mirror so I could see what I was doing, and the towel collected over a dozen small tonsil stones. Amazing. I can already feel that nasty taste receding from my mouth, and I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST 10$ I ever spent. I got all the stones off my tonsils in about 30 minutes the first time I used these syringes.  I just gargled with warm salty water and/or diluted warm hydrogen peroxide for about 5 minutes twice a day to loosen the stones while I waited for the syringes to come in the mail. Then I gargled for 5 more minutes and used about 8 syringes full of warm salt water and everything came out and I spat them out easily. There were stones coming out I didn&#x27;t know we&#x27;re there that looked like that had been there for years. Now the bad taste in my mouth is gone! Make sure you stick the tip in the tonsil crypts at as many different angles as you can and squirting the cap outta them. I was thinking about having my tonsils out because I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore when I found these. So glad I found them!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that these are great for removing tonsil stones. I discovered these syringes a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using them ever since. My GP was shocked when I told her how well these worked.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try these for my tonsil stones as soon as I got them in the mail and washed one I tried it out. Amazing. I have been dealing with the stones for years and usually just try and get them out with a qtip, which only makes them irritated and bleed. I squirted some water right into one of my crypts and alllllll kinds of stuff came flowing right out. (Sorry if this grosses you out! But I know some of you can relate!) It&#x27;s awesome that something so simple can make me this happy!! If you get tonsil stones.. I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Also shipped fast and came right on time!</li>
            <li> Did the job as expected, simple to use.  Not rocket science.  I would recommend this product if you have the need for such a thing.</li>
            <li> Got one from the dentist years ago for tonsil stones and it worked great.  Lately got into blowing out egg shells to decorate them.  Found one in a drawer and they work wonderfully at extracting the egg through a single small hole in the shell.  Just fill the syringe with air and poke the tip in the hole.  Slowly inject the air and the egg will come out around it leaving you with an empty egg shell for decorations.  Much cheaper and more effective than the special devices they sell for the same job.</li>
            <li> Had an oral extraction of a molar with crown. Oral surgeon did not give me one. Extraction turned into a dry socket. Very slow healing. Food always getting stuck in it. These are exactly the same the oral surgeon office gives you. Found this out after going on the Internet for a week. Didn&#x27;t want to bother the oral surgeon, he was a bother. Thank heavens for Amazon! Great price! Fast shipping! Even took one on vacation with me! Also great to irrigate between the teeth at the gum line for stuck food in those teeth that are a pain to floss. Watch out, these thing can be very strong if you push the plunger fast. But they are super fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;A real life saver!</li>
            <li> though they didn&#x27;t work out for cleaning my tonsil pockets like i had hoped, they are just as described and i am sure would be good for whatever else they are used for.</li>
            <li> They work as they should. I woul dhave like a bit longer tip to reach palantine tonsil pockets. Easy to use for tooth cleansing oral pick.</li>
            <li> I love these Syringe but one was receive broken I took a picture of it after I open it , if it was not for that broken syringe I would have been very very happy.</li>
            <li> These things are great for many uses. I originally bought them for oral hygiene, but I have begun using them for projects, giving medication to the kitty, measuring chemicals for gardening, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked all over trying to find these in a store but had no success. These Watts syringes are good quality and value. I would recommend them for a variety of uses.</li>
            <li> I use these to flush dirt/debris from my horse&#x27;s hoof and heel.  They are the only thing small enough to get in between the heel bulbs to do the job!</li>
            <li> Good for use in first aid kits for dental and wound irrigation.  Can be resterilized in boiling water or with alcohol</li>
            <li> Our dentist uses these to irrigate deep pockets in the gums.  He gave us a pair of them to use at home, and we were happy to discover that they could be gotten through Amazon.  They will last a very long time if you rinse with super hot water after each use, and separate the two parts to dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The syringes were as expected. Quality was fine, and no obvious problems with the product. I would buy again if I found myself needing more.</li>
            <li> after reading all of these reviews, I was hopeful this would work on tonsil stones, but it really didn&#x27;t. At all. And I tried many times. Oh well, not for me. Mine are really deep so I think it would need more pressure then this</li>
            <li> Using the oral syringe to raise my mouth after menus is easy to use and convenient. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> LOVE it if you struggle with Tonsil Stones!!!t This $10 was the most effective in my life.  I have been struggling w/ tonsil stones for about 8 months when I first found out that I had a sinus problem. Over this 8 months, I have taken many many of Antibiotics...When I take antibiotics It is great, it doesnt come out. But once you finish taking it, it reoccured over and over... I even had a surgery last months for my sinus and my ENT was hoping that I won&#x27;t have tonsil stones again in my life. .... My surgery cost nearly $100,000 !!!! Can you believe this? After the surgery I was on Antibiotics again to prevent any infection in my nose... As soon as I finish taking it, AGAIAN!!! Tonsil Stones came right back to my tonsil. I was so desperate and  I really lost hope in my life to live with Bad Breath. I am only 25 years old woman, who lost her confidence due to BB. Period. I was so depressed.... But I still wanted to find a way to get rid of this issue.... I have so many years ahead of me, So i cold not give there.  Over extensive research on Amazon.....I finally found this Syringe, and I read all of the review and decided to give a shot. During the research, I was gonna purchase Watrerpik fro $60 just for Tonsil Stone.  Thank god I did this purchase. It came right away and I used it 2 days ago as soon as I received the item. While waiting for the package, I did gargle with Peroxide and water in the evening prior. Then when I got it, I was so happy to try this out. It was my only hope, Do you know the excitement how you feel???  I tried with salted hot water, First time, # tonsil stones just fell off without really angling. Then another 3 came out and few more. After that I tried for 30 min nothing came out. I do not know whether I still have more or not, but for my own sake I feel so much better. I will do this every night from now to prevent from Tonsil stones. This was nightmare in my life and I thought I will loose my BF because of thids. People doesnt have this wont be able to understand but I really went through hell. I did have a surgery and could not help. MY ENT doc is a lier and just wanted to make money.  But this product will save you from taking it out. I used to pick it up by Qtip and i throw up so many times . But With this one I dont anymore. GIve a try, I will leave th review again after 1 month or something. I just wanted to share my story to who struggle with Tonsil Stones like me helpless.....</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the happy reviews about using it for tonsil stones. It is ok but I&#x27;m not sure it really worked a lot better than q tip.  It&#x27;s a syringe so you can adjust the pressure which is nice.  I think a water pick would be to intense for me. Overall, I&#x27;ll likely keep using them but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> We use these in my lab to apply gel to sensors. Works like a charm. I imagine that this holds true for their intended purpose as well.</li>
            <li> I came to Amazon looking for a remedy and - as usual - found exactly what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, these syringes are a great deal because a nearby dentist&#x27;s office wanted $30 for ONE of these that they give patients after wisdom teeth extraction to wash out the empty tooth socket. Yummy.&lt;br /&gt;The syringe plungers glide smoothly in the chamber and seem to hold up well after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;You will want to disassemble and hand-wash these after each use with a mild soap and rinse - no dishwasher!&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, these Watts syringes are about 50% cheaper than the monoject brand.  I have both .. they are the same thing except Watts is less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, end of my review unless you want to know how to clean your ear -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Painless wax removal with Watts Syringes:&lt;br /&gt;The reason I purchased these specific syringes is very important - ear wax removal.  I am sure they work like a charm for other things but I buy these because they keep me from visiting a doctor every few weeks to clean my ears out. If you have never had a medical &#x27;expert&#x27; remove wax from your ears then I highly suggest you make an appointment with your nearest doctor and have him or her give you the royal &#x27;ear wax removal&#x27; treatment.&lt;br /&gt;How about sticking a hard vacuum tube in your ear, rubbing the insides of your head raw while simultaneously damaging your eardrum due to the 1000 decibel sound from the ear wax vacuum cleaner?  I think the instrument my doctor used was the original product from the lab of Benjamin Franklin - made out of rusted metal and fish hooks.&lt;br /&gt;- my tried and true ear wax removal procedure -&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: make sure your eardrums are not perforated ... and not infected.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: put a teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide in your ear and lay on your side (where it doesn&#x27;t run out)for a few minutes and wait while it bubbles... it might even bubble a long time if you have a big wax plug.&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: After a few minutes walk with your head tilted to the bathroom sink, run some body temperature water into the sink basin, plug the sink, use the tap to fill a syringe with warm water.  Cap the full syringe with the plunger.&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: Tilt your head to allow the peroxide to run into the sink and insert the curved tip slightly (SLIGHTLY) into the ear canal and use the syringe to create a thin forced stream of water up into your ear.&lt;br /&gt;Step 5: Repeat step 4 and adjust the stream until you feel it &#x27;pressure washing&#x27; the wax build-up in your ear. If you break through the wax you will know because your ear drum will be sensitive to the water stream and it will get loud.  Still nothing like your doctor&#x27;s Benjamin Franklin rusty ear vacuum...  so , relax.&lt;br /&gt;Step 6: If you plug your sink you can see how much wax is removed during this process.&lt;br /&gt;Step 7: Once you can hear better and see a bunch of little (or big) wax fragments in the sink you will be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: if the wax plug is large then it can&#x27;t be removed until it is softened for a couple of days... so I recommend using the solution from an ear cleaning kit like Debrox.  Put the drops in the ear twice a day for two or three days.  Using hydrogen peroxide every day can be too harsh, the chemicals in Debrox are not harsh but... they really don&#x27;t work very fast either.  After a couple of days you can use the above peroxide / syringe procedure.  I wish Debrox worked but... never.  I have never had these ear cleaning kits do anything for me except for softening the wax over several days.  The bulb syringe is only good for a turkey baster.the bathroom sink, run some body temperature water into the sink basin, plug the sink, use the tap to fill a syringe with warm water.

            <li> just as they were described. arrived quickly and work very well we are using them for a grease at our repair center at work. perfect and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Purchased for removal of tonsil stones. The first occasion on which I used them, I had stones come out after several syringe-fuls. It does work, it just takes time and practice. Definitely worth it overall.</li>
            <li> I use this to grease small areas on my Motorcycle. I cut about 2mm off the tip and use it to &amp;#34;suck&amp;#34; up grease out of my container, and then squeeze it into the areas needed. Works exactly as I expected, has a good seal, and great build quality.</li>
            <li> For you miserable tonsil stone sufferers - this works.  I wasted so much money, time, and hope on useless products, books, and advice on the market and finally came across this.  It takes some practice but if you can stick it in the opening of your tonsils and wash them out from the inside, it&#x27;s the best thing you can do. They fell right out. I had amazing results immediately for a good three months - my mouth felt clean, healthy, and back to normal again.  Now I use a syringe every couple of months to maintain the cleanliness.  Try it, you will thank yourself.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for tonsil stones.  I had tried antibiotics, and I tried &#x27;scraping&#x27; them out with surgical q-tips to no avail.  Five minutes with this and dozens of tiny stones and a few large ones were easily flushed out.  If you suffer from tonsil stones try this before anything else.  Plus they&#x27;re durable and re-usable.  What more could you ask for.</li>
