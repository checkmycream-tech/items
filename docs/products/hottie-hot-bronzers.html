            <li>my ass was smooth for a year after I stopped using it</li>
            <li>ITS GOING TO MAKE YOU HOT AND TINGLE !!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed to say the least.</li>
            <li>It was hot my first use but, def got better.</li>
            <li>Works so well and gives you a great dark tan.</li>
            <li>the lotion gets very hot ..</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion originally from the store, for 40, first time i had tanned in a while.</li>
            <li>so if you like hot and tingling get this lotion!</li>
            <li>This lotion did absolutely nothing for me except cost me more than lotions that I really like.</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle.</li>
            <li>Nice deep tan right out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>im looking at something more rich with color and better even if its&#x60; pricey Id rather buy a small bottle than this, than have nothing come out of it.</li>
            <li>If still available I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my face, and results were same as body though it did burn a tad bit more considering the face is more sensitive.</li>
            <li>So if you get this just try a little in one spot to see your good to use it..</li>
            <li>Yes, it makes you hot</li>
            <li>and Im just now buying this bottle from Amazon which is such a better deal.</li>
            <li>it made me hot at first</li>
            <li>Hot but not too hot.  </li>
            <li>This product was too hot, I saw no bronzer or tan after I used it.  </li>
            <li>These are the only non color depositing bronzers I&#x27;ve ever been able to find.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>It does make you hot and has a tint of bronzer in it.</li>
            <li>If your not used to a tingle or hot bronzer</li>
            <li>also it does get hot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a HOT, TINGLE lotion and should not be used for beginners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used them, but I suspect it has a lot of the same effect on your body that these fat shrink wraps and gels do that are becoming all p</li>
            <li>I previously bought this lotion from my local salon for $40 + tax, so buying this from amazon is a great deal if you have time to wait for it to ship.</li>
            <li>Cons - I don&#x27;t care for the strong smell of it and it can leave red splotches on my skin right after use (this completely goes away after an hour or so).    </li>
            <li>Pros - This lotion really darkens your tan faster than others I have tried.    </li>
            <li>It was intense and made my skin burn.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than i could have gotten it a tanning salon</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; factor is not that intense.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply evenly because it can become blotchy (dark where applied, and lighter where not applied).</li>
            <li>This lotion gets you dark and tan quickly and the tingle is very hot.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking to bring your tan to the next level...and quickly....</li>
            <li>and they threw in some free samples of other lotions.</li>
            <li>In spite of the cons, I will continue to use this lotion (have already ordered additional bottles for future use) because it does the job better than any other lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually like &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; products----but this is an exception I LOVE THIS,  </li>
            <li>Your prices bet the salon prices by far!  </li>
            <li>This bronzer, No less than 5 mins</li>
            <li>but anywhere else makes you very dark, very fast!</li>
            <li>It specifically states, 10X Extreme Heat &amp; Tingle Action High Power.</li>
            <li>but it got me soo dark so fast.</li>

            <li> In addition to that they also tone and firm your skin eliminating cellulite (trust me</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this lotion originally from the store, for 40, first time i had tanned in a while. Yes, it makes you hot but it got me soo dark so fast. It was hot my first use but, def got better. Now, I dont even notice the tingle anymore but, can still tell the difference and that was last year and Im just now buying this bottle from Amazon which is such a better deal. I know theyre are more expensive products out there and I just love this product and dont feel the need to switch I am soo dark with this. I also use the playboy tan extender its awesome too LOVE LOVE them both</li>
            <li> This bronzer, No less than 5 mins it made my skin red and burn, When I was laying in the tanning bed it felt like my arm was on fire, and after my shower I was still burning in some places on my body...I have fair skin...So if you get this just try a little in one spot to see your good to use it..</li>
            <li> I didnt&#x60; even Tan with this stuff it made me hot at first but I tried it again later it did better . That stuff has no color it looks like it ! It dosent like color through my skin ! maybe beacause im so senstive . im looking at something more rich with color and better even if its&#x60; pricey Id rather buy a small bottle than this, than have nothing come out of it.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Instant color every time! Hot but not too hot.  Also excellent when alternated with a bronzer. Kinda sad it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Love it. Just as good as if you bought it from a tanning salon but just more affordable. Will purchase from here again.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great got great results after 1 use will def use again and doesn&#x27;t leave brown tan lines</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed to say the least. This lotion did absolutely nothing for me except cost me more than lotions that I really like.</li>
            <li> Pros - This lotion really darkens your tan faster than others I have tried.    Cons - I don&#x27;t care for the strong smell of it and it can leave red splotches on my skin right after use (this completely goes away after an hour or so).    In spite of the cons, I will continue to use this lotion (have already ordered additional bottles for future use) because it does the job better than any other lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> This product was too hot, I saw no bronzer or tan after I used it.  It was intense and made my skin burn.</li>
            <li> READ THE DESCRIPTION! It specifically states, 10X Extreme Heat &amp; Tingle Action High Power. This is a tingle lotion, other reviewers stating that this burns and left their skin red and blotchy and on fire, and not to use this lotion because of that, didn&#x27;t understand what this lotion is. Its a tingle lotion, it makes your skin red and TINGLE. It increases blood flow in your skin, which is why you are red for an hour or two afterwards. Which INCREASES your tan. Don&#x27;t buy this lotion if you don&#x27;t want a tingle lotion, its plain and simple. Its a great lotion if you want a tingle tanning lotion. If not, then look for a bronzer lotion without tingle in it. Its as simple as that. The other reviewers are clueless about the product they bought, and the tanning lotions they want to use. \\&quot;Extreme Heat &amp; Tingle\\&quot; ITS GOING TO MAKE YOU HOT AND TINGLE !! Its not a sunburn, its the increased blood flow in your skin making you red ! Be knowledgeable about the product your buying, before buying it and giving it bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I previously bought this lotion from my local salon for $40 + tax, so buying this from amazon is a great deal if you have time to wait for it to ship. I just ordered my second bottle of this from here because me &amp; my sister both share this lotion. I have a base tan already and have got to the point that I am not getting any darker. This lotion does have alot of tingle in it and I wouldnt recommend putting it on your face but anywhere else makes you very dark, very fast! This is definately not a beginner lotion! But if your wanting to push your tan to the max and you can stand the tingling, this is the lotion for you. It smells pretty good and doesnt leave you streaky or orange! :)</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of this lotion but I love the darkness it gives my skin! If you have stretch marks, it tans them too!</li>
            <li> If you are looking to bring your tan to the next level...and quickly....this is the lotion for you.  Nice deep tan right out of the tanning bed. Never streaky or blotchy.  NOT for beginning tanner though becuase it does heat up good.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Nice big bottle. Much cheaper than i could have gotten it a tanning salon and they threw in some free samples of other lotions. Will use again.</li>
            <li> The Playboy hottie hot bronzer delivers fast and great results. I will definately buy this product again after I am done with the current bottle I have!! If you are PALE, I DEFINATELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS since it WILL cause you to burn. If you already have a base tan, or is somewhat near that, then this is FOR YOU. I just used it today, and saw results 5-10 min. afterwards... Be sure to apply evenly because it can become blotchy (dark where applied, and lighter where not applied). I used it on my face, and results were same as body though it did burn a tad bit more considering the face is more sensitive. A brown tint was my goal, and it&#x27;s definately giving me that, not orange at all like most tanning lotions will do to your skin.</li>
            <li> These are the only non color depositing bronzers I&#x27;ve ever been able to find. In addition to that they also tone and firm your skin eliminating cellulite (trust me my ass was smooth for a year after I stopped using it and I&#x27;m 220lbs!) the only downside is that it kinda smells like ashtray after it dries- which also worries me that it has the same chemicals in it cigarettes do, but I can&#x27;t find any evidence to support that speculation- so for now bronze on, use this when you are tanning, when you&#x27;re not tanning, when you are pool side, anywhere. I&#x27;ve never used them, but I suspect it has a lot of the same effect on your body that these fat shrink wraps and gels do that are becoming all p</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Works so well and gives you a great dark tan. I love a tingle lotion and this is my favorite I&#x27;ve ever tried. Awesome seller too, they even included two samples of other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> This lotion gets you dark and tan quickly and the tingle is very hot.  I would recommend it to anyone than uses a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; products----but this is an exception I LOVE THIS,  If still available I would highly recommend.  Gives a beautiful bronzing effect.  Thanks Amazon  ;)  Your prices bet the salon prices by far!  The &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; factor is not that intense.</li>
            <li> I have only used this lotion twice but I LOVE IT!! It does make you hot and has a tint of bronzer in it. I waited 2 hours to shower and still felt the burn until the following day. I used it again and the burn wasnt as bad as the first time using it. I have noticed a bit of a darker color (within 2 uses)..not sure if its the bronzer or if its just that good. I would def purchase again. Works as well as $60+ bottles of lotions I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It works great!  If your not used to a tingle or hot bronzer I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it. It works faster</li>
            <li> This is my second year using this lotion I recommend it to any tanner .. You should be and experienced tanner though bc the lotion gets very hot .. Love love love</li>
            <li> I go tanning about every other day.. it gets me so dark! I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments about how tan I&#x27;am! I mean also depends on your skin tone too! but its awesome I highly recommend it.. also it does get hot so if you like hot and tingling get this lotion! another thing I love about it is that its not that expensive either!! Great Lotion and Great Results and for an Awesome Price!!!</li>
            <li> I got great color from this product! I layer it with my bronzer when I tan and it works wonders!!! Smells great for a tingle as well.</li>
            <li> I love my tingle lotions.This one is great ,good smell,great price,and a pretty pink lotion.Iwill order more of this.fast service.This is truly my favorite tingle lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! I purchased this lotion at the tanning salon for about 50 bucks and I am so angry that I didn&#x27;t purchase it from Amazon sooner. It&#x27;s a HOT, TINGLE lotion and should not be used for beginners. Afterward, you will leave the salon very red and blotchy...this is expected. However, the redness will subside within a couple of hours. It&#x27;s an awesome lotion for an awesome price. This product was also tamper-proof with a plastic seal around the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Be careful where you purchase lotions from...I purchased two different lotions from supplier GREENWEB and I believe I was ripped off. They were falsely advertised and my tan was unaffected. Plus, the lotions were delivered in bags but without a seal around the cap.</li>
