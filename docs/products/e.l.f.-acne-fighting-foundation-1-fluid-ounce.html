    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This foundation is very full coverage n nice for being so cheap. I get complimemts on my skin ever since using this. I have oily skin, mild breakouts, but this seems to help with both! Its worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Monday morning and received it Saturday morning. I was so happy with how fast it shipped! I was expecting a full week or so but it came in a lot earlier. I will now explain how I applied this foundation. I used a damp beauty blender and it worked beautifully. I also used a primer and moisturizer before applying the foundation. The consistency is very creamy, literally, you kind of want to eat it just because of its consistency. The smell is quite fragrant. It smelled like witch hazel and a little bit of tea tree oil, which I did not mind. The smell goes away eventually. It&#x27;s not heavy on the skin, but you can definitely tell that you have foundation on. I&#x27;ll list the pros and cons now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-not cakey (use a primer and damp beauty blender)&lt;br /&gt;-satin finish (not too dewy or matte)&lt;br /&gt;-GREAT coverage (I have bright red pigmentation and it dulled it down to a tannish color)&lt;br /&gt;-looks flawless (I got big pores and occasional pimples errday but this did a good job masking them)&lt;br /&gt;-great packaging&lt;br /&gt;-fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-porcelain was a little too pale on me (I have fair asian skin and this ran a bit pale on me, but not too bad)&lt;br /&gt;-skin got really oily after four hours (I have extremely oily skin so I was disappointed with how it didn&#x27;t reduce some of the shine) (then again I did apply a lot of moisturizer today...)&lt;br /&gt;-a bit cakey around the nose (but can easily be fixed with rapid dabbing of the beauty blender)&lt;br /&gt;-slightly stung when it was applied to the skin (which is obv since it&#x27;s medicated but it&#x27;s not painful stinging, more of a sensational sensitive tingling) (just don&#x27;t apply on raw skin: skin right after washing or harsh rubbing/contact)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about all I can think of (: hope my review was thorough enough. Giving this product four and a half stars (but amazon doesn&#x27;t allow halfies so I just did four)</li>
            <li> My daughter started loving this foundation but noticed it oxide after awhile and started to move and became blotchy.</li>
            <li> I would love this foundation if it wasn&#x27;t so dark.  I have fair skin, and this &amp;#34;porcelain&amp;#34; was too dark for me.  The coverage was good, and the foundation had good staying power throughout the day.  It just won&#x27;t work for me.  I wish e.l.f. would make lighter shades for us pale girls.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, full coverage, smells good, ect. Not sure if it&#x27;s helped my acne at all but I like it either way. This is NOT the lightest shade you can get of this product, just a warning.</li>
            <li> So, I had tried one if ELF&#x27;s other foundations before, (the flawless complexion foundation) and was disappointed because it ran so dark for my fair skin. So needless to say, I was a little hesitant to order the Acne Fighting Foundation. I have super-dy-duper oily acne prone skin, and this foundation sounded like if I could find a match for me that if would be my new holy grail foundation. So, I ordered it in porcelain and held my breath. It finally came, and I opened it and tried it on. I&#x27;m SUPER impressed. I feel that it&#x27;s still runs a tad dark but no where near as dark as their other ones. I can make this one work. I LOVE this foundation. It&#x27;s matte, full coverage, and it fights acne and prevents new ones. I can&#x27;t wait to see if it clears it up or not! But honestly, even if it doesn&#x27;t improve my acne as long as it doesn&#x27;t cause new ones, I&#x27;d still use this as my holy grail foundation period. It&#x27;s that good. Singers crossed it works or at least doesn&#x27;t make things worse :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a NC 20 in MAC COSMETICS will this match my skin tone?</li>
            <li> This foundation, I think, is one of Elf&#x27;s fullest coverage foundations...it can tend to look a bit &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; so I just don&#x27;t typically reach for this foundation for that reason..however if I was going to take pictures or something like that, I would use this foundation because it does have good coverage, it does NOT contain spf do you wouldn&#x27;t see whiteness with flash taken photos. I just wouldn&#x27;t wear this everyday because I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;cakeyness&amp;#34; look it tends to give me (I do use a beauty blender with this product..trust me I blend this foundation in well, it still looks cakey)</li>
            <li> I thought this color would be perfect but it is MUCH lighter than displayed, both on Amazon and ELF and on multiple computers.  I can mix it with the color I have left over from summer but it irks me a bit.</li>
            <li> Nothing against the seller, just the product itself made me breakout. Instead of fighting my acne it clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> This foundation provides extremely smooth coverage.  It goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t leave creases, and stays put for a long time.  I borrowed it from my daughter when I ran out of what I was using.  It is for acne fighting, which I don&#x27;t need, but I am buying my own bottle because of how smooth it made my skin look.</li>
            <li> I like the creamy consistency by do not believe I made the best choice in color for my skin tone.  Does not seem to cause breakouts.  Will try again with another shade.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my vegan daughter who ran out of makeup at college. Bought two shades and the BB version and shipped it to her. Priced reasonably, easy to ship to her at school and she likes it.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many foundations over the years for my acne prone skin. This is perfect!  It goes on powdery smooth, and stays that way. This is the first foundation I have used that keeps my face shine free, with a true matte finish, for most of the day. ( All I need is a little afternoon powdering).  I use an oil-free moisterizer first, as per the instructions.  If I skip the moisterizer, I have found the makeup starts to look cakey and unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend trying this foundation, especially at this great price.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation!! I have tried so many high end ones n does not compare to this one. Love da coverage, does not look cakey. And for the price u can&#x27;t go wrong!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Oh yes! I wear Estee lauder double wear and this is really flipping close to the coverage!  It does dry a little bit so you need lotion. And you need a setting spray because it will slide if you don&#x27;t. Also, the rumors are true, I bought porcelain and it is vampire pale. I&#x27;ll have to get the next color for when I start to tan.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who has acne-prone skin. She likes to use foundation to even out her skin tone (despite Mom telling her that foundation may be causing her breakouts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves the way this foundation goes on smoothly and dries to a nearly powder finish. It stays on all day, too, despite her oily skin. The only disappointment was the color - it&#x27;s several shades lighter than the photo indicates and she won&#x27;t be able to use it in the summer when her skin gets darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it just to see what it&#x27;s like, and it&#x27;s way too drying for my middle aged skin. I looked like the Crypt Keeper once it dried on my face.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! Will definitely buy it again!! I just love it!!</li>
            <li> I like it but I feel like I have to use a ton of it for every use.</li>
            <li> Good full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> I used my fingers to apply it the first time and was extremely unhappy because it was streaky, heavy, and highlighted my pores which aren&#x27;t even that big to begin with. I have a BeautyBlender foundation sponge (looks like a pink egg) which I use every now and then so I decided to experiement with it.    Here&#x27;s what I did to get great results: Wet the sponge and squeeze out the water until it&#x27;s just damp. Put a couple of drops of the foundation on the inside of your wrist and work the sponge into it just a tiny bit, then apply it to your face. It takes me three times to go from my wrist to my face. Once for the center &amp; forehead and once for either side of my face. The result is a sheer, flawless lookinig application with a surprisingly good amount of coverage.    The really good thing about this makeup is that is has not caused any blemishes at all and I do have problems with foundation blocking pores and causing me to breakout. The other reason I like this makeup so much is that it I have combination skin and it stays nice and matte all day in my oily spots without drying out the dry skin on my face.    My skin tone is light, but not overly fair, with yellow undertones. I chose porcelain and it does work because i also use a bronzer over it (palladio alantic tan - love it!) but I think buff might be a slightly better choice for my skin tone. I plan to try it the next time I place an order.    After using this for a week, I like it so much I threw out my other foundations as I only want to use this one.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and this makeup is heavy coverage and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I recommend a Beauty blender for application.</li>
            <li> i like it, but the lightest shade is still too dark for me. i&#x27;m fair skinned. i find that it&#x27;s difficult to find my shade in most foundations. for reference, i&#x27;m a nw 10 in MAC.</li>
