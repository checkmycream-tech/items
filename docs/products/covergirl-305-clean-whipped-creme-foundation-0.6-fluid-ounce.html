            <li>It has wonderful coverage, it is kind to my sensitive skin, it is the best color match to my way-too-fair skin of any foundation I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve been a loyal Covergirl consumer)</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the absolute BEST foundation I have ever used in my life.</li>

            <li>I tried it, I fell in love with it, I&#x27;ve used it every day since, and I literally just found out they discontinued it.</li>
            <li>I love it more than the department store foundations I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li>great product I love it so much...</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly, has mediumish coverage, and is easy to apply and blend.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super oily skin, so I haven&#x27;t had many issues</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite foundation!</li>
            <li>Pretty good, maybe better for oiler skin types, kind of clings to any dry spots, needs some light touching up throught out the day.</li>
            <li>creamy  light texture</li>
            <li>I love the look and feel of this makeup, its very smooth and light, and keeps my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t fair enough for my complexion.  </li>
            <li>Overall, good product and</li>
            <li>I may purchase again when I finish this if I don&#x27;t find anything that seems more promising.</li>
            <li>I prefer Almay Smart Shade Mousse in Light</li>
            <li>Only wish I could&#x27;ve had better color samples because this is way too light for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest let the first layer absorb then build and powder after.</li>
            <li>and it still looked almost the same as when i do :).  </li>
            <li>I have found that this lasts pretty well if you use plenty of powder afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Soft smooth and maximum coverage.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, and am amazed at the low price!  </li>

            <li>Lasts all day in the hot weather.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not a lot of stores around me sell it anymore, so thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Lighter than expected and very light coverage</li>
            <li>If you find that it&#x27;s filling your lines, then you&#x27;re using too much at once.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Glides on very smoothly&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty much everything else.</li>
            <li>Since I have been exfoliating, it hasn&#x27;t sunken into my pores as much as before.  </li>
            <li>It does take a bit of product and the jar is pretty small, but it should last a good amount of time considering the price of the product.  </li>
            <li>Like, put a little more than you think you need to be safe if you don&#x27;t plan to touch it up half way through the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, easy to blend, natural looking, and long wearing.</li>
            <li>It has no staying power, though when used with a primer it does get a little better)</li>
            <li>Goes on well, lasts as well as any other foundation, and the color matches my HIGHLY light complexion.  </li>
            <li>but makes your face soft.</li>
            <li>So lightweight and natural looking.</li>
            <li>, it is long lasting, it doesn&#x27;t get soaked up by my makeup sponges like the liquid foundation does, it looks super natural, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off when I blow my nose after doing my makeup (which, yes, happens quite often</li>
            <li>You should, however, use a good moisturizer and immediately apply this foundation if you have any flaky areas of your face because this does stick to them pretty bad if you don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this one very much, but I&#x27;ll break it down into pros and</li>
            <li>While it does glide on smoothy this ends up feeling almost oily by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not my least favorite foundation ever, but I really wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very splotchy, it wears unevenly ( and I have normal skin</li>
            <li>It should be noted that I have dry, sensitive skin</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Lighter than expected and very light coverage but makes your face soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent....love the Covet Girl product..&lt;br /&gt;5..⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ in my book..Thank You.</li>
            <li> As everyone else says, the foundation itself has a lot of coverage.. Yet I bought the ivory colored, and the color is nothing like it looks in the picture. Its about three shades darker.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite foundation! I was devastated upon hearing that it had been discontinued.... I hope they bring it back</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT whipped, what came was runny &amp; greasy!!! I ordered 2 because it had good reviews and was cheap and both were runny, almost like it had melted. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re normally like this or if I just got some from a bad batch, but I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Worked great just like the ones in stores. Unfortunately not a lot of stores around me sell it anymore, so thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! Unfortunately you can&#x27;t buy it locally anymore. Love the price and the product</li>
            <li> Love this product. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it on a daily basis over concealer, and set it with a translucent powder like you&#x27;re supposed to. This is only a foundation base, not complete foundation, and is meant to be blended with other products.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit heavier coverage than I like and it isn&#x27;t fair enough for my complexion.  I prefer Almay Smart Shade Mousse in Light</li>
            <li> This has become my foundation of choice.  I love it!  Goes on well, lasts as well as any other foundation, and the color matches my HIGHLY light complexion.  It&#x27;s creamy so not much is needed and it holds onto powder really great.  If you find that it&#x27;s filling your lines, then you&#x27;re using too much at once.  I&#x27;d suggest let the first layer absorb then build and powder after.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with trying every different foundation known to man, and so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different ones, both department store and high end and drug store as well. I didn&#x27;t like this one very much, but I&#x27;ll break it down into pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Glides on very smoothly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much everything else. It&#x27;s very splotchy, it wears unevenly ( and I have normal skin so it rubs off in odd places. It has no staying power, though when used with a primer it does get a little better) While it does glide on smoothy this ends up feeling almost oily by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not my least favorite foundation ever, but I really wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these and 2 of color 365 perfect for contouring! So creamy and it blends flawlessy.</li>
            <li> I never saw any ads for this foundation, so when I found it on clearance at my local Target, I was intrigued. I tried it, I fell in love with it, I&#x27;ve used it every day since, and I literally just found out they discontinued it. My heart is broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the absolute BEST foundation I have ever used in my life. It has wonderful coverage, it is kind to my sensitive skin, it is the best color match to my way-too-fair skin of any foundation I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve been a loyal Covergirl consumer), it is long lasting, it doesn&#x27;t get soaked up by my makeup sponges like the liquid foundation does, it looks super natural, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off when I blow my nose after doing my makeup (which, yes, happens quite often - something about putting on makeup makes my nose go haywire).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had the money, I would buy up every last container of the stuff. This is truly a low point in my life.</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly, has mediumish coverage, and is easy to apply and blend.  It seems a little too light, but blends into your skin after a few minutes without oxidizing so much that you look like an oompa loompa like my last foundation did :(.  I suggest using your hands to apply as it is the only thing that I have found that blends properly.  I found that it settled into my large pores pretty bad, but that is because I wasn&#x27;t exfoliating enough and did not use a primer.  Since I have been exfoliating, it hasn&#x27;t sunken into my pores as much as before.  I forgot to use a primer the other day and it still looked almost the same as when i do :).  I have found that this lasts pretty well if you use plenty of powder afterwards.  Like, put a little more than you think you need to be safe if you don&#x27;t plan to touch it up half way through the day.  It should be noted that I have dry, sensitive skin and I have not had any problems with this causing irritation.  You should, however, use a good moisturizer and immediately apply this foundation if you have any flaky areas of your face because this does stick to them pretty bad if you don&#x27;t.  I would definitely not recommend this for oily skin.  It does take a bit of product and the jar is pretty small, but it should last a good amount of time considering the price of the product.  Overall, good product and I may purchase again when I finish this if I don&#x27;t find anything that seems more promising.</li>
            <li> This foundation is creamy and works great on my dry/normal combination skin. It&#x27;s moisturizing, easy to blend, natural looking, and long wearing. I love it more than the department store foundations I&#x27;ve used.</li>

I don&#x27;t have super oily skin, so I haven&#x27;t had many issues but I have seen how it could become an issue if you did. Lasts all day in the hot weather. Only wish I could&#x27;ve had better color samples because this is way too light for me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it actually smells good and has great coverage.</li>
            <li> great product I love it so much... so sad that they discontinued it though</li>
