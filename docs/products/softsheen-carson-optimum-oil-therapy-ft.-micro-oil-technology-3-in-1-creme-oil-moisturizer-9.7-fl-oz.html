            <li>I also like the way it makes my hair feels its good.</li>
            <li>Great Product - Love this creme for my daughters</li>
            <li>I was SO happy to be able to find this product again.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesnt leave my hair sticky.</li>
            <li>I have used many products to control frizz</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF, AND</li>
            <li>OK NOW, I HAVE NEVER USED IT ON MY HAIR</li>
            <li>I did that and changed what I washed my hair with, and my hair improved and grew better since using stuff like this to \\&quot;wash,\\&quot; to \\&quot;condition,\\&quot; and to \\&quot;moisturize.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF and trust me</li>
            <li>It your problem is all the hair other than the ends that frizzes up and makes your head into a furball, then this is perfect.</li>
            <li>that is fine.</li>
            <li>but if your going for a shiny straight sleek look or wavy ends its amazing.</li>
            <li>It will not control curls well at the ends (like i said it lets them curl freely but frizz-free like your out of a shower)but</li>
            <li>this product works very well and leave the hair very manageable, I have used this product for more than four years and always do good results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a small amount every day for years - perfect for getting my curls into shape after and in between shampoos.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have used two weeks running and still thoroughly LOVE.  </li>
            <li>MAKE UP REMOVER WHIP 1ST, AND GET MY FACE CLEAN.  </li>
            <li>Once hair dries, comb it out and Soft Sheen gives the most healthy glow to my hair.  </li>
            <li>My best luck was with Nexxus thick gel styling creme and hairspray but even then I had frizz and dullness.</li>
            <li>I use this on the ends at night, it is greasy at first but soaks in by the time I wake up and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down or make it look oily...just healthy.</li>
            <li>I USE THIS FOR MY FACE, AND IT MAKES MY FACE VERY PRETTY, AND YOUTHFUL.  </li>
            <li>A VERY PRETTY WOMAN</li>
            <li>Very good for people with thick hair</li>
            <li>REALLY SMOOTH AND LAST WITH A REFRESHING LOOK ALL DAY.  </li>
            <li>I used it 3 times and once or twice on freshly washed hair and each time flakes and oily buildup.  </li>
            <li>Love it, my hair feels so soft and shines.</li>
            <li>Its almost like having your hair like its straight from the shower, soft smooth and frizz free and managable</li>
            <li>Using natural, pure oils will benefit you more than this.  </li>
            <li>Love it totally.</li>
            <li>it, its not expensive.</li>
            <li>When I finally get it into my hair well, it does an okay job of keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li>First, it must be said it is the exact consistency of Elmer&#x27;s glue.  </li>
            <li>Very mild on my very fragile hair, holds very well with my curls!</li>
            <li>I am on a hair journey to grow my hair long and my hair seems to love this stuff.</li>
            <li>If individual pure oils are not what you seek but desire a product with more than one ingredients, then please check out REAL natural products that have moisturizing properties from companies like littlepenguinsonline.com, or brownbutterbeauty.com or beemine.com.  </li>
            <li>I use a straightner to acheeve a certain look</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft, shiny and slightly slightly oily but in a good feeling</li>
            <li>P.S.--I&#x27;m over 60 yrs old &amp; for the first time in my life consider my curls a blessing!</li>
            <li>Luckily, it&#x27;s light like the other optimum oil products so I can reapply it every morning without my hair getting weighed down.</li>
            <li>My hair used to be straight, now its wavy-frizzy.</li>
            <li>I really like http://www.amazon.com/Optimum-Care-Therapy-Shine-Booster-3-4/dp/B000EGIF7U</li>
            <li>I have tried there products of various kinds from hair teas to scalp conditioner to pomades that can be used on the body without regret, and yes, I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This is also a really great product, I have been very ill and needed something extra to heal my hair since I have not been able to take care of as much as I need to.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m going to keep looking for something that I can put in my hair and just leave for work, instead of spending extra time rubbing it in, trying to make sure my hair isn&#x27;t white.</li>
            <li>AT CHURCH THOUGHT SHE WAS OLDER THAN ME, AND SHE IS 55.........</li>
            <li>First, it SITS on top of the hair in a big white pasty glob that barely settles in even with much brushing.</li>
            <li>That said, put an appropriate amount of the product (I have short hair and the size of a flat quarter</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a new moisturizer,</li>
            <li>I have very fine but thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the only way I can manage to grow my hair at long, it keeps it soft and strong.</li>
            <li>The good stuff are listed toward the bottom and the cheap crap like mineral oil is listed first and second.  </li>
            <li>When I came home one day using another product and it was frizzy, I would put this on and it would leave my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>It lets your hair curl naturally and soft and tames fly-aways.</li>
            <li>This product moisturizes &amp; defines my natural, spiral curls--eliminating frizz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it nearly 2 yrs.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, leaves my curls soft.</li>
            <li>If your hair is like mine, it will be soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll barely have enough hair to put it on after so much breakage!</li>
            <li>is about right)in your palm and ADD WARM WATER TO IT TO THIN IT OUT for easier application.  </li>
            <li>but in fact it&#x27;s the major ingredients that are \\&quot;working\\&quot; for you--mineral oil and silicones.  </li>
            <li>thats not wet.</li>
            <li>This product helps me weigh it down and control the frizz so much.</li>
            <li>very managageable and does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>No, I wasn&#x27;t heavy handed when using them, especially after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Dry your hair naturally or with your blow dryer on low.  </li>
            <li>I am caucasian with thin, fine hair.</li>

            <li> No, I wasn&#x27;t heavy handed when using them, especially after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Dry your hair naturally or with your blow dryer on low.  </li>
            <li> I am caucasian with thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> so it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I apply about a &#x27;dime size&#x27; amount (for short hair)in my hands and glide it over the ends of my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner works great,but this was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> After rubbing hands together (front and back) apply to wet hair and comb through.  </li>
            <li> My hair is 75% gray, dry and cranky.  </li>
            <li> but I am black and both my daughters are of different racial mixes and it doesn&#x27;t work for any of our hair types.</li>
            <li> Ladies the petroleum and mineral oil in this is no good for your hair and trust me whenever if ever the natural oils it claims to have finally settles in your hair</li>
            <li> Readers, this product IS LIKE ALL OF SOFTSHEEN CARSON PRODUCTS, and THEY CONTAIN THE SAME INGREDIENTS WITH LITTLE DIFFERENCE.  </li>
            <li> Second it dries our hair out horribly, seeing that the so called natural oils in it aren&#x27;t at the top of ingredients, petroleum and mineral oil which are both no</li>
            <li> It went from soft and slightly oily to dried up and stiff in one application.</li>
            <li> You only need very little</li>
            <li> A SMALL DIME SIZE, RUB YOUR HANDS TOGETHER, AND PLACE LIKE ANY OTHER MOISTURIZER, AND NECK AND UPPER CHEST BY COLLAR BONE AREA.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE THAN A DIME SIZE, AND NOT HEAPING, LET IT DRY FOR JUST 1 MINUTE BEFORE APPLYING YOUR FOUNDATION</li>
            <li> so I could care less.</li>
            <li> no&#x27;s for black hair</li>
            <li> I tried this mineral oil- and artificial ingredient-product when it was new along with the hair quencher and dry hair healer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months now.</li>
            <li> so well my husband uses it behind my back.</li>
            <li> were not much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who this is working for</li>
            <li> but it is so thick.</li>
            <li> It is too thick and does not penetrate your hair or scalp.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s very thick and leaves my hair looking grayish-white because it doesn&#x27;t coat my hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can no longer find it in stores.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product.  Love it totally.</li>
            <li> Very good for people with thick hair that is fine. I have very fine hair but it is so thick. This product helps me weigh it down and control the frizz so much.</li>
            <li> I am caucasian with thin, fine hair. I use this on the ends at night, it is greasy at first but soaks in by the time I wake up and washes out easily. This stuff is the only way I can manage to grow my hair at long, it keeps it soft and strong. I know this line is meant for African American hair but there is nothing like it when it comes to deep conditioning for anyone with my hair type.</li>
            <li> This is also a really great product, I have been very ill and needed something extra to heal my hair since I have not been able to take care of as much as I need to.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have been using it for a few months now. I use it at night to moisurize my scalp and hydrate the ends of my hair. I love that it doesnt leave my hair sticky. very managageable and does not weigh my hair down. I am on a hair journey to grow my hair long and my hair seems to love this stuff. I have very fine but thick curly hair. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> My hair used to be straight, now its wavy-frizzy. I have used many products to control frizz and they havent worked as well as this one. My best luck was with Nexxus thick gel styling creme and hairspray but even then I had frizz and dullness. When I came home one day using another product and it was frizzy, I would put this on and it would leave my hair soft and managable. Its almost like having your hair like its straight from the shower, soft smooth and frizz free and managable but like it says its not greasy. It will make your hair color look darker and shinier a bit but if your going for a shiny straight sleek look or wavy ends its amazing. It lets your hair curl naturally and soft and tames fly-aways. Dont be decived by its price, i havent had great experiences with cheaper products and high-end ones were not much better. This product is not greasy as I sleep with it over 2 or 3 days sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, its not expensive. When you use it, rub it in damp hair in the roots-hair shaft area and cover the tips and ends from their and simply press or style your hair. It will not control curls well at the ends (like i said it lets them curl freely but frizz-free like your out of a shower)but I use a straightner to acheeve a certain look so I could care less. It your problem is all the hair other than the ends that frizzes up and makes your head into a furball, then this is perfect. It leaves your hair soft, shiny and slightly slightly oily but in a good feeling thats not wet.</li>
            <li> Great Product - Love this creme for my daughters bi-racial hair - eliminates the fuzzies without leaving it looking greasy!</li>
            <li> I really like http://www.amazon.com/Optimum-Care-Therapy-Shine-Booster-3-4/dp/B000EGIF7U and I was looking for a new moisturizer, so I thought this product might work for me. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s very thick and leaves my hair looking grayish-white because it doesn&#x27;t coat my hair well unless I mix it with another product. When I finally get it into my hair well, it does an okay job of keeping it moisturized. Luckily, it&#x27;s light like the other optimum oil products so I can reapply it every morning without my hair getting weighed down. Still, I&#x27;m going to keep looking for something that I can put in my hair and just leave for work, instead of spending extra time rubbing it in, trying to make sure my hair isn&#x27;t white.</li>
            <li> Provides good  amount of oil and moisture to hair leaving it with shine and flexibility. My hair breakage has improved 90%. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a small amount every day for years - perfect for getting my curls into shape after and in between shampoos.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS FOR MY FACE, AND IT MAKES MY FACE VERY PRETTY, AND YOUTHFUL.  A SMALL DIME SIZE, RUB YOUR HANDS TOGETHER, AND PLACE LIKE ANY OTHER MOISTURIZER, AND NECK AND UPPER CHEST BY COLLAR BONE AREA.  I AM 66 AND EVEN WOMEN THINK I AM 55.  A VERY PRETTY WOMAN AT CHURCH THOUGHT SHE WAS OLDER THAN ME, AND SHE IS 55.........LOL..  I LOVE THIS STUFF, AND 1 BOTTLE LAST ME 1 YR.  OK NOW, I HAVE NEVER USED IT ON MY HAIR, HOWEVER I NEED TO, SO I CAN WRITE ANOTHER  REVIEW.  ANNIE:  hiphopsmom11@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;for any questions.  NO MORE THAN A DIME SIZE, AND NOT HEAPING, LET IT DRY FOR JUST 1 MINUTE BEFORE APPLYING YOUR FOUNDATION AND IT GOES ON REALLY SMOOTH AND LAST WITH A REFRESHING LOOK ALL DAY.  I USE A MAKE UP REMOVER WHIP 1ST, AND GET MY FACE CLEAN.  HAPPY FACING !</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s the only thing that will actually keep my hair moisturized! Unfortunately I can no longer find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Very mild on my very fragile hair, holds very well with my curls! Does not leave any residue to my scalp and does not form any dandruff.</li>
            <li> I received the requested item with no problem.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this for me and my daughters&#x27; hair. I&#x27;m not sure who this is working for but I am black and both my daughters are of different racial mixes and it doesn&#x27;t work for any of our hair types. First, it SITS on top of the hair in a big white pasty glob that barely settles in even with much brushing. Second it dries our hair out horribly, seeing that the so called natural oils in it aren&#x27;t at the top of ingredients, petroleum and mineral oil which are both no no&#x27;s for black hair are. I can feel my hair hardening up and breaking off as soon as I tried to rub it it. It went from soft and slightly oily to dried up and stiff in one application. I am horrified that this is on the market. Ladies the petroleum and mineral oil in this is no good for your hair and trust me whenever if ever the natural oils it claims to have finally settles in your hair you&#x27;ll barely have enough hair to put it on after so much breakage!</li>
            <li> I tried this mineral oil- and artificial ingredient-product when it was new along with the hair quencher and dry hair healer.  I got only crappy results of oil build up with flakes on my scalp, even though this was not used on my scalp.  I used it 3 times and once or twice on freshly washed hair and each time flakes and oily buildup.  No, I wasn&#x27;t heavy handed when using them, especially after the first use.  Readers, this product IS LIKE ALL OF SOFTSHEEN CARSON PRODUCTS, and THEY CONTAIN THE SAME INGREDIENTS WITH LITTLE DIFFERENCE.  The good stuff are listed toward the bottom and the cheap crap like mineral oil is listed first and second.  Why bother with stuff like this that only coats your hair and scalp that leave an oily buildup.  Just buy the \\&quot;micro oils\\&quot; this product claims that are working for you but in fact it&#x27;s the major ingredients that are \\&quot;working\\&quot; for you--mineral oil and silicones.  Using natural, pure oils will benefit you more than this.  I did that and changed what I washed my hair with, and my hair improved and grew better since using stuff like this to \\&quot;wash,\\&quot; to \\&quot;condition,\\&quot; and to \\&quot;moisturize.\\&quot;  If individual pure oils are not what you seek but desire a product with more than one ingredients, then please check out REAL natural products that have moisturizing properties from companies like littlepenguinsonline.com, or brownbutterbeauty.com or beemine.com.  NO, I DON&#x27;T WORK FOR THESE COMPANIES OR KNOW ANYONE OF THESE COMPANIES. I have tried there products of various kinds from hair teas to scalp conditioner to pomades that can be used on the body without regret, and yes, I enjoy using them. So, I assume this message may help others, too.</li>
            <li> this product works very well and leave the hair very manageable, I have used this product for more than four years and always do good results</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair shine. I also like the way it makes my hair feels its good.</li>
            <li> I was SO happy to be able to find this product again.  Although the &#x27;box stores&#x27; say they carry it, it&#x27;s never on the shelf.  I apply about a &#x27;dime size&#x27; amount (for short hair)in my hands and glide it over the ends of my wet hair.  Once hair dries, comb it out and Soft Sheen gives the most healthy glow to my hair.  It&#x27;s nice and light, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down or make it look oily...just healthy.</li>
            <li> I did not like this moisturizer at all. It is too thick and does not penetrate your hair or scalp.It just sits on your hair in a big white glob. This is the only product by this line that I did not care for. The shampoo and conditioner works great,but this was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer and heat protection product. It works so well my husband uses it behind my back. Stores don&#x27;t seem to sell it in some places so buying it here is a life saver</li>
            <li> Love it, my hair feels so soft and shines. I&#x27;ve used this product for over 5 years, it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use. You only need very little so it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.  This product moisturizes &amp; defines my natural, spiral curls--eliminating frizz. YEA!! I&#x27;ve used it nearly 2 yrs. now. It is non-greasy, leaves my curls soft. I use it daily. P.S.--I&#x27;m over 60 yrs old &amp; for the first time in my life consider my curls a blessing!</li>
            <li> My hair is 75% gray, dry and cranky.  This is the first product I have used two weeks running and still thoroughly LOVE.  Here&#x27;s how I apply it.  First, it must be said it is the exact consistency of Elmer&#x27;s glue.  That said, put an appropriate amount of the product (I have short hair and the size of a flat quarter is about right)in your palm and ADD WARM WATER TO IT TO THIN IT OUT for easier application.  After rubbing hands together (front and back) apply to wet hair and comb through.  Dry your hair naturally or with your blow dryer on low.  If your hair is like mine, it will be soft and shiny.  LOVE THIS STUFF and trust me, I have every concoction known to man under my bathroom sink to fight frizz and dryness.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Awesome for curly hair</li>
            <li> As Described. Thank you.</li>
