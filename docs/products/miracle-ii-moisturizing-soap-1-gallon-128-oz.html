            <li>We have been using Miracle II soap for many years.</li>

            <li>It is the most economical soap on the market, and it is a very Healthy soap to use, because it has not harmful ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>has a nice clean</li>

            <li>Keeps my fingers from splitting, rinses easily, removes oil from my face without stripping, does dishes</li>
            <li>Strongly suggest you get the screw-on pump for it.</li>
            <li>This product is not FDA approved, and the manufacturer refuses to release all details relevant to its making.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money - if it worked for you - great!</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>something smells familiar...</li>
            <li>Clothes come out clean and soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dish</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had to clean my tub since -</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice and clear!</li>
            <li>Good for many other conditions.  </li>
            <li>Its wonderful....so mild, but also so rich.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>What a shame,  used to love the original undiluted formula and used to highly  recommended to my patients.  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh clean scent</li>
            <li>so I was delighted to see in on Amazon for less money and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about fifteen years as a face wash and at 65 most people comment that they can&#x27;t believe how young my face looks.</li>
            <li>I used to have to drive across town for this stuff and now it gets delivered right to my door.  </li>
            <li>Product was much more moisturizing than when ordered in past, but I liked that after I got used to it.</li>
            <li>Considering how great this stuff is for everything around the home, the foam issue is just a small inconvenience.</li>
            <li>but THIS is what I just realized: I have just (at this very moment) been making DIY laundry detergent that calls for Borax, Super Washing Soda and... Dawn dish soap.</li>
            <li>it if you use too much!</li>
            <li>, I put it in a foamer bottle and this gallon will last me more than a year using it at every sink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite soap, only type I use.</li>
            <li>The only soap in my home, It does everything promised and more.</li>
            <li>This soap really works miracles!</li>
            <li>Never used Dawn but have been reading countless opinions on how many uses it has at home from laundry detergent, carpet cleaner, fleas killer, etc.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that a foam separates at the top (probably the moisturizing ingredietns) and if you can&#x27;t shake it up (like say, because it&#x27;s in your shower dispenser)</li>
            <li>Notice that one of the ingredients listed is prayer and this alone may sell the product to some people but if you see the studies and watch videos of  how prayer works in conjunction with  water or food actually changes it chemically making it better for you -</li>
            <li>First time buying the moisturized version</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling clean but not dried out like soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, it goes a long ways, can be used for everything.</li>
            <li>This is moisturizing soap, not the original soap, so it does not look exactly the same.</li>
            <li>very prompt service.</li>
            <li>Really like this soap.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely does NOT kill fleas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated</li>
            <li>I had a boss who would take a bath in Miracle II and use the water to water her plants &amp; her plants were absolutely</li>
            <li>think anyone with sensitivities would like this gentle, unscented soap: eczema, asthma, allergies, chronic fatigue, cancer, dermatitis, lupus, rashes, inflammation, diabetes - any issue where there may be breathing, skin or immune sensitivities.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve stopped using my straight iron to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, don&#x27;t want to write much about this product as I did not like it...</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>My whole family uses this soap, including the dogs.</li>
            <li>My whole family has been using it for years</li>
            <li>No matter how much grease and grime you have on you, you will leave no bathtub ring.</li>
            <li>Use to clean grease yet gentle enough to bathe in!</li>
            <li>am extremely well pleased with everything.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t need to buy any other soap for a year or more.</li>
            <li>A similar amount in your hand washes your hair squeaky clean, too.</li>
            <li>Or if you have another clean container with a hole or valve in the bottom, you can use that to separate the soap from the foam and put it back into the bottle.</li>
            <li>but I will say this: I will not be surprised if the miracle II soap is just a little bit of Dawn (don&#x27;t laugh, Dawn can be used and is used by many for bathing, cleaning animals from oil spills, washing dogs - recommended by vets because it is SAFEST to kills fleas on puppies, etc.</li>
            <li>There is white light green liquid floating on top.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it in the shower</li>
            <li>big bottle can last a couple years or more.</li>
            <li>I use some large  old soap dispensers for this stuff.</li>
            <li>It can be used as a household cleaner, a degreaser, dish soap, shampoo, body wash, just about anything that you would like to use a gentle and natural, pH-balanaced soap on.</li>
            <li>- feels soft and gentle yet cleanses thoroughly .</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money for me anyway.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase at the health food store</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love that it&#x27;s green or runny, but that doesn&#x27;t matter compared to what it does for me.  </li>
            <li>Just a few simple ingredients that make it nice for those with sensitivities, yet powerful enough to get almost any job done.</li>
            <li>I like the moisturizing property of this product, finding it to do that as I live in an arid climate in the southwestern US.  </li>
            <li>tangled, super dry.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and her fur is very soft and shiny after a bath in this soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is concentrated, which gives it a good value for the money because a single gallon usually lasts me 3 years.</li>
            <li>In the past I paid more for it and got it through a distributor</li>
            <li>I agree with everything positive everyone above says &amp; will try not to repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Large bottle will last forever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this is totally natural and has no phony fragrance my used gray water does not leave my house containing poison</li>
            <li>I am not exaggerating when I say that the fleas are completely repelled by the pH of this soap.  </li>
            <li>It completely eliminates the need for a flea comb after the bath.  </li>
            <li>It has cocoanut oil and is all natural.</li>
            <li>Use in the shower and bath... or anywhere that requires frequent hand washing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The gallon size is really a bargain compared to the smaller size over time.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased the whole line: deodorant, moisturizer, etc.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>It just has SO many uses, not only for washing dishes) and few \\&quot;other\\&quot; ingredients (</li>
            <li>When I get it I shake it up completely till it turns light turquoise with no white streaks &amp; pour what I can into a 1/2 gallon round plastic container</li>
            <li>especially if you have soft water!</li>
            <li>It nourishes my skin like no other product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Laundry... does a great job in the washing machine (for bad stains I add an enzyme spray before washing).  </li>
            <li>I have used this soap with young living essential oil added to it for bathing my dog.</li>
            <li>so I am careful about how much I use in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Also I don&#x27;t think this soap goes as far as the regular Miracle II does.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I did not realize, when ordering it, that it is the moisturizing type, or I would have looked for the regular, as I prefer the regular, but this is good soap anyway.  </li>
            <li>For people complaining that this soap makes their hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; or feel sort of sticky dry when using it - this is because your old shampoo and hair products leave a film of silicone on your hair.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money because each time I take a bath, I only using a small amount.  </li>
            <li>Had helped my 91 year old Father was his dry skin issue!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also fairly certain it killed my cat.</li>
            <li>This new shipment does not look like the other ones.</li>

            <li> If your children love bubble baths it makes bubbles in the bathtub and safe non toxic.  </li>
            <li> favorite use is for bathing my dog.  </li>
            <li> love it  </li>
            <li> Sure makes me feel better.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the timely delivery</li>
            <li> I feel so much better when using this.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find it in the gallon size.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it is a FANTASTIC product!  </li>
            <li> also like how this soap has more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> Most of my friends use it and love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this soap been a longtime user can be a bit drying but will continue to use</li>
            <li> â€™s safe for the grandkids.</li>
            <li> I love the soap with all the applications ( shampoo, soap etc).  </li>
            <li> It is a product I have used for years and love it.</li>
            <li> We have been using Miracle II soap for many years.</li>
            <li> From head to toe you will not find a better soap.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my puppy because I love her and this stuff makes her smell nice and clean</li>
            <li> It is the most economical soap on the market, and it is a very Healthy soap to use, because it has not harmful ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> has a nice clean</li>
            <li> It is a great paraben free option and pure.  </li>
            <li> You can even clean or wash your laundry with it!</li>
            <li> Keeps my fingers from splitting, rinses easily, removes oil from my face without stripping, does dishes</li>
            <li> Strongly suggest you get the screw-on pump for it.</li>
            <li> This product is not FDA approved, and the manufacturer refuses to release all details relevant to its making.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - if it worked for you - great!</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> something smells familiar...</li>
            <li> Clothes come out clean and soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dish</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to clean my tub since -</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice and clear!</li>
            <li> Good for many other conditions.  </li>
            <li> Its wonderful....so mild, but also so rich.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> What a shame,  used to love the original undiluted formula and used to highly  recommended to my patients.  </li>
            <li> It has a fresh clean scent</li>
            <li> so I was delighted to see in on Amazon for less money and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about fifteen years as a face wash and at 65 most people comment that they can&#x27;t believe how young my face looks.</li>
            <li> I used to have to drive across town for this stuff and now it gets delivered right to my door.  </li>
            <li> Product was much more moisturizing than when ordered in past, but I liked that after I got used to it.</li>
            <li> Considering how great this stuff is for everything around the home, the foam issue is just a small inconvenience.</li>
            <li> but THIS is what I just realized: I have just (at this very moment) been making DIY laundry detergent that calls for Borax, Super Washing Soda and... Dawn dish soap.</li>
            <li> it if you use too much!</li>
            <li> , I put it in a foamer bottle and this gallon will last me more than a year using it at every sink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite soap, only type I use.</li>
            <li> The only soap in my home, It does everything promised and more.</li>
            <li> This soap really works miracles!</li>
            <li> Never used Dawn but have been reading countless opinions on how many uses it has at home from laundry detergent, carpet cleaner, fleas killer, etc.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that a foam separates at the top (probably the moisturizing ingredietns) and if you can&#x27;t shake it up (like say, because it&#x27;s in your shower dispenser)</li>
            <li> Notice that one of the ingredients listed is prayer and this alone may sell the product to some people but if you see the studies and watch videos of  how prayer works in conjunction with  water or food actually changes it chemically making it better for you -</li>
            <li> First time buying the moisturized version</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling clean but not dried out like soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it goes a long ways, can be used for everything.</li>
            <li> This is moisturizing soap, not the original soap, so it does not look exactly the same.</li>
            <li> very prompt service.</li>
            <li> Really like this soap.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely does NOT kill fleas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very concentrated</li>
            <li> I had a boss who would take a bath in Miracle II and use the water to water her plants &amp; her plants were absolutely</li>
            <li> think anyone with sensitivities would like this gentle, unscented soap: eczema, asthma, allergies, chronic fatigue, cancer, dermatitis, lupus, rashes, inflammation, diabetes - any issue where there may be breathing, skin or immune sensitivities.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve stopped using my straight iron to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, don&#x27;t want to write much about this product as I did not like it...</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> My whole family uses this soap, including the dogs.</li>
            <li> My whole family has been using it for years</li>
            <li> No matter how much grease and grime you have on you, you will leave no bathtub ring.</li>
            <li> Use to clean grease yet gentle enough to bathe in!</li>
            <li> am extremely well pleased with everything.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t need to buy any other soap for a year or more.</li>
            <li> A similar amount in your hand washes your hair squeaky clean, too.</li>
            <li> Or if you have another clean container with a hole or valve in the bottom, you can use that to separate the soap from the foam and put it back into the bottle.</li>
            <li> but I will say this: I will not be surprised if the miracle II soap is just a little bit of Dawn (don&#x27;t laugh, Dawn can be used and is used by many for bathing, cleaning animals from oil spills, washing dogs - recommended by vets because it is SAFEST to kills fleas on puppies, etc.</li>
            <li> There is white light green liquid floating on top.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it in the shower</li>
            <li> big bottle can last a couple years or more.</li>
            <li> I use some large  old soap dispensers for this stuff.</li>
            <li> It can be used as a household cleaner, a degreaser, dish soap, shampoo, body wash, just about anything that you would like to use a gentle and natural, pH-balanaced soap on.</li>
            <li> - feels soft and gentle yet cleanses thoroughly .</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase at the health food store</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love that it&#x27;s green or runny, but that doesn&#x27;t matter compared to what it does for me.  </li>
            <li> Just a few simple ingredients that make it nice for those with sensitivities, yet powerful enough to get almost any job done.</li>
            <li> I like the moisturizing property of this product, finding it to do that as I live in an arid climate in the southwestern US.  </li>
            <li> tangled, super dry.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and her fur is very soft and shiny after a bath in this soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is concentrated, which gives it a good value for the money because a single gallon usually lasts me 3 years.</li>
            <li> In the past I paid more for it and got it through a distributor</li>
            <li> I agree with everything positive everyone above says &amp; will try not to repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Large bottle will last forever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this is totally natural and has no phony fragrance my used gray water does not leave my house containing poison</li>
            <li> I am not exaggerating when I say that the fleas are completely repelled by the pH of this soap.  </li>
            <li> It completely eliminates the need for a flea comb after the bath.  </li>
            <li> It has cocoanut oil and is all natural.</li>
            <li> Use in the shower and bath... or anywhere that requires frequent hand washing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The gallon size is really a bargain compared to the smaller size over time.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased the whole line: deodorant, moisturizer, etc.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> It just has SO many uses, not only for washing dishes) and few \\&quot;other\\&quot; ingredients (</li>
            <li> When I get it I shake it up completely till it turns light turquoise with no white streaks &amp; pour what I can into a 1/2 gallon round plastic container</li>
            <li> especially if you have soft water!</li>
            <li> It nourishes my skin like no other product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Laundry... does a great job in the washing machine (for bad stains I add an enzyme spray before washing).  </li>
            <li> I have used this soap with young living essential oil added to it for bathing my dog.</li>
            <li> so I am careful about how much I use in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Also I don&#x27;t think this soap goes as far as the regular Miracle II does.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not realize, when ordering it, that it is the moisturizing type, or I would have looked for the regular, as I prefer the regular, but this is good soap anyway.  </li>
            <li> For people complaining that this soap makes their hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; or feel sort of sticky dry when using it - this is because your old shampoo and hair products leave a film of silicone on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money because each time I take a bath, I only using a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Had helped my 91 year old Father was his dry skin issue!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also fairly certain it killed my cat.</li>
            <li> This new shipment does not look like the other ones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t end up with that dry, stretched feeling after cleansing as it doesn&#x27;t strip all the natural oils.</li>
            <li> Same for the moisturizer - left my skin dry with some film on it.</li>
            <li> Should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Wipe it off, let it dry and no stain will be left.</li>
            <li> The soap made my skin dry, especially my hair:</li>
            <li> but they suggest that I go on line because the long ship date.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a long time.</li>
            <li> Be careful when pouring it out into a smaller container</li>
            <li> Big plus for anyone weak from autoimmune disorders, narcolepsy, elderly, physical disabilities, etc.... or anyone who would like to NOT have to deal with soap scum &amp; have more time for other things in life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it lasts a very long time once you dilute it according to your usage as explained on the label.  </li>
            <li> and I have very long hair and after some blow  </li>
            <li> Heals any type of rashes, dry or itchy skin, etc....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li> Same if you use it for laundry...VERY LITTLE...</li>
            <li> You only need a little on your sponge.</li>
            <li> It does sound crazy</li>
            <li> It has a  thin consistency, but it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> Once clothes come out wet, you cannot see the stain if it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> Before you wash newly-stained clothing, put a 1/2 teaspoon of it on a wet cloth.</li>
            <li> [It&#x27;s not a very foamy lather.]  </li>
            <li> so have to be careful what I use.</li>
            <li> it did not clear up dark spots like I hoped it would</li>
            <li> and I have had absolutely NO reaction to the product when using it on my skin</li>
            <li> However, having used this product before, I found this particular batch to be rather thin in viscosity.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It usually lasts us well over a year as we only use it for bathing.</li>
            <li> Bathed the cat with a small amount mixed into water, did not submerge head, and the animal immediately went lethargic dying about forty minutes afterward.</li>
            <li> Use extreme caution.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on all the other uses for it.</li>
            <li> I will always stay with Miracle II which can be used for bath and hand soap, and some friends use it for shampoo and dishes too, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll go back to the non-moisturing type or not.  </li>
            <li> I wish the price was less</li>
            <li> You can always bump it up a little, but you&#x27;ll be going through 50 rinse cycles</li>
            <li> The gallon is heavy to shake for me.</li>
            <li> Have been using this soap for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will order again.</li>
            <li> I keep some in a small spray bottle by the sink and spray my Rubbermaid when I&#x27;m done with my spaghetti sauce...</li>
            <li> A few rubs and the mark or grease stain will be gone!</li>
            <li> Soap usually arrives foamed up on the surface from shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the two starts I wrongfully gave last time.  </li>
            <li> No more chemical soaps for me -</li>
            <li> I am afraid to open it and use it.  </li>
            <li> Can use it to wash delicate clothes.  </li>
            <li> We purchase it by the gallon, and a gallon lasts us at least three months.</li>
            <li> residue in shower!No soap scum or scrubbing!</li>
            <li> If you try it in an automatic dishwasher, start with ONE capful (the cap is small and you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s too little, but it makes  suds like crazy and you&#x27;ll want to hurt yourself!)</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> If it remains faintly, the washing machine will finish the job.</li>
            <li> I am hoping I am wrong</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> I can have the worst day at work and come home, put 2 Tbsp of this soap into my tub and feel like a million bucks.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best all around total body soap I ever used</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap! It usually lasts us well over a year as we only use it for bathing.</li>
            <li> this is working very nicely. very prompt service. am extremely well pleased with everything.</li>
            <li> I have switched to using this soap for all my cleaning needs.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laundry... does a great job in the washing machine (for bad stains I add an enzyme spray before washing).  Clothes come out clean and soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dish washing... I wash my dishes by hand and this is effective for even greasy pots and pans&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body washing... I confess that I do not use this for my hair or teeth... but for the rest of my body it works well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is totally natural and has no phony fragrance my used gray water does not leave my house containing poison</li>
            <li> The gallon of Miracle II Moisturizing Soap I received in July 2013 appears, feels and cleans as if it has been diluted with water in comparison with  the Miracle II MS I bought in 2007.</li>
            <li> Product was much more moisturizing than when ordered in past, but I liked that after I got used to it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Use to clean grease yet gentle enough to bathe in! 1 gallon lasted me 2 1/2 years. Wash your clothes with it,only a tablespoon per load. HE approved.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!!! Just received a shipment December 2013. There is white light green liquid floating on top. Seems 1/4 of the soap is diluted. I have been using this soap since 2005. This new shipment does not look like the other ones. I am afraid to open it and use it.  Will definitely send it back. What a shame,  used to love the original undiluted formula and used to highly  recommended to my patients.  Must start using soap berries.....Only one star because have to rate it. It deserve zero.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Prompt. Just what I ordered! Will order again..</li>
            <li> This is excellent soap.  Unfortunately, I did not realize, when ordering it, that it is the moisturizing type, or I would have looked for the regular, as I prefer the regular, but this is good soap anyway.  It has a thinner texture than the regular, and you have to shake it before use to mix in the moisturizing agent. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love miracle 2 products. No nonsense type of cleanser. Just a few simple ingredients that make it nice for those with sensitivities, yet powerful enough to get almost any job done.</li>
            <li> I like the moisturizing property of this product, finding it to do that as I live in an arid climate in the southwestern US.  However, having used this product before, I found this particular batch to be rather thin in viscosity.  Regular Miracle II soap is thicker and lathers easier than this batch of MII Moisturizing soap did.  Not sure I will order again.</li>
            <li> Best soap I have found!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried Miracle II, you should. It removes make-up (including mascara) in a blink, and will remove most stains on clothing. It will also prevent your plastic storage (like Tupperware and Rubbermaid) from staining with tomato products like spaghetti sauce! Seriously! I keep some in a small spray bottle by the sink and spray my Rubbermaid when I&#x27;m done with my spaghetti sauce...just rinse and it&#x27;s nice and clear! We use it for washing dishes and have also replaced all our body washes with it. If you do NOT have color-treated hair, it makes a great shampoo (it will strip the hair dye out of your hair if you use hair color). If you try it in an automatic dishwasher, start with ONE capful (the cap is small and you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s too little, but it makes  suds like crazy and you&#x27;ll want to hurt yourself!) Same if you use it for laundry...VERY LITTLE...especially if you have soft water! You can always bump it up a little, but you&#x27;ll be going through 50 rinse cycles it if you use too much! LOL! It really is great! Have my daughter and my daughter-in-law stuck on it! I ship this to Oklahoma for them! I&#x27;ve  been using this I think about 10 years.</li>
            <li> IN love ! Great stuff</li>
            <li> Best soap ever!  Keeps my fingers from splitting, rinses easily, removes oil from my face without stripping, does dishes, I put it in a foamer bottle and this gallon will last me more than a year using it at every sink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite soap, only type I use. Worth the extra money for me anyway.</li>
            <li> The only soap in my home, It does everything promised and more.</li>
            <li> I used to have to drive across town for this stuff and now it gets delivered right to my door.  Boom.</li>
            <li> I love Miracle ll Moisturizing Soap. I have used Miracle ll products for over 10 years. I am allergic (skin &amp; respiratory) to a lot of products so when I found Miracle ll it was a good day. I have been faithful to them ever since and they have faithfully provided a quality product. That&#x27;s why I buy it by the gallon! 5 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Thank you for a great experience! The product arrived speedily and is as advertised. My skin has never looked or felt better!</li>
            <li> This soap really works miracles! I use it since many years! When I worked as a CNA in private home health care, I only used this soap with my clients. Best for skin problems, diaper rashes, bed soars etc. Just love it! You can even clean or wash your laundry with it! Truly outstanding</li>
            <li> I love this soap/bubble bath.  There is something about a bubble bath that is so relaxing.  I can not speak of miracles yet, but when I finish my bath with this product I do not have to scrub the tub.</li>
            <li> Really like this soap. Have been using for around  8 months. It does a good job moisturizing your skin as well as cleaning your skin and hair. A gallon lasts a while and is the most cost  effective. It has a  thin consistency, but it doesn&#x27;t take much. Both my sons use this as their shampoo. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely does NOT kill fleas. I&#x27;m also fairly certain it killed my cat. Bathed the cat with a small amount mixed into water, did not submerge head, and the animal immediately went lethargic dying about forty minutes afterward. This product is not FDA approved, and the manufacturer refuses to release all details relevant to its making. Use extreme caution.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have ever used on my face. I don&#x27;t end up with that dry, stretched feeling after cleansing as it doesn&#x27;t strip all the natural oils. I have been using this product for about fifteen years as a face wash and at 65 most people comment that they can&#x27;t believe how young my face looks. It doesn&#x27;t even burn if you get it in your eyes. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have no connection whatsoever with Tedco Inc. Their name and mine is nothing more than a coincidence. All I know about the company is that they did ship the soap as promised and it arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Miracle 2 soap IS the best soap on Earth. Incredibly concentrated and effective, but completely harmless to the body. You can put a tablespoon of soap on a washcloth and wash your entire body.  A similar amount in your hand washes your hair squeaky clean, too. Leaves no film on you. One gallon with 1 or 2 people lasts about a year in the bathroom. Ever get food on your clothes from a restaurant? Do not trust a washing machine to get any stain out. Once clothes come out wet, you cannot see the stain if it&#x27;s still there. Throw that in a dryers and then it locks-in the stain. Re-washing after that will accomplish nothing. Before you wash newly-stained clothing, put a 1/2 teaspoon of it on a wet cloth. A few rubs and the mark or grease stain will be gone! Wipe it off, let it dry and no stain will be left. If it remains faintly, the washing machine will finish the job. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 10 years. Strongly suggest you get the screw-on pump for it. Soap usually arrives foamed up on the surface from shipping and handling. Surface foam takes months (literally) to go away. A screw-on pump for the bottle will draw soap out from below the foam. Or if you have another clean container with a hole or valve in the bottom, you can use that to separate the soap from the foam and put it back into the bottle. Considering how great this stuff is for everything around the home, the foam issue is just a small inconvenience. This soap has a million uses I haven&#x27;t tried yet. Probably work great in the soap tank of a pressure washer, too. If you use it in a washing machine, MEASURE it and use only a very TINY amount - like about a teaspoon. Any more and it will foam up and out over the sides of the washer like a scene from the three stooges. It IS that concentrated!</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for over 6 years. It is concentrated, which gives it a good value for the money because a single gallon usually lasts me 3 years.</li>
            <li> I use this product for bathing...I normally purchase at the health food store but they suggest that I go on line because the long ship date. I&#x27;m glad I did because I get more for  my money.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.  Haven&#x27;t had to clean my tub since - it never leaves a soapy build up.  It&#x27;s very concentrated so it lasts a long time.  I mainly use it in the shower so I can&#x27;t comment on all the other uses for it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.  Miracle soap is a great product.  Heals any type of rashes, dry or itchy skin, etc....&lt;br /&gt;I even wash my dog with it!!</li>
            <li> Its a great soap for so many uses.  If your children love bubble baths it makes bubbles in the bathtub and safe non toxic.  I have used this soap with young living essential oil added to it for bathing my dog. My grandsons like it for showering with.  Can use it to wash delicate clothes.  Its a great soap to have on had.  I have used it for about 9 years.</li>
            <li> fill on bottle was low</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  It is concentrated so it lasts a very long time once you dilute it according to your usage as explained on the label.  It can be used as a household cleaner, a degreaser, dish soap, shampoo, body wash, just about anything that you would like to use a gentle and natural, pH-balanaced soap on. [Everything?]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite use is for bathing my dog.  I am not exaggerating when I say that the fleas are completely repelled by the pH of this soap.  The fleas literally jump off the dog with this product lathered on.  [It&#x27;s not a very foamy lather.]  It completely eliminates the need for a flea comb after the bath.  But, please remember to get the moisturizing version as the regular version is too drying for doggie&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This big bottle can last a couple years or more.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have ever used. Can use it for everything. I delute it with water and use in a foaming dispenser. It has cocoanut oil and is all natural. Works wonders on hair. Good for sensitive skin. Great for kids and elderly people. Use in the shower and bath... or anywhere that requires frequent hand washing.Its wonderful....so mild, but also so rich.  Large bottle will last forever. You won&#x27;t need to buy any other soap for a year or more.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing soap. A little goes a long way. You only need a little on your sponge. I use some large  old soap dispensers for this stuff. You have to give it a shake from time to time to mix up the moisturizer with the soap. You can also buy the soap only without the moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin so have to be careful what I use. This seems to be very low in toxic materials..  love it  I&#x27;m always worried they will stop making this stuff. Then what would I use...</li>
            <li> Sure makes me feel better. I love this product and the timely delivery was awesome.  I feel so much better when using this.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I love it. I was glad to find it in the gallon size.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I use it to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended that I try this \\&quot;Miracle II soap\\&quot; and I laughed when I saw that one of the ingredients was \\&quot;prayer\\&quot;.  Anyway, it is a FANTASTIC product!  I can have the worst day at work and come home, put 2 Tbsp of this soap into my tub and feel like a million bucks.  It nourishes my skin like no other product.  My skin feels soft and moisturized.  Well worth the money because each time I take a bath, I only using a small amount.  Love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I agree with everything positive everyone above says &amp; will try not to repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No residue in shower!No soap scum or scrubbing! Big plus for anyone weak from autoimmune disorders, narcolepsy, elderly, physical disabilities, etc.... or anyone who would like to NOT have to deal with soap scum &amp; have more time for other things in life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to everything &amp; can only use Miracle II soaps without breaking out in hives. If I can use this soap I would bet ANYONE can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have to SHAKE Moisturizing soap BEFORE EACH USE. (Miracle II does have another liquid soap that is NOT moisturizing if you don&#x27;t want to shake.) I bought a 22 oz Miracle II soap to have in the shower &amp; refill it. The gallon is heavy to shake for me. When I get it I shake it up completely till it turns light turquoise with no white streaks &amp; pour what I can into a 1/2 gallon round plastic container so it&#x27;s lighter to shake next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hand washing I bought a &#x27;foamer dispenser&#x27; where you pour in about a third of soap, add two thirds water &amp; the dispenser adds air to make it foamy. Makes soap last a lot longer for hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I had a boss who would take a bath in Miracle II and use the water to water her plants &amp; her plants were absolutely beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think anyone with sensitivities would like this gentle, unscented soap: eczema, asthma, allergies, chronic fatigue, cancer, dermatitis, lupus, rashes, inflammation, diabetes - any issue where there may be breathing, skin or immune sensitivities. Even great for pets!</li>
            <li> Have been using this soap for a few years now. It is wonderful as a shower soap and/or shampoo. The gallon size is really a bargain compared to the smaller size over time.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it goes a long ways, can be used for everything. I wish the price was less but I will purchase again. I have been using this soap for a long time.</li>
            <li> Had helped my 91 year old Father was his dry skin issue!  Good for many other conditions.  Check it out.</li>
            <li> We are using Miracle Soap exclusively in our home.  We purchase it by the gallon, and a gallon lasts us at least three months. We use it for washing our hands, for showers, and everything else in between. It is the most economical soap on the market, and it is a very Healthy soap to use, because it has not harmful ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> For people complaining that this soap makes their hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; or feel sort of sticky dry when using it - this is because your old shampoo and hair products leave a film of silicone on your hair.  Miracle II Moisturizing soap removes all of the shampoo and hair product build up in your hair and scalp.  Depending on how much of a build up you have in your hair, it can take a few shampoos of this soap to remove it from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes my hair shiny and smooth!!  I do not need a conditioner after it and I&#x27;ve stopped using my straight iron to get my hair straight.  This soap is pricey so I am careful about how much I use in my hair.  I also use it on my puppy because I love her and this stuff makes her smell nice and clean and her fur is very soft and shiny after a bath in this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how this soap has more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m soaking myself in man-made synthetic chemicals every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is huge!  Should last a long time.  Be careful when pouring it out into a smaller container - it&#x27;s a bit runny and will slosh!</li>
            <li> Sorry for the two starts I wrongfully gave last time.  This is moisturizing soap, not the original soap, so it does not look exactly the same. Five stars.</li>
            <li> So I used Miracle II Soap a while ago. I actually purchased the whole line: deodorant, moisturizer, etc. The soap made my skin dry, especially my hair: tangled, super dry. Same for the moisturizer - left my skin dry with some film on it. Anyway, don&#x27;t want to write much about this product as I did not like it... but THIS is what I just realized: I have just (at this very moment) been making DIY laundry detergent that calls for Borax, Super Washing Soda and... Dawn dish soap. Never used Dawn but have been reading countless opinions on how many uses it has at home from laundry detergent, carpet cleaner, fleas killer, etc. (just search the web!!!). So I am making this laundry detergent, adding ingredients and.... something smells familiar... OMG It might be just me but this dish soap smells just like the miracle II soap I had! I have to admit, I always liked the smell of that soap. I have a \\&quot;good nose\\&quot; and oh man! I am hoping I am wrong but I will say this: I will not be surprised if the miracle II soap is just a little bit of Dawn (don&#x27;t laugh, Dawn can be used and is used by many for bathing, cleaning animals from oil spills, washing dogs - recommended by vets because it is SAFEST to kills fleas on puppies, etc. It just has SO many uses, not only for washing dishes) and few \\&quot;other\\&quot; ingredients (whatever they are... maybe including the ingredients from on the bottle but omitting DAWN!!!). Sounds like Dawn is a miracle soap itself. Try it for yourself - SMELL IT! It does sound crazy but I keep going to the bottle to smell it and it smells just like miracle II soap. WOW. What a discovery haha. Or maybe someone has already wrote about it. OK. Back to my laundry detergent. Don&#x27;t waste your money - if it worked for you - great! But buy Dawn and let me know what you THINK!!!!</li>
            <li> it did not clear up dark spots like I hoped it would</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Miracle II soap for years and have always loved it. In the past I paid more for it and got it through a distributor so I was delighted to see in on Amazon for less money and free shipping.  Until now I didn&#x27;t know there was a moisturizing Miracle II and it really makes a difference.  I don&#x27;t have to use all the lotion I used to use so it saves time.  The downside is you have to shake it before decanting it and shake it each time before you use it as it stays separated.  Also I don&#x27;t think this soap goes as far as the regular Miracle II does.  I will always stay with Miracle II which can be used for bath and hand soap, and some friends use it for shampoo and dishes too, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll go back to the non-moisturing type or not.  Most of my friends use it and love it.  It&#x27;s a great product and a great deal on Amazon!</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this soap, including the dogs. It has a fresh clean scent and I now buy it by the gallon.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Leaves your skin feeling clean but not dried out like soap. Only thing is that a foam separates at the top (probably the moisturizing ingredietns) and if you can&#x27;t shake it up (like say, because it&#x27;s in your shower dispenser) you get two different layers. Bought the 1 Gallon jug and lasted me a year. Use it for shaving too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My whole family has been using it for years and it is truly a remarkable product. So good for irritated skin (poison ivy and bug bites esp).</li>
            <li> I use it for my body wash and in place of my shampoo and conditioner - so it&#x27;s an ALL in one product for me . I believe the product does a great job in cleaning and moisturizing and I have had absolutely NO reaction to the product when using it on my skin - feels soft and gentle yet cleanses thoroughly . I used to have to shampoo daily and use conditioner before using this product on my hair - now I do not have to shampoo as often and I have very long hair and after some blow  drying I Do Not get any tangles as the brush just glides through my hair . That in itself justifies my using this product ! Notice that one of the ingredients listed is prayer and this alone may sell the product to some people but if you see the studies and watch videos of  how prayer works in conjunction with  water or food actually changes it chemically making it better for you - then yes I will continue the use of this product . No more chemical soaps for me - your skin is the largest organ in your body - so we need to give it proper care !!! Where else do you the opportunity to wash with calcium magnesium and potassium - nothing on the market quite like this product !</li>
            <li> Love this soap been a longtime user can be a bit drying but will continue to use</li>
            <li> I have used Miracle ll Moisturizing Soap for two years.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice clean fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I can mix it with water and use it as a foaming hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;Itâ€™s safe for the grandkids.</li>
            <li> I love the soap with all the applications ( shampoo, soap etc).  Excellent value</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve every used.  My skin feels clean and happy when I use it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  I don&#x27;t love that it&#x27;s green or runny, but that doesn&#x27;t matter compared to what it does for me.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how soon the product arrived.  It is a product I have used for years and love it.</li>
            <li> We have been using Miracle II soap for many years. I have been purchasing from the company and distributors but Amazon has the best price. If you are looking for a mild but good soap try Miracle II. No matter how much grease and grime you have on you, you will leave no bathtub ring. Also good for your plumbing.  From head to toe you will not find a better soap.</li>
            <li> We use this for bathing pets in my hospital.  It is a great paraben free option and pure.  First time buying the moisturized version but I like it.  Even use it myself.  Good for cheap bubble bath.</li>
