            <li>I have returned to brunette (from highlighted blonde) to try to restore better condition to my hair.</li>
            <li>Made the grey hairs shine which makes it more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I tried this for my naturally strawberry blonde hair, which with age has lost its golden tones and become more mousy.  </li>
            <li>♡♡ wish they had a conditioner too because I normally do not wash my hair but because I love the color</li>
            <li>I actually wound up purchasing this product after reading amazing reviews for the blonde/silver version (i.e., [[ASIN:B0018PIY8Q Clairol Shimmer Lights Shampoo Blonde &amp; Silver]]).  </li>
            <li>It keeps my light red hair shiny and prevents that faded look.   </li>
            <li>I have med blonde hair, i use light  </li>
            <li>Several years ago my hair dresser told me about this great shampoo that would add highlights to my drab blonde hair without my having to go through the agony of using various hair color treatments, or frostings.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the way it smells put the pros</li>
            <li>Much better hue than with other color shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo has a funny smell but it does not bother me, it is not terrible, just smells a little chemical-y.</li>
            <li>I had my hair colored red for the past couple of months and this product makes my hair shine and makes it look very healthy!</li>
            <li>So I tried Radiant Redheads (too pinky) and Water Colors molten bronze (didn&#x27;t clean and left my hair all gummy).</li>
            <li>Seemed to clean well enough, but instead of depositing color, it stripped color out of my hair.</li>
            <li>--my hair is thin and fine, but this shampoo seems to make it more manageable.  </li>

            <li>I expected to see some change with the first use, but it has a really mild effect.  </li>
            <li>I will order again and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it is rather strong, and I suppose it does have a bit of an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; quality to it, but to me, it was actually a sweet, sentimental reminder of my grandmom, and even my husband said that it smells nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is not readily available in many stores in my area</li>
            <li>I use it on my grey hair and it turns a lovely soft platinum color not any shade of blue!</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally a medium ash brown, very mousy, so I help it with ammonia-free color to a lighter natural brown.</li>
            <li>I usually have to use a leave-in conditioner afterwards to prevent static and flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my dark golden blonde hair sparkle with copper highlights and super soft too!</li>
            <li>I am 79 years old.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find it in any stores near me</li>
            <li>Much to my dismay, it is no longer carried by our local Sally&#x27;s store, but I found it again on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If anything, the only thing that caught my attention after the first 1-2 shampoos were that my few gray hairs seemed to stand out more; I had hoped that maybe this product would actually help blend the grays until my next color (which, admittedly, I am due for), but true to the \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; in the name, it seemed to make them shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I get a very natural strawberry blonde! !</li>

            <li> I love the highlights it adds to my hair just by shampooing it.</li>
            <li> I actually wound up purchasing this product after reading amazing reviews for the blonde/silver version (i.e., [[ASIN:B0018PIY8Q Clairol Shimmer Lights Shampoo Blonde &amp; Silver]]).  The reviewers talked about how the shampoo brightened their highlights and left their hair looking shiny and wonderful, so when I discovered that there was a product for brunettes as well (I have medium brown hair), I decided to pick up a bottle from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews I had read (on the web site Makeup Alley) came with several cautions, including the following:  1) you need to leave the shampoo on your hair for several minutes, 2) the color of the product is a bright bronze (the blonde/silver version is actually purple!), 3) the shampoo is very drying, and finally, 4) it smells awful!  Well, my first surprise was that I actually LIKED the scent of the shampoo.  Yes, it is rather strong, and I suppose it does have a bit of an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; quality to it, but to me, it was actually a sweet, sentimental reminder of my grandmom, and even my husband said that it smells nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first use, I did make sure to leave the product on for some time.  It did seem a bit strong--i.e., my hair felt quite squeaky clean after!--and so I made sure to condition well following use of the shampoo.  But although I liked the overall feel of my hair after the first shampoo, to be honest, I didn&#x27;t really notice any other difference.  If anything, the only thing that caught my attention after the first 1-2 shampoos were that my few gray hairs seemed to stand out more; I had hoped that maybe this product would actually help blend the grays until my next color (which, admittedly, I am due for), but true to the \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; in the name, it seemed to make them shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did stick with the product, however, and after about 3-4 shampoos, I definitely DID begin to notice a difference.  Prior to my last coloring (several months ago), I had done a few highlights, and for the first time in months, those highlights seem to be standing out again!  Overall, my hair looks shiny and healthy, and I love how the shampoo makes my hair feel as well--my hair is thin and fine, but this shampoo seems to make it more manageable.  As noted above, I am due to color my hair again, and I am eager to see how this shampoo will work fresh after coloring my hair.  The only downside to this shampoo is the price; at almost ten dollars a bottle, I wouldn&#x27;t really consider it to be an everyday shampoo.  However, I am hoping that once I color again, I can continuing using this shampoo as an occasional refresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am glad I found this, and I would definitely recommend it!t time in months, those highlights seem to be standing out again!

            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s supposedly discontinued.  I like the golden highlights it adds to my greying light brown hair.  Much better hue than with other color shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve used this product for close to 10 years and will hate to see it go.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a funny smell but it does not bother me, it is not terrible, just smells a little chemical-y. The shampoo comes out as this dark orange-brown color and actually stays orange as you sud up. However it does not stain your tub or skin and does maintain the color in your hair. (My hair is dyed dark red). This shampoo should not be used as a cleanser -- shampoo &amp; condition first and then use the Shimmer Lights with tepid water as a color preserving agent. My only complaint is that it tends to dry out your hair and in winter weather make it staticy.

            <li> My hair stylist has recommended this product to tone down my hair color and it has been working great. I definitely recommend this product. I just wish they offered the brunette one in stores; they only sell for blonde hair types in my area.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It keeps my light red hair shiny and prevents that faded look.   A gentle shampoo perfect for a touch of red.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, sorry I can&#x27;t find it anymore to buy it</li>
            <li> Makes my dark golden blonde hair sparkle with copper highlights and super soft too!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!! Love love love it! Use gloves so you do not discolor your nails! I have med blonde hair, i use light  blonde to color it then this shampoo and I get a very natural strawberry blonde! ! I love the color!!♡♡ wish they had a conditioner too because I normally do not wash my hair but because I love the color It makes I still use it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it just highlights your natural red…</li>
            <li> Great boost of color and shine. This product is not readily available in many stores in my area and I really appreciate being able to order it through Amazon.  I have used this product for 8 years and re-ordered again and again.</li>
            <li> Made the grey hairs shine which makes it more noticeable. Not the desired effect. My aunt uses it with good results, just not for me</li>
            <li> My wife loves this shampoo as it helps her maintain here highlights without turning them blonde.  She is a medium to dark brunette with reddish highlights.</li>
            <li> I tried this for my naturally strawberry blonde hair, which with age has lost its golden tones and become more mousy.  I expected to see some change with the first use, but it has a really mild effect.  I  leave it on for 5-10 minutes each use and after 3-4 weeks my golden tones were a bit restored.  It&#x27;s harsh and leaves my hair feeling kind of crispy, though, so I&#x27;m not sure I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Been using this shampoo for at least 15 years. My hair stays the same light brown with very little gray. I am 79 years old.</li>
            <li> I like Shimmer Lights shampoo for brunette and red hair even though my hair is a mousy gray with blonde highlights.Thank you for having this shampoo in stock.. I will order again and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what it does to enhance the color that a squeeze of lemon or tomato juice couldn&#x27;t do better.  This shampoo is not what I look forward to using as I didn&#x27;t like how it left the texture.  Might try it again with another conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten mousy and cool over the years so i switched to a color-depositing shampoo to replace the warm tones. I tried this one that i bought at Salky Beauty. I loved it so mich i went back to buy more, but they were out and didnt know when they woukd have more.  Boo! So I tried Radiant Redheads (too pinky) and Water Colors molten bronze (didn&#x27;t clean and left my hair all gummy). So, i&#x27;ve come back to this and am ordering extras online so i don&#x27;t run out.  It puts those warm tones back and and cleans it well, leaving it shiny. One caveat: do NOT order from Cosmetic Solutions, they are a poor and slow shipper.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have tried many &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; products and have not been very impressed with any of them. I had my hair colored red for the past couple of months and this product makes my hair shine and makes it look very healthy!</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair and holds my color in longer.  I can&#x27;t seem to find it in any stores near me</li>
            <li> Several years ago my hair dresser told me about this great shampoo that would add highlights to my drab blonde hair without my having to go through the agony of using various hair color treatments, or frostings.  Much to my dismay, it is no longer carried by our local Sally&#x27;s store, but I found it again on Amazon.  It is my understanding that Shimmer Lights plans to discontinue the &amp;#34;Brunette and Red&amp;#34; and is now only making a shampoo to brighten white hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find anything better.  Would recommend it highly.  I use it on my grey hair and it turns a lovely soft platinum color not any shade of blue!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT.  I HAVE BLOND HIGHLIGHTS WHICH TEND TO FADE.  THIS WAS SUGGESTED BY MY STYLIST AND IT PERFORMS AS WELL AS SHE SAID IT WOULD.  I USE IT TWICE A WEEK.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo every other day to keep my hair red.  Then I don&#x27;t have to dye it.</li>
            <li> It changed my hair from dusty grey to the red it used to be-and looks extremely natural.Friends can not&lt;br /&gt;tell  I have used a coloring shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo stains my skin, therefore, I can&#x27;t use it! It smells good! I wish I could use it!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It gives some color to the grey in my hair.</li>
            <li> Touching up my roots every two weeks has been too much.  This shampoo makes it so that I can go 4.  I have dark blonde hair.  It also makes my hair shiny.  I don&#x27;t really like the way it smells put the pros outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!! I have returned to brunette (from highlighted blonde) to try to restore better condition to my hair. My hair is naturally a medium ash brown, very mousy, so I help it with ammonia-free color to a lighter natural brown. I wanted my hair to be a little more interesting without spending a lot or adding damaging color. This shampoo brings out very subtle auburn tones gradually, if used consistently. It does not come out orange. I was worried when I read it might be drying, but for me it actually softens and detangles my hair. It has been good for the overall condition. I have had a lot of compliments on the auburn. Actually, I wish it was more vivid, but for the money and convenience, I am happy. I purchased first on Amazon, but found it at a local Sally&#x27;s the second time and spent a little less. I am looking for the conditioner now!</li>
            <li> Seemed to clean well enough, but instead of depositing color, it stripped color out of my hair. Not worth the money.</li>
