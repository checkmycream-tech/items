            <li>and they said that their newer formula, which I saw advertised on QVC, is much better, has more of the active ingredient, and is a different size.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>It was fast postage</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Really like it, and it seems to do the job.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>

            <li>; I do not have sensitive skin under normal circumstances.</li>
            <li>I have definitely seen better results from StriVectin Neck Cream in less time.</li>
            <li>This product was not the same as the real thing.</li>
            <li>I started to read reviews and many others complained about the smell.</li>
            <li>I have been using StriVectin neck cream for about two years and seems to work on my 58 year old &amp;#34;turkey neck.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I think it was an old jar, however it seems to be working</li>
            <li>Especially on the upper chest area below the neck where us girls tend to start looking a little older if wearing a top that shows below the neck!&lt;br</li>

            <li> I am not going to be too quick to say that is not a good product.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for a short time, I developed a scaly roughness on my neck, the skin dried out, and my neck stung like the skin was chapped.  </li>
            <li> This particular jar had a slight odor to it and the color was not right.  </li>
            <li> also, the product had a strange smell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough(few weeks) to tell if there is a difference with my neck.</li>
            <li> Clearly, not a product I would recommend</li>
            <li> Firm and not wrinkly and loose so far.  </li>
            <li> Have used other products such as Nectifirm and although I like Nectifirm</li>
            <li> I am in my early fifties and only have a few slight lines at this time</li>
            <li> The real contents are white and heavy whereas the product I received was yellow and thin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> Even though it was in a sealed box the cream was dark yellow instead of the usual white.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed and saw absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND NOT WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> have gotten other products from Amazon with no problems but this was a rip</li>
            <li> When jar was opened, cream was waxy, not creamy, and dark tan color.  </li>
            <li> It is an odd smell</li>
            <li> Guess they haven&#x27;t heard \\&quot;less is more.\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the jar I thought it had gone bad but&lt;</li>
            <li> Was not the texture or color of the usual strict in neck cream that I had purchased from ultra in the past</li>
            <li> I put it in my face for first time and I kept such horrible odor in my face so that I have to wash my face to remove the cream and the odor.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product at department stores but decided to try the amazon.com vendor, who had a substantial discount.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother I&#x27;m so tired of these expensive products that don&#x27;t live up to their promises.</li>
            <li> Could hardly wait to receive it.  </li>
            <li> I will give it at least another 60 days to see if there is an improvement.</li>
            <li> negative side of this cream for me would be the smell.</li>
            <li> Unable to register any change in my turkey neck due to the discomfort of the remedy.  </li>
            <li> Was afraid it was too long on the shelf or had been opened at some point.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed and not sure I want to spend the money to send it back, but I won&#x27;t be buying this product from Amazon.com anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> DUH!</li>
            <li> I use strivectin it works,the neck area is especially delicate, this has an odd smell</li>
            <li> The facial cream that I received has a horrible odor.</li>
            <li> I considered giving up vanity--but at my age it&#x27;s difficult to break a habit.</li>
            <li> It is too expensive though and the packaging is misleading.</li>
            <li> I just received my StriVectin neck cream and it&#x27;s a fake...</li>
            <li> use it at night not in the morning as I&#x27;m afraid others might get a wiff of it.</li>
            <li> Waxy consistency makes it impossible to spread on neck evenly.  </li>
            <li> Bad: I can&#x27;t breath</li>
            <li> Bad news</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was not the texture or color of the usual strict in neck cream that I had purchased from ultra in the past</li>
            <li> This product really works. Began to use it a year ago. Bought at Elder Beerman. What a mistake it is cheaper through Amazon. DUH! No longer need to wear turtlenecks.</li>
            <li> I am 67 and started using this product a year ago.  I definitely see the difference on my neck and décolleté area.  I enjoy wearing v-neck tops and beautiful jewelry and this product has given me new confidence to look my best.</li>
            <li> I use strivectin it works,the neck area is especially delicate, this has an odd smell but it really works my neck is firm and not a hint of turkey gobler.  I love this stuff I will by more!</li>
            <li> I have use this for almost a month and have noticed a big difference in my neck.  I use it am and pm.  My neck looks tighter and smoother.  Does it look like it did when I was 20? no, but it sure looks way better than it did.  I love this stuff.  In fact, I plan on trying the eye cream next.</li>
            <li> Bottom Line: It tightens my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: I look way younger&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: I can&#x27;t breath</li>
            <li> I have seen lots and lots of raving reviews about StriVectin products.  Could hardly wait to receive it.  Put it on and the next morning my neck was covered with a rash.  Left StriVectin off and the rash went away.  Am I the only person this happened to?  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The facial cream that I received has a horrible odor. I put it in my face for first time and I kept such horrible odor in my face so that I have to wash my face to remove the cream and the odor. The following day I tried to put the cream again and I had the same problem. I don´t know if I received a damage cream. I bought this brand the lasta year (eye cream) abd I did not have that problem, just until now with this reference.</li>
            <li> Wonderful-  really helps the crepe neck from occurring as you age.  Very worthwhile expense if you are having issues with extra skin.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product at department stores but decided to try the amazon.com vendor, who had a substantial discount. This product was not the same as the real thing. I called Strivectin and they confirmed it is a knock-off product. The real contents are white and heavy whereas the product I received was yellow and thin. The vendor agreed to take it back but I had to pay for the return postage and was not reimbursed by them. Several of the cosmetics I have purchased thru amazon are fake, so I am going back to paying more but getting the real stuff.</li>
            <li> The Strivectin neck cream was at a very good price but not the latest Strivectin neck cream on the market.  The new one is lighter in color and is the latest break thru with better wrinkle solving properties.  Will try to see if this one does any good.Amazon has good prices.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND NOT WORTH THE MONEY. CHEAPER PRODUCTS WILL WORK JUST AS WELL</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks.  At this point I believe it has helped with my appearance, although my weight loss may be helping as well.  I am willing to continue using it to see if any additional benefits are coming.</li>
            <li> I used it for a month and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement,  will continue to use all of the cream to see if any improvement. I didn&#x27;t feel any tightening after applying the cream to my neck as one might expect.</li>
            <li> I have used the product before and like the results. The 3 stars is for the condition it came in. Even though it was in a sealed box the cream was dark yellow instead of the usual white. Apparently even though sold as new it had been open before.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and I like it. It was fast postage and I recommend this product and seller! THANKS!</li>
            <li> The old formula was thicker and needed body heat to make it looser, however,it went much further. The new formula is whipped and thinner, it requires much more product&lt;br /&gt;to get the same coverage. Bad news</li>
            <li> You can tell by the picture that this is the very old formula Stri Vectin neck cream. I called Stri Vectin and they said that their newer formula, which I saw advertised on QVC, is much better, has more of the active ingredient, and is a different size. The newer formula has 5% NIA-114 and is 1.7 oz. This might not be working for some reviewers because it is a weaker formula and maybe even out of date. I believe cosmetics are only good for 2 years, so maybe this is too old as well as being weaker.</li>
            <li> What more does one need say? I&#x27;m old, fallng apart--but this item does help! I considered giving up vanity--but at my age it&#x27;s difficult to break a habit. And if I&#x27;m going to hang on to such a thing \\&quot;support\\&quot; helps&lt;br /&gt;and this product provides it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that I could purchase this wonderful, effective, product at such a reasonable price and have it delivered in no time!  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Have used StriVectin for years.  Really like it, and it seems to do the job.  Have several of their products.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream a month a go, still don&#x27;t notice any improvement.  I am not going to be too quick to say that is not a good product.  I will give it at least another 60 days to see if there is an improvement.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal!  Items sells for $90.00 in stores! Best Neck Cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Works in tightening and smoothing neck wrinkles.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product really works. Especially on the upper chest area below the neck where us girls tend to start looking a little older if wearing a top that shows below the neck!&lt;br /&gt;Try it and you will be hooked!</li>
            <li> The neck cream feels good and helps improving sagging skin.It is too expensive though and the packaging is misleading. It is okay !</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Arrived promptly.  Product was as expected and at a reasonable price.  Will reorder from this site again.  Thank you.</li>

            <li> Have used other products such as Nectifirm and although I like Nectifirm I have definitely seen better results from StriVectin Neck Cream in less time. I will continue to use StriVectin and recommend to any woman looking for a good Neck Cream.</li>
            <li> This was such a waste of money and it wasn&#x27;t cheap. I used it as directed and saw absolutely no difference. Don&#x27;t bother I&#x27;m so tired of these expensive products that don&#x27;t live up to their promises.</li>
            <li> THE SHIPMENT ARRIVED IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS AND MY WIFE LOVES THE WAY IT WORKS. USES IT MOST EVERY DAY</li>
            <li> This product does not work and the colour is off.  It also does not smell very good.  I would not look to order again</li>
            <li> apparently this product was near its expiration date when I recieved it from amazon.  I called the strivectin co. and checked the serial numbers.  strivectin no longer makes this formulaiton and have taken it off its department store shelves.  also, the product had a strange smell.</li>
            <li> I decided I had to write a review.  I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.  A friend of mine asked me why my neck wasn&#x27;t aging like everyone elses.  I hadn&#x27;t even thought about it, but I actually realized it was working and when I look at my neck compared to others my age (I&#x27;m 54) I realized that mine looks the same as it did when I was in my early 40s.  Firm and not wrinkly and loose so far.  I will keep using this product, especially after recognizing that yah, my neck looks pretty good!  I have been using it religiously for about a year now.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough(few weeks) to tell if there is a difference with my neck. I am in my early fifties and only have a few slight lines at this time but I thought I&#x27;d try it out.&lt;br /&gt;The negative side of this cream for me would be the smell. When I first opened the jar I thought it had gone bad but&lt;br /&gt;then I started to read reviews and many others complained about the smell. It is an odd smell so I can only bring myself&lt;br /&gt;to use it at night not in the morning as I&#x27;m afraid others might get a wiff of it. The cream itself goes on smooth and I&#x27;m interested to see if it makes any difference over the course of completing the jar.</li>
            <li> When I received the item the package was generic, the label not the exact wording of the actual Strivectin product and not sealed.&lt;br /&gt;I still had a jar of the actual Strivectin Cream I purchased directly from the website and it is not the same.  I am returning it.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on me - buyer beware.  If it seems too good to be true ----it probably is.</li>
            <li> This seller was awesome!  I only gave the product four stars because I haven&#x27;t seen any remarkable difference yet but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a month.  I&#x27;ll update if/when I notice something.</li>
            <li> I have been using StriVectin neck cream for about two years and seems to work on my 58 year old &amp;#34;turkey neck.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just received my StriVectin neck cream and it&#x27;s a fake...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not white like the original cream I have gotten but tan.&lt;br /&gt; I am so disappointed and not sure I want to spend the money to send it back, but I won&#x27;t be buying this product from Amazon.com anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten other products from Amazon with no problems but this was a rip off.&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for and I only paid $31.00.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY FROM:  BEST closeouts...they don&#x27;t sell the real deal!</li>
            <li> Okay, so it doesn&#x27;t do what it promises.  but what it does, I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Amazon says I need more words.  Guess they haven&#x27;t heard \\&quot;less is more.\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> I use this product and see results.  This particular jar had a slight odor to it and the color was not right.  I think it was an old jar, however it seems to be working so I am not sending it back</li>
