            <li>Going at the hair from the side does not give the best results.</li>
            <li>All the Best, MLC</li>
            <li>This is a very good efficient product and does a great job.  </li>

            <li>item is good.</li>
            <li>All good no complaints.</li>
            <li>of course, this is  cool mom &amp; daughter picks :D</li>
            <li>However, electric nose hair trimmers, including the best, have three distinct disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>safe and handy!</li>
            <li>This is the best trimmer I have used, it does exactly what it claims it will do.</li>
            <li>But the Platinum XL is absolutely just the best thing since sliced bread!</li>
            <li>The TrimIt works nice on the ears too, but I often feel that I am just clacking along with no sense of how the job is going.</li>
            <li>The Platinum XL is easily the best Nose/Ear trimmer I have ever used, and the TrimIt is worth your consideration if it suits your style.</li>
            <li>Great product, well built, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It is nicely balanced and it the pressure to squeeze it is very light.   </li>
            <li>I can not for the life of me understand anyone who says this does a competent job.</li>
            <li>Not that others haven&#x27;t worked as well but none have worked better plus the others all use batteries and eventually stop working.</li>
            <li>The more I think about it, I&#x27;m probably being generous giving the Wing XL three stars because of the pain issue.  </li>
            <li>but it is just ok</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t use batteries.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can find ones he likes better.</li>
            <li>I do a better job on ear hair with my shaver.</li>
            <li>This device does not cut most hairs.</li>
            <li>Takes forever and with most strokes it cuts no hairs.</li>
            <li>I thought that there had to be a better way than this</li>
            <li>and it is ok...</li>
            <li>but it works ok.</li>
            <li>though it looks like the top of an electric nose trimmer, it does cut like an electric model.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Also, the tactile feel of using two hands made me feel more in control.   </li>
            <li>(the side burn attachment is ok</li>

            <li>bought him this new one</li>

            <li>Top notch nose / ear hair trimmer from a company that offers support.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company to obtain a replacement spring for a trimmer, and I had it in a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is a pretty simple device.</li>
            <li>That being said, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as an electric trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I just want to warn people DO NOT use this thing near your eyes, ears or nose.</li>

            <li>On Stainless Steel Cap for Extra</li>
            <li>chief complaints are it is not as precise as the old one, nor does it feel as well made, the mechanical action is jerky not smooth...</li>
            <li>I believe you must have a thick jungle in your nose to make this product worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>It is true that the XL (and the TrimIt) require a little more time than the battery operated ones that I have used (those that actually cut hair), but the extra time spent was negligible.</li>
            <li>last might be the most important to the less habitually fastidious among us because if your trimmer isn&#x27;t right there in your pocket, like your comb, you will be unable to deal with any hair emergencies that you notice in the mirror while you are out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The obvious disadvantage about this type is that it&#x27;s a little bulkier in the pocket than the two handed barrel type; the less obvious disadvantage is that if you have two good hands, you may prefer the precision of two handed</li>
            <li>very slippery when wet.  </li>
            <li>they said its really works than the other battery trimmer.</li>
            <li>The 5.0 twirls the blade so fast that my eyes watered, and that&#x27;s no joke...and no fun either.</li>
            <li>I assume the electics go dull quickly and the batteries are always running down!Honestly the \\&quot;Trimit\\</li>
            <li>i wondered what it was... after being accused by my girlfriend about constantly picking my nose, much to my dismay, i figured out that my nasal hair was slightly longer than what i wanted it to be for someone of that age.    </li>

            <li> Here is the review that I posted on the Groom Mate Platinum XL model in which I compared it to this TrimIt model with a few extra comments on this TrimIt model:    </li>
            <li> You must be a little careful and squeeze it twice</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift as my cousin had been looking for the same product over the past few years with no success.  </li>
            <li> very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Even though I did not pay a huge price for this trimmer I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; mechanism basically turns the rotary clipping blades a few revolutions on the squeeze... and another few on the release.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times already</li>
            <li> In most cases it pulls them out very painfully.</li>
            <li> But once mastered, it trims unwanted hair as neatly and efficiently as any batter-powered unit I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
            <li> Itâs not sold in any of the usual places you would expect.  </li>
            <li> I was fully expecting the Japanese made one-handed TrimIt model to wipe the floor with the two-handed XL, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Not worth the risk!!!</li>
            <li> I am keeping the name of this company, just incase he loses them.</li>
            <li> When I went to my ears, I feared that having to use two hands to use the XL trimmer would lead to a clumsy experience: That fear was unfounded.</li>
            <li> The Remington model is decently made but is worthless for cutting nose hair</li>
            <li> It cuts hairs in difficult to get at places well without hurting</li>
            <li> so i invested - or at least purchased all sorts of electronic wizardry to cut through those annoying hairs and scizzors also.    </li>
            <li> I would like to say this thing is DANGEROUS.</li>
            <li> Impossible to get a close trim.</li>
            <li> Yes, the TrimIT Wing would appear to be easier to use if your looking for something to operate with one hand, but it pulls the hairs out a lot and can be somewhat painful.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to buy another!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s sick of itchy nose syndrome!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- One handed operation&lt;br /&gt;- No batteries needed&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to store thanks to the case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It takes a great deal of effort to cut stubborn hairs&lt;br /&gt;- Sometimes hairs get ripped out instead of cut, which has led to infections in my nose</li>
            <li> This is a small nose hair trimmer High quality! sharp and safe. You must be a little careful and squeeze it twice or you may pull a hair. I recommend this to all who travel extensivly. or just want quality.</li>
            <li> I can not for the life of me understand anyone who says this does a competent job. Mine broke after 3 uses. The \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; mechanism basically turns the rotary clipping blades a few revolutions on the squeeze... and another few on the release. It totally blows. You need the RPMs of one of the plastic cheap-o models despite the latter requiring replacement every year or two. Avoid this one. Trust me.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works so well and smoothly I thought it was malfunctioning, until I checked my nose! Great product, well built, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> My opinion is that this is the best nosehair trimmer I&#x27;ve used. Not that others haven&#x27;t worked as well but none have worked better plus the others all use batteries and eventually stop working. I don&#x27;t see why my own son shouldn&#x27;t inherit this fine tool one day far in the future.</li>
            <li> I have both the Groom Mat TrimIT Wing XL and the Groom Mate Platinum XL Trimmer.  The reviewer Stardreamers also has both and while he inicates in text that he prefers the Platinum XL, he gives the TrimIT five stars.  On the basis of comparison, I give the TrimIT three stars and the Platinum XL five stars. Yes, the TrimIT Wing would appear to be easier to use if your looking for something to operate with one hand, but it pulls the hairs out a lot and can be somewhat painful.  It does not CUT the hairs.  It PULLS the hairs out.  Ouch!!!  This is not at all the case with the Platinum XL.  Yes, the Platinum XL is awkard to use, but far more comfortable.  It CUTS the hairs.  The more I think about it, I&#x27;m probably being generous giving the Wing XL three stars because of the pain issue.  I definitely recommend the Platinum XL over the Wing XL.</li>
            <li> Even though I did not pay a huge price for this trimmer I was disappointed.  I believe you must have a thick jungle in your nose to make this product worthwhile.  It did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> I expected more - it works but it is just ok</li>
            <li> This trimmer will last forever and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t use batteries.  That being said, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as an electric trimmer.  If you take a close look at compare the reason is that most electric trimmers have a thinner guage of metal on the outside that shears with the actual rotating blade.  If I had a grinder at my apartment I&#x27;d try to grind around the outside of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a pair of non-electric trimmers all over town and I finally found them on the net. My husband really likes these. It&#x27;s odd to say that nose trimmers are really nice, but they are. They do the job perfectly. I am keeping the name of this company, just incase he loses them. I don&#x27;t think I can find ones he likes better.</li>
            <li> High quality, but slow to use.  You must hunt down each individual hair to get the job done.  A weekend project.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work as suggested. I do a better job on ear hair with my shaver.</li>
            <li> This device does not cut most hairs. In most cases it pulls them out very painfully. Impossible to get a close trim. Takes forever and with most strokes it cuts no hairs. I have the product and don&#x27;t use it anymore.    --Victor</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Trimit\\&quot; is the first trimmer I have ever bought.I wanted to avoid the battery powered type.I assume the electics go dull quickly and the batteries are always running down!Honestly the \\&quot;Trimit\\&quot; didnt work very well for me .It just didnt get the hairs!I might try a good electric or go back to the small sizzors that are made for this purpose.</li>
            <li> This is a very good efficient product and does a great job.  When I made my purchase, it was a very easy and fast transaction, shipped to me quickly and the company service is outstanding, I highly recommend them and would definitely purchase from them again, buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Unique father&#x27;s day gifts!&lt;br /&gt;My friends use this trimmer they said its really works than the other battery trimmer. safe and handy! of course, this is  cool mom &amp; daughter picks :D</li>
            <li> I chose the Groom Mate TrimIT Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer because it was hand-operated (I wanted something that did not require a battery) and because it appeared to be well-made (two battery-powered plastic units I&#x27;ve purchased broke after a year or two and had to be discarded). The article proved to be as solidly-made as the illustration suggested. Its stainless construction promises years of dependable service with nothing more than a few squeezes of my fingers. It takes a bit of getting used to at first, learning to aim accurately while squeezing your fingers together. But once mastered, it trims unwanted hair as neatly and efficiently as any batter-powered unit I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
            <li> First, thank you for the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is good. As a matter of fact I&#x27;d bougth it to me and my brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are glad that the item arrive here down in Brazil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is what we expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again.</li>
            <li> For some reason, about 6 years ago when i was 22, i started getting an itchy nose... i wondered what it was... after being accused by my girlfriend about constantly picking my nose, much to my dismay, i figured out that my nasal hair was slightly longer than what i wanted it to be for someone of that age.    Anyway, i had no clue of what i should do apart from ask my girlfriend what to do.  OH Yeah! She took great pleasure in plucking my superflous hairs with the use of tweezers resulting in my many tears :( I thought that there had to be a better way than this so i invested - or at least purchased all sorts of electronic wizardry to cut through those annoying hairs and scizzors also.    6 years on i finally stumble across this device... I live in England and i&#x27;ve never seen such a product on the market here. But the Platinum XL is absolutely just the best thing since sliced bread! I&#x27;ve used this a few times already and you soon get used to the two-handled operation.  It cuts (not pulls), it&#x27;s comfortable (not irritating) and most of all robust and certainly built to last (not broken after a few uses).    I would recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s sick of itchy nose syndrome! Go for it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift as my cousin had been looking for the same product over the past few years with no success.  Itâs not sold in any of the usual places you would expect.  He loves this product and said it was exactly what he was looking for, performance and all :)</li>
            <li> very sharp.  very slippery when wet.  quicker and easier to use than groom mate.  made in japan.  yup.  used it in america.</li>
            <li> Top notch nose / ear hair trimmer from a company that offers support.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company to obtain a replacement spring for a trimmer, and I had it in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great trimmer and I&#x27;ve used it for years. It is a single handed device, so use your free hand to tug and push your nose or ear into a position that allows the trimmer to get directly at the tips of the hair you want to trim. Going at the hair from the side does not give the best results. With the hand holding this trimmer, you smoothly and continuously squeeze the handles to keep the cutter in motion. Now you&#x27;ll trim the hair, and experience the fewest pulls as possible.&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty simple device. It really does not require instructions, but if you are prone to giving up quickly, try the above to get up to speed quickly.</li>
            <li> I would like to say this thing is DANGEROUS. I used one on my nose and the spring broke sending part of it LIKE A NAIL GUN into my nose!  Blood streamed out like I&#x27;ve never seen before.  I was ready to call 911 but I eventually got the bleeding to stop.  I just want to warn people DO NOT use this thing near your eyes, ears or nose. I was lucky that I didn&#x27;t lose hearingï»¿ or eyesight (can only imagine someone using it on eyebrows or ear hair. The spike (broken spring) did sink a good 1/4\\&quot; to 1/2\\&quot; into my skin. It was a very scary experience from such an innocent looking device.  It needs a redesign just to prevent the spring from shooting out if it breaks. Not worth the risk!!!</li>
            <li> All good no complaints. It cuts hairs in difficult to get at places well without hurting and I like that it has no batteries.</li>
            <li> My dad had one of these rotary trimmers for 30 years....worked great.  It finally wore out- bought him this new one and it is ok...chief complaints are it is not as precise as the old one, nor does it feel as well made, the mechanical action is jerky not smooth...but it works ok.</li>
            <li> Could they?  If you even had to think about it, much less run to a mirror and check, you need this product or something similar, and with nose and ear hair trimmers you&#x27;ve got a couple of ways to go: manual or electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With electric, you&#x27;ve got a huge number of choices, including the one Hammacher Schlemmer currently rates as the best [[ASIN:B00BCGAOVQ Wahl 5546-400 Lithium Powered Lighted Detailer]].  However, electric nose hair trimmers, including the best, have three distinct disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They are noisy.&lt;br /&gt;2. They require batteries.&lt;br /&gt;3. There too large to comfortably fit in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That last might be the most important to the less habitually fastidious among us because if your trimmer isn&#x27;t right there in your pocket, like your comb, you will be unable to deal with any hair emergencies that you notice in the mirror while you are out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, if you go with a manual trimmer, the next question is one handed or two.  If one handed, your choice is made; you will need something like this [[ASIN:B0001MBRYK Groom Mate Silver Wing XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]].  The chief advantage of this type is speed; you can safely trim squeezing the wing handles as fast as you can.  The obvious disadvantage about this type is that it&#x27;s a little bulkier in the pocket than the two handed barrel type; the less obvious disadvantage is that if you have two good hands, you may prefer the precision of two handed operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the two handed type you&#x27;ve got several choices:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00LBZY16W Groom Mate Classic Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]],&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000EBFJXS Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]],&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00LC201MM Groom Mate Platinum XL Plus Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]],&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008ZPW36Q Groom Mate Platinum XL Professional Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the deciding factor was the \\&quot;Screw-On Stainless Steel Cap for Extra Protection\\&quot; because if you drop it and manage to damage the blades and guards, you are out of business until it is fixed, even though it will be a free repair under the lifetime guarantee.e blades and guards, you are out of business until it is fixed, even though it will be a free repair under the lifetime guarantee.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my dad for his birthday. And he satisfied very much</li>
            <li> Maybe min Groom Mate Silver was supposed to come with instructions.  Because I do not know how to use it properly.  The product looks cool and I thought it would get rid of pesky nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it looks like the top of an electric nose trimmer, it does cut like an electric model.  Tried many times to clean out my nose of unwanted hairs, to only see a few cut in the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also you cannot clean the trimmers with water or they will rust.  Maybe it was all user error, but they did not perform for me, the way I expected them to.</li>
            <li> I have never found a circular nose trimmer that trims my hairs close enough and this is no exception.  While I like the simple design the hairs at the edge of my nose still stick out after using this, so I threw it out and use the trimmer on my electric face razor, which cuts much more quickly, effectively, and short.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0001MBRYK Groom Mate TrimIT Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer + Lifetime Warranty]]    It&#x27;s not possible to get a close trim and it&#x27;s \\&quot;catch as catch\\&quot; can with nasal hairs. I often feel nothing is happening.  Nevertheless, it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Here is the review that I posted on the Groom Mate Platinum XL model in which I compared it to this TrimIt model with a few extra comments on this TrimIt model:    I was intrigued to try a non-battery operated nose/ear trimmer, and after speaking with the company, I decided to try the Platinum XL (U.S made two-handed model) and the TrimIt (Japanese made one-handed model)both sold by Groom Mate. Let me say that this company is very open to questions and really tried to make me happy with my purchase. I like that, and it is so rare in today&#x27;s marketplace.   Both of the nose/ear trimmers arrived sealed and brand new. Both were better made than I expected, much better made; the Platinum XL was notably hefty and durable. Another rare find in today&#x27;s world of cheap throw-away consumables.   I was fully expecting the Japanese made one-handed TrimIt model to wipe the floor with the two-handed XL, but I was wrong. Using two hands to twist and guide the XL made for a faster and closer nose trimming experience. Also, the tactile feel of using two hands made me feel more in control.   To be sure, the TrimIt model was easy and actually fun to use. It is nicely balanced and it the pressure to squeeze it is very light.   When I went to my ears, I feared that having to use two hands to use the XL trimmer would lead to a clumsy experience: That fear was unfounded. The Platinum XL works great on the ears, and I had no fear of nicking either.   The TrimIt works nice on the ears too, but I often feel that I am just clacking along with no sense of how the job is going. To its credit, it is super comfortable to use on the ears.   It is true that the XL (and the TrimIt) require a little more time than the battery operated ones that I have used (those that actually cut hair), but the extra time spent was negligible. More important, I know I am using a quality machine when I am using either the Platinum XL or the TrimIt.   For the record, I have plenty of experience with battery operated nose/ear trimmers. I have used the Sharper Image battery trimmers and after the 2.0 they literally did not cut worth a darn. The 5.0 twirls the blade so fast that my eyes watered, and that&#x27;s no joke...and no fun either. Besides, they break far too fast for a product as expensive as they are. The Remington model is decently made but is worthless for cutting nose hair (the side burn attachment is ok but it&#x27;s not why I bought it!). The two Panasonic models I had recently bought were slower and cut good, but both broke within months of use...I was afraid to buy another! That&#x27;s what brought me to these non-battery operated nose/ear trimmers.  As I stated earlier, both the XL and the TrimIt are amazingly well made; I fully expect them to last for years of use.   I never expected to be so into a nose/ear trimmer, and 20 years ago I would have laughed at the prospect of even needing one. Now, at 42, it&#x27;s a weekly reality that I don&#x27;t need to worry about--will my nose trimmer break, will the new model even cut, etc. Thanks to the Platinum XL (and the TrimIt), I know I now have a tool that I can rely on to do the job, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about entering the world with any hints of embarrassment holding me back.   The Platinum XL is easily the best Nose/Ear trimmer I have ever used, and the TrimIt is worth your consideration if it suits your style. They actually compliment each other nicely.    I hope my review has helped you to make a decision on whether to buy a Groom Mate trimmer and the pros and cons of these two top of the line trimmer models.  All the Best, MLC</li>
            <li> Well made, not cheapo. Can use with one hand. Does not pull hairs. Easy to use once a week. No need for batteries.</li>
            <li> Keeps my ears and beak free of stragglers, but is time consuming. This product is well made though, and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have used, it does exactly what it claims it will do. And no cord and no batteries with no noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well thought out product</li>
