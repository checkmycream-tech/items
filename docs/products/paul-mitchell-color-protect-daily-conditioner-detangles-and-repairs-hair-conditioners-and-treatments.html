            <li>and then like magic, the residue absorbs styling product and hairspray and deflates all volume.</li>

            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Also the conditioner is perfect for conditioning my hair, but it is still light enough so my hair still feels clean.</li>
            <li>This conditioner smooths it right out in the shower without adding any weight like many conditioners.</li>
            <li>I have always struggled with tangles after washing my super fine hair until using this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This product just makes you feel clean</li>
            <li>The price point is not bad and I like Paul Mitchell products.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt clean and soft and it was just more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is the only product I can use that will not cause my color treated hair to fade.  </li>
            <li>It arrived fast, wrong for my hair, but might be perfect for your hair.</li>
            <li>Actually it will look fine for about an hour</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my hair and does not make the color fade.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use much at all</li>
            <li>think this is lotion in a bottle, not the real</li>
            <li>thought I was using to much</li>
            <li>, \\&quot;SPROING!\\&quot; There is just so much of it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and could see the difference between this one and the &#x27;real&#x27; Paul Mitchell conditioner.</li>
            <li>She loves them so much, she will not even considerr another product.</li>
            <li>but it is fragrance free and soften your hair, I tried several products.</li>
            <li>It is as expected, good to use after shampooing my hair, definitely will purchase another product after this one runs out.</li>
            <li>mine is naturally straight and not really thick.  </li>
            <li>Sent it back and got full refund.</li>
            <li>When my hair dried it was soft and smelled nice.  </li>
            <li>It worked great, it did protect my hair color, the only thing I didnt like was that it left my hair oily as times and it weighed my hair down, while some would like that</li>
            <li>And, the color seems to hold its luster right through to the next touch up.</li>
            <li>My wife buys what seems to be a new shampoo and conditioner every month for us to try.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Leaves color treated hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Wasted my money on this very large bottle.  </li>
            <li>didnt like the conditioner so much..... weighed down my hair</li>
            <li>If you have dry tangly color treated hair this conditioner will detangle and leave your hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I did not want to be one of the many reviewers who complained their hair became greasy and overly full of residue, but sadly I am.</li>

            <li> My hair felt and looked different all day long and not just after I showered.</li>
            <li> When the actual product is put up against the real deal it is a clear fake.  </li>
            <li> With this product, paired with the Color Protect Shampoo, I have found my salon appts are about a week farther apart, due to the colorant lasting longer (that saves me money!).</li>
            <li> This product left an extremely greasy residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> so I used just a bit on my ends and it feels like wax my hair won&#x27;t dry</li>

            <li> it was really dirty looking on the second day.</li>

            <li> This is an awesome conditioner.  I have always struggled with tangles after washing my super fine hair until using this conditioner.  It is even better than the Paul Mitchell conditioner that is suppose to be for hair with tangles.  I hope the manufacturer never discontinues this product.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I color my hair- so why not protect that color from appt to appt? With this product, paired with the Color Protect Shampoo, I have found my salon appts are about a week farther apart, due to the colorant lasting longer (that saves me money!). I spend a lot of time outdoors without a hat, so need to protect my hair from the elements.</li>
            <li> The Beauty salon where I get my hair colored recommended the Paul Mitchel Color Protect Conditioner (along with the shampoo). This product is great for color treated hair. It is gentle on my hair and does not make the color fade. Actually it seems to help the color last longer. Also the conditioner is perfect for conditioning my hair, but it is still light enough so my hair still feels clean.</li>
            <li> I did not want to be one of the many reviewers who complained their hair became greasy and overly full of residue, but sadly I am. I like PM shampoo but this one is lousy.  I wash my hair every other day and on the second day my hair usually is a bit oily but tolerable, after using this shampoo it was really dirty looking on the second day. I had to re-wash and it&#x27;s still gross. So I would stick to their Shampoo One Or Shampoo Two. The Color Protect shampoo is a total dud, but I can see how they feel the residue might soften colored treated hair but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I use this with the shampoo from Paul Mitchell. It works great with keeping my hair manageable. I have hair thats so thin that when I get out of the shower that it is very hard to comb through but this product helps with that.</li>
            <li> This leaves a greasy film on my hair and I don&#x27;t use much at all, I have very thick hair this makes it look gross.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is lotion in a bottle, not the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was using to much so I used just a bit on my ends and it feels like wax my hair won&#x27;t dry and I don&#x27;t have buildup because I used a good cleaning shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is as expected, good to use after shampooing my hair, definitely will purchase another product after this one runs out.</li>
            <li> didnt like the conditioner so much..... weighed down my hair</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this very large bottle.  I have had the same experience as some of the other reviewers with my hair being weighed down and feeling like there is a residue no matter how well I rinse.  Maybe it depends on the type of hair you have and mine is naturally straight and not really thick.  I tried a few times and my hair will not hold any body or volume from blow drying when I&#x27;ve used this conditioner.  Actually it will look fine for about an hour and then like magic, the residue absorbs styling product and hairspray and deflates all volume.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair too greasy.  It&#x27;s not the experience I&#x27;ve had with other Paul Mitchell products</li>
            <li> it did not make my air as bright as nexus did ,&lt;br /&gt;there are better conditioner in the market too ,&lt;br /&gt;next time I buy nexus ,</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is the only product I can use that will not cause my color treated hair to fade.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Get a great look and a beautiful aroma all in one bottle. Your hair will love it. This product just makes you feel clean</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair greasy and waxy, regardless of how many times ive attempted to wash it all out. will be returning ASAP.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy.  Was what I needed for my bad hair.</li>
            <li> It also leaves a residue on my hair. I bought this not online so I feel that it&#x27;s the conditioner line itself not who sells it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it&#x27;s great for color treated hair. I think my highlights last longer. Makes my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I have the kind of hair you can&#x27;t put a barrette in because it goes, \\&quot;SPROING!\\&quot; There is just so much of it. And, now that I color it, the texture seems to be even thicker and rougher. This conditioner smooths it right out in the shower without adding any weight like many conditioners. And, the color seems to hold its luster right through to the next touch up. One caveat though... I still need to add controlling products when I dry the hair to keep it from poofing out.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy !! Anyone that didn&#x27;t like the conditioner, it&#x27;s because this is counterfeit. I ordered this and could see the difference between this one and the &#x27;real&#x27; Paul Mitchell conditioner. It not only doesn&#x27;t have the same result, it looks different too.</li>
            <li> It worked great, it did protect my hair color, the only thing I didnt like was that it left my hair oily as times and it weighed my hair down, while some would like that I dont, so its more on preference of how you want your hair. It arrived fast, wrong for my hair, but might be perfect for your hair.</li>
            <li> This works great on colored hair.  The only thing that saves the color and helps to prevent hair damage. I purchase this product in bulk (to save $$$) on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair and have found this is the best conditioner I have ever used. Its expensive but by hair feels soft with no tangles. I love it and would recomend this to anyone who dyes their hair</li>
            <li> Zgreat service excellent product this is something I do not go without. I will be ordering more. you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use it. The packaging was not good enough and it arrived exploded and unusable. I had to go out and buy it again.</li>
            <li> My wife buys what seems to be a new shampoo and conditioner every month for us to try. Recently she purchased a bottle of this conditioner and the matching hair shampoo. I have to tell you that I really liked this conditioner a lot. My hair felt clean and soft and it was just more manageable. My hair felt and looked different all day long and not just after I showered. I liked this conditioner and I will use it again. I recommend it to you!</li>
            <li> The bottle looks legitimate but it a counterfeit.  When the actual product is put up against the real deal it is a clear fake.  It smells like a hotel grade conditioner too and does not work.  Sent it back and got full refund.</li>
            <li> My wife is a big Paul Mitchell products user. She loves them so much, she will not even considerr another product.</li>
            <li> This product left an extremely greasy residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have dry tangly color treated hair this conditioner will detangle and leave your hair soft.  I leave it on for about 5 minutes then rinse with tepid water.  When my hair dried it was soft and smelled nice.  The price point is not bad and I like Paul Mitchell products.  I also use the Paul mitchell Mousse as well.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> This was for my Gal and she needed by the weekend.  It arrived perfectly on time on Sunday! Great!</li>
            <li> I love this conditionair. My colored hair is always smiling when I use it</li>
            <li> Wonderful conditioner and keeps my color fresh</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. Leaves color treated hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Great product expansive but it is fragrance free and soften your hair, I tried several products.</li>
