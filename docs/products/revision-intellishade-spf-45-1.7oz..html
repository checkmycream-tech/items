            <li>so this is my foundation providing a nice even tone.</li>
            <li>It blends nicely.</li>
            <li>It is a tinted moisturizer and acts really kind of like a BB Cream.  </li>
            <li>lightweight, nice tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>if that is what you want, but a nice product to balance skin</li>
            <li>She liked the consistency of the liquid when she got it out.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover as much as a foundation or even a BB cream, but it&#x27;s perfect if you don&#x27;t want to feel like you have anything on but still even out your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about this...sunscreen of 45, perfect medium shade and great moisture.</li>

            <li>High spf factor, leaves a nice finish, and does a great job of coverup without looking un-natural on my face!</li>
            <li>This is the best all-in-one moisturizer and tint with a high SPF.  </li>
            <li>Plus it is a good strong SPF</li>
            <li>The tint in it is perfect and there&#x27;s no need to use additional foundation or face powder; looks very natural.</li>
            <li>A very strong competitor for Revision Intellishade is &#x27;Miracle skin transformer&#x27;</li>

            <li>I use this as a sunscreen many days, but not in place of any kind of covering foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a good sunscreen and light tint...</li>
            <li>It smooths over the face nicely, though I wish it were more lotion than cream.</li>

            <li>Gives light, but good coverage when you don&#x27;t need heavier foundation make-up.  </li>
            <li>Besides being greasy upon putting it on (easily fixed with a translucent powder), my face looked AWESOME.</li>
            <li>It is natural looking and provides excellent moisture and sun protection.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful for mature wormen</li>

            <li>I am pleased</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This is what my dermatologist suggested I try since she said I have melasma and need more than a SPF 30-So instead of buying in the office which is $48</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are better products out there-</li>
            <li>I think hanskin had way better coverage with spf and calming effect</li>
            <li>I use this as a sunscreen/foundation and it protects my skin and makes it look healthy and dewy.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have fair/medium yellow tinged skin and the color blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>Absolutely Fantastic!  </li>

            <li>Love the products.</li>
            <li>According to a Senior Executive at Revision Skincare products, companies affiliated with Amazon are not “authorized outlets” for the distribution of their products and therefore this product should not be considered an “authentic” Revision product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I have the neck cream and absolutely love it.  </li>

            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I would give it more of a SPF 20 rating.  </li>
            <li>Most products like this also settle into my wrinkles making them look more pronounced.   </li>
            <li>and my sister love it too..</li>
            <li>:) i recommend this product..</li>

            <li>love the tinted make-up</li>
            <li>- I am so glad my dermatologist recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li>My skin just looks healthy and has a more even tone.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I have sun protection as well.  </li>
            <li>The SPF level is prefect, just wish it didn&#x27;t feel so greasy and had a bit more coverage.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>but without the kabuki theater look of so many sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Okay, let me start off by saying my face seems to break out with anything and everything.</li>
            <li>Have been using this prodouct for years and pricing is much better from this vendor.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite under makeup tinted hydrating cream.  </li>
            <li>She raved about it and said all the women at the spa ranging in age from 25 to 50+ just love it.  </li>
            <li>Magic, I tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Who could want more?</li>
            <li>I have tried many tinted SPF products but never got the coverage I needed.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It also has a lot of SPF which I love.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>(I was hesitant because so many products are pushed by businesses all the time).  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I continue to use this product and love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I always love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my skin after applying this product.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t care about your overall health, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>I genuinely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>My favorite makeup of all time.</li>
            <li>I love the coverage.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t and has a tint that seems to even out any skin tone nicely and give light coverage.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist sells this for at minimum $15 more a tube.  </li>
            <li>I feel it has made my skin look much better.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite products ever.  </li>
            <li>It also gives the skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice dewy light coverage that I like.</li>
            <li>Coverage is light and may not be effective for someone who needs to conceal some skin issues.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product have used it for several years.</li>
            <li>This product in the Original formulation blends perfectly with your skin color and looks extremely natural.</li>
            <li>It used to feel and look like a smooth, creamy tinted moisturizer that blended easily into my skin with a nice dewy glow.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, goes on easy</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, and quickly adapts to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Great for mature skin and is also a moisturizer as well as a sun screen!</li>
            <li>I tried the matte finish and did not like how it sat in my pores; it seemed to exaggerate them where the original formula although more moisturizing, sits on my skin better.  </li>
            <li>It blends into most skin tones and has a smooth feel and look.</li>
            <li>Lovely light coverage and moisture</li>
            <li>Skin looks healthy and feels free of need for foundation.</li>
            <li>It is tinted and you&#x27;ll love the light texture.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>The SPF of 45 offers great protection.</li>
            <li>I love that the product is light weight</li>
            <li>Looks very natural but provides light coverage and has been great with sun protection.  </li>
            <li>What a nice surprise to find it right online.</li>
            <li>I have tried other tinted moisturizers, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both the original and the matte formulas and the matte is too matte and the original is ok, but could use a tad more coverage.</li>
            <li>I like the original better than the matte, have tried both</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and blends well.  </li>
            <li>Tinted moisturizer with SPF 45 goes on easily and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Gave me a rash, and didn&#x27;t wash off easily at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Skin looks healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>and that maybe it isn&#x27;t meant for people who break out easily.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to wipe off easily.  </li>
            <li>It leaves me protected from the strong Colorado sun</li>
            <li>I have really fair skin and need high SPF protection.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product at first</li>
            <li>Much more coverage than you would expect, perfect match for most skin colors ( including my super pale skin)</li>
            <li>Light coverage wears nicely all day - highly recommend and it has spf!!</li>
            <li>And it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>is hands down the best sunscreen/day time mositurizer / BB type product available.</li>
            <li>Have used this for years as my main moisturizer and sun screen in one and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>very happy and young looking 72 yr old lady and by the way even doctors have remarked that I don&#x27;t look my age</li>
            <li>Light with some coverage.</li>
            <li>The color is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, and even though it is tinted, it goes on smoothly and without streaking.</li>
            <li>The protection is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and fortunately I had another lighter makeup with me.  </li>
            <li>My milia have greatly diminished and my under eyes seems much younger looking and moisturized!</li>
            <li>I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to wear foundation, but this is so light I have to use both.  </li>
            <li>the products are available from Amazon seller&#x27;s :0)</li>
            <li>-I have even used a makeup brush to really lightly apply it</li>
            <li>I am always looking for great ways to incorporate sunscreen into my daily regimen.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth &amp; color blends in.  .  .</li>
            <li>Love being able to put it on and be able to be out the door on a busy day.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and adjust color to my tones.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got oily skin (like me), it&#x27;s great to only have to use one product.  </li>
            <li>smooth to apply, and you do not even know it is there.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy the product..  </li>
            <li>It is a moisturizer and so light on the skin</li>
            <li>Smooth application.</li>
            <li>Evens skin tone and yet it is so light.</li>
            <li>I wear a light powder over it.</li>
            <li>This is a great sunblock that comes tinted in matte or regular.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now, and it makes me feel great.</li>
            <li>It is a must have, more than worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Light coverage for days</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>Elta MD Lightly Tinted for Extra-Sensitive Skin is far superior sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This is a very natural looking foundation, love it!</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product and I can see why its nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li>I accidentally ordered the Original version of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I prefer the original to the matte.</li>
            <li>It was originally given to me by my plastic surgeon to protect my skin.</li>
            <li>I get this in the original and the matte</li>
            <li>I use matte during the summer and the original during the winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both the original and the matte</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but well worth it!  </li>
            <li>I think it covers better and gives a more natural</li>
            <li>It is light, sheer, and good for all skin shades.  </li>
            <li>Clean face, moisturizer (I use Vivite), eye cream, and then Intellishade.</li>
            <li>I have tried several name brand tinted moisturizers and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for not only protecting, but blending with your natural skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for the past year - Excellent Product, the best tinted moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever had; I have very sensitive skin and usually get blemishes and pimples from most products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need or want a heavy foundation (I&#x27;m 38, but take very good care of my skin).  </li>
            <li>Living in California requires me to us a high SPF and this product spares my skin the rays, adds a light and lovely coverage and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for a minimal coverage makeup.</li>
            <li>This is my go-to foundation and sunscreen, I just sweep some Bare Minerals over it and my face not only looks perfect, it&#x27;s protected too.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and looks fresh on your face.  </li>
            <li>:) I upped my lippies from 1 to 3 since I still would not use it on my whole face ever again.</li>
            <li>Gives full coverage.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and have loved it.</li>
            <li>It gives me full coverage</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want a full face of make-up.  </li>
            <li>It has a 45 SPF and has just enough color to make you look good w/o any makeup.  </li>
            <li>Love putting this stuff on on the weekends when I want to run to the grocery store or Target in the morning, but am not quite ready t have on a full face of makeup.</li>
            <li>I am a low maintenance kind of gal and like that this product is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It has a more silky texture, versus a matte texture, which creates a very natural, smooth finish.</li>
            <li>It offers just enough coverage to make your complexion very even, and blends perfectly, but it&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li>You will love this tinted moisturizer; been using it at the recommendation of my dermatologist for several years and still works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is incredible make-up especially for mature women who no longer respond to over the counter make-up.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>This last purchase feels more like sunscreen that stays more on the surface and does not blend in so well.</li>
            <li>Sometime back I purchased a tube of this wonderful tinted moisturizer at a day spa, and did not want to call or make the trip back to get another.  </li>
            <li>It applies easily, feels good on my skin, but carries more of a sheer, even coverage than regular foundation.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dermatologist and I found it to be excellent and not a good price.  </li>
            <li>I liked the coverage I got with bare minerals, but I still felt like I had makeup on.</li>
            <li>This product is supposedly adaptable for all skin types and shades, but the first tube I purchased was from my Dr and it gave me a light, sun-kissed look.  </li>
            <li>Thumbs down, I was hoping I&#x27;d found a great all in one product.</li>
            <li>I have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;, though oily skin; doesn&#x27;t help to live in Florida where you sweat most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Goes on extremely  smoothly, fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>you have dry skin, and are looking for a good tinted moisturizer, this is for you.</li>
            <li>great quality product a little pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>It may be too dark if you have a very very light skin tone, but I usually get &#x27;light beige&#x27; or &#x27;beige&#x27; powder and the tint in this product works perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage but not too heavy.</li>
            <li>- surprisingly great coverage without being heavy.  </li>
            <li>Fun fact:</li>
            <li>It is so easy to have a wrinkle cream sunscreen and halfway decent makeup coverage in one tube.</li>
            <li>Feels like a sheer foundation;  goes on extremely smooth; love the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 45.  </li>
            <li>cost more to buy it directly from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>It stays looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing while giving light coverage, I love the no makeup look and have been using this product for several years.</li>
            <li>It blends so nicely though - even w/aging skin, enlarged pores, dryness and facial hair and a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; at 45 SPF protection!!</li>
            <li>Does not settle into fine  lines, moisturizing with high SPF.</li>
            <li>Second color is not extreme and to have sunscreen also is Great.</li>
            <li>I immediately loved it, but tried using other (cheaper) products.  </li>
            <li>Blends right in and not shinny or greasy.  </li>
            <li>It blends right in.</li>
            <li>JUST THE RIGHT SHADE FOR MY SKIN TONE.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>It has just the right coverage and in fact have stopped using my BB cream.</li>
            <li>I live in a strong sun state and it works.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very light and the tint makes me look as if I have real  make-up, looks very natural</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and easily break out</li>
            <li>I like this product because of the high SPF rating, the tint in the moisturizer and the light, non-greasy  coverage.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin and this product works great to keep my skin hydrated and protected from UV yet does not break my skin out.</li>
            <li>Great value for a premium product usually sold though dermatologist offices.  </li>
            <li>dermatologist say that there isn&#x27;t a need for anything over SPF30, which I  may have to stick with b/c this stuff also transfers really bad-I had an itch on my nose and took a tissue I had on hand and quickly itched the corner of my nose and the tissue was covered with the tint from the SPF-Am I also taking off SPF when I do this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, great cream especially for the summer.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>This product blends much better and doesn&#x27;t cake or settle into fine lines like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Although if you have SUPER fair skin I&#x27;m not sure it would match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a product that I like very much.  </li>
            <li>I am very light skinned obviously the skin changes during the year</li>
            <li>stuff gives great light coverage, with just enough to mask slight imperfections.  </li>
            <li>I know it works well with the high SPF and makes my skin feel great, but the greasy look is just too much and needs to be toned down a bit.</li>
            <li>This is better and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>I like the shade (color) but didn&#x27;t find it to be exactly the miracle color that some have found it to be.</li>
            <li>I was quite interested in this product, since the manufacturer claims it will match any skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Saves so much time missing several products together and suits my skin type (light/medium) perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Next time, I will purchase this at a reputable spa and not trust the Internet.</li>
            <li>First I picked it up from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office at the bargain basement price of $55 -</li>
            <li>I was foolish not to check Amazon first.</li>
            <li>I first bought this at my derm&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it moisturizes eliminating tiny lines and the fact the shade compliments any type of complexion.</li>
            <li>I put a powder sunscreen on top of this for extra</li>
            <li>Since using this instead of traditional foundation, my skin is clearer and also looks and feels better when I use it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time to use this product and I just like the way it is..</li>
            <li>matching interested me.    </li>
            <li>I love the 45 SPF and after only a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>This make-up was first sold to me by my skincare specialist.  </li>
            <li>The mat finish, I suspect, would be better for younger skin; it has a drier look/effect.</li>
            <li>and I personally like the matte better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s voodoo magic the way it actually blends in to your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;SPF - 45 for us Southern Californians who love the sun, not some wimpy SPF 10 that makes us reapply throughout the day (which I never do</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or breaks outs either which happens often with higher SPF creams.</li>
            <li>Came on time exactly as vendor promised.  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I orderd.</li>
            <li>I did break out the first week or two.</li>
            <li>I love that it always matches your skin shade, even in different seasons.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and found on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but, I believe when you first start using this product(if</li>
            <li>colors&amp;#34;-it is more of a light color not the beige I previously had used.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s skin is so fair she is actually white and it blended fine with her skin when even the lightest color foundation looked dark.</li>
            <li>It drags a little as I apply it but putting a light moisturizer underneath (first) is helpful to make it glide on better.</li>
            <li>The matte version balled up pigment on my face, and wasn&#x27;t nearly as even in application as the original product.  </li>
            <li>I actually got this in my dermatologists office but the prices are more reasonable on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>product is great at matching my skin tone both in the winter when I get quite pale and also in the summer when my skin darkens quite considerably from the sun.  </li>
            <li>The positive things are it has no fragrant and SPF 45.</li>
            <li>I had tried samples in the past and loved them, but using the product on-going wasn&#x27;t for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I also have very oily skin and by the afternoon, it&#x27;s pretty much floated away.  </li>
            <li>Good for those long summer days outside.</li>
            <li>Does not have as strong a sunscreen smell as some facial sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old and I have been shying away from tinted products because I am fair skinned and the tint is always too dark.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for more coverage or have an olive or dark complexion, this probably isn&#x27;t for you, but if you are looking for natural coverage with moisturizers and some SPF, this product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>But with this cream, it goes on very smoothly with minimal application and stays even throughout the day and through my workouts.</li>
            <li>I can use this during the day with a little mascara and my skin looks flawless, at night with a little powder and a \\&quot;night\\&quot; eye make-up</li>
            <li>This product feels like it&#x27;s good for your skin, and it eliminates the need for moisturizer/sunscreen (this is big for me, since I have very dry skin and don&#x27;t like to spend money on two products when I can use one.)</li>
            <li>It really does blend in well.</li>
            <li>In natural water, however, I throw it in my tote bag and take it with me for fun in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t adjust light enough to match my skin.</li>
            <li>It feels very nourishing and calming to the skin.</li>
            <li>much prefer the Matte finish,.  </li>
            <li>It has a very neutral fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, too and doesn&#x27;t pill up or roll into waxy chunks.</li>
            <li>Somehow, it doesn&#x27;t really match mine.  </li>
            <li>but yet it covers very well.</li>
            <li>find this product to go on and feel greasy the whole time</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give that much coverage, but it does give a sort of glow to your skin and it absorbs well as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Very Dissapointed</li>
            <li>It blends very well with my skin color.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, blends very well,</li>
            <li>gives my face a natural/dewy finish without looking like I have makeup on, and it really does moisturize.  </li>
            <li>It really saves time as an all-in-one product.  </li>
            <li>, I just don&#x27;t know why everyone likes this product so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Matched my skin tone very well.</li>
            <li>plus it has sunscreen, which I really need.</li>
            <li>I have used for 2 years and it really works.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much per application.  </li>
            <li>it blends very well.</li>
            <li>- it is very drying - this is the one to get.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and has SP45 protection.</li>
            <li>I just wear it with a light setting powder and don&#x27;t even wear regular foundation anymore.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t offer much coverage, but it does do well as a moisturizer, and as an addition to BB.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the more moisturizing regular formula for my mature skin.</li>
            <li>It does add good moisture, so if you wanted to use it under foundation, it is a good base.</li>
            <li>(If you are curious, you&#x27;re welcome to check my other reviews to see which ones).</li>
            <li>The coverage is much better than other tinted moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>So, I was so excited when finally (at the age of 26)</li>
            <li>,only downside is the price,but is worth it!</li>
            <li>but I love it for other reasons also.  </li>
            <li>This product did not offer enough  coverage and wasn&#x27;t as easy to use or comfortable on the skin as I expected.</li>
            <li>I have dark spots, but most sun screens make my eyes water.</li>
            <li>When I buy a tinted moisturizer I expect less coverage than a foundation but more than a BB.  </li>
            <li>use this  is the main part of my morning &amp;#34;Face the World&amp;#34; routine.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer would a better choice for daily use.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to be outside on a super sunny day, I use it alone.  </li>
            <li>it might be a decent product.</li>
            <li>As much as I love this product, it does not pass the EWG Skin Deep database safety standards--meaning there are potentially harmful substances in this product.</li>
            <li>This makeup is very light with little to no coverage.  </li>
            <li>Maybe because I don&#x27;t wear foundation, I&#x27;m not sure, but I didn&#x27;t find it any better then other moisturizers on the market, and not as good as some cheaper ones you can get in your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who has sensitivity to sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them both.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this foundation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Definitely highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for aging lines and coverage.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>have tried other (highly rated) brands of tinted moisturizers and Revision is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes my face a little better.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday unless you like serious coverage.</li>
            <li>It does not even outr skin tone and is only good if you like to wear very little make- up.</li>
            <li>Really, if you have sensitive skin, try this product.</li>
            <li>I feel I wasted $40 on a product when I could have gotten something better in the drugstore for $15.</li>
            <li>I would have never purchased it if I knew it was an order at your own risk, the product was to thick to comfortably&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like it because it doesn&#x27;t accentuate my fine lines like some other make-ups do.</li>
            <li>It actually makes you look years younger, diminishing your fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>For those of you that find the original formula too wet, try the matte version.</li>
            <li>Other all in one creams that I used were greasier and did not go on as smoothly.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas.</li>
            <li>Product is very easy to apply, It does not feel thick</li>
            <li>The color is very natural, too.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive  skin</li>
            <li>I am not sure about the &amp;#34;intellishade&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in a light, medium and dark color so it would provide more coverage like foundation.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the distribution facility was different that that of the bottle I originally purchased which could possibly be the issue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is exactly the same product by name.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s any better the the OTC products.</li>
            <li>Better than the usual foundation</li>
            <li>I first tried this product after my esthetician put it on me after a facial.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more compliments on my skin the past 2 years</li>
            <li>I usually do not wear foundation with it as I like the coverage and get a lot of compliments on my skin while wearing it.</li>
            <li>Not too light, not too dark.  </li>
            <li>Love this and will never go back to any other make up ever!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m positive there is no tube inside this tiny box.</li>
            <li>Not only does it offer great coverage for everyday wear - particularly in the daytime - it doesn&#x27;t clog pores or feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>Once in a while, on a nice night out, I will use my normal base for more coverage.</li>
            <li>It has a yellow undertone that doesn&#x27;t really flatter my complexion (light skin tone, neutral to slightly pinkish undertones).  </li>
            <li>It does leave my face a little shiny but that is resolved with a light covering of face powder.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wish it gave me a little bit more coverage.</li>
            <li>Expiration date was clearly stated with a sufficient timeline.</li>
            <li>Having had a few  skin cancers  on my face removed, I know how important it is to apply sunscreen every day.</li>
            <li>old.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by a skin care professional-</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised that this</li>
            <li>It looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>As a tinted moisturizer, it is not a heavy foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend you give it a try; it&#x27;s not too heavy and not too light</li>
            <li>Natural coverage with sun protection.</li>
            <li>not a heavy coverage</li>
            <li>LOOKS AND FEELS SOFT</li>
            <li>My wife used it - found that it seemed like it was old --  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had years of issues with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>A natural look for someone not wanting to use foundation.</li>
            <li>- it makes your skin look young and seamless</li>
            <li>I have yet to find an organic, natural BB cream that does what this does.</li>
            <li>If you like a natural look , this is for you.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy or light.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for at least 2 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>so this somewhat evens out the redness although it is not a heavy, covering makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can experience breakout w/</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin)if</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or thick but look in the mirror 20 minutes later</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this product is very light, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I bought the original (vs the matte) and it gives a little glow.</li>
            <li>(Pretty much EVERY SPF product has a shine to it, so this issue is not unique to this product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is more natural than other products that I have used of other brands</li>
            <li>This Amazon purchase is the exact same product, but for some reason it is lighter in appearance and doesn&#x27;t give me the same sun-kissed look.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend- use it daily....</li>
            <li>I normally use Bare Minerals and felt that it covered just as well without all the excessive twirling of the powder brush and the clean up that would always need to be done</li>
            <li>I use a little loose powder and/or blush for more coverage.  </li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to straight make up base AND is has a 45 SPF.    </li>
            <li>Give it a try, it is a major time saver.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricier than some products, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Apparently they also make a matte version</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and you can barely tell it is there</li>
            <li>I just use my bare minerals foundation over it and out the door</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin it definitely is a must.</li>
            <li>I have been told that I look years younger by two people so far.</li>
            <li>But it felt thick and sticky and nothing like the original product I bought at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It covers the dark spots very well and works well with my powder.  </li>
            <li>It makes my otherwise uneven, blotched skin tone look absolutely radiant!</li>
            <li>have not used this product very long, maybe a month, but I like it, so far.</li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount for coverage and goes on a little heavier than my current CC foundation but lighter than most sunscreen.</li>

            <li> I use the original as my skin likes that best.</li>

            <li> I have used this product exclusively for 2 years and have had comments on my &#x27;beautiful&#x27; skin many times  </li>
            <li> but if you do, you will love the coverage and feeling of this beautiful product</li>

            <li> I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It perfectly matched my skin and provided just the right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> Very impressive time wise and even the fact that it was the real product.</li>

            <li> Excellent product, first introduced to me by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Intellishade blends easily and is great to wear alone</li>
            <li> This is the best tinted moisturizer, does not settle in fine lines, stays on all day with a light dusting of face powder.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing how it adapts to skin colors.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product which provides a smooth finish to your face.</li>
            <li> Works great as light makeup coverage that includes a moisturizer and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> A tinted moisturizer type of product that conceals better and is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> Good for Amazon to be able to supply it.  </li>
            <li> The revision line is spectacular.</li>
            <li> Nice finish</li>
            <li> so this is my foundation providing a nice even tone.</li>
            <li> It blends nicely.</li>
            <li> It is a tinted moisturizer and acts really kind of like a BB Cream.  </li>
            <li> lightweight, nice tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> if that is what you want, but a nice product to balance skin</li>
            <li> She liked the consistency of the liquid when she got it out.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover as much as a foundation or even a BB cream, but it&#x27;s perfect if you don&#x27;t want to feel like you have anything on but still even out your skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this...sunscreen of 45, perfect medium shade and great moisture.</li>
            <li> It blends very well and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Blends nicely, doesn&#x27;t look like make-up on the skin, even in daylight.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Intellishade!!</li>
            <li> The original gives me a dewy look which is great.</li>
            <li> High spf factor, leaves a nice finish, and does a great job of coverup without looking un-natural on my face!</li>
            <li> This is the best all-in-one moisturizer and tint with a high SPF.  </li>
            <li> Plus it is a good strong SPF</li>
            <li> The tint in it is perfect and there&#x27;s no need to use additional foundation or face powder; looks very natural.</li>
            <li> A very strong competitor for Revision Intellishade is &#x27;Miracle skin transformer&#x27;</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use, just put it on and it adapts to your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love it, it blends in so nicely.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> This one yielded the best, natural color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say my skin is light to fair and Revision does not match.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a sunscreen many days, but not in place of any kind of covering foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a good sunscreen and light tint...</li>
            <li> It smooths over the face nicely, though I wish it were more lotion than cream.</li>
            <li> Good coverage; smooth and natural look and finish for the face - excellent protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> Gives light, but good coverage when you don&#x27;t need heavier foundation make-up.  </li>
            <li> Besides being greasy upon putting it on (easily fixed with a translucent powder), my face looked AWESOME.</li>
            <li> It is natural looking and provides excellent moisture and sun protection.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful for mature wormen</li>
            <li> this is the best foundation I have ever used love that is also a moisturizer with sunscreen protection all in one makes my face feel very soft</li>
            <li> Got my order very quickly!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product!</li>

            <li> It goes on very smoothly</li>
            <li> This is very light coverage, doesn&#x27;t require a lot of blending.</li>
            <li> and it goes on very smoothly.</li>

            <li> I bought some for my sister and she fell in love with it also.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Even better, the pigment does not ball up like so many tinted moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> We love our lakes and rivers.</li>

            <li> I am pleased</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This is what my dermatologist suggested I try since she said I have melasma and need more than a SPF 30-So instead of buying in the office which is $48</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are better products out there-</li>
            <li> I think hanskin had way better coverage with spf and calming effect</li>
            <li> I use this as a sunscreen/foundation and it protects my skin and makes it look healthy and dewy.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have fair/medium yellow tinged skin and the color blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love this tinted moisturizer with sunscreen protection and&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this all in one product.</li>
            <li> I love having a product that is affordable and also has sunblock in it.  </li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen foundation.</li>
            <li> Love the products.</li>
            <li> According to a Senior Executive at Revision Skincare products, companies affiliated with Amazon are not “authorized outlets” for the distribution of their products and therefore this product should not be considered an “authentic” Revision product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I have the neck cream and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> You can build coverage on top of it though.  </li>
            <li> most, anyway.</li>
            <li> Love this tinted sunblock/moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I would give it more of a SPF 20 rating.  </li>
            <li> Most products like this also settle into my wrinkles making them look more pronounced.   </li>
            <li> and my sister love it too..</li>
            <li> :) i recommend this product..</li>
            <li> I love this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> and we just love it.</li>
            <li> She is more fairer complected than I am.</li>
            <li> love the tinted make-up</li>
            <li> - I am so glad my dermatologist recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li> My skin just looks healthy and has a more even tone.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple years now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I have sun protection as well.  </li>
            <li> The SPF level is prefect, just wish it didn&#x27;t feel so greasy and had a bit more coverage.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> but without the kabuki theater look of so many sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Okay, let me start off by saying my face seems to break out with anything and everything.</li>
            <li> Have been using this prodouct for years and pricing is much better from this vendor.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite under makeup tinted hydrating cream.  </li>
            <li> She raved about it and said all the women at the spa ranging in age from 25 to 50+ just love it.  </li>
            <li> Magic, I tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Who could want more?</li>
            <li> I have tried many tinted SPF products but never got the coverage I needed.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It also has a lot of SPF which I love.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> (I was hesitant because so many products are pushed by businesses all the time).  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I continue to use this product and love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I always love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my skin after applying this product.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t care about your overall health, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> I genuinely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup of all time.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t and has a tint that seems to even out any skin tone nicely and give light coverage.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist sells this for at minimum $15 more a tube.  </li>
            <li> I feel it has made my skin look much better.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite products ever.  </li>
            <li> It also gives the skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> It provides a nice dewy light coverage that I like.</li>
            <li> Coverage is light and may not be effective for someone who needs to conceal some skin issues.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product have used it for several years.</li>
            <li> This product in the Original formulation blends perfectly with your skin color and looks extremely natural.</li>
            <li> It used to feel and look like a smooth, creamy tinted moisturizer that blended easily into my skin with a nice dewy glow.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, goes on easy</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, and quickly adapts to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Great for mature skin and is also a moisturizer as well as a sun screen!</li>
            <li> I tried the matte finish and did not like how it sat in my pores; it seemed to exaggerate them where the original formula although more moisturizing, sits on my skin better.  </li>
            <li> It blends into most skin tones and has a smooth feel and look.</li>
            <li> Lovely light coverage and moisture</li>
            <li> Skin looks healthy and feels free of need for foundation.</li>
            <li> It is tinted and you&#x27;ll love the light texture.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> The SPF of 45 offers great protection.</li>
            <li> I love that the product is light weight</li>
            <li> Looks very natural but provides light coverage and has been great with sun protection.  </li>
            <li> What a nice surprise to find it right online.</li>
            <li> I have tried other tinted moisturizers, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the original and the matte formulas and the matte is too matte and the original is ok, but could use a tad more coverage.</li>
            <li> I like the original better than the matte, have tried both</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and blends well.  </li>
            <li> Tinted moisturizer with SPF 45 goes on easily and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Gave me a rash, and didn&#x27;t wash off easily at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Skin looks healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> and that maybe it isn&#x27;t meant for people who break out easily.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to wipe off easily.  </li>
            <li> It leaves me protected from the strong Colorado sun</li>
            <li> I have really fair skin and need high SPF protection.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product at first</li>
            <li> Much more coverage than you would expect, perfect match for most skin colors ( including my super pale skin)</li>
            <li> Light coverage wears nicely all day - highly recommend and it has spf!!</li>
            <li> And it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> is hands down the best sunscreen/day time mositurizer / BB type product available.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years as my main moisturizer and sun screen in one and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> very happy and young looking 72 yr old lady and by the way even doctors have remarked that I don&#x27;t look my age</li>
            <li> Light with some coverage.</li>
            <li> The color is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, and even though it is tinted, it goes on smoothly and without streaking.</li>
            <li> The protection is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and fortunately I had another lighter makeup with me.  </li>
            <li> My milia have greatly diminished and my under eyes seems much younger looking and moisturized!</li>
            <li> I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to wear foundation, but this is so light I have to use both.  </li>
            <li> the products are available from Amazon seller&#x27;s :0)</li>
            <li> -I have even used a makeup brush to really lightly apply it</li>
            <li> I am always looking for great ways to incorporate sunscreen into my daily regimen.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth &amp; color blends in.  .  .</li>
            <li> Love being able to put it on and be able to be out the door on a busy day.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and adjust color to my tones.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got oily skin (like me), it&#x27;s great to only have to use one product.  </li>
            <li> smooth to apply, and you do not even know it is there.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy the product..  </li>
            <li> It is a moisturizer and so light on the skin</li>
            <li> Smooth application.</li>
            <li> Evens skin tone and yet it is so light.</li>
            <li> I wear a light powder over it.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunblock that comes tinted in matte or regular.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now, and it makes me feel great.</li>
            <li> It is a must have, more than worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Light coverage for days</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> Elta MD Lightly Tinted for Extra-Sensitive Skin is far superior sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural looking foundation, love it!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I can see why its nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the Original version of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I prefer the original to the matte.</li>
            <li> It was originally given to me by my plastic surgeon to protect my skin.</li>
            <li> I get this in the original and the matte</li>
            <li> I use matte during the summer and the original during the winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the original and the matte</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but well worth it!  </li>
            <li> I think it covers better and gives a more natural</li>
            <li> It is light, sheer, and good for all skin shades.  </li>
            <li> Clean face, moisturizer (I use Vivite), eye cream, and then Intellishade.</li>
            <li> I have tried several name brand tinted moisturizers and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for not only protecting, but blending with your natural skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past year - Excellent Product, the best tinted moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever had; I have very sensitive skin and usually get blemishes and pimples from most products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need or want a heavy foundation (I&#x27;m 38, but take very good care of my skin).  </li>
            <li> Living in California requires me to us a high SPF and this product spares my skin the rays, adds a light and lovely coverage and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for a minimal coverage makeup.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to foundation and sunscreen, I just sweep some Bare Minerals over it and my face not only looks perfect, it&#x27;s protected too.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and looks fresh on your face.  </li>
            <li> :) I upped my lippies from 1 to 3 since I still would not use it on my whole face ever again.</li>
            <li> Gives full coverage.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and have loved it.</li>
            <li> It gives me full coverage</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want a full face of make-up.  </li>
            <li> It has a 45 SPF and has just enough color to make you look good w/o any makeup.  </li>
            <li> Love putting this stuff on on the weekends when I want to run to the grocery store or Target in the morning, but am not quite ready t have on a full face of makeup.</li>
            <li> I am a low maintenance kind of gal and like that this product is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It has a more silky texture, versus a matte texture, which creates a very natural, smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It offers just enough coverage to make your complexion very even, and blends perfectly, but it&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li> You will love this tinted moisturizer; been using it at the recommendation of my dermatologist for several years and still works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is incredible make-up especially for mature women who no longer respond to over the counter make-up.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> This last purchase feels more like sunscreen that stays more on the surface and does not blend in so well.</li>
            <li> Sometime back I purchased a tube of this wonderful tinted moisturizer at a day spa, and did not want to call or make the trip back to get another.  </li>
            <li> It applies easily, feels good on my skin, but carries more of a sheer, even coverage than regular foundation.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist and I found it to be excellent and not a good price.  </li>
            <li> I liked the coverage I got with bare minerals, but I still felt like I had makeup on.</li>
            <li> This product is supposedly adaptable for all skin types and shades, but the first tube I purchased was from my Dr and it gave me a light, sun-kissed look.  </li>
            <li> Thumbs down, I was hoping I&#x27;d found a great all in one product.</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;, though oily skin; doesn&#x27;t help to live in Florida where you sweat most of the time.  </li>
            <li> Goes on extremely  smoothly, fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> you have dry skin, and are looking for a good tinted moisturizer, this is for you.</li>
            <li> great quality product a little pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li> It may be too dark if you have a very very light skin tone, but I usually get &#x27;light beige&#x27; or &#x27;beige&#x27; powder and the tint in this product works perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li> Great coverage but not too heavy.</li>
            <li> - surprisingly great coverage without being heavy.  </li>
            <li> Fun fact:</li>
            <li> It is so easy to have a wrinkle cream sunscreen and halfway decent makeup coverage in one tube.</li>
            <li> Feels like a sheer foundation;  goes on extremely smooth; love the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 45.  </li>
            <li> cost more to buy it directly from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It stays looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing while giving light coverage, I love the no makeup look and have been using this product for several years.</li>
            <li> It blends so nicely though - even w/aging skin, enlarged pores, dryness and facial hair and a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; at 45 SPF protection!!</li>
            <li> Does not settle into fine  lines, moisturizing with high SPF.</li>
            <li> Second color is not extreme and to have sunscreen also is Great.</li>
            <li> I immediately loved it, but tried using other (cheaper) products.  </li>
            <li> Blends right in and not shinny or greasy.  </li>
            <li> It blends right in.</li>
            <li> JUST THE RIGHT SHADE FOR MY SKIN TONE.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> It has just the right coverage and in fact have stopped using my BB cream.</li>
            <li> I live in a strong sun state and it works.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very light and the tint makes me look as if I have real  make-up, looks very natural</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and easily break out</li>
            <li> I like this product because of the high SPF rating, the tint in the moisturizer and the light, non-greasy  coverage.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin and this product works great to keep my skin hydrated and protected from UV yet does not break my skin out.</li>
            <li> Great value for a premium product usually sold though dermatologist offices.  </li>
            <li> dermatologist say that there isn&#x27;t a need for anything over SPF30, which I  may have to stick with b/c this stuff also transfers really bad-I had an itch on my nose and took a tissue I had on hand and quickly itched the corner of my nose and the tissue was covered with the tint from the SPF-Am I also taking off SPF when I do this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, great cream especially for the summer.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> This product blends much better and doesn&#x27;t cake or settle into fine lines like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Although if you have SUPER fair skin I&#x27;m not sure it would match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a product that I like very much.  </li>
            <li> I am very light skinned obviously the skin changes during the year</li>
            <li> stuff gives great light coverage, with just enough to mask slight imperfections.  </li>
            <li> I know it works well with the high SPF and makes my skin feel great, but the greasy look is just too much and needs to be toned down a bit.</li>
            <li> This is better and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I like the shade (color) but didn&#x27;t find it to be exactly the miracle color that some have found it to be.</li>
            <li> I was quite interested in this product, since the manufacturer claims it will match any skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Saves so much time missing several products together and suits my skin type (light/medium) perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I will purchase this at a reputable spa and not trust the Internet.</li>
            <li> First I picked it up from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office at the bargain basement price of $55 -</li>
            <li> I was foolish not to check Amazon first.</li>
            <li> I first bought this at my derm&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it moisturizes eliminating tiny lines and the fact the shade compliments any type of complexion.</li>
            <li> I put a powder sunscreen on top of this for extra</li>
            <li> Since using this instead of traditional foundation, my skin is clearer and also looks and feels better when I use it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time to use this product and I just like the way it is..</li>
            <li> matching interested me.    </li>
            <li> I love the 45 SPF and after only a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> This make-up was first sold to me by my skincare specialist.  </li>
            <li> The mat finish, I suspect, would be better for younger skin; it has a drier look/effect.</li>
            <li> and I personally like the matte better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s voodoo magic the way it actually blends in to your skin tone.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;SPF - 45 for us Southern Californians who love the sun, not some wimpy SPF 10 that makes us reapply throughout the day (which I never do</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or breaks outs either which happens often with higher SPF creams.</li>
            <li> Came on time exactly as vendor promised.  </li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I orderd.</li>
            <li> I did break out the first week or two.</li>
            <li> I love that it always matches your skin shade, even in different seasons.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and found on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but, I believe when you first start using this product(if</li>
            <li> colors&amp;#34;-it is more of a light color not the beige I previously had used.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s skin is so fair she is actually white and it blended fine with her skin when even the lightest color foundation looked dark.</li>
            <li> It drags a little as I apply it but putting a light moisturizer underneath (first) is helpful to make it glide on better.</li>
            <li> The matte version balled up pigment on my face, and wasn&#x27;t nearly as even in application as the original product.  </li>
            <li> I actually got this in my dermatologists office but the prices are more reasonable on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> product is great at matching my skin tone both in the winter when I get quite pale and also in the summer when my skin darkens quite considerably from the sun.  </li>
            <li> The positive things are it has no fragrant and SPF 45.</li>
            <li> I had tried samples in the past and loved them, but using the product on-going wasn&#x27;t for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I also have very oily skin and by the afternoon, it&#x27;s pretty much floated away.  </li>
            <li> Good for those long summer days outside.</li>
            <li> Does not have as strong a sunscreen smell as some facial sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and I have been shying away from tinted products because I am fair skinned and the tint is always too dark.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for more coverage or have an olive or dark complexion, this probably isn&#x27;t for you, but if you are looking for natural coverage with moisturizers and some SPF, this product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> But with this cream, it goes on very smoothly with minimal application and stays even throughout the day and through my workouts.</li>
            <li> I can use this during the day with a little mascara and my skin looks flawless, at night with a little powder and a \\&quot;night\\&quot; eye make-up</li>
            <li> This product feels like it&#x27;s good for your skin, and it eliminates the need for moisturizer/sunscreen (this is big for me, since I have very dry skin and don&#x27;t like to spend money on two products when I can use one.)</li>
            <li> It really does blend in well.</li>
            <li> In natural water, however, I throw it in my tote bag and take it with me for fun in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t adjust light enough to match my skin.</li>
            <li> It feels very nourishing and calming to the skin.</li>
            <li> much prefer the Matte finish,.  </li>
            <li> It has a very neutral fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, too and doesn&#x27;t pill up or roll into waxy chunks.</li>
            <li> Somehow, it doesn&#x27;t really match mine.  </li>
            <li> but yet it covers very well.</li>
            <li> find this product to go on and feel greasy the whole time</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give that much coverage, but it does give a sort of glow to your skin and it absorbs well as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Very Dissapointed</li>
            <li> It blends very well with my skin color.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight, blends very well,</li>
            <li> gives my face a natural/dewy finish without looking like I have makeup on, and it really does moisturize.  </li>
            <li> It really saves time as an all-in-one product.  </li>
            <li> , I just don&#x27;t know why everyone likes this product so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Matched my skin tone very well.</li>
            <li> plus it has sunscreen, which I really need.</li>
            <li> I have used for 2 years and it really works.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much per application.  </li>
            <li> it blends very well.</li>
            <li> - it is very drying - this is the one to get.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and has SP45 protection.</li>
            <li> I just wear it with a light setting powder and don&#x27;t even wear regular foundation anymore.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t offer much coverage, but it does do well as a moisturizer, and as an addition to BB.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the more moisturizing regular formula for my mature skin.</li>
            <li> It does add good moisture, so if you wanted to use it under foundation, it is a good base.</li>
            <li> (If you are curious, you&#x27;re welcome to check my other reviews to see which ones).</li>
            <li> The coverage is much better than other tinted moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> So, I was so excited when finally (at the age of 26)</li>
            <li> ,only downside is the price,but is worth it!</li>
            <li> but I love it for other reasons also.  </li>
            <li> This product did not offer enough  coverage and wasn&#x27;t as easy to use or comfortable on the skin as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots, but most sun screens make my eyes water.</li>
            <li> When I buy a tinted moisturizer I expect less coverage than a foundation but more than a BB.  </li>
            <li> use this  is the main part of my morning &amp;#34;Face the World&amp;#34; routine.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer would a better choice for daily use.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to be outside on a super sunny day, I use it alone.  </li>
            <li> it might be a decent product.</li>
            <li> As much as I love this product, it does not pass the EWG Skin Deep database safety standards--meaning there are potentially harmful substances in this product.</li>
            <li> This makeup is very light with little to no coverage.  </li>
            <li> Maybe because I don&#x27;t wear foundation, I&#x27;m not sure, but I didn&#x27;t find it any better then other moisturizers on the market, and not as good as some cheaper ones you can get in your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who has sensitivity to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them both.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this foundation.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Definitely highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for aging lines and coverage.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> have tried other (highly rated) brands of tinted moisturizers and Revision is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes my face a little better.</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday unless you like serious coverage.</li>
            <li> It does not even outr skin tone and is only good if you like to wear very little make- up.</li>
            <li> Really, if you have sensitive skin, try this product.</li>
            <li> I feel I wasted $40 on a product when I could have gotten something better in the drugstore for $15.</li>
            <li> I would have never purchased it if I knew it was an order at your own risk, the product was to thick to comfortably&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like it because it doesn&#x27;t accentuate my fine lines like some other make-ups do.</li>
            <li> It actually makes you look years younger, diminishing your fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> For those of you that find the original formula too wet, try the matte version.</li>
            <li> Other all in one creams that I used were greasier and did not go on as smoothly.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas.</li>
            <li> Product is very easy to apply, It does not feel thick</li>
            <li> The color is very natural, too.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive  skin</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the &amp;#34;intellishade&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in a light, medium and dark color so it would provide more coverage like foundation.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the distribution facility was different that that of the bottle I originally purchased which could possibly be the issue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is exactly the same product by name.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s any better the the OTC products.</li>
            <li> Better than the usual foundation</li>
            <li> I first tried this product after my esthetician put it on me after a facial.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more compliments on my skin the past 2 years</li>
            <li> I usually do not wear foundation with it as I like the coverage and get a lot of compliments on my skin while wearing it.</li>
            <li> Not too light, not too dark.  </li>
            <li> Love this and will never go back to any other make up ever!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m positive there is no tube inside this tiny box.</li>
            <li> Not only does it offer great coverage for everyday wear - particularly in the daytime - it doesn&#x27;t clog pores or feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> Once in a while, on a nice night out, I will use my normal base for more coverage.</li>
            <li> It has a yellow undertone that doesn&#x27;t really flatter my complexion (light skin tone, neutral to slightly pinkish undertones).  </li>
            <li> It does leave my face a little shiny but that is resolved with a light covering of face powder.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wish it gave me a little bit more coverage.</li>
            <li> Expiration date was clearly stated with a sufficient timeline.</li>
            <li> Having had a few  skin cancers  on my face removed, I know how important it is to apply sunscreen every day.</li>
            <li> old.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by a skin care professional-</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised that this</li>
            <li> It looks natural.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> As a tinted moisturizer, it is not a heavy foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend you give it a try; it&#x27;s not too heavy and not too light</li>
            <li> Natural coverage with sun protection.</li>
            <li> not a heavy coverage</li>
            <li> LOOKS AND FEELS SOFT</li>
            <li> My wife used it - found that it seemed like it was old --  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had years of issues with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> A natural look for someone not wanting to use foundation.</li>
            <li> - it makes your skin look young and seamless</li>
            <li> I have yet to find an organic, natural BB cream that does what this does.</li>
            <li> If you like a natural look , this is for you.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy or light.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for at least 2 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> so this somewhat evens out the redness although it is not a heavy, covering makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can experience breakout w/</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin)if</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or thick but look in the mirror 20 minutes later</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this product is very light, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought the original (vs the matte) and it gives a little glow.</li>
            <li> (Pretty much EVERY SPF product has a shine to it, so this issue is not unique to this product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is more natural than other products that I have used of other brands</li>
            <li> This Amazon purchase is the exact same product, but for some reason it is lighter in appearance and doesn&#x27;t give me the same sun-kissed look.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend- use it daily....</li>
            <li> I normally use Bare Minerals and felt that it covered just as well without all the excessive twirling of the powder brush and the clean up that would always need to be done</li>
            <li> I use a little loose powder and/or blush for more coverage.  </li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to straight make up base AND is has a 45 SPF.    </li>
            <li> Give it a try, it is a major time saver.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricier than some products, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Apparently they also make a matte version</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly and you can barely tell it is there</li>
            <li> I just use my bare minerals foundation over it and out the door</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin it definitely is a must.</li>
            <li> I have been told that I look years younger by two people so far.</li>
            <li> But it felt thick and sticky and nothing like the original product I bought at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It covers the dark spots very well and works well with my powder.  </li>
            <li> It makes my otherwise uneven, blotched skin tone look absolutely radiant!</li>
            <li> have not used this product very long, maybe a month, but I like it, so far.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount for coverage and goes on a little heavier than my current CC foundation but lighter than most sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 31-year-old new mom and my morning &amp;#34;beautifying&amp;#34; time has been cut down to about 5-10 minutes tops now</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product doesn&#x27;t have  much popularity.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day with a little mascara for a very natural look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of different products in the effort to fade my freckles, to little avail, but I am finding that they are naturally fading from lack of sun exposure since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> If my skin is feeling extra dry, I&#x27;ll mix in a little face lotion (I live in the desert).  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage either and disappears after several hours, so at least for me, some sort of foundation is needed.  </li>
            <li> It is not very moisturizing though, so I do put on my face lotion first, and then a small amount of this tinted lotion.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so I moisten my fingers slightly before applying, use very little and it glides right on.</li>
            <li> For those not interested in purchasing Revision Skincare products from a doctor or medical spa, I can personally recommend Lovelyskin.com, which is indeed an authorized distributor of Revision Skincare products.  </li>
            <li> Recently I actually took it all off in the car, the dark color was so obvious</li>
            <li> I am not a professional</li>
            <li> I have bought three tubes and plan to continue using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> had been in the tube a long time --</li>
            <li> Not a professional</li>
            <li> Previously, we had been using bare minerals.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other products for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this daily under powder type makeup as I want as little sun tan as possible on my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream because it provides SPF and a little bit of color without feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I use the matt during the summer when it is humid and the intellishade during the winter when it dry.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and then use Intellishade and done.</li>
            <li> I still use a moisturizer, but that is because I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin usually isn&#x27;t what I would call sensitive, and I purchased as it is one my dermatologist sells in her office.</li>
            <li> It did give a slight and gradual improvement in overall skin tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As such, the ingredients in this product could be compromised and have less than acceptable results.  </li>
            <li> but I would prefer to use my Peter Thomas Roth Uber Dry SPF 30 with a little foundation brushed in areas opposed to this greasy feel all over my face-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this was a little pricey,  the cost was comparable to the same purchase at the spa.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day and mix it with a little regular face cream to stretch the use.</li>
            <li> I found that this version of the product left my skin looking a little shiny and greasy.  </li>
            <li> There are few beauty products I am willing to pay serious cash for.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, product was as expected.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product a few times but it seems to work.  </li>
            <li> My Dr. told me to stay out of the sun, and use this everyday as part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> It does absorb well, but be careful of getting it into your eyes because it does cause blurry vision and your eyes to tear.</li>
            <li> Not heavy and thick.  </li>
            <li> It provides just enough color to my face so that I don&#x27;t look pale.  </li>
            <li> Getting made up is so much quicker now--and less expensive, since all three necessary products are in one tube.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it lasts some time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it post-Accutane, when my face was tight and dry.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my plastic surgeon due to a bike crash.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll just use it on places other than my face.  </li>
            <li> so you have to let it sink it before you put any other makeup on.</li>
            <li> But, after a couple of uses I noticed my pores were extremely clogged, and then my face started breaking out again.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need any other make-up.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of tinted moisturizers and they just don&#x27;t go on like this one does.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to interact with other products, pill or roll.</li>
            <li> It conceals my scars, and fades any active acne spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big makeup wearer and this goes on like a light base but feels like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m confused!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot but find it just a little thicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t cover breakouts or dark spots and is too dark for my skin shade.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I don&#x27;t feel like it is truly a SPF 45.  </li>
            <li> I have strangers compliment my skin frequently and want to know my secret.</li>
            <li> I end up having to put powder over this to tone down the oiliness</li>
            <li> I add a little bit of base if I want more coverage.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy this for $50 at my dermatologist&#x27;s office but now getting them for less from Amazon.</li>
            <li> half the price that my dermatologist sells it for.</li>
            <li> I am a brown skin black woman.  </li>
            <li> and it has a slight tint.</li>
            <li> so sometimes it is a little too dark</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it pre-Accutane, when my face was a volcanic, greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I find this moisturizer too thick to apply; therefore, it takes a long time to absorb, it&#x27;s almost like a foundation</li>
            <li> so I use a little powder to help with coverage.</li>
            <li> The finish is a little dewy, but once you put powder on that goes away.</li>
            <li> Just wish the coverage was a little longer</li>
            <li> I put it on sometimes just because I want to feel a little prettier,  even when im just sitting around the house.</li>
            <li> It can still be a little chalky (even with the tint)</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> I think it would work with any skin color except possibly very dark skin.</li>
            <li> Used on my whole face this product stays very greasy and shiny, covers nothing  and breaks me out horribly.</li>
            <li> This is not a light moisturizer, but it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> &amp; I hate that heavy thick feeling of most makeup</li>
            <li> I use it under a light application of base.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any corrections or improvements for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I use it for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I wear this product everyday, in place of make-up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;During the summer I just think this is way too heavy-</li>
            <li> round-</li>
            <li> Or using a really heavy foundation with sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> over your face,  waste of $37.75....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy makeup and have used mineral makeup for years.  </li>
            <li> I use it all year round as my foundation.  </li>
            <li> This foundation is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Not to greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t use harsh retinol products</li>
            <li> it is because of the ingredients used to help firm your skin.</li>
            <li> just add a little moisturizer (revision has a 20 sunscreen plain moisturizer)</li>
            <li> Put my order in and even received my product in less than the amount of time it said it was going to take!</li>
            <li> It is a little thick</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a legitimate product.</li>
            <li> Then use a small amount of foundation.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended it for sunscreen protection, now i wear it as my everyday make-up!</li>
            <li> Expensive to buy locally.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is the one I had intended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it clogs pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer every morning  for the past 2 years and wouldn&#x27;t  think of changing it.</li>
            <li> Not pleased by it.  </li>
            <li> Wondering what went wrong with my order and am sending this back.</li>
            <li> I am anxious for spring to come to see how the SPF works.</li>
            <li> but you usually get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be too dark for my pale skin shade and even worse, I broke out after I used it.</li>
            <li> Major disappointment.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover dark freckles or broken capillaries</li>
            <li> I used to buy this through my MedSpa, but started ordering it on Amazon because it&#x27;s a little bit less expensive, and easier.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly tell that I have make-up on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little confused as to why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 weeks, and there has been no breakouts, bumps or any negative effects.  </li>
            <li> At least not for me.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t open it, because I was afraid doing so might void my ability to return</li>
            <li> At least it is cheaper on Amazon than at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Too thick.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> It is very thick.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re poor like me, just use it</li>
            <li> I had a poor complexion and now.......</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like both the texture (too thin) and color (too orange)</li>
            <li> and no one can see my enlarged pores, broken capillaries, and brown spots.  </li>
            <li> Weird stuff-colors like a make up but blotches like a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Made me breakout, poor coverage, just didn&#x27;t work for my skin at all!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am usually wary of &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> hate heavy make up - have never worn anything until in my 60s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 &amp; ordered this after reading all of the rave reviews on it &amp; figured how bad could it be?</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> Hate that line you get where your makeup ended</li>
            <li> or I like to wear it as a base under my power make-up.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great stuff. Excellent protection and make-up combined</li>
            <li> Best tinted sunscreen!  I use the matt during the summer when it is humid and the intellishade during the winter when it dry.  I use it in place of foundation and put a powder over it. I love it</li>
            <li> Love this makeup. I bought some for my sister and she fell in love with it also. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Light with some coverage. Does not settle into fine  lines, moisturizing with high SPF. Good for those long summer days outside.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I could no longer purchase Josie Moran&#x27;s tinted argon oil moisturizer at QVC.  This is better and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my plastic surgeon due to a bike crash.  I utilize this product for sun protection and foundation coverage. By ordering on-line, it saves me a trip to the MD office.</li>
            <li> Great product and fair price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years.  It had a tent and is sun screen of 45  also is creamy. Love it</li>
            <li> My daughter has had acne and this seemed help. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love it, it blends in so nicely.  I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this tinted moisturizer. Much more coverage than you would expect, perfect match for most skin colors ( including my super pale skin) - how do they do that?! Gives a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this through a skin care boutique an it did a good job.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the &amp;#34;intellishade&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in a light, medium and dark color so it would provide more coverage like foundation.</li>
            <li> There are few beauty products I am willing to pay serious cash for. (If you are curious, you&#x27;re welcome to check my other reviews to see which ones). This is hands-down one of the best skin care products I&#x27;ve encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is very thick. This is not a light moisturizer, but it is not greasy. Although, I do feel its necessary to dab translucent powder to matte the shine. (Pretty much EVERY SPF product has a shine to it, so this issue is not unique to this product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The color is fantastic. It really does blend in well. It looks like I&#x27;m wearing nothing at all. This is no foundation by any means, but I&#x27;ve tried a TON of tinted moisturizers. This one yielded the best, natural color. Even better, the pigment does not ball up like so many tinted moisturizers do. The color remains evenly on your face throughout the entire day. It conceals my scars, and fades any active acne spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The moisture level is perfect. I&#x27;ve used it in summer and winter. I&#x27;ve used it pre-Accutane, when my face was a volcanic, greasy mess. I&#x27;ve used it post-Accutane, when my face was tight and dry. The moisture was perfect every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Since I am on a budget, I don&#x27;t like to use this at night, or when I&#x27;m only hanging around the house. The tint is a gorgeous glow, so I use it before I leave in the morning. Fun fact: this stays on remarkably well when swimming. I live in Texas. We love our lakes and rivers. This will NOT last in a chlorinated pool. In natural water, however, I throw it in my tote bag and take it with me for fun in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is no discernible smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It did give a slight and gradual improvement in overall skin tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it helps to compare your skin type to mine, I&#x27;m Caucasian, with fair skin and freckles. Give it a try, it is a major time saver. If you&#x27;re poor like me, just use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.  I did also try the matte version of this, and frankly I did not like it.  The matte version balled up pigment on my face, and wasn&#x27;t nearly as even in application as the original product.  Just something to consider if you are looking at the matte version as well.</li>
            <li> On time and grear product use every day. Stops skin cance r</li>
            <li> I like having a tinted moisturizer with SPF protection. I don&#x27;t need to use a foundation when I use this product since it provide me with good coverage.</li>
            <li> I love Intellishade.  It takes place of moisturizer, sunscreen, and makeup.  It goes on smoothly and looks fresh on your face.  It has not caused any breakouts.  Since this is waterproof, it works well outside as well.</li>
            <li> Why I say for summer is that I am very fair and I get a hint of color during the summer months, but I find even with the adjusting color it doesn&#x27;t adjust light enough to match my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s good for fair skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin &amp; I hate that heavy thick feeling of most makeup, this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I used to buy this for $50 at my dermatologist&#x27;s office but now getting them for less from Amazon. I&#x27;ve had no problems with my purchases and have never received one that was expired or defective.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. I have used it, per the recommendation of my dermatologist, for over a year.  It is easy to apply and blends well.  I use it under a light application of base.  It feels very nourishing and calming to the skin.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the Original version of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the Matte finish,.  I think it covers better and gives a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I use this  is the main part of my morning &amp;#34;Face the World&amp;#34; routine.</li>
            <li> perfect color, great price</li>
            <li> This blends in perfectly with my skin color. It makes my skin look dewy. I also like it because it doesn&#x27;t accentuate my fine lines like some other make-ups do. It doesn&#x27;t cover dark freckles or broken capillaries so I use a little powder to help with coverage.</li>
            <li> I struggle with suncreen products as they tend to cause breakouts, but Intellishade is AMAZING!  It&#x27;s not greasy, and even though it is tinted, it goes on smoothly and without streaking. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 weeks, and there has been no breakouts, bumps or any negative effects.  The protection is fantastic.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has sensitivity to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot but find it just a little thicker than I expected. It drags a little as I apply it but putting a light moisturizer underneath (first) is helpful to make it glide on better. I like the shade (color) but didn&#x27;t find it to be exactly the miracle color that some have found it to be. It covers well and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts but I&#x27;m not a person who gets blemishes anyway. It has a very neutral fragrance. I&#x27;m happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a legitimate product. I have purchased the same item from a cosmetology clinic, which had several differences to this item. The smell and texture was off and the finish of the packaging was different. I noticed that the distribution facility was different that that of the bottle I originally purchased which could possibly be the issue.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for a minimal coverage makeup. A tinted moisturizer type of product that conceals better and is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time..Just absolutely love it..Will order again and again</li>
            <li> Incredible. Perfect every time. Very moisturizing, too and doesn&#x27;t pill up or roll into waxy chunks.</li>
            <li> I was quite interested in this product, since the manufacturer claims it will match any skin tone.  Somehow, it doesn&#x27;t really match mine.  It has a yellow undertone that doesn&#x27;t really flatter my complexion (light skin tone, neutral to slightly pinkish undertones).  It doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage either and disappears after several hours, so at least for me, some sort of foundation is needed.  I also have very oily skin and by the afternoon, it&#x27;s pretty much floated away.  I&#x27;m not going to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Watch your expiration dates!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to do it all and found it in this product.  Saves so much time missing several products together and suits my skin type (light/medium) perfectly.  Looks flawless.  Love it - don&#x27;t think I can use anything else now.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I wear it alone or under makeup. I prefer the original to the matte. It moisturizes my face a little better. Both are very good. I highly recommend them both.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past year - Excellent Product, the best tinted moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever had; I have very sensitive skin and usually get blemishes and pimples from most products. Color matches perfectly on my fair skin :)) Love it</li>
            <li> SPF 45 is great and the moisturizer truly blends perfectly and gives skin a wonderful glow. I knew I would love it from the moment I put it on!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product!  I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear it.  Beauty in a sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Tinted moisturizer with SPF 45 goes on easily and lasts all day.  It blends into most skin tones and has a smooth feel and look.</li>
            <li> Good coverage and feel moist on the skin.  The tint takes away the chalky look</li>
            <li> I liked this product at first but it doesn&#x27;t cover breakouts or dark spots and is too dark for my skin shade. It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or thick but look in the mirror 20 minutes later and you see every flaw.  I have to use another makeup to even out my skin tone. Recently I actually took it all off in the car, the dark color was so obvious and fortunately I had another lighter makeup with me.  I&#x27;d say my skin is light to fair and Revision does not match.  Hate that line you get where your makeup ended and your skin started.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist and it&#x27;s amazing. Your skin will look flawless!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Much much better than the matte.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to straight make up base AND is has a 45 SPF.    It is so moist that I follow up with a powder finish.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Great product to use alone or with your base makeup.  It goes on smooth and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> You will love this tinted moisturizer; been using it at the recommendation of my dermatologist for several years and still works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this at an upscale spa along time ago and I loved it. When it ran out I found it on Amazon and purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly the same product by name. But it felt thick and sticky and nothing like the original product I bought at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little confused as to why. This also happened once with some kiss my face brand body wash that I bought on Amazon too.  Makes me wonder if something is fishy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No I did not try to return it. I guess I&#x27;ll just use it on places other than my face.  Next time, I will purchase this at a reputable spa and not trust the Internet.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found for summer.  It is a lightweight sunscreen that reminds me of a tinted moisturizer.  It has just enough pigment to cover imperfections.  I add a little bit of base if I want more coverage.  Amazing how it adapts to skin colors.  You don&#x27;t need to try to figure out which color.</li>
            <li> Used on my whole face this product stays very greasy and shiny, covers nothing  and breaks me out horribly. I decided to try it as an under eye concealer since I ran out of my regular one and I love it. My milia have greatly diminished and my under eyes seems much younger looking and moisturized! not to mention it&#x27;s spf 45 :) I upped my lippies from 1 to 3 since I still would not use it on my whole face ever again.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Can&#x27;t say enough of how great it is!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. It was originally given to me by my plastic surgeon to protect my skin. I think it works.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Great coverage but not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wear make up over a cream! Just put this in and go. Blends right in and not shinny or greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t sweat off in the sun and that&#x27;s a plus for a fla. girl. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wish it gave me a little bit more coverage.</li>
            <li> When I use this, I do not need Foundation.  It tints, moisturizes and sun blocks.  Great product.  Good for Amazon to be able to supply it.  BEF</li>
            <li> It is so easy to have a wrinkle cream sunscreen and halfway decent makeup coverage in one tube. Its great and lasts all day without the smell of sunscreen</li>
            <li> I find this moisturizer too thick to apply; therefore, it takes a long time to absorb, it&#x27;s almost like a foundation yet the color doesn&#x27;t quite match my Asian skin color, medium beige.  It produces a shiny and unnatural look even after hours of wearing.  The positive things are it has no fragrant and SPF 45. I don&#x27;t notice any corrections or improvements for a few months now. Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer would a better choice for daily use.</li>
            <li> I have used this product exclusively for 2 years and have had comments on my &#x27;beautiful&#x27; skin many times  I&lt;br /&gt; have been stopped  in stores, and told how beautiful my skin is  All my ilife I had a poor complexion and now.......&lt;br /&gt;Because of all the compliments I have recommended it; and have 6 ladies ( all much younger than me), are now using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very happy and young looking 72 yr old lady and by the way even doctors have remarked that I don&#x27;t look my age&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> I like this because it has a very sheer color ....just enough coverage without being caked on. Plus it is a good strong SPF</li>
            <li> Although this was a little pricey,  the cost was comparable to the same purchase at the spa.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s any better the the OTC products.</li>
            <li> I like this product and the one that arrived is the one I ordered. It is more natural than other products that I have used of other brands</li>
            <li> good product non greasy</li>
            <li> Great product and great service.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to wear foundation, but this is so light I have to use both.  I won&#x27;t buy again because I have sunscreen.  I was trying to get rid of one step!  If you don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage, this would be a great product to have.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites.  I am a low maintenance kind of gal and like that this product is easy to use.  Does a great job of coverage and not greasy.  In fact, I don&#x27;t even know I have on sunscreen! (Because of the way it feels not the way it performs.) I use it for everyday use.  Once in a while, on a nice night out, I will use my normal base for more coverage.</li>
            <li> I wear this product everyday, in place of make-up. It has enough color for me. I like the amount of moisturizer and sunscreen in it.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used this product very long, maybe a month, but I like it, so far.</li>
            <li> Product is very easy to apply, It does not feel thick it&#x27;s very light and the tint makes me look as if I have real  make-up, looks very natural but yet it covers very well. I am pleased</li>
            <li> it does what it says and works great</li>
            <li> Got my order very quickly! Put my order in and even received my product in less than the amount of time it said it was going to take!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00396VE7U Revision Intellishade SPF 45 - 1.7oz.]]Absolutely perfect moisturizing-tint lotion. I get this in the original and the matte then I mix them together. I have combination skin and this product is very light, a little goes a long way. First I picked it up from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office at the bargain basement price of $55 - I was foolish not to check Amazon first. A very strong competitor for Revision Intellishade is &#x27;Miracle skin transformer&#x27; they have a great line to choose from - yes of course the products are available from Amazon seller&#x27;s :0)</li>
            <li> Awesome moisturizer with a bit of tint.  Splash some powder over and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Tint is perfect.  Sunscreen at 45 gives great protection.  It also doesn&#x27;t make me break out, which has been a continual problem in finding a daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love this. I wear it over my moisturizers.  Then use Replenix Sheer Physical Sunscreen.  Then use a small amount of foundation.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional however I speak from experience with years of skin troubles, dermatologists, estheticians and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;This is hands down the best sunscreen/day time mositurizer / BB type product available. I started this when dermatologists did not make a difference and I went to a specialist dealing with skin. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Feels like a sheer foundation;  goes on extremely smooth; love the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 45.  The color is very natural, too.</li>
            <li> This is what my dermatologist suggested I try since she said I have melasma and need more than a SPF 30-So instead of buying in the office which is $48 I ordered online-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product to go on and feel greasy the whole time-I have even used a makeup brush to really lightly apply it and s-p-r-e-a-d it out but that doesn&#x27;t work-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some dermatologist say that there isn&#x27;t a need for anything over SPF30, which I  may have to stick with b/c this stuff also transfers really bad-I had an itch on my nose and took a tissue I had on hand and quickly itched the corner of my nose and the tissue was covered with the tint from the SPF-Am I also taking off SPF when I do this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the summer I just think this is way too heavy-Maybe, just maybe in the winter I may try it out but I would prefer to use my Peter Thomas Roth Uber Dry SPF 30 with a little foundation brushed in areas opposed to this greasy feel all over my face-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better products out there-</li>
            <li> Im asian with combination skin Type. There was a hype about this product so I tried it. It reminded me of BB cream that was a sensation in Asian countries about 10 years ago. Try BB cream from hanskin. I think hanskin had way better coverage with spf and calming effect</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist and I found it to be excellent and not a good price.  I will be ordering it regularly.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Intellishade I purchased from Amazon. I wear it sometimes as my only makeup. It works well as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Better than the usual foundation</li>
            <li> Not greasy. Feels great. Just enough cover.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!  Gives my skin a dewey look with a healthy glow!  Great sun protection as well!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and easily break out this is the best tinted moisturizer in the best thing is you don&#x27;t have to worry about the color!  great quality product a little pricey but worth it.  cost more to buy it directly from my dermatologist. Seller had a good price and good service will use them again</li>
            <li> I first bought this at my derm&#x27;s office.  I am always looking for great ways to incorporate sunscreen into my daily regimen.  I mix some of this with my Lancôme foundation to increase the protection.  If I&#x27;m going to be outside on a super sunny day, I use it alone.  It also evens out your complexion and reduces the redness, which I like.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that&#x27;s going to give you the same amount of coverage as, say, a BB or CC cream, this isn&#x27;t it.  At least not for me.  It doesn&#x27;t give that much coverage, but it does give a sort of glow to your skin and it absorbs well as a moisturizer.  It&#x27;s also not runny, so the SPF doesn&#x27;t get into your eyes and make them tear up.  I use this as a sunscreen many days, but not in place of any kind of covering foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I priced this in my dermatologist&#x27;s office but bought it here because it&#x27;s about $10 cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this as a sunscreen/foundation and it protects my skin and makes it look healthy and dewy. It applies with ease and feels marvelous and light. It stays looking fresh all day. I have strangers compliment my skin frequently and want to know my secret. I use the original as my skin likes that best. Some people prefer the Matte.</li>
            <li> I have used Revision Moisturizer &amp; Revision Tinted Moisturizer for 3 years now- I will never go back to any other products for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Tinted Moisturizer ALL year round- I am over 60 .... and I like the natural look &amp; get very nice compliments on my face - YEA !&lt;br /&gt;There is never that \\&quot;make up line\\&quot; it blends perfectly- keep up the good products Revision !!</li>
            <li> Revision Intellishade SPF 45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love this product.  Having had a few  skin cancers  on my face removed, I know how important it is to apply sunscreen every day. This product is my sunscreen, moisturizer, foundation all in one. It is light, sheer, and good for all skin shades.  I have been using this product for  three years and would not use anything else on my face.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, product was as expected.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!! It has a good sunscreen and light tint...it&#x27;s all I need for makeup. I just use moisturizer coz I have dry skin and then use Intellishade and done.</li>
            <li> It is a little thick so you have to let it sink it before you put any other makeup on. But I also use a moisturizer under it. I think you could use it alone as just a moisturizer/foundation but I have not tried that yet. Does not have as strong a sunscreen smell as some facial sunscreens. And it DOES do it&#x27;s job as a sunscreen, unlike some foundations that claim to have sunscreen in them. The finish is a little dewy, but once you put powder on that goes away. Apparently they also make a matte version but I have not tried that. I have fair/medium yellow tinged skin and the color blends perfectly. I think it would work with any skin color except possibly very dark skin. My daughter&#x27;s skin is so fair she is actually white and it blended fine with her skin when even the lightest color foundation looked dark.</li>
            <li> This is the best tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve come across and it&#x27;s a daily staple.  The coverage is much better than other tinted moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.  It applies easily, feels good on my skin, but carries more of a sheer, even coverage than regular foundation.  The fact that it has SPF of 45 makes it a must have.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended it for sunscreen protection, now i wear it as my everyday make-up! Moisturizer, make-up and sunscreen all in one . Great value for a premium product usually sold though dermatologist offices.  That is where  I got started, now save money ordering online.</li>
            <li> Gave me a rash, and didn&#x27;t wash off easily at the end of the day.  Thumbs down, I was hoping I&#x27;d found a great all in one product.</li>
            <li> Weird stuff-colors like a make up but blotches like a sunscreen. I would not buy this product again. Very Dissapointed</li>
            <li> Made me breakout, poor coverage, just didn&#x27;t work for my skin at all!</li>
            <li> This works great.  Looks very natural but provides light coverage and has been great with sun protection.  I have been using this for several years and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Fantastic!  Goes on smooth &amp; color blends in.  .  .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a year. Love the way it moisturizes eliminating tiny lines and the fact the shade compliments any type of complexion.</li>
            <li> Tinted sunblock recommended by both my dermatologist and a well known plastic surgeon, this stuff ROCKS!!!!  It is a &#x27;one shade&#x27; tint and it blends perfectly with my skin.  I don&#x27;t like the feel of foundation and the coating it seems to leave on my skin.  Revision Intellishade SPF 45 is so lightweight I don&#x27;t feel it on my skin AND it blocks the sun to prevent sun-damage.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this tinted moisturizer with sunscreen protection and&lt;br /&gt;the fact that it blends in with any skin tone. I am fair skinned&lt;br /&gt;with freckles. I like the anti-aging factor also as I am 73 yrs. old.</li>
            <li> I love this all in one product. Works well as a. Foundation. Gives full coverage. You never have to worry about picking a shade. It blends right in.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I like very much.  It blends very well with my skin color.  Expensive to buy locally.</li>
            <li> This product did not offer enough  coverage and wasn&#x27;t as easy to use or comfortable on the skin as I expected.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It was recommended to me by a skin care professional- and I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like both the texture (too thin) and color (too orange), I&#x27;m amazed at all the 5 star reviews.  Elta MD Lightly Tinted for Extra-Sensitive Skin is far superior sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It takes away the double duty of putting on suncreen under your foundation. Or using a really heavy foundation with sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> I love having a product that is affordable and also has sunblock in it.  Love being able to put it on and be able to be out the door on a busy day.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, no matter what your skin tone is this product gives you sun protection and great coverage.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen foundation. Goes on smooth and adjust color to my tones. The best part.....half the price that my dermatologist sells it for.</li>
            <li> I only use Revision products because my dermatalogist recommended Revsion skin care. Love the products.</li>
            <li> I returned this product and purchased it elsewhere.  According to a Senior Executive at Revision Skincare products, companies affiliated with Amazon are not “authorized outlets” for the distribution of their products and therefore this product should not be considered an “authentic” Revision product.  As such, the ingredients in this product could be compromised and have less than acceptable results.  For those not interested in purchasing Revision Skincare products from a doctor or medical spa, I can personally recommend Lovelyskin.com, which is indeed an authorized distributor of Revision Skincare products.  And no, I am not an employee of Lovelyskin.com, simply a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I would have never purchased it if I knew it was an order at your own risk, the product was to thick to comfortably&lt;br /&gt;spread over your face,  waste of $37.75....</li>
            <li> Makeup is so awesome ! Gives great even tones throughout the day... Even when I am sweaty it seems to stay on great</li>
            <li> I use this daily under powder type makeup as I want as little sun tan as possible on my face. It smooths over the face nicely, though I wish it were more lotion than cream. It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause blemishes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  Sold on this moisturizer</li>
            <li> Too thick.  I am not sure this is the one I had intended.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, great delivery, flawless</li>
            <li> Revision is terrific.  It moisturizes and evens the skin tone beautifully.  The best part though is the 45 SPF....not need for additional sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have the neck cream and absolutely love it.  This product did not work on my skin.  I did not like the coverage it provided.  Needless to say, would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It goes on very smoothly and I use it as a foundation and a moisturizer.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be too dark for my pale skin shade and even worse, I broke out after I used it.</li>
            <li> The revision line is spectacular. I use this every day and mix it with a little regular face cream to stretch the use. Covers perfectly doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. Nice finish</li>
            <li> Love this! Probably on my 5th tube of it. If you are looking for coverage of foundation, this is not for you. This is very light coverage, doesn&#x27;t require a lot of blending. You can build coverage on top of it though.  Skin looks healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> Love putting this stuff on on the weekends when I want to run to the grocery store or Target in the morning, but am not quite ready t have on a full face of makeup. It is not very moisturizing though, so I do put on my face lotion first, and then a small amount of this tinted lotion.</li>
            <li> best sunscreen ever.  i get compliments weekly about my &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;- thx intellishade!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend- use it daily....great moisture and sunscreen... won&#x27;t leave home without applying.  use it as a foundation so saves me money on makeup.</li>
            <li> This is incredible make-up especially for mature women who no longer respond to over the counter make-up. Clean face, moisturizer (I use Vivite), eye cream, and then Intellishade. Looks great with all skin tones.</li>
            <li> Good coverage; smooth and natural look and finish for the face - excellent protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> I am usually wary of &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34; product ---but I have been pleasantly surprised that this&lt;br /&gt;product does what it says it does and it blends perfectly with my skin tone</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Intellishade!! This is my go-to foundation and sunscreen, I just sweep some Bare Minerals over it and my face not only looks perfect, it&#x27;s protected too. Almost every type of sunscreen make me breakout but not Intellishade.</li>
            <li> Have used this foundation since 2009. It works well and is moisturizing, plus has sun protection. Would highly recommend this foundation.</li>
            <li> Combines my make-up and SPF protection in one. I use matte during the summer and the original during the winter. The original gives me a dewy look which is great.</li>
            <li> Love this and will never go back to any other make up ever!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It has made a difference in my dog&#x27;s oral health</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It arrived with ALL packaging sealed and the tube was Sealed.  Expiration date was clearly stated with a sufficient timeline. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Intellishade product for 5 or so years.  Suits my skin tone perfectly and is a great sunscreen.  One shade fits all . . .well most, anyway.</li>
            <li> Love this tinted sunblock/moisturizers. They can almost be used as a foundation.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The reason this product is so wonderful is because it&#x27;s moisturizer and foundation in one.  If you&#x27;ve got oily skin (like me), it&#x27;s great to only have to use one product.  And the SPF 45 is perfect when you&#x27;re outdoors.  Highly recommend it.  And it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly.  I bought the same tube earlier at twice the price from my aesthetician.  For those who don&#x27;t want to layer foundation, this is a wonderful alternative.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and have loved it. This time it feels like the product has changed. It used to feel and look like a smooth, creamy tinted moisturizer that blended easily into my skin with a nice dewy glow. This last purchase feels more like sunscreen that stays more on the surface and does not blend in so well. I&#x27;m not sure I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy makeup and have used mineral makeup for years.  After trying this product, I will never go back to mineral makeup.  It goes on evenly and you can barely tell it is there but your skin tone looks great.</li>
            <li> Best tinted moisturizer on the market - I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it. Light coverage wears nicely all day - highly recommend and it has spf!!</li>
            <li> smooth to apply, and you do not even know it is there.  Love it</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It is lightweight, blends very well, gives my face a natural/dewy finish without looking like I have makeup on, and it really does moisturize.  My only complaint is I don&#x27;t feel like it is truly a SPF 45.  I would give it more of a SPF 20 rating.  I put a powder sunscreen on top of this for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other (highly rated) brands of tinted moisturizers and Revision is by far my favorite.  This product blends much better and doesn&#x27;t cake or settle into fine lines like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Since using this instead of traditional foundation, my skin is clearer and also looks and feels better when I use it.  If you are looking for more coverage or have an olive or dark complexion, this probably isn&#x27;t for you, but if you are looking for natural coverage with moisturizers and some SPF, this product is fantastic.  It really saves time as an all-in-one product.  (FYI - I am very fair with sensitive/slightly acne prone skin)</li>
            <li> I accidentally order orginal instead of matte😁</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and I have been shying away from tinted products because I am fair skinned and the tint is always too dark. Most products like this also settle into my wrinkles making them look more pronounced.   This suncreen acts as a moisturizer, sunscreen, and skin tone color corrector. I love it! My skin looks smmother with it on too!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use this product and I just like the way it is..It just blend w/ my Asian color and my sister love it too..:) i recommend this product..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 &amp; ordered this after reading all of the rave reviews on it &amp; figured how bad could it be? Well, it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s bad, I just don&#x27;t know why everyone likes this product so much. Maybe because I don&#x27;t wear foundation, I&#x27;m not sure, but I didn&#x27;t find it any better then other moisturizers on the market, and not as good as some cheaper ones you can get in your local drugstore. I feel I wasted $40 on a product when I could have gotten something better in the drugstore for $15. Major disappointment.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it daily. I am happy with the product. Enjoy the product..  It is great protection from sun.</li>
            <li> Covers and blends with your skin, gives moisture as well as evening out the tone.  I love this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received liturature on Intellishade from my dermatologist.  The 45 SPF and no fuss shade matching interested me.    I have only used the product a few times but it seems to work.  It looks natural.  I am not sure if it clogs pores.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this product for almost a year now and we just love it. Previously, we had been using bare minerals. I liked the coverage I got with bare minerals, but I still felt like I had makeup on. I also had to change shades from winter to summer. This spring, I ran out of my moisturizer and I was introduced to Revision Intellishade. I was skeptal, but I thought I would give it a try. It perfectly matched my skin and provided just the right amount of coverage. My daughter also tried it. She is more fairer complected than I am. It matched her skin perfectly, as well. I have tried other tinted moisturizers, but this one is the best. For those of you that find the original formula too wet, try the matte version.</li>
            <li> love the tinted make-up</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  Great for mature skin and is also a moisturizer as well as a sun screen!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  My Dr. told me to stay out of the sun, and use this everyday as part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> What a great product! I have very sensitive  skin and this is this stuff works and makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful - I am so glad my dermatologist recommended it to me.  She charges double the price here on Amazon - so I get it from Amazon.  I have drier skin, so this original formula is perfect for me.  My skin just looks healthy and has a more even tone.  I use it daily as a moisturizer, sun block and foundation.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, a moisturizer and sunscreen combination. This product is very easy to use, just put it on and it adapts to your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple years now and love it.  It provides just enough color to my face so that I don&#x27;t look pale.  I love the fact that I have sun protection as well.  I don&#x27;t use a foundation product so this is my foundation providing a nice even tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the original and the matte formulas and the matte is too matte and the original is ok, but could use a tad more coverage. I end up having to put powder over this to tone down the oiliness is leaves... I know it works well with the high SPF and makes my skin feel great, but the greasy look is just too much and needs to be toned down a bit. I tend to use this when I know I will be outdoors often in the summer and need the SPF. The SPF level is prefect, just wish it didn&#x27;t feel so greasy and had a bit more coverage.</li>
            <li> Intellishade was recommended by my dermatologist&#x27;s office. It only takes a small amount for coverage and goes on a little heavier than my current CC foundation but lighter than most sunscreen. I love the 45 SPF and after only a couple of weeks I&#x27;m starting to see evening of skin tone. I bought the original (vs the matte) and it gives a little glow.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m not a big makeup wearer and this goes on like a light base but feels like a moisturizer. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I can see why its nothing short of amazing! It is a moisturizer and so light on the skin while still being a 45 sunscreen - the tint is a bonus! I am very light skinned obviously the skin changes during the year so sometimes it is a little too dark just add a little moisturizer (revision has a 20 sunscreen plain moisturizer) and it makes the color perfect - anytime I want coverage of a foundation I just use my bare minerals foundation over it and out the door I go with beautiful, protected skin without feeling like I have a mask on!</li>
            <li> Revision Intellishade is a perfect match for my skin in all seasons. Living in California requires me to us a high SPF and this product spares my skin the rays, adds a light and lovely coverage and moisturizers. All in one.</li>
            <li> Goes on extremely  smoothly, fast and easy.  Does 3 things in one! Gives light, but good coverage when you don&#x27;t need heavier foundation make-up.  Good for weekend daytime, running out to go shopping, vacation times outdoors etc.  Remember you always need a good SPF #!</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a darker shade.  It is suppose to blend to any color skin.  I am a brown skin black woman.  It does blend but I wish it came in a darker shade.  Makes skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years as my main moisturizer and sun screen in one and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Great color that blends effortlessly.  Great texture, coverage.  The perfect 1st step to applying your make up!</li>
            <li> I just love this product. It is a wonderful tinted moisturizer with sunscreen. You don&#x27;t have to use much so it will last a long time. It blends nicely. I have bought three tubes and plan to continue using it for a long time. Elaine in Florida</li>
            <li> I got the idea, from reading a review of the Intellishade 45 matte product, to use a dab of this stuff combined with a dab of the matte.  I found that this version of the product left my skin looking a little shiny and greasy.  But combined with the matte version, it just seems to disappear into my skin.  It leaves me protected from the strong Colorado sun but without the kabuki theater look of so many sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This make-up was first sold to me by my skincare specialist.  It&#x27;s excellent: it&#x27;s a conditioner, sunscreen and make-up all in one.  Getting made up is so much quicker now--and less expensive, since all three necessary products are in one tube.</li>
            <li> No need for make up. Love it. Spreads easier than the matte finish, IMO.</li>
            <li> I turned out to be alergic to this product. My skin usually isn&#x27;t what I would call sensitive, and I purchased as it is one my dermatologist sells in her office. I had tried samples in the past and loved them, but using the product on-going wasn&#x27;t for my skin. It eventually started to burn on my eyelids and around my mouth, then peel. It&#x27;s probably a very good product for many, just not me.</li>
            <li> Lovely light coverage and moisture&lt;br /&gt;Big bonus is the SPF ....</li>
            <li> i use this daily on my face. it means you don&#x27;t need makeup to run around and do errands and it protects my skin!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife. She loves it! Provides great coverage and protection. Skin looks healthy and feels free of need for foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer every morning  for the past 2 years and wouldn&#x27;t  think of changing it. The tint in it is perfect and there&#x27;s no need to use additional foundation or face powder; looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. I have tried several name brand tinted moisturizers and this one by far is the best. You can feel a difference as soon as you put it on your face. I am a convert. A. Cymbaluk</li>
            <li> I really like this product. As a tinted moisturizer, it is not a heavy foundation. And somehow the color works for everyone. I&#x27;d recommend you give it a try; it&#x27;s not too heavy and not too light and it goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is the best all-in-one moisturizer and tint with a high SPF.  I put it on every morning for my sunscreen and make-up.  It does leave my face a little shiny but that is resolved with a light covering of face powder.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing while giving light coverage, I love the no makeup look and have been using this product for several years. The mat finish, I suspect, would be better for younger skin; it has a drier look/effect. I prefer the more moisturizing regular formula for my mature skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth application. Not heavy and thick.  Matched my skin tone very well. Natural coverage with sun protection. Very nice product!</li>
            <li> I like this product because of the high SPF rating, the tint in the moisturizer and the light, non-greasy  coverage.</li>
            <li> This product works for all kinds of skin and has kept my skin in really good condition.  I have used it for several years each and every morning!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time (years)&lt;br /&gt; and it&#x27;s the best sunblock ever. And your skin looks perfect every day.</li>
            <li> Best tinted moisturizer that I have ever used!  Great coverage!  It goes on great and doesn&#x27;t make your face break out.</li>
            <li> Okay, let me start off by saying my face seems to break out with anything and everything. I have been battling scars (chickenpox all over my face in 7th grade) and acne since 7th grade. So, I was so excited when finally (at the age of 26) my face and complexion were clearer. I went a couple of months without a breakout, and all my scars were faded. I decided I wanted to try and go without makeup, and came upon this product. Besides being greasy upon putting it on (easily fixed with a translucent powder), my face looked AWESOME. It was glowing and my complexion looked brighter. But, after a couple of uses I noticed my pores were extremely clogged, and then my face started breaking out again. I stopped using it and my face cleared up again, started using it again and the same thing started to happen with my face. I can&#x27;t blame it all on this product though (thank you, genes!!), but I can say that it did contribute to my face breaking out again and that maybe it isn&#x27;t meant for people who break out easily. But, it did make my face look great while it lasted!</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone. Great moisturizer, great primer, great for very light/subtle coverage if you feel like going without foundation.</li>
            <li> Like the texture and the color</li>
            <li> Have been using this prodouct for years and pricing is much better from this vendor.  It is a tinted moisturizer and acts really kind of like a BB Cream.  I wear it under my powder to work or on the weekends I wear it by itself when I go out to run errands.  I actually got this in my dermatologists office but the prices are more reasonable on Amazon.  Great productd and this vendor has been good as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used.Plenty of sunscreen and no one can ever believe I have any foundation on.Evens skin tone and yet it is so light.A little goes a long way so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great consistency and coverage for a moisturizer with SPF ,blends very easy ,smells good,only downside is the price,but is worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation with 45 SPF you will every try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the original and the matte and I personally like the matte better.  This is a great product bc its a tinted moisturizer w sunscreen. They say the color matches all skin types and it does! It&#x27;s great for evening out your skin tone and gives nice coverage. I wear a light powder over it. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite under makeup tinted hydrating cream.  One color works for  all skin types and includes sunscreen and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not good. it seems greasy and I do not like to use in the morning when I am so inrush. I will never order again</li>
            <li> This makeup is very light with little to no coverage.  It does not even outr skin tone and is only good if you like to wear very little make- up.</li>
            <li> Great product, gets here quick, best price, never a problem.  I highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product - speedy shipping!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before-purchased it at a med spa and decided to order it online.  The product I received is a different shade even though it&#x27;s supposed to be for &amp;#34;all skin colors&amp;#34;-it is more of a light color not the beige I previously had used.  Not pleased by it.  It should indicate what skin colors it is for- i.e. fair, olive, etc.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  It works great on my problem skin.  It may be too dark if you have a very very light skin tone, but I usually get &#x27;light beige&#x27; or &#x27;beige&#x27; powder and the tint in this product works perfectly for me.  It covers the dark spots very well and works well with my powder.  Highly recommend.  Not sure why this product doesn&#x27;t have  much popularity.</li>
            <li> Has great coverage and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting on additional sunscreen!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I don&#x27;t even use foundation, just powder.  Because of oily skin, I will be switching to the matte finish.</li>
            <li> great coverage with a make up tint that covers up my blemishes.  Just wish the coverage was a little longer</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product! Intellishade blends easily and is great to wear alone or I like to wear it as a base under my power make-up. I love how it contains color plus SPF! Great Product!</li>
            <li> lightweight, nice tinted moisturizer. i like that i can use this all year, as the color adjusts to you skin tone... evens color without adding a makeup-y look. not a heavy coverage if that is what you want, but a nice product to balance skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 31-year-old new mom and my morning &amp;#34;beautifying&amp;#34; time has been cut down to about 5-10 minutes tops now that I have a baby to get out the door as well.  I need a multipurpose product and this is it.  I first tried this product after my esthetician put it on me after a facial.  She raved about it and said all the women at the spa ranging in age from 25 to 50+ just love it.  It&#x27;s voodoo magic the way it actually blends in to your skin tone.  I&#x27;m a fair skinned redhead and my esthetician is an olive skin-toned Sicilian and it somehow works for the both of us.  Magic, I tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purposes:&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer - not greasy or heavy, just very moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;SPF - 45 for us Southern Californians who love the sun, not some wimpy SPF 10 that makes us reapply throughout the day (which I never do anyway)&lt;br /&gt;Coverage - surprisingly great coverage without being heavy.  Tinted moisturizers never feel like they actually cover.  I normally use Bare Minerals and felt that it covered just as well without all the excessive twirling of the powder brush and the clean up that would always need to be done afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must try!</li>
            <li> JUST THE RIGHT SHADE FOR MY SKIN TONE. LOOKS AND FEELS SOFT</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m confused!!! I ordered a tube of Revision Intellishade and instead received a tiny box. Wondering what went wrong with my order and am sending this back. I didn&#x27;t open it, because I was afraid doing so might void my ability to return and I&#x27;m positive there is no tube inside this tiny box. I do love the product - just trying to figure out how to get a tube with Intellishade in it!</li>
            <li> makes your face feel so good</li>
            <li> My wife used it - found that it seemed like it was old --  had been in the tube a long time -- a lot of air in the bottom of the tube when you pressed it to get the liquid out.  She liked the consistency of the liquid when she got it out.  She said that she would probably try it again if she could find a local source for the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve had years of issues with my sensitive skin.  I am 47 years old, and since Revision products were recommended by my dermatologist two years ago I have had minimal issues on my face.  I use this tinted moisturizer along with the Vitamin C lotion, and once in a while I utilized the Retinal A.  I&#x27;ve had more compliments on my skin the past 2 years then I had my entire 20-30&#x27;s!  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I think this is a really terrific product.  It protects my skin, enhances its tone and moisturizes too.  Who could want more?</li>
            <li> This is a summer must have! I am a working mom with 2 children and always on the run. This simplifies my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I have tried many tinted SPF products but never got the coverage I needed.  This product is incredible.  It gives me full coverage so I don&#x27;t need concealer and no one can see my enlarged pores, broken capillaries, and brown spots.  I purchased another tube for my 70ish mother and she is thrilled!</li>
            <li> I started using this product over 5 years ago.  I immediately loved it, but tried using other (cheaper) products.  I always returned to this product.  There is no substitute for it.  Intellishade smooths, softens, blends, and moisturizes.  All this while it is protecting your skin from the sun! It is a little pricier than some products, but well worth it.  I use it all year round as my foundation.  I still use a moisturizer, but that is because I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and it is excellent.  It is tinted and you&#x27;ll love the light texture.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a couple of years.  It is really good moisturizer and a good sunscreen all in one step.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream because it provides SPF and a little bit of color without feeling greasy or heavy. Other all in one creams that I used were greasier and did not go on as smoothly. I was always worried about streaks on my face from not rubbing in the cream well enough or when I sweated. But with this cream, it goes on very smoothly with minimal application and stays even throughout the day and through my workouts. It hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or breaks outs either which happens often with higher SPF creams. Overall, great cream especially for the summer.</li>
            <li> Intellishade is the perfect product for me. I don&#x27;t like thicker foundations that look like you have it on. This product makes my face look shinier and healthier plus it has sunscreen, which I really need. I can hardly tell that I have make-up on.</li>
            <li> This is a great product which provides a smooth finish to your face. The coverage lasts for several hours. A natural look for someone not wanting to use foundation.</li>
            <li> I use this as foundation as it gives good coverage while providing the best sunscreen. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist&#x27;s office. I love it. I&#x27;ve used a couple of different products in the effort to fade my freckles, to little avail, but I am finding that they are naturally fading from lack of sun exposure since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunblock that comes tinted in matte or regular.  I have used for 2 years and it really works.  Coverage is wonderful and the tint blends perfectly with any complexion.  Came on time exactly as vendor promised.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> This foundation is not too heavy. It has great sun protection. I use it almost every day with a little mascara for a very natural look.</li>
            <li> Really nice!  Very smooth, goes on easy</li>
            <li> recommended by my dermatologist</li>
            <li> Very happy with product. If you have sensitive skin it definitely is a must. Not greasy and it has a slight tint. Great for fair skin.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like dewey, stay away - but if you do, you will love the coverage and feeling of this beautiful product - it makes your skin look young and seamless yet it doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;. Their matte version didn&#x27;t thrill me; but I like dewey. This product feels like it&#x27;s good for your skin, and it eliminates the need for moisturizer/sunscreen (this is big for me, since I have very dry skin and don&#x27;t like to spend money on two products when I can use one.)</li>
            <li> Works great as light makeup coverage that includes a moisturizer and sunscreen.  The color matches my complexion perfectly. Perfect for workout days.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I had facial surgery 2 yrs. ago and Revision was used on my face after laser @ my plastic surgeons office.&lt;br /&gt;They recommended that I use it for the sun protection but I love it for other reasons also.  It gives just enough coverage and moisturizes my skin without feeling or looking greasy.  It soaks right in.  Since it comes in 1 color, I use a bronzing powder over it in the summer when I have some tan on the rest of my body.  I make every effort not to get sun on my face. Even wear a hat when swimming. A tube last quite a while.  You don&#x27;t need much per application.  I use it every day .</li>
            <li> It was delivered promptly and was in good shape.  I will be ordering it again. It is natural looking and provides excellent moisture and sun protection.</li>
            <li> This creates an even tone and covers blemishes in the process. I don&#x27;t even need to wear powder on top, this by itself looks great! It also has a lot of SPF which I love. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> If only it didnt contain these ingredients ^^ it might be a decent product. Raise the zinc oxide and leave out the chemical filters and the aloe vera please.  It has a ton of silicones too, so if your skin reacts to silicones with acne, give this one a pass.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I orderd.</li>
            <li> wrote a review before as I ordered 2 of these.  Love it! just a lite color with sunscreen. love this product. can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the Revision line by my dermatologist and reluctantly gave it a try (I was hesitant because so many products are pushed by businesses all the time).  I use the cleanser, clarifying rinse, SPF 50 and now this product.  I will say that I don&#x27;t need to use the SPF 50 on days when I use this product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great at matching my skin tone both in the winter when I get quite pale and also in the summer when my skin darkens quite considerably from the sun.  Although if you have SUPER fair skin I&#x27;m not sure it would match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff gives great light coverage, with just enough to mask slight imperfections.  It doesn&#x27;t cover as much as a foundation or even a BB cream, but it&#x27;s perfect if you don&#x27;t want to feel like you have anything on but still even out your skin tone.  It stays on all day, but does tend to get a bit greasy looking on my oily skin later in the afternoon (thus 4 stars instead of 5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product though!  Definitely highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My dermatologist recommended it several years ago and my skin is glowing. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so I moisten my fingers slightly before applying, use very little and it glides right on. Tube lasts about a year as I don&#x27;t use every day.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need any other make-up. Perfect for everyday unless you like serious coverage. Plus it contains SPF 45 sun screen.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for aging lines and coverage.  Great product for the price.  Works wonderful for mature wormen</li>
            <li> I continue to use this product and love it. The product always blends with my skin color as it changes with the seasons.</li>
            <li> I use Revision Vitamin C ( which is great) and when I was ordering it, I noticed this and decided to try it. I am so glad I did. It goes on nicely, and quickly adapts to my skin tone. It has just the right coverage and in fact have stopped using my BB cream. I am anxious for spring to come to see how the SPF works.</li>
            <li> I have been using a spf, primer and mineral powder... until I found this product.... I can use this during the day with a little mascara and my skin looks flawless, at night with a little powder and a \\&quot;night\\&quot; eye make-up and I&#x27;m set to go! This is the best product I have EVER used and the rest of the line is amazing!... you have found your last stop and this line is it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this...sunscreen of 45, perfect medium shade and great moisture. This is a very natural looking foundation, love it!</li>
            <li> this is the best foundation I have ever used love that is also a moisturizer with sunscreen protection all in one makes my face feel very soft</li>
            <li> Very nice SPF for the face with a hint of cover.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hands and decollete, Covers and blends as well as protects.  Not to greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> A great product. People always compliment my skin when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, first introduced to me by my dermatologist.  Check out the SPF!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin glow and is perfect for anytime of the year. Tan or no tan you dont have to worry about adjusting the shade bc it blends very well. I put it on sometimes just because I want to feel a little prettier,  even when im just sitting around the house.</li>
            <li> I always love this stuff.  It&#x27;s perfect for my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now, and it makes me feel great.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it goes on so smooth. It makes my otherwise uneven, blotched skin tone look absolutely radiant! I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my skin after applying this product.  It took a while for my face to get used to it, though. I did break out the first week or two. But, I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 years so my skin responds well now. A little goes a long way, so it lasts some time. I recently took a break from this product because I am venturing into healthier &amp;#34;greener&amp;#34; beauty products. As much as I love this product, it does not pass the EWG Skin Deep database safety standards--meaning there are potentially harmful substances in this product. If you don&#x27;t care about your overall health, this product is awesome. I have yet to find an organic, natural BB cream that does what this does.</li>
            <li> I genuinely love this stuff. Initially, I got a sample from my dermatologist. I have really fair skin and need high SPF protection.  This product is supposedly adaptable for all skin types and shades, but the first tube I purchased was from my Dr and it gave me a light, sun-kissed look.  This Amazon purchase is the exact same product, but for some reason it is lighter in appearance and doesn&#x27;t give me the same sun-kissed look. It blends so nicely though - even w/aging skin, enlarged pores, dryness and facial hair and a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; at 45 SPF protection!!</li>
            <li> This is the best tinted moisturizer, does not settle in fine lines, stays on all day with a light dusting of face powder.&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, and are looking for a good tinted moisturizer, this is for you. It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover and a little goes a long way. I have tried other brands of tinted moisturizers and they just don&#x27;t go on like this one does. If you like a natural look , this is for you. I have used this for over a year now, and I hope they never quit making it. So glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item April 24, 2014 and the expiration date on the tube is 05/2014.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It&#x27;s a great go-to product when I want some coverage and a lot of protection.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation, moisturizer, and sunscreen all rolled into one that I have ever come across.  I will never buy anything else.  A wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda Florke, Author of the book September Woods</li>
            <li> This product in the Original formulation blends perfectly with your skin color and looks extremely natural. The SPF of 45 offers great protection. It can be used in place of both foundation and sunscreen. Non-greasy and does not clog pores. I highly recommend. Both men and women can use this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Definitely has an odor</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  It actually makes you look years younger, diminishing your fine lines and wrinkles.  It is a must have, more than worth the price.  I have been told that I look years younger by two people so far.</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup of all time. High spf factor, leaves a nice finish, and does a great job of coverup without looking un-natural on my face!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. Not only does it offer great coverage for everyday wear - particularly in the daytime - it doesn&#x27;t clog pores or feel heavy on my skin. All my girlfriends swear by it, too!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but this doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate it at all.  I love the coverage.  It is not too heavy or light.  But do not buy the matte version - it is very drying - this is the one to get.  Wish it was cheaper.  At least it is cheaper on Amazon than at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and has SP45 protection. Goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  Light coverage for days you don&#x27;t want a full face of make-up.  Color adjust to  your skin tone. I use a little loose powder and/or blush for more coverage.  Best tinted moisturizer I have used~</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. I have dark spots, but most sun screens make my eyes water. This doesn&#x27;t and has a tint that seems to even out any skin tone nicely and give light coverage. I just wear it with a light setting powder and don&#x27;t even wear regular foundation anymore. It does add good moisture, so if you wanted to use it under foundation, it is a good base.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist sells this for at minimum $15 more a tube.  I have been using this for at least 2 years and love it.  I have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;, though oily skin; doesn&#x27;t help to live in Florida where you sweat most of the time.  I tried the matte finish and did not like how it sat in my pores; it seemed to exaggerate them where the original formula although more moisturizing, sits on my skin better.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to wipe off easily.  I feel it has made my skin look much better.  I have rosacea as well so this somewhat evens out the redness although it is not a heavy, covering makeup.  I like the antioxidants and the sun screen.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Has zinc oxide in it with an SPF of 45. Great creamy moisturizer and great anti aging product</li>
            <li> I have ordered this over and over again. It is a great moisturizer and provides medium coverage, blends well with all skin tones. I usually do not wear foundation with it as I like the coverage and get a lot of compliments on my skin while wearing it. The SPF protection of 45 is awesome! It doesn&#x27;t seem to interact with other products, pill or roll. I like the original better than the matte, have tried both</li>
            <li> This made my face break out when nothing ever makes my face break out....</li>
            <li> It blends very well and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> When I buy a tinted moisturizer I expect less coverage than a foundation but more than a BB.  This doesn&#x27;t offer much coverage, but it does do well as a moisturizer, and as an addition to BB.  It does absorb well, but be careful of getting it into your eyes because it does cause blurry vision and your eyes to tear.</li>
            <li> Been using for 2 years. Love it. A little goes a long way. It can still be a little chalky (even with the tint) so I often mix it with just a dab of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this through my MedSpa, but started ordering it on Amazon because it&#x27;s a little bit less expensive, and easier.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite products ever.  I don&#x27;t need or want a heavy foundation (I&#x27;m 38, but take very good care of my skin).  It offers just enough coverage to make your complexion very even, and blends perfectly, but it&#x27;s light.  I love that it always matches your skin shade, even in different seasons.  If my skin is feeling extra dry, I&#x27;ll mix in a little face lotion (I live in the desert).  A bottle lasts me quite a while too.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and found on Amazon.  Sometime back I purchased a tube of this wonderful tinted moisturizer at a day spa, and did not want to call or make the trip back to get another.  It has a 45 SPF and has just enough color to make you look good w/o any makeup.  What a nice surprise to find it right online.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen and foundation in one does a great job protecting the skin.  It also gives the skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin and this product works great to keep my skin hydrated and protected from UV yet does not break my skin out. It provides a nice dewy light coverage that I like. Have been using this for over a year and will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> Blends nicely, doesn&#x27;t look like make-up on the skin, even in daylight.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.....hate heavy make up - have never worn anything until in my 60s all the color is gone from my face.  Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!! love it for summer!!!</li>
            <li> great product, moisturizes nicely. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Very impressive time wise and even the fact that it was the real product.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I am fair complected and worried the color might be too dark, but it seems to somehow blend into a perfect color for my taste.  Not too light, not too dark.  Coverage is light and may not be effective for someone who needs to conceal some skin issues.  I have sensitive skin and can experience breakout w/some moisturizers, but not with this product.  It&#x27;s a perfect all-in-one skin product: moisturizer, light foundation and sun protection.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I received 3 samples of this product from my day spa and was impressed. One I love that the product is light weight and you can have moisturizer underneath without clotting up. Second color is not extreme and to have sunscreen also is Great. Not a professional but I can&#x27;t use harsh retinol products but, I believe when you first start using this product(if you have sensitive skin)if you get a tingling feeling it is because of the ingredients used to help firm your skin. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Good price for the purchase!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist&#x27;s office said the ingredients are just what I need for a sunscreen.  The tint disappears when rubbed in and color is great.  A little pricey but you usually get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for not only protecting, but blending with your natural skin tone.  A bit pricey, but well worth it!  It has a more silky texture, versus a matte texture, which creates a very natural, smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Excellent product have used it for several years. Seller shipped on time. Really, if you have sensitive skin, try this product. I mix it with a tiny amt. of my Chanel foundation and it looks great. I live in a strong sun state and it works.</li>
            <li> Leaves with a healty glow while moisterising.</li>
