            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>broke out from some kind of rash... had to go to the doctor</li>
            <li>All Josie Maran argan oil products are wonderful -- I love all of her products -- cannot say enough good adjectives about them.  </li>
            <li>I *love</li>
            <li>like it is just sitting on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this, skin never looked better including my heels.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this oil.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff for my hair.</li>
            <li>but the light oil works wonders on my skin!</li>
            <li>Love the light texture better than the original one!</li>
            <li>: The service was fast, and the product arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very smooth and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>No breakouts at all and feels so light on my skin.</li>
            <li>Prior to using Josie&#x27;s Argan oil - I used Tarte&#x27;s maracuja oil -- which is also a good one, but I think Josie&#x27;s works better..</li>
            <li>Best of all, I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts since starting to use argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>

            <li>Worried at first to put on my face but no blemishes or oiliness</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the stuff!</li>
            <li>The Josie Maran light argan oil made the dead skin slough off, and my skin now looks SO much better.</li>
            <li>I use the regular version at night..and the light in the morning.  </li>
            <li>and this really hydrates my skin without making it feel greasy - or</li>
            <li>Absorption is fast.</li>
            <li>lines are less noticeable :).  </li>
            <li>Product: This is my new miracle product.</li>
            <li>I can definitely feel the difference between the light oil and the regular argan oil.  </li>
            <li>You only smell it when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>Makes it soft, shiny, and reduces volume.  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of old cooking oil.</li>

            <li> I *love* this stuff.. I have been using it for over a year.  I use the regular version at night..and the light in the morning.  I have dry skin and this really hydrates my skin without making it feel greasy - or like it is just sitting on top of my skin.  Prior to using Josie&#x27;s Argan oil - I used Tarte&#x27;s maracuja oil -- which is also a good one, but I think Josie&#x27;s works better.. at least on my skin.  Supposedly Josie&#x27;s is &#x27;cold pressed&#x27; which processes the plant/oil  in a way that doesn&#x27;t denigrate and destroy the nutrients.  I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin.. although I have read that it works well with all skin types, including those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Not in a box, open and dirty upon arrival and smells HORRIBLE! This is NOT Josie Maran product!!</li>
            <li> All Josie Maran argan oil products are wonderful -- I love all of her products -- cannot say enough good adjectives about them.  They make your skin look radiant.</li>
            <li> Product: This is my new miracle product. My acne-prone skin was dry from acne treatment products. The Josie Maran light argan oil made the dead skin slough off, and my skin now looks SO much better. Best of all, I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts since starting to use argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service: The service was fast, and the product arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> broke out from some kind of rash... had to go to the doctor</li>
            <li> I used for my face under my make up, It help me for my dry skin.it is so amazingly .</li>
            <li> This is truly a miracle maker when used on hair!  Makes it soft, shiny, and reduces volume.  Also helps shaping down short sprouts stemming up after blow drying.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it for my face and neck and my hair to tame the frizz. The only down side is the smell. Reminds me of old cooking oil. You only smell it when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> Love this, skin never looked better including my heels. Worried at first to put on my face but no blemishes or oiliness</li>
            <li> The bottle was already opened when I received the package and the contents had spilled inside the envelope. Unfortunately I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for the wife. She absolutely loves the stuff! Amazon had the best price for Josie Maran products</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil.  I&#x27;ve bought alot of different creams and oils for my face, but have never really seen a difference.  But I have now, face is brighter, smoother, and lines are less noticeable :).  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I look younger and my face has a glow to it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my hair. It helps with flyaways. The item came, on time, wrapped in bubble wrap so it wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Good value.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very smooth and soaks in quickly. Use it day and night. In the day I use sunscreen over it.</li>
            <li> Price is a little high but a very little goes a long way. I use it on my hair before I blow dry and my hair is not oily, just feels healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I can definitely feel the difference between the light oil and the regular argan oil.  The regular argan oil was heavier and made my skin break out but the light oil works wonders on my skin! No breakouts at all and feels so light on my skin. Absorption is fast. As a skin care regime, I use this product after applying a vitamin C serum. My skin feels and looks great now.</li>
            <li> This made my face soft and smooth! Love the light texture better than the original one!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was hypoallergenic, and everything that I have read said it was, however, I put it on my cheeks and I itched like crazy, I thought it could be something else so I tried it again the next day, and not only did I itch all day but it broke me out...NOT hypoallergenic.</li>
