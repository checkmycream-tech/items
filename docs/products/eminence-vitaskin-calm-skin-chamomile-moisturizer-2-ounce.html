            <li>This cream is absolutely amazing.</li>

            <li>I have problems with most products burning on my skin or causing my rosacea to flare but this moisturizer calms it everytime.  </li>
            <li>Eminence line is really the best line I have ever used, there products are quality and they absorbed into your skin without feeling greasy or clogging your pores.</li>
            <li>love it a lot</li>
            <li>My skin is best classified as &#x27;over reactive&#x27; getting red and irritated at the drop of a hat.</li>
            <li>and I have tried more products than I can count.</li>
            <li>I love it, even though I have combination skin (oily around the T zone)</li>

            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand of skincare.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Great smell and very creamy.</li>
            <li>Loved the smell, and it helps with redness caused by hot flushes.</li>
            <li>have used several Eminence products and always find them to be very good products and will continue to use them, but not from this seller.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my skin feel, very calming and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product is for sensitive skin and it works great.  </li>

            <li>Totally soft and smooth!!!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product from UBeauty Zone, and it came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>is a great general moisturizer for everyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin looking fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li>For most people this probably wont happen, but I have acne prone skin and a fair complexion with red</li>
            <li>I have tried many moisturizers for my extremely dry skin on my forehead and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The entire Eminence line is amazing!</li>
            <li>Does not feel greasy or heavy and smells very nice :)</li>
            <li>I would have loved to exchange this for another formula within the same company</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>The seller was  quickly responsive to my message and did accept the return (but didn&#x27;t cover my return postage as they promised).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I dont use the Probiotic Moisturizer, because it does not moisturizer as well as the Eminence VitaSkin Calm Skin Chamomile Moisturizer does.</li>
            <li>I use the Radish seed refining peel, the Stone Crop masque, and this moisturizer (Calm Skin Chamomile)</li>
            <li>this product arrived on time and has been a great everyday routine usage for my regimen.</li>
            <li>This is my primary moisturizer, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years after a facial therapist at a fancy spa recommended it, and I still love it.</li>
            <li>Love this company, 100% organic and environmentally conscious.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>My skin feels hydrated and fresh.</li>
            <li>Eminence Chamomile Moisturizer has kept my skin dewy soft with no breakouts and my skin is more even than ever.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the expense.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s so natural.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just right for me.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, light scent, does not last very long.  </li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a great line of products, and I would recommend trying a few!</li>
            <li>and this has really been great for my skin and some of the redness has calmed down as well!</li>
            <li>I have a mild case of rosacea and this really works for calming.</li>
            <li>Be careful where you buy them and be sure to check reviews for the seller so that you know you&#x27;re getting a product that hasn&#x27;t been tampered with, but otherwise I have no reservations in recommending these products!</li>
            <li>I would very much recommend this stuff to anyone.</li>
            <li>Within a week my skin was clear, the redness was gone and it has been fine ever since.  </li>
            <li>I have been doing a lot of research about cancer causing chemicals that are in most facial products.</li>
            <li>She recommended the Eminence line and my skin has never been so smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, when I opened it I noted that the protective seal had been breached and when I pulled the seal back, there was a hair or a brush bristle on the top of the cream.  </li>
            <li>Really, really moisturizing without being greasy!</li>
            <li>it does exactly what is labeled.</li>
            <li>I use the entire calm skin line and my face stays problem free.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s completely organic, made with herbs, plants, all natural ingredients that are healthier for your skin.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really notice much of a positive difference,  either.</li>
            <li>so I was really upset it has now been passed on to someone else.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it looked &#x27;real&#x27; (which it did) ...</li>
            <li>I have Rosacea and it really works for me.</li>
            <li>I am sold, and was happy to opt for this price and leave my Prevage Night Cream and Day cream behind.  </li>
            <li>and this really combats the damage.</li>
            <li>Very calming to my skin.</li>
            <li>Far better than I&#x27;ve seen in my local spas.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive acne prone skin and this moisturizer really helped clear it up.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin during break outs, and this was very soothing.</li>
            <li>This one came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this moisturizer after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I also live in a high altitude dry climate &amp; find the rich cream combats the dryness.</li>
            <li>This is the only cream that helps me to calm my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought a new product that needed to have a label on it that said new.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin, this is the moisturizer and related &#x27;Calm Skin&#x27; products to get.</li>
            <li>This is a great soothing product after having some laser done recently for broken capillaries.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing and calming for my oily/dry patches skin, living in dry colorado.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>this moisturizer is very soft and calms the redness in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in well and leaves my skin soft and glowing!</li>
            <li>I like the more natural ingredients of the eminence products than other moisturizers on the market and placed my second order for this product today.</li>
            <li>I did notice a change in my face, my skin is softer, my pores are more controlled, and any old small acne scars are dissapearing while using the Probiotic Cleanser along with the Probiotic Masque 1 to 2 times a week.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer the clear skin moisturizer because it is super calming on my face and doesn&#x27;t heat it up whereas the chamomile moisturizer heats up my face when I put it on, but only for a moment.</li>
            <li>i use a drop of their creams mixed in with a drop of pure aloe gel</li>
            <li>I could tell a huge difference after using for a few days.  </li>
            <li>During a recent facial, the provider used and recommended Eminence Calm Skin.  </li>
            <li>I will say that, like some others have mentioned about Eminence products on Amazon, I received the product from this seller and the protective seal had clearly been opened.</li>
            <li>I use this with the clear skin cleanser.</li>
            <li>I like this moisturizer and all Eminence products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It did not irritate and kept my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It helps my sensitive skin and smells like chamomile.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy but not too light, so I use it for both day and night use.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t done much for my red cheeks, but I plan to keep using it.  </li>
            <li>Then when I was told my skin is actually more rosacea-like by my aesthetician, she told me that drying treatments would actually make my skin worse (which may be why I had trouble skin for so many years).</li>
            <li>gentle and soothing without clogging pores  a bit spendy but lasts a long time  </li>
            <li>Your dry skin will drink up this product and is gentle on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Buy from Eminence, not other sellers.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd purchase of this product because it works so well on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use bare mineral makeup with it</li>
            <li>My skin can be prone to occasional breakouts, and is sensitive to greasy products.  </li>
            <li>Have only used it for a day but already noticed a slight difference, combined with the calm skin masque.</li>
            <li>well, I live in Arizona, air always dry.</li>
            <li>After a facial during a particularly dry winter, I left feeling so soft and moisturized!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over 7 months and really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a little longer than expected to receive my package (3 weeks) but it is worth the wait.</li>

            <li> Be careful where you buy them and be sure to check reviews for the seller so that you know you&#x27;re getting a product that hasn&#x27;t been tampered with, but otherwise I have no reservations in recommending these products!</li>
            <li> I would very much recommend this stuff to anyone.</li>
            <li> Within a week my skin was clear, the redness was gone and it has been fine ever since.  </li>
            <li> I have been doing a lot of research about cancer causing chemicals that are in most facial products.</li>
            <li> She recommended the Eminence line and my skin has never been so smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, when I opened it I noted that the protective seal had been breached and when I pulled the seal back, there was a hair or a brush bristle on the top of the cream.  </li>
            <li> Really, really moisturizing without being greasy!</li>
            <li> it does exactly what is labeled.</li>
            <li> I use the entire calm skin line and my face stays problem free.</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s completely organic, made with herbs, plants, all natural ingredients that are healthier for your skin.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really notice much of a positive difference,  either.</li>
            <li> so I was really upset it has now been passed on to someone else.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it looked &#x27;real&#x27; (which it did) ...</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and it really works for me.</li>
            <li> I am sold, and was happy to opt for this price and leave my Prevage Night Cream and Day cream behind.  </li>
            <li> and this really combats the damage.</li>
            <li> Very calming to my skin.</li>
            <li> Far better than I&#x27;ve seen in my local spas.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive acne prone skin and this moisturizer really helped clear it up.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin during break outs, and this was very soothing.</li>
            <li> This one came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this moisturizer after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I also live in a high altitude dry climate &amp; find the rich cream combats the dryness.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that helps me to calm my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought a new product that needed to have a label on it that said new.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin, this is the moisturizer and related &#x27;Calm Skin&#x27; products to get.</li>
            <li> This is a great soothing product after having some laser done recently for broken capillaries.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and calming for my oily/dry patches skin, living in dry colorado.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> this moisturizer is very soft and calms the redness in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in well and leaves my skin soft and glowing!</li>
            <li> I like the more natural ingredients of the eminence products than other moisturizers on the market and placed my second order for this product today.</li>
            <li> I did notice a change in my face, my skin is softer, my pores are more controlled, and any old small acne scars are dissapearing while using the Probiotic Cleanser along with the Probiotic Masque 1 to 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the clear skin moisturizer because it is super calming on my face and doesn&#x27;t heat it up whereas the chamomile moisturizer heats up my face when I put it on, but only for a moment.</li>
            <li> i use a drop of their creams mixed in with a drop of pure aloe gel</li>
            <li> I could tell a huge difference after using for a few days.  </li>
            <li> During a recent facial, the provider used and recommended Eminence Calm Skin.  </li>
            <li> I will say that, like some others have mentioned about Eminence products on Amazon, I received the product from this seller and the protective seal had clearly been opened.</li>
            <li> I use this with the clear skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer and all Eminence products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It did not irritate and kept my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It helps my sensitive skin and smells like chamomile.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy but not too light, so I use it for both day and night use.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done much for my red cheeks, but I plan to keep using it.  </li>
            <li> Then when I was told my skin is actually more rosacea-like by my aesthetician, she told me that drying treatments would actually make my skin worse (which may be why I had trouble skin for so many years).</li>
            <li> gentle and soothing without clogging pores  a bit spendy but lasts a long time  </li>
            <li> Your dry skin will drink up this product and is gentle on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Buy from Eminence, not other sellers.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd purchase of this product because it works so well on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use bare mineral makeup with it</li>
            <li> My skin can be prone to occasional breakouts, and is sensitive to greasy products.  </li>
            <li> Have only used it for a day but already noticed a slight difference, combined with the calm skin masque.</li>
            <li> well, I live in Arizona, air always dry.</li>
            <li> After a facial during a particularly dry winter, I left feeling so soft and moisturized!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over 7 months and really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a little longer than expected to receive my package (3 weeks) but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this much trouble with my skin in high school.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick going on</li>
            <li> But it was strange that the box had a printed label from the seller that said &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; on it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not completely gone...</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing from this seller &amp; my only issue is that when the product came, the seal on the container was broken (it was not sealed at all on the container).</li>
            <li> For the longest time I was treating any breakouts I would get with products that would dry my skin - it made sense at the time.</li>
            <li> my skin was no match for the dry air.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and not many creams agree with me, but I had no problems at all with this one, and it arrived in a timely manner, which was another bonus!</li>
            <li> The products are expensive, but they last for months and they really work.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of broken capillaries in my face (thanks to my mom&#x27;s genetics)</li>
            <li> My nose area has been breaking out, probably due to Rosacea,  since August.  </li>
            <li> There are a number of other products in this line that say corrective and they have &#x27;retinol alternative&#x27; in them.</li>
            <li> I use other Eminence products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be trying some of the other products from Eminence as well when I get around to it.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy for me in the humid summers, but I will still use it occasionally at night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably too thick for some people but my skin is always so dry</li>
            <li> However, within days the cream caused my skin to erupt in little bumps.  </li>
            <li> A little product goes along way.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid maybe it wasn&#x27;t even the real product</li>
            <li> My package was missing the spatula.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy to use under make up.</li>
            <li> Typically, I use the Prevage line which is quite pricy, but usually keeps my 40</li>
            <li> it still isn&#x27;t too heavy when you use a small amount of it.</li>
            <li> Have a wet face when applying to thin out the application a little.</li>
            <li> Rather expensive, but only need to use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> I found them very harsh and inflammatory.</li>
            <li> Too bad since this product came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is thick and this may have something to do with absorption.  </li>
            <li> I like to use this in the cold,  harsh winters of Michigan.  </li>
            <li> This is really expensive</li>
            <li> These products go bad after a year because they are all organic.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed....</li>
            <li> Disgusting.</li>
            <li> My 1 star doesn&#x27;t review the product but the horrible way I received it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received a sample of this when I received a facial and so I bought a larger jar. I thought this was going to be a great product but it made my face break out quit a bit. I tried to return it but the time frame had passed.  This is really expensive so I was really upset it has now been passed on to someone else. I would have loved to exchange this for another formula within the same company but I can&#x27;t afford to try another formula and have that not work as well.  Too bad since this product came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell, and it helps with redness caused by hot flushes. Hydrates well, I live in Arizona, air always dry.</li>
            <li> Your dry skin will drink up this product and is gentle on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, will always go back to this product.</li>
            <li> I have been doing a lot of research about cancer causing chemicals that are in most facial products. I found out about this product at a resort I was staying at, so I tried it. Man did my skin feel great, and still does. I did notice a change in my face, my skin is softer, my pores are more controlled, and any old small acne scars are dissapearing while using the Probiotic Cleanser along with the Probiotic Masque 1 to 2 times a week. I dont use the Probiotic Moisturizer, because it does not moisturizer as well as the Eminence VitaSkin Calm Skin Chamomile Moisturizer does. This moisturizer gets rid of redness and makes you skin feel like a babies bottom. Totally soft and smooth!!!  I would very much recommend this stuff to anyone. I also love that it&#x27;s completely organic, made with herbs, plants, all natural ingredients that are healthier for your skin. Plus my hubby has roseaca and this stuff has helped control his skin.</li>
            <li> My nose area has been breaking out, probably due to Rosacea,  since August.  I didn&#x27;t have this much trouble with my skin in high school.  Nothing made it go away.  During a recent facial, the provider used and recommended Eminence Calm Skin.  I bought the starter kit.  Within a week my skin was clear, the redness was gone and it has been fine ever since.  I have very sensitive skin and this is a wonderful product.  This is a keeper.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and I absolutely love this product!!! They plant a tree every time you purchase and my face looks so happy!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost 1 year and this was a re-order.  LOVE how it feels on my aging skin!!</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer and all Eminence products I&#x27;ve tried so far. I will say that, like some others have mentioned about Eminence products on Amazon, I received the product from this seller and the protective seal had clearly been opened. I was afraid maybe it wasn&#x27;t even the real product so I took it to my esthetician to have her confirm it looked &#x27;real&#x27; (which it did) ... so I kept it. But it was strange that the box had a printed label from the seller that said &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; on it. I&#x27;ve never bought a new product that needed to have a label on it that said new. BTW if you have sensitive skin, this is the moisturizer and related &#x27;Calm Skin&#x27; products to get. There are a number of other products in this line that say corrective and they have &#x27;retinol alternative&#x27; in them. I found them very harsh and inflammatory.</li>
            <li> gentle and soothing without clogging pores  a bit spendy but lasts a long time  i use a drop of their creams mixed in with a drop of pure aloe gel</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product.</li>
            <li> may be leading to breakouts</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel, very calming and perfect for sensitive skin. Have only used it for a day but already noticed a slight difference, combined with the calm skin masque. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I use other Eminence products.  This one came highly recommended.  However, within days the cream caused my skin to erupt in little bumps.  It is thick and this may have something to do with absorption.  When I stopped using the moisturizer, the bumps disappeared.  I tried it again and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer! It soaks in well and leaves my skin soft and glowing! Best of all, it&#x27;s made of all organic products and soothes sensitive skin. The entire Eminence line is amazing!</li>
            <li> This cream is absolutely amazing. A tiny amount moisturizes the driest areas.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin during break outs, and this was very soothing. Have a wet face when applying to thin out the application a little.</li>
            <li> Not as good as their coconut moisturizer. Kind of makes me break out.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing from this seller &amp; my only issue is that when the product came, the seal on the container was broken (it was not sealed at all on the container). I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because there&#x27;s a possibility the product was contaminated or had been used before.</li>
            <li> This is my primary moisturizer, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years after a facial therapist at a fancy spa recommended it, and I still love it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is rich and creamy, and goes onto your skin very smoothly. Does not feel greasy or heavy and smells very nice :)</li>
            <li> Eminence products are perfection. I have sensitive skin - I&#x27;m prone to redness and breakouts if my skin gets irritated. For the longest time I was treating any breakouts I would get with products that would dry my skin - it made sense at the time. Then when I was told my skin is actually more rosacea-like by my aesthetician, she told me that drying treatments would actually make my skin worse (which may be why I had trouble skin for so many years). She recommended the Eminence line and my skin has never been so smooth and clear. I use the Radish seed refining peel, the Stone Crop masque, and this moisturizer (Calm Skin Chamomile) and it&#x27;s the perfect system for my skin. I use the peel and masque about once a week, but I use the moisturizer every morning and night. The products are expensive, but they last for months and they really work. Be careful where you buy them and be sure to check reviews for the seller so that you know you&#x27;re getting a product that hasn&#x27;t been tampered with, but otherwise I have no reservations in recommending these products!</li>
            <li> Works excellent on my rosacea and skin issues.  I have problems with most products burning on my skin or causing my rosacea to flare but this moisturizer calms it everytime.  I use the entire calm skin line and my face stays problem free.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, shipped quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product is for sensitive skin and it works great.  A little product goes along way.  You may need to add a drop or two of water but the leaflet tells you this. It can be used on ones hands if you want to try it and then cover them with cotton gloves at night.  I have Rosacea and it really works for me.</li>
            <li> Eminence line is really the best line I have ever used, there products are quality and they absorbed into your skin without feeling greasy or clogging your pores.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for sensitive skin, immediately after use reduces redness and irritation. This is the 2nd purchase of this product because it works so well on sensitive skin. Love this company, 100% organic and environmentally conscious.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but it can leave my skin feeling a bit too greasy. Rather expensive, but only need to use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was doing its job for me since 2012. This is the only cream that helps me to calm my skin. Like it a lot! Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the cream and it works!!! Will continue using this! Happy that I discovered this gem, love it a lot</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell. This is a great line of products, and I would recommend trying a few!</li>
            <li> This is a great soothing product after having some laser done recently for broken capillaries. It did not irritate and kept my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive acne prone skin and this moisturizer really helped clear it up.  It&#x27;s probably too thick for some people but my skin is always so dry it&#x27;s just right for me.  I even use it day and night.  I use bare mineral makeup with it and I finally feel like the makeup doesn&#x27;t look cakey because my skin has enough moisture.</li>
            <li> I have been using this same product for years. Buy from Eminence, not other sellers. It didn&#x27;t even smell like chamomile. I was really disappointed....</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I could tell a huge difference after using for a few days.  Excellent moisturizer and does not irritate my skin in any way.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. I use with the Neroli eye serum and have had wonderful results with the fine lines on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be trying some of the other products from Eminence as well when I get around to it. Also, the pricing n Amazon is great! Far better than I&#x27;ve seen in my local spas.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from UBeauty Zone, and it came very quickly.  HOWEVER, when I opened it I noted that the protective seal had been breached and when I pulled the seal back, there was a hair or a brush bristle on the top of the cream.  These products also always come with a spatula so that you don&#x27;t have to use fingers to remove the cream.  My package was missing the spatula. The seller was  quickly responsive to my message and did accept the return (but didn&#x27;t cover my return postage as they promised).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several Eminence products and always find them to be very good products and will continue to use them, but not from this seller.</li>
            <li> Skin is looking better after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a week, but I am already noticing a tiny difference in my skin. My skin is best classified as &#x27;over reactive&#x27; getting red and irritated at the drop of a hat. I hope that with continued use my skin will continue to improve.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this moisturizer after reading the reviews. I am 51 with rosacea since adolescence and I have tried more products than I can count. I have been using this product for 2 weeks. The product doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin but I don&#x27;t really notice much of a positive difference,  either. It does smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> This cream is very moisturizing and has a pleasant light scent. I love it, even though I have combination skin (oily around the T zone) it still isn&#x27;t too heavy when you use a small amount of it. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I have a mild case of rosacea and this really works for calming. I use it when I have a flare up.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! It helps my sensitive skin and smells like chamomile. Not too heavy but not too light, so I use it for both day and night use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over 7 months and really like it. My skin feels hydrated and fresh. It&#x27;s pretty thick going on so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product. Very happy!</li>
            <li> This made my face way too greasy (I have combination skin). I love eminence products, but this did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. not greasy. Feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers for my extremely dry skin on my forehead and this one is by far the best. Its not greasy so you can use it anytime and not worry if your face looks greasy when leaving the house. Both me and my wife use it so man or woman it works great.  I like the more natural ingredients of the eminence products than other moisturizers on the market and placed my second order for this product today.</li>
            <li> Eminence has an absolutely great product line. This moisturizer changes my complexion immediately after two days of use. I am now glowing... I use this with the clear skin cleanser. I actually prefer the clear skin moisturizer because it is super calming on my face and doesn&#x27;t heat it up whereas the chamomile moisturizer heats up my face when I put it on, but only for a moment. For most people this probably wont happen, but I have acne prone skin and a fair complexion with red undertones.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great general moisturizer for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;It took a little longer than expected to receive my package (3 weeks) but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Really, really moisturizing without being greasy!</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and calming for my oily/dry patches skin, living in dry colorado.  Especially great through winter.  See how it does through summer.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this moisturizer.  After a facial during a particularly dry winter, I left feeling so soft and moisturized!  When I asked why my skin felt so amazing, the aesthetician handed me a jar of this moisturizer.  My skin can be prone to occasional breakouts, and is sensitive to greasy products.  Typically, I use the Prevage line which is quite pricy, but usually keeps my 40+ skin looking fabulous.  But this winter... my skin was no match for the dry air.  Eminence Chamomile Moisturizer has kept my skin dewy soft with no breakouts and my skin is more even than ever.  I am sold, and was happy to opt for this price and leave my Prevage Night Cream and Day cream behind.  I won&#x27;t part with Prevage Serum, but the two work beautifully together.  I also recommend the complementary Chamomile cleanser.  Along with the Clarisonic, I have never felt better about my complexion!!!</li>
            <li> This Eminence Moisturizer was sent to me without any exterior security wrap plus the interior cap seal had been opened and product was obviously used. Disgusting. I also ordered Eminence Bright Skin Mask and that did have an exterior security seal/wrap. My 1 star doesn&#x27;t review the product but the horrible way I received it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. I am in the pool daily and this really combats the damage. I also live in a high altitude dry climate &amp; find the rich cream combats the dryness.</li>
            <li> It arrived unsealed and definitely used.</li>
            <li> Wonderful everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  I notice a total difference in the redness of my skin since I started  using it.  It is worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Great product , used by my SPA for my facials. Went on line to buy it. Very calming to my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it at night but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for sensitive, dry skin.  I like to use this in the cold,  harsh winters of Michigan.  It is a little heavy for me in the humid summers, but I will still use it occasionally at night.  Very nice, light scent, does not last very long.  I noticed immediate redness relief with this cream.  Eminence Organics make wonderful natural products, perfect for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of broken capillaries in my face (thanks to my mom&#x27;s genetics) and this has really been great for my skin and some of the redness has calmed down as well! it&#x27;s not completely gone...but it&#x27;s much better! love, love, love this!</li>
            <li> Works great to keep my skin clear</li>
            <li> Love everything Eminence!</li>
            <li> this product arrived on time and has been a great everyday routine usage for my regimen. it does exactly what is labeled. &amp;#34;calm skin moisturizer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had to return this. My sister in law owns a spa where she sells this, so I knew how it was supposed to smell.  This was way off.  It smelled like motor oil. These products go bad after a year because they are all organic. So I sent it back and ordered it from my sister in laws spa instead. Its a great product otherwise!</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Didn&#x27;t see the results others did.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of skincare.  this moisturizer is very soft and calms the redness in my skin.  Defintely a product I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It feels good on my skin and I love that it&#x27;s so natural.</li>
            <li> Great smell and very creamy. I use as a night cream.  Hasn&#x27;t done much for my red cheeks, but I plan to keep using it.  A bit heavy to use under make up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream. I have very sensitive skin, and not many creams agree with me, but I had no problems at all with this one, and it arrived in a timely manner, which was another bonus!</li>
