            <li>Soap smells very nice but not too strong and lathers perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice soap that works well and has a nice neutral smell, but the best thing about it is NO SLIVERS.</li>
            <li>My fiance and I funded this Kickstarter project because it sounded like a neat invention based on environmental concerns and the want for good soap, not just body wash.  </li>
            <li>It looks really good in and out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap does not smell good and that&#x27;s why I knocked off a star.  </li>
            <li>The lather is good and the scent of the unscented bar just smells like soap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great soap and smells nice AND the design is genius.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Update on Friday, May 29, 2015: Still love this soap!</li>
            <li>in spite of a mild, pleasant scent, it has not irritated my skin at all after months of use!</li>
            <li>Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best ones, and this is certainly an example of that...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely recommend this soap, Aric did an amazing job</li>
            <li>/&gt;Subscribe to the amazing podcast MBMBaM.</li>
            <li>The lather you get from this soap is absolutely fantastic, it lathers up better than any soap I have ever used, and the stacking part works incredibly well.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>and it makes a nice lather too.</li>
            <li>The soap feels really nice</li>
            <li>Would be nice to see an exfoliating version at some point...</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, the design to absorb the remaining sliver of an old bar of soap into the next is great, and it&#x27;s a lovely-smelling wonderfully creamy soap too.</li>
            <li>Delighted to see it now available as a \\&quot;real\\&quot; product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Bars truly are never wasted, as they stick together perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did, because I love, love, love this soap!</li>
            <li>The idea looked great and it can now report that it really works well!  </li>
            <li>Very smooth, not overly scented.</li>
            <li>The ingenious design and pleasing fragrance matched with the care and dedication of its creators to has proven to me</li>
            <li>An ingenious solution to an age-old problem.</li>
            <li>Stack Soap solves this problem without the guilt of so many almost finished bars unceremoniously tossed into the trash.</li>
            <li>I love the concept</li>
            <li>and I love the soft,creamy texture of the soap.</li>
            <li>Im sure every company wishes they thought of this years ago.</li>
            <li>But after getting it - I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the concept.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>In this price range Stack is one of the most moisturizing soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I ordered more for Christmas presents!&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>really love the fragarence-</li>
            <li>OK the \\&quot;infinite</li>
            <li>and I may or may not buy more myself.</li>
            <li>I came across this ingenious, soap-saving concept on Kickstarter, and ordered it out of curiosity.</li>
            <li>love that the soap is not tested on animals-</li>
            <li>This is an ingenious way to transition from one soap to another.  </li>
            <li>How much better can it get than this?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked forward to not having to throw away pieces of soap, the quality of the soap is great as well as it does not have much scent and is moisturizing</li>
            <li>I was very excited for this soap since I helped fund it, I think the idea is genius.</li>
            <li>: they lather smoothly, leave the skin feeling soft and without residue, and have the most wonderful, light scent.</li>
            <li>At first, I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Support the little guy and get a great soap at a great price as well.  </li>
            <li>The actual soap is very good and doesn&#x27;t contain animal fat like most soaps do.</li>
            <li>received an email within a day after writing my original review from the inventor of stack soap, and he was very understanding of my issues with the soap, and gave great explanations for the problems I had.</li>
            <li>You would think the majority of the product focus would be the &amp;#34;infinity&amp;#34; innovation but the actual soap is very good.</li>
            <li>You always have a nice sized bar of soap that&#x27;s actually useful, and there&#x27;s no waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it smells great and the cleaning action of the soap isn&#x27;t too strong or weak.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m too easy going</li>
            <li>Be suspicious of many of the detractors, they won&#x27;t come clean about their motives.</li>
            <li>Soap lathers well and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very mild scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but anyone who thinks this smells good must live in a cave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Our water in the area is soft and the lather for this soap was pretty incredible.</li>
            <li>They are just a bit pricey, but that&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
            <li>Stack costs more than some mainstream-brand soaps, but I&#x27;m OK paying a higher price for a couple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The smell is fine.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for an eco-friendly and chemical-light soap that did not require me to use a soap bag to avoid wasting soap slivers, and Stack fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Compared the mainstream, cheaper brands, Stack is vegan and SLS-free, both of which are important to me.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It soaps up really well and washes off nice too.</li>
            <li>to the important piece.</li>
            <li>Yes, its a great idea, and I would definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li>The problem is, it leaves a really scummy residue floating in the water.. kind of chunky looking.  </li>
            <li>The soap is very nice  with a mild scent and pleasant feel, but the real selling point is the satisfaction of fitting the old sliver into the new bar.</li>
            <li>Takes some practice to find the right moment to squish bars together, but it&#x27;s kind of fun.</li>
            <li>first problem with this soap is that it smells like a magic marker, it has an extremely strong chemical smell and I was hesitant to even use it.</li>
            <li>I was a supporter of the stack soap Kickstarter, and was extremely excited to receive my bars of soap in the mail.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this soap because the inventor was from my home town.  </li>
            <li>I was one of the original Kickstarter backers, and I&#x27;ve been buying Stack on Amazon ever since.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, the stack really works and the soap in non drying and milky sudsy!</li>
            <li>I am now on my 4th of the original 6 bars I received as part of my stack Soap at KickStarter.com</li>
            <li>The actual soap smells nice but not overpowering, it is very light.</li>
            <li>Clean.</li>
            <li>My hands feel clean, that is what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells clean and leaves me feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>and I felt squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>just enough, not too much- really pleasant .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best of both worlds, so I really have no reason to buy other soap again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to stack the sliver onto a new bar, and I love the soap itself.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is very mild and unscented; good for dry skin in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I thought the concept was cool on Kickstarter, but the product surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft, without any residue; most importantly, nd</li>
            <li>I feel a great appreciation for these guys, knowing that they actually whole heatedly care about the product they are putting out, and that they personally looked for my name in the kickstarter backers, and then emailed me from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel a great appreciation for these guys, knowing that they actually whole heatedly care about the product they are putting out, and that they personally looked for my name in the kickstarter backers, and then emailed me from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this stuff, but I would love to see them license the design to bigger soap companies so we could see this in teh supermarket.</li>
            <li>So I would love to see a version of this soap which had more moisturizing qualities for all over daily use</li>
            <li>I hope they come out with new scents because I would love to keep buying this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We were able to test out its design function right away with our old soap bar - it fit like a glove and adhered right away - no slippage, no slivers of soap clogging the drain...  </li>
            <li>My mornings (and hence the respective days ahead of them) have been so much better!</li>
            <li>I have noticed several reviews that knock the scent, but as regular users of good, old fashioned Ivory, we have to say this soap smells pleasant and fresh.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if Stack could offer some smaller quantities through Amazon as a add-on purchase.</li>
            <li>After using Stack soap for nearly a year, it&#x27;s safe to say this has become a staple in our home.</li>
            <li>and it is not heavily scented which I love.</li>
            <li>it worth it?  </li>
            <li>and I think it is worth trying once</li>
            <li>While others have said that this doesn&#x27;t work out economically, I&#x27;m into the &amp;#34;reduce, reuse, and recycle&amp;#34; philosophy.</li>
            <li>Right now, I can&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li>As they are right now, you will feel like you need another shower after showering with this</li>
            <li>Or if you&#x27;re not a fragrance person, soon after your shower you&#x27;re pretty much unscented but clean</li>
            <li>than anything, everyone should support Stack soap not only because it&#x27;s a great product and competitively priced with the mass produced soaps, but because it takes GUTS to start your own small business based on an idea you believe in!</li>
            <li>but I think they just need a little bit more time to make everyone satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it works best if you wait until the old sliver is just getting to the point of being hard to hold onto.  </li>
            <li>It really is one of those ideas that you&#x27;ll wish you thought of first!</li>
            <li>I will buy the next fragrance and style of soap that they put out next, and this may be my new soap of choice from now on.ail within a day after writing my original review from the inventor of stack soap, and he was very understanding of my issues with the soap, and gave great explanations for the problems I had.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to find than not only does the soap stack</li>
            <li>It is long lasting, feels great</li>
            <li>First things first- the notch works.  </li>
            <li>In the hot, humid summer the feeling didn&#x27;t linger and now that it&#x27;s winter</li>
            <li>We only just finished using the first bar, so we were able to test out the stacking for ourselves.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as you expect.</li>
            <li>It really does work!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used Stack Soap, I noticed that the soap washed off immediately</li>
            <li>My hot showers are now shorter, thus saving energy cash.  </li>
            <li>so that I will not run out when I finish my first 6 bars of Stack Soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it left me feeling very clean yet</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more expensive than most other soaps, but I&#x27;m happy to not be wasting soap slivers.</li>
            <li>well but ultimately, a soap is only as good as the soap itself.</li>
            <li>well- within a shower&#x27;s time, the old bar was secure, and we had reasonable soap again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some Irish Springs is much cheaper and smells a lot better.  </li>
            <li>The soap has no real strong scent, which I liked, but it is not as moisturizing as I thought it would be-</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this because of the cool stacking feature, but I worried that it might irritate my VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Good idea not sure if Dr. Drew Invited you on the show or if you just called in.</li>
            <li>My hubby and I supported this venture because we thought the idea was pretty clever.  </li>
            <li>think this is the very definition of what soap should do,</li>
            <li>Despite the eco-friendlier nature of the soap, it still lathers very well in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whole stacking thing is just a genius idea</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>If you have even the mildest of OCD tendencies, this will really scratch that itch.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>If it costs 4X as much, I&#x27;d rather throw the slivers</li>
            <li>I just got the soap a few days ago and am loving it.</li>
            <li>If you are even remotely interested in trying new soaps this isn&#x27;t that much of an investment for a box</li>
            <li>While fragrance can be a pretty personal thing, I liked this initial fragrance because it reminds me of a light fresh green tea based scent.</li>
            <li>The bars stack as promised--a tight, satisfying squeeze and a quarter-bar joins seamlessly with a full bar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product that finally solves all those little slivers of soap!</li>
            <li>Most of the other reviews have this covered.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels pretty nice after using this and it lathers well, all while actually leaving you clean or at least neutral smelling as noted</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a clever idea, and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>This one, they fight over who gets to get the new bar and squeeze in the sliver to it!  </li>
            <li>If the soap was good, I&#x27;d say it might be worth that premium, sadly that&#x27;s not the case.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that it would smell &#x27;decent&#x27; or &#x27;soapy&#x27; but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Such a simple concept, but works elegantly.</li>
            <li>but the high price just makes it impractical.</li>
            <li>Each bar of Stack has an indent at the top that allows you to join the remaining sliver of the previous bar to a new bar.</li>
            <li>But there are two major problems I noticed from first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No heavy scents, no unnecessary ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Was skeptical of buying soap from Kickstarter company but happy I did.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, as soon as I switched my skin was perfectly clear again, and has been for the last month or two.  </li>
            <li>It is fun when your bar starts getting smaller</li>
            <li>more messy soap dish--great idea.</li>
            <li>We have ordered STACK a few times now, and we love it.</li>
            <li>Aside from its main purpose of allowing you to make the most out of your soap, it also has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t hang around like an annoying relative and leaves even ragged hands like mine that have been exposed to cleaning chemicals, engine grease, garden dirt, and a cat that thinks fingers are chew toys soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Our new soap.  </li>
            <li>Stick it to the new one and done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>What a waste if I were then to throw away a significant portion of the bar!</li>
            <li>The sliver of soap actually had to be smaller than I thought it would need to be before it fit</li>
            <li>I just recently got the STACK soap in the mail from supporting the kickstarter program.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised when we received our shipment!  </li>
            <li>This spelling test was no ordinary spelling test...</li>
            <li>Unique design keeps bathroom soap from being wasted as smaller, used bar fits into fresh, new bar in what STACK calls the &amp;#34;infinity bar&amp;#34; design.</li>
            <li>Even if the previous soap is tiny it can still be put into the new soap and because of the ridge it is able to stick to the new soap and not get dislodged when you wash your hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the new Stack Soap idea and the completely satisfactory</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelming and personally I think it&#x27;s a nice unisex scent.</li>
            <li>(Prior to Stack, I used a little soap bag, which was OK, but not ideal.)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Thankfully after use it leaves your body \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; because the bar itself smells to me like old potatoes or squash.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have any expectations regarding the quality of the soap itself, so i was pleasantly surprised when we started using the bars</li>
            <li>I feel cleaner and have a body soap that can be used up completely.  </li>
            <li>It comes across neither &#x27;female&#x27; nor &#x27;male&#x27; ... just very lightly green, clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving and opening our first box of Stack soap, it is clear there is no reason to go back to traditional soaps/body washes.  </li>
            <li>While the smell may be jarring at first, I find that it quickly wears off, and then it&#x27;s hard to notice in subsequent showers.</li>
            <li>Even tiny soaps can be added to make the new soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok, but at over 4X the per bar cost of \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soap, I could throw away 3 bars every time I open a new one and still be saving money compared to buying the Stack</li>
            <li>But the idea of an unscented soap doesn&#x27;t bother me it was the actual smell of the soap that ruined it for me, it is straight up gross.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my son in law--after hearing and seeing how well it works---NO MORE STICKY SMALL PIECE OF SOAP!!  </li>
            <li>The competition soap that my wife uses simply can not be washed off completely.  </li>
            <li>scent of a product is a make-or-break point for me and while I liked the idea, I was a bit wary of what it would smell like.  </li>
            <li>I will buy the next fragrance and style of soap that they put out next, and this may be my new soap of choice from now on.</li>
            <li>but it was too long for the space in the new bar.</li>
            <li>but I quickly realized that it was because I didn&#x27;t have a small bar to stick into the notch.</li>
            <li>&quot; insert the sliver\\&quot; stage with the first bar-we even waited a. Little longer than we had to-</li>
            <li>Let it set/harden till next day and the pieces will generally stay together...</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding soaps that moisturize and actually remove odor, seems like many do one or the other.  </li>
            <li>A very earthy smell, not especially pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I supported Stack Soap from the Kickstarter mostly because slivers of soap tend to slip from my freakishly large hands at high speeds into inconvenient places like behind the toilet or straight into my face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews because it is stupid, but this soap is fresh</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Soap smells very nice but not too strong and lathers perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice soap that works well and has a nice neutral smell, but the best thing about it is NO SLIVERS.</li>
            <li> My fiance and I funded this Kickstarter project because it sounded like a neat invention based on environmental concerns and the want for good soap, not just body wash.  </li>
            <li> It looks really good in and out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap does not smell good and that&#x27;s why I knocked off a star.  </li>
            <li> The lather is good and the scent of the unscented bar just smells like soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great soap and smells nice AND the design is genius.</li>
            <li> Smells good and stacks as billed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say I was quite pleased with the fragrance-free and dye-free soap formula.</li>

            <li> Love the soap!</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this soap!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update on Friday, May 29, 2015: Still love this soap!</li>
            <li> in spite of a mild, pleasant scent, it has not irritated my skin at all after months of use!</li>
            <li> Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best ones, and this is certainly an example of that...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recommend this soap, Aric did an amazing job</li>
            <li> /&gt;Subscribe to the amazing podcast MBMBaM.</li>
            <li> The lather you get from this soap is absolutely fantastic, it lathers up better than any soap I have ever used, and the stacking part works incredibly well.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> and it makes a nice lather too.</li>
            <li> The soap feels really nice</li>
            <li> Would be nice to see an exfoliating version at some point...</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, the design to absorb the remaining sliver of an old bar of soap into the next is great, and it&#x27;s a lovely-smelling wonderfully creamy soap too.</li>
            <li> Delighted to see it now available as a \\&quot;real\\&quot; product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bars truly are never wasted, as they stick together perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did, because I love, love, love this soap!</li>
            <li> The idea looked great and it can now report that it really works well!  </li>
            <li> Very smooth, not overly scented.</li>
            <li> The ingenious design and pleasing fragrance matched with the care and dedication of its creators to has proven to me</li>
            <li> An ingenious solution to an age-old problem.</li>
            <li> Stack Soap solves this problem without the guilt of so many almost finished bars unceremoniously tossed into the trash.</li>
            <li> I love the concept</li>
            <li> and I love the soft,creamy texture of the soap.</li>
            <li> Im sure every company wishes they thought of this years ago.</li>
            <li> But after getting it - I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love the concept.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> In this price range Stack is one of the most moisturizing soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered more for Christmas presents!&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> really love the fragarence-</li>
            <li> OK the \\&quot;infinite</li>
            <li> and I may or may not buy more myself.</li>
            <li> I came across this ingenious, soap-saving concept on Kickstarter, and ordered it out of curiosity.</li>
            <li> love that the soap is not tested on animals-</li>
            <li> This is an ingenious way to transition from one soap to another.  </li>
            <li> How much better can it get than this?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked forward to not having to throw away pieces of soap, the quality of the soap is great as well as it does not have much scent and is moisturizing</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this soap since I helped fund it, I think the idea is genius.</li>
            <li> : they lather smoothly, leave the skin feeling soft and without residue, and have the most wonderful, light scent.</li>
            <li> At first, I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Support the little guy and get a great soap at a great price as well.  </li>
            <li> The actual soap is very good and doesn&#x27;t contain animal fat like most soaps do.</li>
            <li> received an email within a day after writing my original review from the inventor of stack soap, and he was very understanding of my issues with the soap, and gave great explanations for the problems I had.</li>
            <li> You would think the majority of the product focus would be the &amp;#34;infinity&amp;#34; innovation but the actual soap is very good.</li>
            <li> You always have a nice sized bar of soap that&#x27;s actually useful, and there&#x27;s no waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it smells great and the cleaning action of the soap isn&#x27;t too strong or weak.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too easy going</li>
            <li> Be suspicious of many of the detractors, they won&#x27;t come clean about their motives.</li>
            <li> Soap lathers well and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very mild scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> but anyone who thinks this smells good must live in a cave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Our water in the area is soft and the lather for this soap was pretty incredible.</li>
            <li> They are just a bit pricey, but that&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
            <li> Stack costs more than some mainstream-brand soaps, but I&#x27;m OK paying a higher price for a couple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The smell is fine.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an eco-friendly and chemical-light soap that did not require me to use a soap bag to avoid wasting soap slivers, and Stack fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Compared the mainstream, cheaper brands, Stack is vegan and SLS-free, both of which are important to me.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It soaps up really well and washes off nice too.</li>
            <li> to the important piece.</li>
            <li> Yes, its a great idea, and I would definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li> The problem is, it leaves a really scummy residue floating in the water.. kind of chunky looking.  </li>
            <li> The soap is very nice  with a mild scent and pleasant feel, but the real selling point is the satisfaction of fitting the old sliver into the new bar.</li>
            <li> Takes some practice to find the right moment to squish bars together, but it&#x27;s kind of fun.</li>
            <li> first problem with this soap is that it smells like a magic marker, it has an extremely strong chemical smell and I was hesitant to even use it.</li>
            <li> I was a supporter of the stack soap Kickstarter, and was extremely excited to receive my bars of soap in the mail.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this soap because the inventor was from my home town.  </li>
            <li> I was one of the original Kickstarter backers, and I&#x27;ve been buying Stack on Amazon ever since.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, the stack really works and the soap in non drying and milky sudsy!</li>
            <li> I am now on my 4th of the original 6 bars I received as part of my stack Soap at KickStarter.com</li>
            <li> The actual soap smells nice but not overpowering, it is very light.</li>
            <li> Clean.</li>
            <li> My hands feel clean, that is what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells clean and leaves me feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> and I felt squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> just enough, not too much- really pleasant .  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best of both worlds, so I really have no reason to buy other soap again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to stack the sliver onto a new bar, and I love the soap itself.</li>
            <li> The soap itself is very mild and unscented; good for dry skin in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I thought the concept was cool on Kickstarter, but the product surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft, without any residue; most importantly, nd</li>
            <li> I feel a great appreciation for these guys, knowing that they actually whole heatedly care about the product they are putting out, and that they personally looked for my name in the kickstarter backers, and then emailed me from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel a great appreciation for these guys, knowing that they actually whole heatedly care about the product they are putting out, and that they personally looked for my name in the kickstarter backers, and then emailed me from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love this stuff, but I would love to see them license the design to bigger soap companies so we could see this in teh supermarket.</li>
            <li> So I would love to see a version of this soap which had more moisturizing qualities for all over daily use</li>
            <li> I hope they come out with new scents because I would love to keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We were able to test out its design function right away with our old soap bar - it fit like a glove and adhered right away - no slippage, no slivers of soap clogging the drain...  </li>
            <li> My mornings (and hence the respective days ahead of them) have been so much better!</li>
            <li> I have noticed several reviews that knock the scent, but as regular users of good, old fashioned Ivory, we have to say this soap smells pleasant and fresh.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if Stack could offer some smaller quantities through Amazon as a add-on purchase.</li>
            <li> After using Stack soap for nearly a year, it&#x27;s safe to say this has become a staple in our home.</li>
            <li> and it is not heavily scented which I love.</li>
            <li> it worth it?  </li>
            <li> and I think it is worth trying once</li>
            <li> While others have said that this doesn&#x27;t work out economically, I&#x27;m into the &amp;#34;reduce, reuse, and recycle&amp;#34; philosophy.</li>
            <li> Right now, I can&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li> As they are right now, you will feel like you need another shower after showering with this</li>
            <li> Or if you&#x27;re not a fragrance person, soon after your shower you&#x27;re pretty much unscented but clean</li>
            <li> than anything, everyone should support Stack soap not only because it&#x27;s a great product and competitively priced with the mass produced soaps, but because it takes GUTS to start your own small business based on an idea you believe in!</li>
            <li> but I think they just need a little bit more time to make everyone satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it works best if you wait until the old sliver is just getting to the point of being hard to hold onto.  </li>
            <li> It really is one of those ideas that you&#x27;ll wish you thought of first!</li>
            <li> I will buy the next fragrance and style of soap that they put out next, and this may be my new soap of choice from now on.ail within a day after writing my original review from the inventor of stack soap, and he was very understanding of my issues with the soap, and gave great explanations for the problems I had.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to find than not only does the soap stack</li>
            <li> It is long lasting, feels great</li>
            <li> First things first- the notch works.  </li>
            <li> In the hot, humid summer the feeling didn&#x27;t linger and now that it&#x27;s winter</li>
            <li> We only just finished using the first bar, so we were able to test out the stacking for ourselves.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as you expect.</li>
            <li> It really does work!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used Stack Soap, I noticed that the soap washed off immediately</li>
            <li> My hot showers are now shorter, thus saving energy cash.  </li>
            <li> so that I will not run out when I finish my first 6 bars of Stack Soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it left me feeling very clean yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is more expensive than most other soaps, but I&#x27;m happy to not be wasting soap slivers.</li>
            <li> well but ultimately, a soap is only as good as the soap itself.</li>
            <li> well- within a shower&#x27;s time, the old bar was secure, and we had reasonable soap again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some Irish Springs is much cheaper and smells a lot better.  </li>
            <li> The soap has no real strong scent, which I liked, but it is not as moisturizing as I thought it would be-</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this because of the cool stacking feature, but I worried that it might irritate my VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good idea not sure if Dr. Drew Invited you on the show or if you just called in.</li>
            <li> My hubby and I supported this venture because we thought the idea was pretty clever.  </li>
            <li> think this is the very definition of what soap should do,</li>
            <li> Despite the eco-friendlier nature of the soap, it still lathers very well in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whole stacking thing is just a genius idea</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> If you have even the mildest of OCD tendencies, this will really scratch that itch.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> If it costs 4X as much, I&#x27;d rather throw the slivers</li>
            <li> I just got the soap a few days ago and am loving it.</li>
            <li> If you are even remotely interested in trying new soaps this isn&#x27;t that much of an investment for a box</li>
            <li> While fragrance can be a pretty personal thing, I liked this initial fragrance because it reminds me of a light fresh green tea based scent.</li>
            <li> The bars stack as promised--a tight, satisfying squeeze and a quarter-bar joins seamlessly with a full bar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great product that finally solves all those little slivers of soap!</li>
            <li> Most of the other reviews have this covered.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels pretty nice after using this and it lathers well, all while actually leaving you clean or at least neutral smelling as noted</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a clever idea, and it really does work.  </li>
            <li> This one, they fight over who gets to get the new bar and squeeze in the sliver to it!  </li>
            <li> If the soap was good, I&#x27;d say it might be worth that premium, sadly that&#x27;s not the case.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that it would smell &#x27;decent&#x27; or &#x27;soapy&#x27; but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Such a simple concept, but works elegantly.</li>
            <li> but the high price just makes it impractical.</li>
            <li> Each bar of Stack has an indent at the top that allows you to join the remaining sliver of the previous bar to a new bar.</li>
            <li> But there are two major problems I noticed from first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No heavy scents, no unnecessary ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Was skeptical of buying soap from Kickstarter company but happy I did.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, as soon as I switched my skin was perfectly clear again, and has been for the last month or two.  </li>
            <li> It is fun when your bar starts getting smaller</li>
            <li> more messy soap dish--great idea.</li>
            <li> We have ordered STACK a few times now, and we love it.</li>
            <li> Aside from its main purpose of allowing you to make the most out of your soap, it also has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t hang around like an annoying relative and leaves even ragged hands like mine that have been exposed to cleaning chemicals, engine grease, garden dirt, and a cat that thinks fingers are chew toys soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Our new soap.  </li>
            <li> Stick it to the new one and done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> What a waste if I were then to throw away a significant portion of the bar!</li>
            <li> The sliver of soap actually had to be smaller than I thought it would need to be before it fit</li>
            <li> I just recently got the STACK soap in the mail from supporting the kickstarter program.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised when we received our shipment!  </li>
            <li> This spelling test was no ordinary spelling test...</li>
            <li> Unique design keeps bathroom soap from being wasted as smaller, used bar fits into fresh, new bar in what STACK calls the &amp;#34;infinity bar&amp;#34; design.</li>
            <li> Even if the previous soap is tiny it can still be put into the new soap and because of the ridge it is able to stick to the new soap and not get dislodged when you wash your hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the new Stack Soap idea and the completely satisfactory</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming and personally I think it&#x27;s a nice unisex scent.</li>
            <li> (Prior to Stack, I used a little soap bag, which was OK, but not ideal.)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Thankfully after use it leaves your body \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; because the bar itself smells to me like old potatoes or squash.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any expectations regarding the quality of the soap itself, so i was pleasantly surprised when we started using the bars</li>
            <li> I feel cleaner and have a body soap that can be used up completely.  </li>
            <li> It comes across neither &#x27;female&#x27; nor &#x27;male&#x27; ... just very lightly green, clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving and opening our first box of Stack soap, it is clear there is no reason to go back to traditional soaps/body washes.  </li>
            <li> While the smell may be jarring at first, I find that it quickly wears off, and then it&#x27;s hard to notice in subsequent showers.</li>
            <li> Even tiny soaps can be added to make the new soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok, but at over 4X the per bar cost of \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soap, I could throw away 3 bars every time I open a new one and still be saving money compared to buying the Stack</li>
            <li> But the idea of an unscented soap doesn&#x27;t bother me it was the actual smell of the soap that ruined it for me, it is straight up gross.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son in law--after hearing and seeing how well it works---NO MORE STICKY SMALL PIECE OF SOAP!!  </li>
            <li> The competition soap that my wife uses simply can not be washed off completely.  </li>
            <li> scent of a product is a make-or-break point for me and while I liked the idea, I was a bit wary of what it would smell like.  </li>
            <li> I will buy the next fragrance and style of soap that they put out next, and this may be my new soap of choice from now on.</li>
            <li> but it was too long for the space in the new bar.</li>
            <li> but I quickly realized that it was because I didn&#x27;t have a small bar to stick into the notch.</li>
            <li> &quot; insert the sliver\\&quot; stage with the first bar-we even waited a. Little longer than we had to-</li>
            <li> Let it set/harden till next day and the pieces will generally stay together...</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding soaps that moisturize and actually remove odor, seems like many do one or the other.  </li>
            <li> A very earthy smell, not especially pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I supported Stack Soap from the Kickstarter mostly because slivers of soap tend to slip from my freakishly large hands at high speeds into inconvenient places like behind the toilet or straight into my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews because it is stupid, but this soap is fresh</li>
            <li> I had been struggling to save small bars of soap by pressing them together until I had a bar large enough to actually use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Love this soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any other bar of soap, the kids will leave behind these little slivers of soap that aren&#x27;t big enough to use, meaning I gotta get out of the shower and get a new bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> The design of the soap lets you put your almost done previous bar into the new bar.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I think of this, I could have become filthy rich, then used the soap to get clean.</li>
            <li> The entire idea behind this clever soap bar shape is to save the slivers of leftover soap from the previous bar and add it into the dish of a fresh bar...</li>
            <li> The idea is genius, and I&#x27;m surprised no one had previously thought of this.</li>
            <li> Lasts so much longer than the castille soap we were purchasing previously and this costs less too.</li>
            <li> , Stack Soap also works very well with my hard well water.  </li>
            <li> but I am having trouble figuring out when I will know the soap bar is small enough to fit into the next bar and not be too small.</li>
            <li> soap does have a masculine, almost musky scent however I dont associate it with any, harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavily perfumed and perhaps that&#x27;s what some users are missing - it doesn&#x27;t smell like a beach, a flower or a rainstorm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to a long friendship with Stack Soap.</li>
            <li> price is a bit steep, especially considering you actually get less product than you would without the cut-out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using my second bar of soap now, I can say that I have gotten sufficiently used to the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t linger like other scented soaps do.</li>
            <li> No more throwing away or trying to mold old soap onto another bar unsuccessfully!</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t linger long so if you like to layer on other fragrances (cologne, perfume, scented lotions), it won&#x27;t interfere.  </li>
            <li> However once I received the soap I was very disappointed in the smell of it, I had not been aware that the original idea was for it to be unscented because I read in one of the updates that they were trying to have a similar smell to dove for men.</li>
            <li> and I look forward to the time when I can insert that little bar into the next one.  </li>
            <li> For years I have been squeezing together the softened DIAL soap which is built with a concavity anyway (so old thin bar can be molded into new thick bar at end of shower)  </li>
            <li> Like other commenters I was a Kickstarter backer of this product.</li>
            <li> So now I have 11 bars of soap that I will probably never use, and I am not willing to give any away to my friends.</li>
            <li> it was small enough widthwise</li>
            <li> The Stack Soap design allows me to save the soap before it becomes a small sliver by pressing it into the cavity of the next bar.  </li>
            <li> The initial bar was a bit hard to hold in the shower</li>
            <li> It even accepted my previous non-stack soap sliver to kick things off.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight bit of residue that makes my skin feel squeaky</li>
            <li> My wife and I funded this project on Kickstarter because we are always looking for ways to avoid wasting those little slivers that slip and slide all over the place, try to go down the drain and basically make a nuisance of themselves.</li>
            <li> I hate waste, I hate small pieces of bars of soap that are still good and for me I can&#x27;t just toss them, this product does exactly what it is says!</li>
            <li> In short, no more wasted soap and no more messy slivers sliding around the shower or tub.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely weird to describe, but from comparing Stack soap to Men&#x27;s Dove the feeling is clearly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also backed this project on Kickstarter, and I&#x27;ve been using the soap for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> no more wasted soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging, I have to say, is slick.</li>
            <li> No more pieces of soap stuck to the bottom of the soap holder or the shower floor.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re saving a small amount of soap...</li>
            <li> Not sure how that would translate in hard water areas.</li>
            <li> For almost 30 years now I have had a hard time removing the slick feeling</li>
            <li> too have been annoyed by wasting those little slivers of bar  soap.</li>
            <li> but, seriously, it&#x27;s soap, what were people expecting.  </li>
            <li> I found myself using my first bar like crazy to get to the annoying little nub and try out the stacking, and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at getting non-Stack soap to stick together.</li>
            <li> The past few months I have been breaking out on my face really bad.  </li>
            <li> Tough call.  </li>
            <li> , I really hope I got a bad batch or something like that because the smell is just that bad.</li>
            <li> notice on the box that they have the email for the CEO of the company, and I will be sending an email to see if I just got a bad batch of soap, or if the chemical scent is supposed to be there.</li>
            <li> I funded this as a Kickstarter,  because I also hated all those littler slivers hanging around in the sop dish in our shower.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It even accepted my previous non-stack soap sliver to kick things off.  My mornings (and hence the respective days ahead of them) have been so much better!</li>
            <li> My fiance and I funded this Kickstarter project because it sounded like a neat invention based on environmental concerns and the want for good soap, not just body wash.  Upon receiving and opening our first box of Stack soap, it is clear there is no reason to go back to traditional soaps/body washes.  The ingenious design and pleasing fragrance matched with the care and dedication of its creators to has proven to me this is the only soap I care to use.  Thank you for this product, your dedication, and your passion.  You will have my continued business.</li>
            <li> I just recently got the STACK soap in the mail from supporting the kickstarter program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is the very definition of what soap should do, Clean. My hands feel clean, that is what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap does have a masculine, almost musky scent however I dont associate it with any, harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this soap, Aric did an amazing job and I hope one day it will appear in physical retailers.</li>
            <li> Love this soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any other bar of soap, the kids will leave behind these little slivers of soap that aren&#x27;t big enough to use, meaning I gotta get out of the shower and get a new bar of soap.  This one, they fight over who gets to get the new bar and squeeze in the sliver to it!  I&#x27;m happy, never have to get in the shower and find no bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  This one needs to be on the auto-ship program.</li>
            <li> My hubby and I supported this venture because we thought the idea was pretty clever.  And we were not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of a product is a make-or-break point for me and while I liked the idea, I was a bit wary of what it would smell like.  I was very pleasantly surprised when we received our shipment!  While fragrance can be a pretty personal thing, I liked this initial fragrance because it reminds me of a light fresh green tea based scent. It&#x27;s not overwhelming and personally I think it&#x27;s a nice unisex scent. The scent doesn&#x27;t linger long so if you like to layer on other fragrances (cologne, perfume, scented lotions), it won&#x27;t interfere.  Or if you&#x27;re not a fragrance person, soon after your shower you&#x27;re pretty much unscented but clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our water in the area is soft and the lather for this soap was pretty incredible. Not sure how that would translate in hard water areas. I had no issues rinsing it off and it left me feeling very clean yet moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were able to test out its design function right away with our old soap bar - it fit like a glove and adhered right away - no slippage, no slivers of soap clogging the drain...  I can&#x27;t wait until we use up the bar and break open the next stack soap bar!</li>
            <li> As soon as I graduate in 4 months and get my career going, I plan to buy a pallet of bars with my RN nursing money. Right now, I can&#x27;t afford it. They are just a bit pricey, but that&#x27;s totally fine. At that price, I assume it does not have sodium laurate sulfate and propylene glycol, those killer ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subscribe to the amazing podcast MBMBaM.</li>
            <li> My wife and I funded this project on Kickstarter because we are always looking for ways to avoid wasting those little slivers that slip and slide all over the place, try to go down the drain and basically make a nuisance of themselves. When I saw this on Kickstarter I didn&#x27;t hesitate and immediately backed it. Now the soap is here and we&#x27;re very happy with it - smell and all. I have noticed several reviews that knock the scent, but as regular users of good, old fashioned Ivory, we have to say this soap smells pleasant and fresh. It&#x27;s not heavily perfumed and perhaps that&#x27;s what some users are missing - it doesn&#x27;t smell like a beach, a flower or a rainstorm. It smells clean and leaves me feeling clean.  Maybe I&#x27;m too easy going but, seriously, it&#x27;s soap, what were people expecting.  I say, \\&quot;Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Like other commenters I was a Kickstarter backer of this product. I had been looking for an eco-friendly and chemical-light soap that did not require me to use a soap bag to avoid wasting soap slivers, and Stack fit the bill. Stack costs more than some mainstream-brand soaps, but I&#x27;m OK paying a higher price for a couple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m not good at getting non-Stack soap to stick together. (Prior to Stack, I used a little soap bag, which was OK, but not ideal.)&lt;br /&gt;- Compared the mainstream, cheaper brands, Stack is vegan and SLS-free, both of which are important to me.&lt;br /&gt;- Despite the eco-friendlier nature of the soap, it still lathers very well in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how $12 might be discourage some first-time buyers. It would be nice if Stack could offer some smaller quantities through Amazon as a add-on purchase.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s the greatest idea since slivered soap anyway. Why didn&#x27;t I think of this, I could have become filthy rich, then used the soap to get clean. The smell is fine. Be suspicious of many of the detractors, they won&#x27;t come clean about their motives. I&#x27;m looking forward to a long friendship with Stack Soap. I might add that this soap lasts two weeks whereas the Dove soap I formerly used only lasted a week.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a genius idea when I heard about it. The actual soap is very good and doesn&#x27;t contain animal fat like most soaps do. The initial bar was a bit hard to hold in the shower but I quickly realized that it was because I didn&#x27;t have a small bar to stick into the notch.</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this soap since I helped fund it, I think the idea is genius. However once I received the soap I was very disappointed in the smell of it, I had not been aware that the original idea was for it to be unscented because I read in one of the updates that they were trying to have a similar smell to dove for men. But the idea of an unscented soap doesn&#x27;t bother me it was the actual smell of the soap that ruined it for me, it is straight up gross. I used one bar once and that was it, I really hope I got a bad batch or something like that because the smell is just that bad. I think the idea and everything is there but I think they just need a little bit more time to make everyone satisfied. So now I have 11 bars of soap that I will probably never use, and I am not willing to give any away to my friends.</li>
            <li> An ingenious solution to an age-old problem. Stack stacks well but ultimately, a soap is only as good as the soap itself. I&#x27;m happy to say I was quite pleased with the fragrance-free and dye-free soap formula. After using Stack soap for nearly a year, it&#x27;s safe to say this has become a staple in our home.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best ones, and this is certainly an example of that...in fact, I&#x27;m amazed that nobody else has thought of this before now! Each bar of Stack has an indent at the top that allows you to join the remaining sliver of the previous bar to a new bar. In short, no more wasted soap and no more messy slivers sliding around the shower or tub. It really is one of those ideas that you&#x27;ll wish you thought of first!</li>
            <li> I was a supporter of the stack soap Kickstarter, and was extremely excited to receive my bars of soap in the mail. The idea is genius, and I&#x27;m surprised no one had previously thought of this. But there are two major problems I noticed from first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first problem with this soap is that it smells like a magic marker, it has an extremely strong chemical smell and I was hesitant to even use it. I knew when I supported the project on Kickstarter that it wasn&#x27;t going to be scented, and that they were taking suggestions for the future soaps, but I didn&#x27;t know that it would smell so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem with the soap is that it leaves you feeling sticky. It&#x27;s extremely weird to describe, but from comparing Stack soap to Men&#x27;s Dove the feeling is clearly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice on the box that they have the email for the CEO of the company, and I will be sending an email to see if I just got a bad batch of soap, or if the chemical scent is supposed to be there. For now though, I say avoid this soap at all costs until they release the scented bars. As they are right now, you will feel like you need another shower after showering with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review 06/26:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using my second bar of soap now, I can say that I have gotten sufficiently used to the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t linger like other scented soaps do. While the smell may be jarring at first, I find that it quickly wears off, and then it&#x27;s hard to notice in subsequent showers. I still feel as if there is a bit of a stick to me after I wash using stack soap, but it could be because of the hardness of the water, as people are commenting saying. The lather you get from this soap is absolutely fantastic, it lathers up better than any soap I have ever used, and the stacking part works incredibly well. I found myself using my first bar like crazy to get to the annoying little nub and try out the stacking, and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received an email within a day after writing my original review from the inventor of stack soap, and he was very understanding of my issues with the soap, and gave great explanations for the problems I had. I feel a great appreciation for these guys, knowing that they actually whole heatedly care about the product they are putting out, and that they personally looked for my name in the kickstarter backers, and then emailed me from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, I have upped my review from 2 stars to 4 stars. I will buy the next fragrance and style of soap that they put out next, and this may be my new soap of choice from now on.ail within a day after writing my original review from the inventor of stack soap, and he was very understanding of my issues with the soap, and gave great explanations for the problems I had.

            <li> I supported Stack Soap from the Kickstarter mostly because slivers of soap tend to slip from my freakishly large hands at high speeds into inconvenient places like behind the toilet or straight into my face. Stack Soap solves this problem without the guilt of so many almost finished bars unceremoniously tossed into the trash. Aside from its main purpose of allowing you to make the most out of your soap, it also has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t hang around like an annoying relative and leaves even ragged hands like mine that have been exposed to cleaning chemicals, engine grease, garden dirt, and a cat that thinks fingers are chew toys soft and smooth. Hooray for Stack Soap!</li>
            <li> I just got the soap a few days ago and am loving it. The actual soap smells nice but not overpowering, it is very light. It soaps up really well and washes off nice too. The packaging, I have to say, is slick. It looks really good in and out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the important piece. The design of the soap lets you put your almost done previous bar into the new bar. I love the concept but I am having trouble figuring out when I will know the soap bar is small enough to fit into the next bar and not be too small. Still don&#x27;t know how to solve this problem, BUT I don&#x27;t think I have to. Even if the previous soap is tiny it can still be put into the new soap and because of the ridge it is able to stick to the new soap and not get dislodged when you wash your hands. Even tiny soaps can be added to make the new soap. I hope they come out with new scents because I would love to keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> I thought the concept was cool on Kickstarter, but the product surpassed my expectations. Delighted to see it now available as a \\&quot;real\\&quot; product on Amazon. Bars truly are never wasted, as they stick together perfectly. Soap lathers well and rinses easily. This has replaced Dove for Men for me.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to find than not only does the soap stack well it smells so good! My entire bathroom has a pleasing scent and I love the soft,creamy texture of the soap.</li>
            <li> Yes, its a great idea, and I would definitely keep buying. Im sure every company wishes they thought of this years ago.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this soap because the inventor was from my home town.  But after getting it - I love it.  It is long lasting, feels great and I look forward to the time when I can insert that little bar into the next one.  No more throwing away or trying to mold old soap onto another bar unsuccessfully!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff exclusively for about 6 months.  At first, I loved it.  The whole stacking thing is just a genius idea and I wish all soap manufacturers would do the same.  Smells and lathers great.  The problem is, it leaves a really scummy residue floating in the water.. kind of chunky looking.  I don&#x27;t think it dissolves well in the water.  The past few months I have been breaking out on my face really bad.  I thought it was just all the sweating from the Texas heat.. it turned out to be the soap.  I switched back to Zest to see if I could rule out the soap as the cause.  Sure enough, as soon as I switched my skin was perfectly clear again, and has been for the last month or two.  Yeah I know, you&#x27;re not *supposed* to use bath soap on your face.. but I always have and I&#x27;ve never had an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit steep, especially considering you actually get less product than you would without the cut-out.  You&#x27;re definitely paying a premium for the design.  If the soap was good, I&#x27;d say it might be worth that premium, sadly that&#x27;s not the case.  The remaining bars of mine are going into the trash.</li>
            <li> Unique design keeps bathroom soap from being wasted as smaller, used bar fits into fresh, new bar in what STACK calls the &amp;#34;infinity bar&amp;#34; design.</li>
            <li> Love the concept. Love the soap! I&#x27;ve been using these soaps for over 6 months now and I&#x27;m never going back to regular soap.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It smells nice but not overbearing. In this price range Stack is one of the most moisturizing soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was one of the original Kickstarter backers, and I&#x27;ve been buying Stack on Amazon ever since. I love this stuff. It&#x27;s nice soap that works well and has a nice neutral smell, but the best thing about it is NO SLIVERS. You always have a nice sized bar of soap that&#x27;s actually useful, and there&#x27;s no waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this stuff, but I would love to see them license the design to bigger soap companies so we could see this in teh supermarket.</li>
            <li> No more pieces of soap stuck to the bottom of the soap holder or the shower floor. I like the smell and it makes a nice lather too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that finally solves all those little slivers of soap! It is fun when your bar starts getting smaller and you know it is time to simply place it into the next bar. The soap feels really nice and it is not heavily scented which I love. I&#x27;ve re-ordered several times and will continue doing so!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son in law--after hearing and seeing how well it works---NO MORE STICKY SMALL PIECE OF SOAP!!  I ordered more for Christmas presents!&lt;br /&gt;No more messy soap dish--great idea.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this small soap company when they supported the My Brother My Brother and Me podcast and thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  Very glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the genius idea of stacking, Stack soap is just really simple and does what it should.  No heavy scents, no unnecessary ingredients.  It&#x27;s just soap at it&#x27;s simplest, which is all it needs to be.  The shea butter is an added bonus and does seem to make it just a smoother feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t include packaging as part of the point score, but as an added bonus, you guys did a great job with it.  It looks amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than anything, everyone should support Stack soap not only because it&#x27;s a great product and competitively priced with the mass produced soaps, but because it takes GUTS to start your own small business based on an idea you believe in! Support the little guy and get a great soap at a great price as well.  It&#x27;s the best of both worlds, so I really have no reason to buy other soap again.</li>
            <li> I funded this as a Kickstarter,  because I also hated all those littler slivers hanging around in the sop dish in our shower.  We&#x27;ve reached the \\&quot; insert the sliver\\&quot; stage with the first bar-we even waited a. Little longer than we had to- and the meld process worked well- within a shower&#x27;s time, the old bar was secure, and we had reasonable soap again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the fragarence- just enough, not too much- really pleasant .  Our new soap.  Period.</li>
            <li> Most of the other reviews have this covered.  Here&#x27;s some truth though.  #1 - This soap does not smell good and that&#x27;s why I knocked off a star.  I get it is supposedly unscented.  Thankfully after use it leaves your body \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; because the bar itself smells to me like old potatoes or squash.  A very earthy smell, not especially pleasant.  Again it does not leave your body smelling that way but anyone who thinks this smells good must live in a cave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 - The price.  OK the \\&quot;infinite bar\\&quot; thing works well enough but come on.  As others have noted you&#x27;re looking at probably two bucks a bar here.  Some Irish Springs is much cheaper and smells a lot better.  This leads to my final point which is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3- It does work well.  I have a hard time finding soaps that moisturize and actually remove odor, seems like many do one or the other.  This does both.  Skin feels pretty nice after using this and it lathers well, all while actually leaving you clean or at least neutral smelling as noted above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth it?  Tough call.  If you are even remotely interested in trying new soaps this isn&#x27;t that much of an investment for a box and I think it is worth trying once and I may or may not buy more myself.</li>
            <li> I came across this ingenious, soap-saving concept on Kickstarter, and ordered it out of curiosity. The leftover stacking works as described and is reason enough to re-order the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any expectations regarding the quality of the soap itself, so i was pleasantly surprised when we started using the bars: they lather smoothly, leave the skin feeling soft and without residue, and have the most wonderful, light scent. It comes across neither &#x27;female&#x27; nor &#x27;male&#x27; ... just very lightly green, clean, and fresh. Like a meadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will definitely continue to use this product and recommend it to our friends.</li>
            <li> First things first- the notch works.  I&#x27;ve found it works best if you wait until the old sliver is just getting to the point of being hard to hold onto.  Stick it to the new one and done.&lt;br /&gt;I love that the soap is not tested on animals- that is a prerequisite for me.  The lather is good and the scent of the unscented bar just smells like soap.  There is a slight bit of residue that makes my skin feel squeaky which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.  In the hot, humid summer the feeling didn&#x27;t linger and now that it&#x27;s winter I moisturize so again the squeaky feeling doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent idea with great execution.  I plan to make this my default soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this soap exclusively for a while, I am upgrading my review to 5 stars.  I recently tried the Jasmine scent also- it&#x27;s a very mild scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great idea. We&#x27;ve been using them since their kickstarter launch. Once you go stack you&#x27;ll never go back. Get it now</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, the design to absorb the remaining sliver of an old bar of soap into the next is great, and it&#x27;s a lovely-smelling wonderfully creamy soap too.</li>
            <li> I also backed this project on Kickstarter, and I&#x27;ve been using the soap for a few months now.  I really like it and I&#x27;m proud to recommend it to friends and family, and now strangers on the internet.</li>
            <li> The soap is very nice  with a mild scent and pleasant feel, but the real selling point is the satisfaction of fitting the old sliver into the new bar. If you have even the mildest of OCD tendencies, this will really scratch that itch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been several months without having to ever deal with a soap shard.  The bars stack as promised--a tight, satisfying squeeze and a quarter-bar joins seamlessly with a full bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap seems to be unscented and does the job well.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, the stack really works and the soap in non drying and milky sudsy! Heard abound this on the Adam Carolla podcast with Dr Drew, thought it would make a great gift for hubby, but we both ended up loving it and will be buying more....for sure!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. Lasts so much longer than the castille soap we were purchasing previously and this costs less too.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would smell &#x27;decent&#x27; or &#x27;soapy&#x27; but it doesn&#x27;t. It smells like the day you came home from school with the widest of smiles on your face. Your mother asks \\&quot;How was school, dear?\\&quot; and you reply with the highest pitch in your voice \\&quot;I got an A on my spelling test\\&quot;. This spelling test was no ordinary spelling test... this was the spelling test that included the word &#x27;lugubrious&#x27;. Your mother looked over the test and said \\&quot;Lugubrious?! I am going to hang this on the refrigerator\\&quot;. End&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reals. It is awesome soap. I don&#x27;t write many reviews because it is stupid, but this soap is fresh (in the literal term and the &#x27;slang&#x27; meaning)</li>
            <li> We have ordered STACK a few times now, and we love it. It&#x27;s great soap and smells nice AND the design is genius.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this soap! It&#x27;s so easy to stack the sliver onto a new bar, and I love the soap itself. I think it smells great and the cleaning action of the soap isn&#x27;t too strong or weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more expensive than most other soaps, but I&#x27;m happy to not be wasting soap slivers. While others have said that this doesn&#x27;t work out economically, I&#x27;m into the &amp;#34;reduce, reuse, and recycle&amp;#34; philosophy. Resources were expended making this soap and transporting it to our house. What a waste if I were then to throw away a significant portion of the bar! Now nothing is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on Friday, May 29, 2015: Still love this soap! No problems.</li>
            <li> I was also a kickstarter investor, as the sliver soap problem has vexed me for years! When I saw the design, I knew that they had it solved. We only just finished using the first bar, so we were able to test out the stacking for ourselves. It works exactly as you expect. Two comments:&lt;br /&gt;1) The sliver of soap actually had to be smaller than I thought it would need to be before it fit lengthwise- it was small enough widthwise but it was too long for the space in the new bar. So I just waited another couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;2) The soap has no real strong scent, which I liked, but it is not as moisturizing as I thought it would be- my skin does not feel moisturized like when I use liquid soap like neutrogena. So I would love to see a version of this soap which had more moisturizing qualities for all over daily use</li>
            <li> This is an ingenious way to transition from one soap to another.  It really does work!  The soap itself is very mild and unscented; good for dry skin in the winter months.</li>
            <li> The entire idea behind this clever soap bar shape is to save the slivers of leftover soap from the previous bar and add it into the dish of a fresh bar...no more wasted soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, but at over 4X the per bar cost of \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soap, I could throw away 3 bars every time I open a new one and still be saving money compared to buying the Stack soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you&#x27;re saving a small amount of soap...so what?  If it costs 4X as much, I&#x27;d rather throw the slivers away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a clever idea, and it really does work.  If the price were comparable it&#x27;s a slam dunk...but the high price just makes it impractical.</li>
            <li> My son sent me the link to Stack Soap at KickStarter.com.  The idea looked great and it can now report that it really works well!  I had been struggling to save small bars of soap by pressing them together until I had a bar large enough to actually use in the shower.  The Stack Soap design allows me to save the soap before it becomes a small sliver by pressing it into the cavity of the next bar.  The Stack Soap idea works!  I am now on my 4th of the original 6 bars I received as part of my stack Soap at KickStarter.com involvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to an excellent idea, Stack Soap also works very well with my hard well water.  The competition soap that my wife uses simply can not be washed off completely.  For almost 30 years now I have had a hard time removing the slick feeling I got from using her skin cream infected soap.  The first time I used Stack Soap, I noticed that the soap washed off immediately and I felt squeaky clean.  My hot showers are now shorter, thus saving energy cash.  I feel cleaner and have a body soap that can be used up completely.  How much better can it get than this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the new Stack Soap idea and the completely satisfactory product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now placing my order for two 6 packs from Amazon.com so that I will not run out when I finish my first 6 bars of Stack Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BobG, Raleigh, NC</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this because of the cool stacking feature, but I worried that it might irritate my VERY sensitive skin. However, my curiosity about the stacking outweighed my worries, so I gave it a try. I am so glad I did, because I love, love, love this soap! It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft, without any residue; most importantly, nd in spite of a mild, pleasant scent, it has not irritated my skin at all after months of use!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical of buying soap from Kickstarter company but happy I did. Soap smells very nice but not too strong and lathers perfectly. Would be nice to see an exfoliating version at some point...</li>
            <li> I heard about this product on the Adam Carolla podcast  .I too have been annoyed by wasting those little slivers of bar  soap. For years I have been squeezing together the softened DIAL soap which is built with a concavity anyway (so old thin bar can be molded into new thick bar at end of shower)  Let it set/harden till next day and the pieces will generally stay together...</li>
            <li> Good idea not sure if Dr. Drew Invited you on the show or if you just called in. Now come up with something for Body wash as I dont use bar soap.</li>
            <li> Smells good and stacks as billed. Takes some practice to find the right moment to squish bars together, but it&#x27;s kind of fun.</li>
            <li> Such a simple concept, but works elegantly. You would think the majority of the product focus would be the &amp;#34;infinity&amp;#34; innovation but the actual soap is very good. Very smooth, not overly scented. Just great all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this now before the big manufacturers grab the concept!</li>
            <li> Great soap and I looked forward to not having to throw away pieces of soap, the quality of the soap is great as well as it does not have much scent and is moisturizing</li>
            <li> I hate waste, I hate small pieces of bars of soap that are still good and for me I can&#x27;t just toss them, this product does exactly what it is says!</li>
