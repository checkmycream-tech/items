            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to make the switch.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This gel looked great for about a week and then started chipping on my index fingers.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how happy i am</li>
            <li>Many gel colors and the DVD is trully incredible!</li>
            <li>My nails have NEVER looked this good.</li>
            <li>good luck with it.</li>
            <li>Bond-aid is a good addition</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the quality of OPI.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I no longer wear acrylic nails and wanted to start the process of repairing my own nails.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve already done my Sisters nails, my friends, my niece and my own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be happy with a full 7 days...</li>
            <li>Really easy to work with, this gel kit amazed me!</li>
            <li>It seems to be of great quality, but I have not used the product yet, as I need to soak off my acrylic nails first.</li>
            <li>My nails look great and the process is easy and quick.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m sure someone else out there is like me.    </li>
            <li>Great product with good instructions that are easy to follow, I would Recommend this product highly to others, one point to remember is that you do need a UV light to set the gels.</li>
            <li>Just make sure the color you select is what you like because to change the color once you start polishing is not that easily done.</li>
            <li>Probably a good idea to order some bright colours that you like at the same time</li>
            <li>havent been able to use it yet as i have had issues ordering a light for curing.</li>
            <li>If you are intro level of gel nail user, I strongly recommend not to buy this one.</li>
            <li>My kit was missing the DVD and the &amp;#34;Tips for Perfect Nails Brochure.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so I was excited but within 2 days I had 2 chips</li>
            <li>I am not a &#x27;nail enhancement&#x27; enthusiast in general, but prefer to work on maintaining great natural nails.  </li>
            <li>This product does not dry on its own.  </li>
            <li>The polish is hard, durable, shiny and perfect after a whole week.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it, and after 3-4 uses it&#x27;s payed off compared to salon prices.</li>
            <li>They look good for about a day and a half after a manicure, but then they chip and peel away.  </li>
            <li>I think it should be made very clear that a person HAS to have the light in order for this product to work.  </li>
            <li>One reviewer mentioned that they wouldn&#x27;t come off of her nails,  I haven&#x27;t had to deal with that yet because it is my first use.  </li>
            <li>thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I used to get it done at a nail salon until I decided I was spending way too much money ($50 every 3 weeks).</li>
            <li>Then I invested in this system and got me some UV lamps and nail drills and was ready to roll.</li>
            <li>But in any case, it is worth investing in a gel nail system and saving some money on professional mani.</li>
            <li>Ordered the Thermal Spa light in order to dry the product.  </li>
            <li>also i&#x27;ll add that although the color palette available is limited, you can mix them like normal nail polish.  </li>
            <li>The clear polish that is applied to your nails hardens  your nails, because they are very weaken from the acrylic process.</li>
            <li>other than that everything else seems fine with the product.</li>
            <li>That is not made clear at all when a person orders the kit.</li>
            <li>but currently my natural nails are damaged from it and my skin is cracked from soaking in acetone for about 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Even when using natural tips the nail end up looking TRULY NATURAL.</li>
            <li>another time i did 2 different pinks to create a &#x27;new&#x27; color.    </li>
            <li>Not to mention you can always fix a nail if it gets broken without waiting for an appointment :)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I peeled it off-big mistake-it took off the top layer or two of my natural nail.  </li>
            <li>It turns out the pink is the most difficult part because the gel is very viscous and it will end up with a lot of bumps and dents if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>I was \\&quot;sold\\&quot; this \\&quot;polish\\&quot; by my salon-I have very little success with regular manicures-my polish starts chipping after two days, etc.  </li>

            <li> I was \\&quot;sold\\&quot; this \\&quot;polish\\&quot; by my salon-I have very little success with regular manicures-my polish starts chipping after two days, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh like acrylic, no drilling of nails, can be worn on natural nails and you can get away with thin coats.</li>
            <li> The opi gel laquer lasts for approximately two weeks, no chipping  and the polish looks wet all the time, very vibrant.</li>
            <li> I waited 30 mins and it was still wet and sticky</li>
            <li> my manicurist suggested after 3 tries that i do not use it because she has never seen anyone with the reaction i have where it just won&#x27;t come off.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat tricky to apply the pink gel</li>
            <li> A salon I found in Dallas this past weekend carried OPI axxium which would be the THIRD brand of gel polish I tried.</li>
            <li> i had taken a blah pale pink and then put a shimmer coat over it.  </li>
            <li> This is hard type, not soft.</li>
            <li> Also my nails start lifting after a couple of weeks, no matter how carefully I apply the gels, so I am still not sure how to fix this.</li>
            <li> I chose a very dark color (Linkin Park)</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t even doing any of my usual activities.</li>
            <li> My nails are too fragile for the buffing needed for acrylics and acrylics look lousy on my thin fingers anyway.  </li>
            <li> I was on vacation hardly doing anything!</li>
            <li> and she told me that I had to file the tops of the nails-to \\&quot;break through to the color\\&quot; and soak in acetone for at least 15 minutes!  </li>
            <li> All the other chipped after a few days so needless to say I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> I have horrible peeling ugly nails.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to get off your nails!!</li>

            <li> This product does not dry on its own.  I waited 30 mins and it was still wet and sticky so I took it off.  Ordered the Thermal Spa light in order to dry the product.  We&#x27;ll see.  Works in the salon so should work at home.  I think it should be made very clear that a person HAS to have the light in order for this product to work.  That is not made clear at all when a person orders the kit.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I no longer wear acrylic nails and wanted to start the process of repairing my own nails. This is a great way to make the switch. My nails look great and the process is easy and quick. Just make sure the color you select is what you like because to change the color once you start polishing is not that easily done. The clear polish that is applied to your nails hardens  your nails, because they are very weaken from the acrylic process. The opi gel laquer lasts for approximately two weeks, no chipping  and the polish looks wet all the time, very vibrant. This is my choice for now!!</li>
            <li> I found out about gel polish in december and was so hopeful. A salon I found in Dallas this past weekend carried OPI axxium which would be the THIRD brand of gel polish I tried. All the other chipped after a few days so needless to say I was disappointed. The OPI brand seemed thicker from the start so I was excited but within 2 days I had 2 chips and I wasn&#x27;t even doing any of my usual activities. I was on vacation hardly doing anything! it seems my nail beds are \\&quot;oily\\&quot; which is what the salon claims but the stuff is supposed to last 3 weeks???? I&#x27;d be happy with a full 7 days...try it out at the salon before buying the kit.</li>
            <li> I have horrible peeling ugly nails.  They look good for about a day and a half after a manicure, but then they chip and peel away.  My nails are too fragile for the buffing needed for acrylics and acrylics look lousy on my thin fingers anyway.  My salon aggressively sold me on these during a moment of weakness.  Best thing that has ever happened to my nails!  The polish is hard, durable, shiny and perfect after a whole week.  One reviewer mentioned that they wouldn&#x27;t come off of her nails,  I haven&#x27;t had to deal with that yet because it is my first use.  I chose a very dark color (Linkin Park) so that could be an issue for me, but I am committed to this polish.  My nails have NEVER looked this good.</li>
            <li> I am not a &#x27;nail enhancement&#x27; enthusiast in general, but prefer to work on maintaining great natural nails.  i went for a regular mani/pedi and this polish was presented to me as a &#x27;soak off gel polish&#x27;.  i was all over it!  it is BEAUTIFUL, shiny, perfect, strong and stays absolutely flawless for weeks.  i was amazed.  best thing ever.....but....it will not come off me.  my manicurist suggested after 3 tries that i do not use it because she has never seen anyone with the reaction i have where it just won&#x27;t come off.  so i know i may be the &#x27;oddball&#x27; but i&#x27;m sure someone else out there is like me.    and for the rest of you in the majority--if you can use this--use it and i envy you!!  it is beautiful!   but currently my natural nails are damaged from it and my skin is cracked from soaking in acetone for about 40 minutes.  :(  also i&#x27;ll add that although the color palette available is limited, you can mix them like normal nail polish.  i had taken a blah pale pink and then put a shimmer coat over it.  another time i did 2 different pinks to create a &#x27;new&#x27; color.    i wish i could still use this!    good luck with it.</li>
            <li> Did NOT like this at all!  Very difficult to get off your nails!!</li>
            <li> Great product with good instructions that are easy to follow, I would Recommend this product highly to others, one point to remember is that you do need a UV light to set the gels. Probably a good idea to order some bright colours that you like at the same time so you only have to pay freight once.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Just about everything you need to create beautiful gel nails including extensions. Bond-aid is a good addition so don&#x27;t forget to buy this as it helps bonding the gel to the nail.</li>
            <li> I used to get it done at a nail salon until I decided I was spending way too much money ($50 every 3 weeks). Then I invested in this system and got me some UV lamps and nail drills and was ready to roll. It is somewhat tricky to apply the pink gel and I used to think once you are done with the white tips, the rest is a piece of cake. It turns out the pink is the most difficult part because the gel is very viscous and it will end up with a lot of bumps and dents if you are not careful. Also my nails start lifting after a couple of weeks, no matter how carefully I apply the gels, so I am still not sure how to fix this. But in any case, it is worth investing in a gel nail system and saving some money on professional mani. Not to mention you can always fix a nail if it gets broken without waiting for an appointment :)</li>
            <li> I was \\&quot;sold\\&quot; this \\&quot;polish\\&quot; by my salon-I have very little success with regular manicures-my polish starts chipping after two days, etc.  This gel looked great for about a week and then started chipping on my index fingers.  Unfortunately, I peeled it off-big mistake-it took off the top layer or two of my natural nail.  The tech who applied the gel told me to take it off with acetone; I bought a bottle of nail polish remover with acetone...nothing, it didn&#x27;t budge.  I called the salon and spoke to the \\&quot;head\\&quot; tech and she told me that I had to file the tops of the nails-to \\&quot;break through to the color\\&quot; and soak in acetone for at least 15 minutes!  This process scares me!  I am going to the salon tomorrow to have them remove the gel. Never again!</li>
            <li> Cd was not inside the box?!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I bought this the 3rd of this month, I&#x27;ve already done my Sisters nails, my friends, my niece and my own. I can&#x27;t express how happy i am i bought this item. It&#x27;s not harsh like acrylic, no drilling of nails, can be worn on natural nails and you can get away with thin coats. Even when using natural tips the nail end up looking TRULY NATURAL. If you&#x27;re into acrylic, or even getting manicures, i so recommend this. It&#x27;s well worth it, and after 3-4 uses it&#x27;s payed off compared to salon prices.</li>
            <li> This kit is perfect! Many gel colors and the DVD is trully incredible! Really easy to work with, this gel kit amazed me!</li>
            <li> thank you so much! I am very satisfied with the quality of OPI. The gels are increadable and i am going to continue to use them!!!!</li>
            <li> when my package arrivd one of the bottles had opened and leaked all over the place. other than that everything else seems fine with the product. havent been able to use it yet as i have had issues ordering a light for curing.</li>
            <li> This is hard type, not soft. If you are intro level of gel nail user, I strongly recommend not to buy this one.</li>
            <li> This product I returned.</li>
            <li> I received my Axxium Intro Kit in the mail today. It seems to be of great quality, but I have not used the product yet, as I need to soak off my acrylic nails first. My kit was missing the DVD and the &amp;#34;Tips for Perfect Nails Brochure.&amp;#34;</li>
