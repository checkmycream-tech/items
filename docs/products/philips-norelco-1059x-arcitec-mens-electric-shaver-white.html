    <ol>
            <li>Cleaning this is one of the best things about it.</li>
            <li>Now here&#x27;s the best story I can tell you about this shaver.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is one of the best looking shavers on the market!</li>
            <li>This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>(but this can also be a problem, see below); very good \\&quot;on-sale\\&quot; price on Amazon;    </li>
            <li>so I also got a good deal on the price!</li>
            <li>It looks great and like it would hug your face and give you a close shave.</li>
            <li>Great razor.  </li>
            <li>Great for men on medications.</li>
            <li>I think it would be a great razor for someone with a coarser and denser beard than mine.    </li>
            <li>It is also very nice that Amazon had it on one of their one day specials</li>
            <li>Either way,  amazing shaver!  </li>
            <li>my friends recommand  it ,I like it,so nice work and beautifully .I</li>
            <li>I purchased the razor and it is in good working order.  </li>
            <li>I feel the price that I paid was a fair price.</li>
            <li>the good:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now the not so good news...</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem so good though.  </li>
            <li>The shaving head is fairly flexible and adapts to contours well,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you this has to be the world&#x27;s best Electric Shaver and it was purchased right here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>In fact, with restricting the whiskers to a one or two day length, the results are fairly comparable to the Braun 360 which so far yielded the best results for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and handle while shaving.</li>
            <li>easy to rinse clean, good accessories</li>
            <li>and I wonder how many times this can be done before one of the heads breaks</li>
            <li>The shaver comes with a travel charger/case and a plug,  and a stand,  and seems to work flawlessly on stubble and such.  </li>
            <li>However, it also irritates the skin a bit more.</li>
            <li>I bought the Arcitec on sale thinking the swivel head would do even better.</li>
            <li>First the good news...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really classy looking and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>My experience so far is that this razor has many great attributes EXCEPT power.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean and comes with a stand up charger as well as a charging case.</li>
            <li>It is almost as good as a real blade but still not quite.</li>
            <li>It is fast and gives you as good a shave as any \\&quot;Gillette\\&quot; and I do not get any nicks...</li>
            <li>It works really great until it loads up with fur and there is no room left for more.</li>
            <li>Received this as a gift a year ago and couldn&#x27;t easily return it.</li>
            <li>The razor itself is fine</li>
            <li>Wish I could get all enthusiastic about scoring a great piece of shaver technology at a great price, but sadly, the only great thing there was, was the price.  </li>
            <li>I found that the razor was very loud and the shave was not any better than the Norelco shaver I now own.</li>
            <li>The cheap China made pump motor died on the R1000 and Remington</li>
            <li>This makes an amazing gift,  really.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean under running water and saves shaving time as well.</li>
            <li>I do like how easy it is to clean the 1059X.</li>
            <li>The results are very similar - a good, clean shave everywhere except below the jaw, although the Norelco does a slightly better job there than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I had an older Norelco that I liked a lot, so I was hopeful.</li>
            <li>I kept it past the warranty date and still have it sitting on a shelf gathering dust which it does the best at.</li>
            <li>My example would be that you must open&lt;br /&gt;each head individually to clean it</li>
            <li>The biggest problem with this design is that if you have a heavy/fast growing beard is that you may have to stop and clean it mid-shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a gold box special.</li>
            <li>No one in their right mind would EVER pack this thing in a suitcase!  </li>
            <li>I had a norelco prior to this one and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>I believe it may be the only head design that good on&lt;br /&gt;the market which is why I rated it 5</li>
            <li>IT IS TRUE.  </li>
            <li>So yes, it&#x27;s a very, very nice razor (not perfect), does a good job, is comfortable</li>
            <li>This shaver is very comfortable to hold, and does a good job of shaving, although I think the Norelco that I replaced with this one did the job a little quicker.</li>
            <li>The Arcitec 1059 gives a good, comfortable shave with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>Love the shave head on this range MUCH more than the 11xx and 12xx models, so I went back to this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is light and reasonably easy to handle with its new form factor.</li>
            <li>Cuts very close, and the heads do move freely to deal with curves in my face.  </li>
            <li>This is really a razor for those that have a light growth or shave twice a day cleaning it thoroughly each time.     </li>
            <li>razor is much better than the reflex action.</li>
            <li>The lift&#x27;n&#x27;cut feature is standard for Norelco and reasonably effective.</li>
            <li>Every 3 - 4 years or so, I buy a new electric razor, hoping that the technology will have improved enough to give me a good shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>Husband likes the shaver very much.  </li>
            <li>Oh, it&#x27;s competent enough.  </li>
            <li>First is the recharging operation.  </li>
            <li>When I first used this Norelco 1059X</li>
            <li>One of the advantages of the Braun was the much better handling of longer whiskers as the occasional 1-week-slump generates.</li>
            <li>Charges seem to last a good while, several shaves, including head shaves.    </li>
            <li>For the daily shave, the Arcitec 1059X is quite able to provide a reasonable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(travel charger/box is very convenient); the three heads can reach corners better because they are not laying on a flat plane but are \\&quot;caved in\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the color over every other color!</li>
            <li>will recommand another one,hope more man who real man have it,and you will full of confidence face everyday.</li>
            <li>and I usually go over my face twice to make sure I get a clean shave with no missed spots.  </li>
            <li>I wish this one had not sacrificed function for form so much...</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>If you have real whiskers don&#x27;t by it.</li>
            <li>the medium: shaves fairly well, but nothing better than the more traditional three-head Norelco series, actually, now with the three independent heads, you have to push a bit harder to make them run flat on your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely clean and ready for the next use.</li>
            <li>I also had to still clean out the shaving head even with the fluid running through the R1000.</li>
            <li>The Goldbox offer (half price) suckered me into buying this model, despite recently having happily switched away from Norelco to the Braun 360 Complete.</li>
            <li>I have had a couple of other Norelcos that did a decent job, but this one misses more than it cuts.</li>
            <li>If you pay full price you may need a second job</li>
            <li>Battery life is excellent and the charging stand has actual suction cups to make it easier to keep the base planted on the counter top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall mostly a cool design and quite functional for the daily chore.</li>
            <li>design may be the main reason to get this model as the shape and the cool display are likely to grace every bathroom.</li>
            <li>My older R***-brand, corded, 3-head razor shaves just as well.</li>
            <li>The design is attractive and flashy but it is over designed to the point</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to anyone wanting a new shaver.</li>
            <li>sent me a new shaver which turned into another piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Hoping that the hype of the new shaving heads resolved this issue, I eagerly tried out the Arcitec.</li>
            <li>And really classy looking!  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco shaver was 10 years old and still doing a decent job.</li>
            <li>My beard is less coarse than most and a tad sparse, which makes irritation a problem.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re big, obnoxious, and take up a lot of drawer or counter real estate.</li>
            <li>Out of habit, I packed the power cord and shaver as I always did with the old one.</li>
            <li>advice is to keep and eye out for a deal or wait until your old reliable shaver&lt;</li>
            <li>THIS SHAVER DOES SHAVE YOUR NECK CLOSER THAN THE OLD NORELCO SHAVERS DID.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still completely overwhelmed and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually care that much about what my shaver looks like.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come close to the old shaver performance.  </li>
            <li>I take my old norelco and shave while watching tv</li>
            <li>There just isn&#x27;t any room for cut whiskers in the tiny heads and where a heavy 1-day growth is a maybe a 2-day growth is way more than it can hold.</li>
            <li>The old one was quieter and gave me a great shave, but not the Arcitec, lousy shave!</li>
            <li>No simple snap-on like the older models, this has to slide, and you have to get it aligned just so</li>
            <li>2nd norelco shaver,they will get the job done, if you use electric shaver this one is high on the list</li>
            <li>Never really gives a consistent shave.  </li>
            <li>I have a normal growing facial hair.  </li>
            <li>As with any dry shaver I tried so far, it won&#x27;t match a wet blade, but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li>it got those missing hairs under my nose and after 5 months of using this, it still shaves very close as it flexes to the contour of your face very well.</li>
            <li>I can shave in about half the time I could with my old shaver &amp; this shaves much closer too!</li>
            <li>Overall it works, but the price is too high for what it actually does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco since I was old enough to shave as my Dad handed me his used one when I was 14.</li>
            <li>Also I think the little trimmer on the side is too little and mostly ineffective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Handling of the Arcitec is reasonable and style concerns certainly overrode function, but still to a subtle degree</li>
            <li>Now all that would be enough to take off a star or two, but there are a couple of other things that Norelco has really hosed on this thing.  </li>
            <li>It takes me twice as long to complete a shave.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re big, obnoxious, and take up a lot of drawer or counter real estate.</li>
            <li> Out of habit, I packed the power cord and shaver as I always did with the old one.</li>
            <li> advice is to keep and eye out for a deal or wait until your old reliable shaver&lt;</li>
            <li> THIS SHAVER DOES SHAVE YOUR NECK CLOSER THAN THE OLD NORELCO SHAVERS DID.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still completely overwhelmed and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually care that much about what my shaver looks like.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come close to the old shaver performance.  </li>
            <li> I take my old norelco and shave while watching tv</li>
            <li> There just isn&#x27;t any room for cut whiskers in the tiny heads and where a heavy 1-day growth is a maybe a 2-day growth is way more than it can hold.</li>
            <li> The old one was quieter and gave me a great shave, but not the Arcitec, lousy shave!</li>
            <li> No simple snap-on like the older models, this has to slide, and you have to get it aligned just so</li>
            <li> 2nd norelco shaver,they will get the job done, if you use electric shaver this one is high on the list</li>
            <li> Never really gives a consistent shave.  </li>
            <li> I have a normal growing facial hair.  </li>
            <li> As with any dry shaver I tried so far, it won&#x27;t match a wet blade, but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li> it got those missing hairs under my nose and after 5 months of using this, it still shaves very close as it flexes to the contour of your face very well.</li>
            <li> I can shave in about half the time I could with my old shaver &amp; this shaves much closer too!</li>
            <li> Overall it works, but the price is too high for what it actually does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco since I was old enough to shave as my Dad handed me his used one when I was 14.</li>
            <li> Also I think the little trimmer on the side is too little and mostly ineffective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Handling of the Arcitec is reasonable and style concerns certainly overrode function, but still to a subtle degree</li>
            <li> Now all that would be enough to take off a star or two, but there are a couple of other things that Norelco has really hosed on this thing.  </li>
            <li> It takes me twice as long to complete a shave.</li>
            <li> The three-track cutter heads make short work of a day or two&#x27;s worth of beard, but for some reason when the little guys get longer than that, you&#x27;re faced with quite a lot of work to mow &#x27;em all down.  </li>
            <li> For crying out loud, just give me a cord to plug in the shaver and into the wall!!</li>
            <li> The slim design looks nice, but is very difficult to hold.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly Long battery life between charges even though I want a close shave.  </li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t know why i have kept it this long.</li>
            <li> Then again, past that point, the Braun is a clear winner loosing only to a wet blade (again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe the motor is smaller due to the compact size of the razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the poorest excuse for an electric shaver I have ever saw!</li>
            <li> Once your facial hair gets a little too long</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I guess I am a bit disappointed that Norelco&#x27;s brand new design doesn&#x27;t solve the problem that seems to plague just about everybody - getting a clean shave below the jaw..    </li>
            <li> On the plus side, it DOES take care of those difficult concave facial surfaces pretty well.  </li>
            <li> or you risk dragging something hard over the sensitive cutter surface.    </li>
            <li> If you want a close shave buy something other than this</li>
            <li> shave daily, fairly tough beard, especially in the neck area.</li>
            <li> I priced this razor after I got it from Amazon and found it was substantially less at Amazon over Costco or any other stores.</li>
            <li> Then there&#x27;s the wide strip of real estate that surrounds each cutter that makes those buggers under your nose nearly unreachable without a serious attack on them while your nose suffers the collateral damage.  </li>
            <li> If you wait too long, with too much to mow, they&#x27;re going to fill up and stop cutting.  </li>
            <li> Even tapping the thing to dislodge the clippings is tricky since at least one of the doors will close and the contents will fall back into the cutter.  </li>
            <li> The LiOn power seems to run forever without slowing down.</li>
            <li> The shavings are not collected inside the shaver, but rain down on wherever you are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it one star less because of the packaging.</li>
            <li> it is actually less convenient to use.</li>
            <li> My previous electric was a Panasonic ES8068</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re less diligent with your shaving schedule</li>
            <li> This is not true.</li>
            <li> I find it very difficult to get a complete shave, there are always hairs left.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so firmly ensconced in plastic that it almost takes an act of God to get it out.</li>
            <li> No more walking around the house shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have found very few electric shavers that compare with a blade</li>
            <li> still do NOT like the stupid charging stand, especially when it is different for every model.</li>
            <li> The Norelco is also less irritating than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be amazed if I don&#x27;t break at least one of them within a year.</li>
            <li> The capacity to hold clippings is VERY small too.  </li>
            <li> The flashy crap just gives them an excuse to further increase their profit margin.</li>
            <li> The trimmeris difficult to deploy with the small recessed slide \\&quot;switch\\&quot; and its versatility is severely compromised by the cutter looming just over it.  </li>
            <li> Yep I was dumb for doing that</li>
            <li> However, the side-burn trimmer is very narrow, which makes it difficult to cut the side-burn evenly.  </li>
            <li> Opening each of the three fragile thin plastic head holders is irritating, difficult, and dirty since it&#x27;s impossible to do without clippings coating your fingers.</li>
            <li> the 1 review on this unis is a fake one this units has not been out yet</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s acceptable albeit not perfect.</li>
            <li> the bad: this razor runs very slow, the noise it makes gives you a feeling of struggle, even when fully charged.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about it.  </li>
            <li> BAD JOB</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for over 40 years and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this razor.</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> fake review !!!!</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest worst ever shaver ever made.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver I have owned in my 70+ years of shaving.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased the razor and it is in good working order.  I like the way it cuts my beard.  I have nothing bad to say about it.  I feel the price that I paid was a fair price.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat the price.  Husband likes the shaver very much.  Would recommend this product to anyone wanting a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is fine but I have to complain about the packaging. It&#x27;s so firmly ensconced in plastic that it almost takes an act of God to get it out. I&#x27;ve given it one star less because of the packaging. Also I think the little trimmer on the side is too little and mostly ineffective.</li>
            <li> user type: shave daily, fairly tough beard, especially in the neck area. Also shave head daily.    the good: easy to rinse clean, good accessories (travel charger/box is very convenient); the three heads can reach corners better because they are not laying on a flat plane but are \\&quot;caved in\\&quot; (but this can also be a problem, see below); very good \\&quot;on-sale\\&quot; price on Amazon;    the medium: shaves fairly well, but nothing better than the more traditional three-head Norelco series, actually, now with the three independent heads, you have to push a bit harder to make them run flat on your face. Charges seem to last a good while, several shaves, including head shaves.    the bad: this razor runs very slow, the noise it makes gives you a feeling of struggle, even when fully charged. (Actually, may be I have a defective unit?)    Overall it works, but the price is too high for what it actually does. My older R***-brand, corded, 3-head razor shaves just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lusted after this thing since it appeared on the market a couple of years ago. Amazon&#x27;s recent Gold Box deal on it made further sales resistance futile.  Wish I could get all enthusiastic about scoring a great piece of shaver technology at a great price, but sadly, the only great thing there was, was the price.  Oh, it&#x27;s competent enough.  The three-track cutter heads make short work of a day or two&#x27;s worth of beard, but for some reason when the little guys get longer than that, you&#x27;re faced with quite a lot of work to mow &#x27;em all down.  Then there&#x27;s the wide strip of real estate that surrounds each cutter that makes those buggers under your nose nearly unreachable without a serious attack on them while your nose suffers the collateral damage.  Now all that would be enough to take off a star or two, but there are a couple of other things that Norelco has really hosed on this thing.  First is the recharging operation.  For crying out loud, just give me a cord to plug in the shaver and into the wall!! No.  That&#x27;s too simple for Norelco.  They seem to have this inordinate fascination with stands and holders. There are two and you have to use one to charge the thing.  They&#x27;re big, obnoxious, and take up a lot of drawer or counter real estate. The \\&quot;travel holder\\&quot; is GIGANTIC and looks like a sex toy from the planet Zork. No one in their right mind would EVER pack this thing in a suitcase!  What were they thinking? Then there&#x27;s the cleaning. Opening each of the three fragile thin plastic head holders is irritating, difficult, and dirty since it&#x27;s impossible to do without clippings coating your fingers. I&#x27;ll be amazed if I don&#x27;t break at least one of them within a year. The capacity to hold clippings is VERY small too.  If you wait too long, with too much to mow, they&#x27;re going to fill up and stop cutting.  Even tapping the thing to dislodge the clippings is tricky since at least one of the doors will close and the contents will fall back into the cutter.  The trimmeris difficult to deploy with the small recessed slide \\&quot;switch\\&quot; and its versatility is severely compromised by the cutter looming just over it.  The head cover is fussy to install.  No simple snap-on like the older models, this has to slide, and you have to get it aligned just so or you risk dragging something hard over the sensitive cutter surface.    On the plus side, it DOES take care of those difficult concave facial surfaces pretty well.  The LiOn power seems to run forever without slowing down. It is light and reasonably easy to handle with its new form factor.</li>
            <li> My experience so far is that this razor has many great attributes EXCEPT power. It takes me twice as long to complete a shave. Maybe the motor is smaller due to the compact size of the razor. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have the James Bond shaver the 8000 model and this razor give me a closer shave.</li>
            <li> the 1 review on this unis is a fake one this units has not been out yet but the guy claims he is been using it for six months when the unit has not being in the market !!!! fake review !!!!</li>
            <li> I have found very few electric shavers that compare with a blade but this one is as close as I have found. It is also very easy to clean and comes with a stand up charger as well as a charging case. It is also very nice that Amazon had it on one of their one day specials so I also got a good deal on the price! Overall, I give the shaver an A-.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this razor. It looks great and like it would hug your face and give you a close shave. This is not true. I find it very difficult to get a complete shave, there are always hairs left. I had a norelco prior to this one and LOVED it. The old one was quieter and gave me a great shave, but not the Arcitec, lousy shave! I had intended to return it to Norelco under their 30 day guarantee, but forgot and missed the deadline. If you want a close shave buy something other than this</li>
            <li> 2nd norelco shaver,they will get the job done, if you use electric shaver this one is high on the list</li>
            <li> My wife bought me this Philips Norelco 1059X shaver last Christmas after complaining about my so called self cleaning Remington R1000 shaver. I can tell you that I always had issues getting the R1000 to shave under my nose well. I also had to still clean out the shaving head even with the fluid running through the R1000. The cheap China made pump motor died on the R1000 and Remington sent me a new shaver which turned into another piece of junk. When I first used this Norelco 1059X it got those missing hairs under my nose and after 5 months of using this, it still shaves very close as it flexes to the contour of your face very well. It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and handle while shaving. Cleaning this is one of the best things about it. You just flip up the 3 hinged shaving heads and rinse under the faucet. It&#x27;s extremely clean and ready for the next use. Even an indicator shows up above the digital battery life indicator to remind you to wash it out which by the way only takes 10 seconds if that.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco since I was old enough to shave as my Dad handed me his used one when I was 14. That was 40 years ago. Why I bought that Remington is beyond me.    Now here&#x27;s the best story I can tell you about this shaver. I took a trip to the Philippines back in March. Out of habit, I packed the power cord and shaver as I always did with the old one. I left without the charging stand (my unit came with two types). Yep I was dumb for doing that I thought but the stored energy on this thing allowed me to shave every day I was there without a charge the entire 22 days I was gone. And it still had a charge for another day or two after I returned from that trip. I&#x27;m telling you this has to be the world&#x27;s best Electric Shaver and it was purchased right here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> First the good news...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is much better than the reflex action. It is almost as good as a real blade but still not quite. I believe it may be the only head design that good on&lt;br /&gt;the market which is why I rated it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the not so good news...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a gold box special. If you pay full price you may need a second job&lt;br /&gt;for the privilege of shaving! It feels mucho cheesey when compared with the older&lt;br /&gt;razors. The design is attractive and flashy but it is over designed to the point&lt;br /&gt;that it is actually less convenient to use. My example would be that you must open&lt;br /&gt;each head individually to clean it and I wonder how many times this can be done before one of the heads breaks off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to keep and eye out for a deal or wait until your old reliable shaver&lt;br /&gt;fails and then bite the bullet. I am use to Norelco gouging me on the price of the&lt;br /&gt;heads but now they are gouging on the price of the razor as well. When buying remember it is the type of head the razor uses that matters. The flashy crap just gives them an excuse to further increase their profit margin.</li>
            <li> IT IS TRUE.  THIS SHAVER DOES SHAVE YOUR NECK CLOSER THAN THE OLD NORELCO SHAVERS DID.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Cuts very close, and the heads do move freely to deal with curves in my face.  However, the side-burn trimmer is very narrow, which makes it difficult to cut the side-burn evenly.  Also, since the side-burn trimmer is not at the same level as the shaving blades, the shaving blades obscure your view making it even more difficult to cut your side-burns evenly.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this for someone as a gift.  This makes an amazing gift,  really.  It&#x27;s really classy looking and beautiful.  The shaver comes with a travel charger/case and a plug,  and a stand,  and seems to work flawlessly on stubble and such.  Once your facial hair gets a little too long it doesn&#x27;t seem so good though.  Either way,  amazing shaver!  And really classy looking!  I&#x27;m loving the color over every other color!</li>
            <li> The biggest problem with this design is that if you have a heavy/fast growing beard is that you may have to stop and clean it mid-shave. There just isn&#x27;t any room for cut whiskers in the tiny heads and where a heavy 1-day growth is a maybe a 2-day growth is way more than it can hold. I think that may be why some people complain about the closeness and/or speed of the shave. It works really great until it loads up with fur and there is no room left for more. This is really a razor for those that have a light growth or shave twice a day cleaning it thoroughly each time.     Note to Norelco: Increase the cut whisker capacity in next year&#x27;s model.</li>
            <li> The electric razor of today is not like the one I tried 50 years ago. It is fast and gives you as good a shave as any \\&quot;Gillette\\&quot; and I do not get any nicks...Great for men on medications. It is easy to clean under running water and saves shaving time as well. Surprisingly Long battery life between charges even though I want a close shave.  No airport hassle with liquids or shaving cream as I buy powder shave block from Amazon. I priced this razor after I got it from Amazon and found it was substantially less at Amazon over Costco or any other stores.</li>
            <li> Every 3 - 4 years or so, I buy a new electric razor, hoping that the technology will have improved enough to give me a good shave without irritation. I still haven&#x27;t found one that will get all of the hairs below my jawline. My beard is less coarse than most and a tad sparse, which makes irritation a problem. I think it would be a great razor for someone with a coarser and denser beard than mine.    The Arcitec 1059 gives a good, comfortable shave with minimal irritation. My previous electric was a Panasonic ES8068 and I have compared the two side-by-side. The results are very similar - a good, clean shave everywhere except below the jaw, although the Norelco does a slightly better job there than the Panasonic. The Norelco is also less irritating than the Panasonic. Nonetheless, I guess I am a bit disappointed that Norelco&#x27;s brand new design doesn&#x27;t solve the problem that seems to plague just about everybody - getting a clean shave below the jaw..    So yes, it&#x27;s a very, very nice razor (not perfect), does a good job, is comfortable and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Goldbox offer (half price) suckered me into buying this model, despite recently having happily switched away from Norelco to the Braun 360 Complete. One of the advantages of the Braun was the much better handling of longer whiskers as the occasional 1-week-slump generates. Hoping that the hype of the new shaving heads resolved this issue, I eagerly tried out the Arcitec. It&#x27;s still completely overwhelmed and no competition for the Braun at all. For the daily shave, the Arcitec 1059X is quite able to provide a reasonable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design may be the main reason to get this model as the shape and the cool display are likely to grace every bathroom. It&#x27;s modernistic, yet understated. Yes, this is one of the best looking shavers on the market! The shaving head is fairly flexible and adapts to contours well, As with any dry shaver I tried so far, it won&#x27;t match a wet blade, but it&#x27;s not bad either. In fact, with restricting the whiskers to a one or two day length, the results are fairly comparable to the Braun 360 which so far yielded the best results for me. Then again, past that point, the Braun is a clear winner loosing only to a wet blade (again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handling of the Arcitec is reasonable and style concerns certainly overrode function, but still to a subtle degree that&#x27;s acceptable albeit not perfect. Battery life is excellent and the charging stand has actual suction cups to make it easier to keep the base planted on the counter top. There is also a travel case included which doubles as a charging cradle. (The power supply plugs into the case and contacts allow the razor to be charged when plugged in.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall mostly a cool design and quite functional for the daily chore. However, if you&#x27;re less diligent with your shaving schedule it&#x27;s hopelessly overwhelmed with the longer (and thicker) whiskers. The lift&#x27;n&#x27;cut feature is standard for Norelco and reasonably effective. However, it also irritates the skin a bit more.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift a year ago and couldn&#x27;t easily return it. I had an older Norelco that I liked a lot, so I was hopeful. Very, very disappointed.  1. The slim design looks nice, but is very difficult to hold. NEWS FLASH: men often have big hands.  2. The shavings are not collected inside the shaver, but rain down on wherever you are. No more walking around the house shaving.  3. The shaver is obligately battery powered, which means it is under-powered. Never really gives a consistent shave.  I don&#x27;t actually care that much about what my shaver looks like. I wish this one had not sacrificed function for form so much...</li>
            <li> My old Norelco shaver was 10 years old and still doing a decent job. I bought the Arcitec on sale thinking the swivel head would do even better. WRONG!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is the poorest excuse for an electric shaver I have ever saw! Doesn&#x27;t come close to the old shaver performance.  BAD JOB NORELCO!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for another brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. I can shave in about half the time I could with my old shaver &amp; this shaves much closer too! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for over 40 years and have never been disappointed. This shaver is very comfortable to hold, and does a good job of shaving, although I think the Norelco that I replaced with this one did the job a little quicker. I do like how easy it is to clean the 1059X. Over all I don&#x27;t regret purchasing the 1059X.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for over 15 years.  This is the cheapest worst ever shaver ever made.  It&#x27;s louder than a lawn mower.  The shave clippings fall all over you.  It takes me 30 minutes to shave.  I have a normal growing facial hair.  I don&#x27;t even get a 5 oclock shadow but it takes forever to shave.  I take my old norelco and shave while watching tv and I usually go over my face twice to make sure I get a clean shave with no missed spots.  With this one, I have to go over my face close to ten times and in front of a mirror because it just doesn&#x27;t cut.  It&#x27;s being returned!</li>
            <li> i have this six mnths and i don&#x27;t know why i have kept it this long. if you have anything more than a one day growth its useless</li>
            <li> Love the shave head on this range MUCH more than the 11xx and 12xx models, so I went back to this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still do NOT like the stupid charging stand, especially when it is different for every model.</li>
            <li> my friends recommand  it ,I like it,so nice work and beautifully .I will recommand another one,hope more man who real man have it,and you will full of confidence face everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver I have owned in my 70+ years of shaving. I have had a couple of other Norelcos that did a decent job, but this one misses more than it cuts. I kept it past the warranty date and still have it sitting on a shelf gathering dust which it does the best at. If you have real whiskers don&#x27;t by it.</li>
            <li> I found that the razor was very loud and the shave was not any better than the Norelco shaver I now own. Therefore, I returned the shaver to Amazon.</li>
