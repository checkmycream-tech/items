            <li>Have used now for 2 months and happy to finally get some relief for severe lichen sclerosis.</li>
            <li>i was sent a (free gift)and</li>
            <li>I did not find the product to be effective and was highly overpriced.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work</li>
            <li>It seemed to help me at first, but then seemed to aggravate more than help.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the Emuaid max as i have eczema</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no offensive odor and healing was very fast.  </li>
            <li>clean the area first</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I DO, THEN IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
            <li>At first use I knew I that I found help.</li>
            <li>THIS REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>After using for a couple of days I noticed that not only was it not getting better</li>
            <li>It may be effective on other conditions, but not on that one.</li>
            <li>Very smelly, but seems to work if used consistently</li>
            <li>Even the really inflamed bumps.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and not too much of an &amp;#34;antiseptic&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of money for something that doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really needed something to work for chronic, untreatable skin condition.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li>These provide much needed relief.  </li>
            <li>This really helped my daughter when she had shingles .  </li>
            <li>REALLY HELPS ALLEVIATE PAIN AND ITCH</li>
            <li>IF YOU ABSOLUTELY CANT AFFORD THIS PRODUCT THEN TRY AN OINTMENT CALLED CALMOSEPTINE.</li>
            <li>I have also used this cream on burns and other rashes with huge success.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered my new batch!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them both for Lichen Sclerosus.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that because it was pricey that it would work.  </li>
            <li>actually dried my skin out more.</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>You live and learn.</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD BUT VERY EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li>After using emuaidmax for about four days my symptoms were almost completely gone!  </li>
            <li>I wish I had thought to look for a smaller jar to try first.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still early to tell whether it will clear it</li>
            <li>Since it was all natural I did not even consider it.</li>
            <li>Could not use way to strong for harsh for me to use, switched to the reg blue container and found the same problem, my dr. wants me to stop use of Emuaid Max and Emuaid reg and Emuaid Moisture bar, could be just me</li>
            <li>now I actually feel normal</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the relief I&#x27;ve gotten from the &amp;#34;itching&amp;#34; and uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li>color is actually coming back to the white patches I am going to use the whole jar and just bought my second jar.</li>

            <li> No other products seemed to help, but within two weeks of occasional treatment, the dry patch is gone.</li>
            <li> MY SCARS OR WHITE ROUGH SPOTS HAVE DRAMATICALLY DIMINISHED WITHIN ONE MONTH.</li>
            <li> Seemed to help with itch but ringworm still taking long time to disappear.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long.  </li>
            <li> also used this on a patch of skin on my wrist that was extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was both products together, or the Retin-A, but the dermatologist seemed to be extremely surprised that all the bumps had cleared up by the follow up appointment.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but was willing to do anything!  </li>
            <li> It definitely has an odor to it, but I could&#x27;ve lived with that if it had helped - even a little.  </li>
            <li> It does not cure, but it removed most painful  and itchy symtoms.</li>
            <li> &amp; then you need only to apply a small amount ( just a film on your finger &amp; rub the affected area....</li>
            <li> NOT SURE IF INGREDIENTS IN THIS VERSION IS ANY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER VERSIONS OR NOT.</li>
            <li> I used both these products and in less than a month, they were ALL gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering for over a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Its very expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> the itching was driving me crazy, &amp; I was ready to try anything.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using just plain emu oil for years</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND BUYING IT IN THE SMALL JARS, NOT TUBES.</li>
            <li> As many of you with LS know, we can get a little desperate when in a flare :(</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this  works  , its  very expensive for 2 oz, we brought this thinking it would clear up skin condition lichen sclerousus ,like it states ,</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this, but was utterly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This was not effective.</li>
            <li> While expensive, a little dab will do it.  </li>
            <li> really bad  tried everything I was at my witts end after the 2nd week</li>
            <li> and they were just getting worse.  </li>
            <li> The product did nothing for my skin condition, if anything it made it worse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use steroids which thin the tissue.  </li>
            <li> In fact, for me, I believe it made matters worse.  </li>
            <li> and still i was suffering the pain so bad not able to use the  bathroom because my output of urine would always give me burns.i just received my jar and my dear God</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to get past the awful smell.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS PRICEY BUT FOR ANYONE THAT SUFFERS FROM LICHEN SCLEROSUS</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this to help treat my daughter&#x27;s Molluscum contagiosum. I had also taken her to the doctor and was prescribed Retin-A.  I used both these products and in less than a month, they were ALL gone.  Even the really inflamed bumps.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was both products together, or the Retin-A, but the dermatologist seemed to be extremely surprised that all the bumps had cleared up by the follow up appointment. We were able to dodge the cryo-therapy, which was my goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on a patch of skin on my wrist that was extremely dry.  No other products seemed to help, but within two weeks of occasional treatment, the dry patch is gone.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this  works  , its  very expensive for 2 oz, we brought this thinking it would clear up skin condition lichen sclerousus ,like it states ,been using it for couple weeks, im starting to think there a reason why it hasn&#x27;t been evaluated by the food and drug administration ,,  not to please at all &#x27;</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my Lichen Sclerosus.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD BUT VERY EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> Could not use way to strong for harsh for me to use, switched to the reg blue container and found the same problem, my dr. wants me to stop use of Emuaid Max and Emuaid reg and Emuaid Moisture bar, could be just me but it made my Lichen Sclerosus symptoms flare up!!!!!</li>
            <li> after suffering from anal itch for a year, &amp; trying everything....nobody seems to know what causes the problem.... i finally went on line in the hopes of finding a homeopathic way to get some relief. the itching was driving me crazy, &amp; I was ready to try anything.&lt;br /&gt;  the reviews I read gave me hope, so I bought the emuaid for severe lichen sclerosis, &amp; paid an xtra $10 for a speedy shipment. I experienced a 50% relief in a day or 2 &amp; after a week, most of my symptoms were gone!!&lt;br /&gt;  I used it after my morning shower, at bedtime, &amp; after bowel movements. i forget to use it some days because I don&#x27;t have a problem unless I go 4-5 days without an application. this stuff is a miracle!!&lt;br /&gt;  clean the area first &amp; then you need only to apply a small amount ( just a film on your finger &amp; rub the affected area....THAT&#x27;S IT!!&lt;br /&gt;if you are suffering with this problem, ORDER THIS NOW!! you will thank me for it.</li>
            <li> I have serve LS I havr been suffering for two decades i used everything there was and still i was suffering the pain so bad not able to use the  bathroom because my output of urine would always give me burns.i just received my jar and my dear God it helped ive been suffering for years. At first use I knew I that I found help. Its very expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> not a fan of the scent however if u can only use at night it does work well</li>
            <li> This cream has helped a bit for my eczema. It often helps with itch but it&#x27;s still early to tell whether it will clear it, I&#x27;ll let you know. It&#x27;s creamy and not too much of an &amp;#34;antiseptic&amp;#34; smell. But that&#x27;s the tea tree oil and there&#x27;s no way to avoid that.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work I had LS for years and I had it  really bad  tried everything I was at my witts end after the 2nd week it wasn&#x27;t getting better I said to myself I new this was too good to be true but I kept on using it then just going on the 3rd week it took a turn now I actually feel normal everything is gone color is actually coming back to the white patches I am going to use the whole jar and just bought my second jar. Thanks so much for this wonderful cream I am soooo happy I could cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again</li>
            <li> Used this product as directed, but it did not work!  In fact, the condition seemed to worsen.  Had high hopes for this, but was utterly disappointed.  I am returning for a refund.  Wish this had worked as advertised.  Avoid this product!</li>
            <li> It doing what t suppose to do. Thanks</li>
            <li> It did repair skin, but it did not help the lichen scoloris.  Odor is also a issue.  I wished it had done as promised.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible. It&#x27;s really hard to get past the awful smell. It has done nothing to relieve the lichen sclerosus. It may be effective on other conditions, but not on that one. It&#x27;s a lot of money for something that doesn&#x27;t really work. I say don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I have had lichen sclerosis for more than a decade, but it was never severe until about a year ago.  I have been using just plain emu oil for years so when I read about this product I tried it.  If you have lichen sclerosis you know there is no cure and the only recommended Dr treatment is steroids, which is only a temp fix, if it even works at all.  It was almost immediate relief from itching!  After using emuaidmax for about four days my symptoms were almost completely gone!  I have also used this cream on burns and other rashes with huge success.  It is also really good for mosquito bites.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter&#x27;s mollescum.  We battled it for almost two years, docs said wait it out and they were just getting worse.  I read reviews that it was amazing and saw results and eliminated them within weeks.  I was skeptical but was willing to do anything!  IT WORKED!  within days they were improving and two weeks to the day of starting they were scabs.  We applied each night before bed.  THIS REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Unpleasent smell, zero results. Really needed something to work for chronic, untreatable skin condition. Should have just tossed my money in the trash.  Don&#x27;t believe their hype.</li>
            <li> MY be to strong. had to reduce the dosage.</li>
            <li> Have used now for 2 months and happy to finally get some relief for severe lichen sclerosis. I have had to add some hydrocortisone cream to enhance effectiveness</li>
            <li> I have lichen sclerosis.  I started using this one year ago on my thighs and private areas. This product worked for me. Just ordered my new batch!</li>
            <li> The product did nothing for my skin condition, if anything it made it worse. You live and learn. Would not order again.</li>
            <li> Did not work...actually dried my skin out more.</li>
            <li> It seemed to help me at first, but then seemed to aggravate more than help. I wish I had thought to look for a smaller jar to try first.  As many of you with LS know, we can get a little desperate when in a flare :(</li>
            <li> This was not effective.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in the way it treated my lichens sclorosis. I also did not like the smell. I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me in so many ways. I am thrilled with the relief I&#x27;ve gotten from the &amp;#34;itching&amp;#34; and uncomfortable feeling. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> If you have been diagnosed with lichen sclerosus, please, please try this product!  While expensive, a little dab will do it.  I have been using Emuaid for 6 months and can tell that it has made a huge impact on my level of comfort.  I don&#x27;t have to use steroids which thin the tissue.  Not what we need.  This is the second jar I have bought; started with regular strength and then decided to buy the stronger formula.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> i was sent a (free gift)and was charged 119.97 for it and i did not want it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Emuaid max as i have eczema and i read all the reviews that showed great results. I even paid for 2 day shipping. After using for a couple of days I noticed that not only was it not getting better but  I broke out in a rash all over my torso!Actually had to go to urgent care and shorten our thanksgiving vacation ! There must be an ingredient I as allergic to. Since it was all natural I did not even consider it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.  I was hoping that it would help stop the itching.</li>
            <li> I did not find the product to be effective and was highly overpriced.</li>
            <li> Very smelly, but seems to work if used consistently</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for psoriasis.</li>
            <li> A really great product. Easy to use, no offensive odor and healing was very fast.  We&#x27;ll worth the money.  Would order again</li>
            <li> great stuff.. no noticealbe difference</li>
            <li> It helped quite a bit.  I haven&#x27;t been using it very long.  Hoping for better results.  I will probably buy another jar.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> After researching this product it is helping with a medical issue. Thankful I have found this product. Thank-You!</li>
            <li> Sooo happy I tried this. I got the soap too and I love them both.  I&#x27;ve been suffering for over a year and a half.  Steroid creams don&#x27;t solve the condition. These provide much needed relief.  I highly recommend them both for Lichen Sclerosus.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that because it was pricey that it would work.  It didn&#x27;t work at all.  In fact, for me, I believe it made matters worse.  It definitely has an odor to it, but I could&#x27;ve lived with that if it had helped - even a little.  It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> This really helped my daughter when she had shingles .  It relieved the pain. I  would order this again .</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS PRICEY BUT FOR ANYONE THAT SUFFERS FROM LICHEN SCLEROSUS LIKE I DO, THEN IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY. MY SCARS OR WHITE ROUGH SPOTS HAVE DRAMATICALLY DIMINISHED WITHIN ONE MONTH. REALLY HELPS ALLEVIATE PAIN AND ITCH TOO. IM NOT SURE IF INGREDIENTS IN THIS VERSION IS ANY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER VERSIONS OR NOT. WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW. IF YOU ABSOLUTELY CANT AFFORD THIS PRODUCT THEN TRY AN OINTMENT CALLED CALMOSEPTINE. IT HELPS WITH BURN AND ITCH PRETTY GOOD. CAN BUY IT AT MOST PHARMACIES BUT CHEAPER ON AMAZON. I RECOMMEND BUYING IT IN THE SMALL JARS, NOT TUBES. GOOD LUCK.</li>
            <li> My wife has used it for a week now and said she no improvement. I would love to be able to change this review.</li>
            <li> Seemed to help with itch but ringworm still taking long time to disappear. 3 months and counting.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work as the reviews said it would.</li>
            <li> the results were amazingly good. It does not cure, but it removed most painful  and itchy symtoms.But it was used only for a month. So I hope for the best.</li>
            <li> I loved this. Thank you.</li>
