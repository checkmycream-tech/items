            <li>Although it does seem to resemble some sort of torture device, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but after that is amazing!!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product, is excellent, it does a great job.</li>
            <li>and I loved it!</li>
            <li>It is corded which is great since it doesn&#x27;t eat up batteries, and should hold a charge so that it can be used cordless as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>have one  Remington razors and I m happy by the 4 years that it work with my ...</li>
            <li>and I love it!!</li>
            <li>Even though you can use the epilator wireless, you should plug it in while using it because it is not as good at removing the hair if it is unplugged.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the epilator.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I am loving it.</li>
            <li>Price and quality balance is nice.</li>
            <li>love the way it makes my leg feels and it get the job done when i need a good shave :-)</li>
            <li>I think this is a great epilator for a first time-er.</li>
            <li>But once you get used to it, it becomes more bearable and easier to use.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>it has many advantages:  1) do not hurt,  2)</li>
            <li>This epilator is like adviced, my legs, arm, under arm and my bikini area still silky for more than 3 weeks, it is  </li>
            <li>The problem is that this machine cuts many of my hairs, so 2 days after its use there are hair in my legs again...</li>
            <li>Much better than shaving.</li>
            <li>If you just want to use an epilator for hair removal without having to wax or shave, then I recommend finding an epilator that has more tweezer heads.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>i LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s probably one of the best choices I&#x27;ve made in a long time....</li>
            <li>does not get every hair but does pretty good</li>
            <li>Good shape and easy to use very convenient.  </li>
            <li>With Summer nearing I was dreading having to shave every day because my legs get irritated easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean (just pop out the head, and use the brush to get the extra hairs off) and does a great job at getting at stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it comes with a shaving head which is great for getting at those areas where you don&#x27;t necessarily want the hair removed by the root.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but I&#x27;ve never gotten the &amp;#34;hair free for up to 6 weeks&amp;#34; results, but I never got them with waxing either.</li>
            <li>, I got the Smooth and Silky)</li>
            <li>I bought it to use it as an epilator because I wanted having a smooth skin longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>I had a great epilator and it finally died.</li>
            <li>but for such a good price, I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to follow the directions, don&#x27;t get in a hurry, don&#x27;t use much pressure, and be patient.</li>
            <li>Not really the best on coarse hairs, but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>but it cut less hair than this one, so I was happy with that one.</li>
            <li>My first epilator, and the one I&#x27;ll stick to!</li>
            <li>I have to admit that the first time I used this product as an epilator I was clenching my teeth because of the burning sensation of hair being pulled from my leg!  </li>
            <li>it is realy a worth of your money.  </li>
            <li>This epilator is a worth of money, so that I bought two others for my two sisters as gifts.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job if you follow the directions VERY carefully and do not try to remove the hair all at once.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I got this new item at reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Once you get past te pain this is great for bikini area.</li>
            <li>It will most likely take a month or more to do the underarms completely the first time.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and the extra head for touch ups.</li>
            <li>The Remington EP-5000 Essentials Epilator was the first epilator I had ever tried</li>
            <li>First, you have to ship it yourself, insure it, and then you are charged a 15% \\&quot;restocking fee.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The face is OK if not done all at one time, Have not done over the upper lip yet.  </li>
            <li>Shave first with the shaving attachment.  </li>
            <li>It was the first time that I use this type of product and let me tell you girls</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li>When using this epilator I do have to pass over the area several times to make sure all of the hair is gone.</li>
            <li>What does come in is very light soft &amp; can&#x27;t be seen &amp; is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this for people willing to deal with some (at times a good deal of) pain but looking for long lasting results.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using an epilator and to be honest, I was a little nervous after seeing what it looked like upclose.  </li>
            <li>especially when epilating areas where really fine hair grows, so exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>And the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and hair grows back slower than shaving and no stubble.</li>
            <li>The hair on my legs does not grow much anymore.</li>
            <li>my hair grows FAST and it&#x27;s been over a week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this epilator for a good few months now, and I definitely recommend it!  </li>
            <li>had red skin and bumps right after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure higher-end epilators might do a better job, but this one definitely satisfies me - I don&#x27;t mind going back over an area slowly to catch any stragglers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The under arms are very sensitive and tricky.  </li>
            <li>And this is much more convenient because you can either charge it up and use it cordless, or you can use it with the cord (which I always end up having to do because I&#x27;m lazy and forget to charge it).  </li>
            <li>For the first year it grabbed all the hairs without cutting them, held a pretty long charge, and was easy to clean with the cleaning brush that was included with the package.</li>
            <li>Anyway the company, Factory Direct, said that Amazon had the products listed incorrectly and that they didn&#x27;t have and couldn&#x27;t send me the one I wanted (the Essentials</li>
            <li>I have tried the circular motions, I have tried doing the motions more slowly, but I always end up with some hairs to pluck anyway</li>
            <li>I have black corse hair on my legs that grows quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not typically what I&#x27;d call a wimp.</li>
            <li>surprisingly, epilating my underarms for the first time wasn&#x27;t as painful as doing my arms.  </li>
            <li>Remove some hair, come back a few days later and do some more.  </li>
            <li>I had assumed I would get at the most a mediocre razor since this is primarily sold as an epilator, but the razor attachment works better than other electric razors I have owned in the past (a much closer shave in less time).  </li>
            <li>It can be kinda tricky to clean, even with the little brush that comes with it, but if you take care of your product, it will definitely save you money in the end.  </li>
            <li>The only area that was too sensitive to epilate in my opinion, was my bikini line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To clean it, I now remove the head via the purple button, swish it through water and use a designated epilator cleaning toothbrush, then turn upside down to dry.</li>

            <li> Typically, my results last for around a week before I have to epilate again...</li>
            <li> First off, it took over a week to get here, then when I finally got it it was the wrong item.</li>
            <li> Even after I shave, you can still see tiny black dots where the hair is under the skin surface and by that evening, I can already feel the stubble.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I epilated my arms was very painful, I&#x27;m not going to lie, but after the first epilation, I could barely feel it at all.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend to depilate at night because your legs will get irritated and a little red.</li>
            <li> The only reason I took a star away is because the epilator seems to miss some hairs, so I will have random hairs left over even after spending extra time in those areas.  </li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t stand this policy, Amazon should sell items they sell and not from other distributors, this annoys me)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews that say that it hurts.  </li>
            <li> we I bought 4 Epilator from other Factory, to my wife, my sisters and sister law.</li>
            <li> It arrived before i expected!</li>
            <li> I have used other epilators with less pain.</li>
            <li> the first few times are the worst, especially on sensitive areas like the stomach and back.</li>
            <li> hurts like crazy at first, but removed hair well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pain does take a little getting used to -</li>
            <li> Wait a few days and repeat.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt at all, it&#x27;s just scary because the epilator is loud.</li>
            <li> The rubber \\&quot;grip\\&quot; looking part on the epilator head gets dirty and makes it difficult to clean the inside of the epilator where hair gets trapped</li>
            <li> They accept returns, but it&#x27;s pointless to return something.</li>
            <li> Then use the epilator very lightly on a very small area of the underarm.  </li>
            <li> seriously this thing could be used as a torture device.</li>
            <li> I wax without flinching, but seriously if I had any confidential information I&#x27;d probably have spilled it.</li>
            <li> It was less expensive than I was expecting to pay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very tedious and takes so long to epilate both legs.</li>
            <li> Have been working on them very slowly.  </li>
            <li> I am very upset and will be boycotting Amazon for a while because of the horrible service and no help from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The legs are the least painful and the easiest to do.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be wary of ingrown hairs when epilating -</li>
            <li> Come on ladies, it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> Bad Rates.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful at the beginning</li>
            <li> I feel like an idiot for buying this epilator.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> I hated the trimmer head that came with mine</li>
            <li> The trimmer piece is TERRIBLE!!</li>

            <li> My first epilator, and the one I&#x27;ll stick to! It&#x27;s easy to clean (just pop out the head, and use the brush to get the extra hairs off) and does a great job at getting at stubborn hairs. Not really the best on coarse hairs, but that&#x27;s fine by me. Additionally, it comes with a shaving head which is great for getting at those areas where you don&#x27;t necessarily want the hair removed by the root. I don&#x27;t know why, but I&#x27;ve never gotten the &amp;#34;hair free for up to 6 weeks&amp;#34; results, but I never got them with waxing either. Typically, my results last for around a week before I have to epilate again...but for such a good price, I won&#x27;t complain. I&#x27;m sure higher-end epilators might do a better job, but this one definitely satisfies me - I don&#x27;t mind going back over an area slowly to catch any stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;The pain does take a little getting used to - the first few times are the worst, especially on sensitive areas like the stomach and back. After a while, you do get used to it though, I promise!</li>
            <li> I am loving it. It is working so well...and I am so glad that I got this new item at reasonable price. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> With Summer nearing I was dreading having to shave every day because my legs get irritated easily.  Being Hispanic I have a lot of leg hair so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have seen a reduction on the amount of hair on my lower legs.  Of course you feel the pulls of the depilator when it pulls your hairs, but I take my time and it is not unbearable.  I find that I was able to depilate the front of my legs but not the back of my legs as it was too painful. I do recommend to depilate at night because your legs will get irritated and a little red. Love this product and the extra head for touch ups.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that the first time I used this product as an epilator I was clenching my teeth because of the burning sensation of hair being pulled from my leg!  But once you get used to it, it becomes more bearable and easier to use.  Also, the razor head is really great!  I had assumed I would get at the most a mediocre razor since this is primarily sold as an epilator, but the razor attachment works better than other electric razors I have owned in the past (a much closer shave in less time).  And this is much more convenient because you can either charge it up and use it cordless, or you can use it with the cord (which I always end up having to do because I&#x27;m lazy and forget to charge it).  The only reason I took a star away is because the epilator seems to miss some hairs, so I will have random hairs left over even after spending extra time in those areas.  I have tried the circular motions, I have tried doing the motions more slowly, but I always end up with some hairs to pluck anyway or I just use the razor attachment as \\&quot;back-up\\&quot; for leftover hairs; however, I still recommend this product for the lower cost, the convenience, and for the ease factor of having two head attachments for one product!</li>
            <li> If you have 25 dollars and want to buy an epilator. It is the best item. Price and quality balance is nice.</li>
            <li> The Remington EP-5000 Essentials Epilator was the first epilator I had ever tried and I loved it! It is corded which is great since it doesn&#x27;t eat up batteries, and should hold a charge so that it can be used cordless as well. For the first year it grabbed all the hairs without cutting them, held a pretty long charge, and was easy to clean with the cleaning brush that was included with the package. I hated the trimmer head that came with mine so I never used it. The trimmer still left stubble and would catch on the shortest hairs so I wouldn&#x27;t dream of using it on longer hairs (i.e arms). However after a year of ownership, it no longer holds a charge and is starting to cut the hair instead of grabbing it at the root. The rubber \\&quot;grip\\&quot; looking part on the epilator head gets dirty and makes it difficult to clean the inside of the epilator where hair gets trapped (I have lost the cleaning brush now). To clean it, I now remove the head via the purple button, swish it through water and use a designated epilator cleaning toothbrush, then turn upside down to dry. I think this is a great epilator for a first time-er. I&#x27;ve just outgrown it!</li>
            <li> I did not like the item and wanted to return it.It is not at all what i thought it would be. Epilator? I think not.You&#x27;re better off shaving or waxing. They accept returns, but it&#x27;s pointless to return something. First, you have to ship it yourself, insure it, and then you are charged a 15% \\&quot;restocking fee.\\&quot; Basically if i return the product I am getting nothing back. Do not bother buying from this seller. Find another to purchase from and check their return policy. I made the mistake of not checking ahead of time.</li>
            <li> First off, it took over a week to get here, then when I finally got it it was the wrong item. Amazon wouldn&#x27;t help because it was the company that was selling it that I needed to talk to. (I can&#x27;t stand this policy, Amazon should sell items they sell and not from other distributors, this annoys me) Anyway the company, Factory Direct, said that Amazon had the products listed incorrectly and that they didn&#x27;t have and couldn&#x27;t send me the one I wanted (the Essentials, I got the Smooth and Silky) so how did everyone else on this website get the correct item if they supposedly didn&#x27;t have any? The one I wanted was more expensive so I just asked for the difference and I could keep it and they wouldn&#x27;t do it! They went on to say that Amazon&#x27;s costs were different than their&#x27;s and that they&#x27;d rather have me send it back. That is the stupidest thing I&#x27;ve ever heard. I am very upset and will be boycotting Amazon for a while because of the horrible service and no help from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!!  Now I can stop thinking about how to afford lazer hair removal.  I have black corse hair on my legs that grows quickly.  Even after I shave, you can still see tiny black dots where the hair is under the skin surface and by that evening, I can already feel the stubble.  I&#x27;ve read the other reviews that say that it hurts.  Come on ladies, it&#x27;s not that bad. In my opinion, it&#x27;s tollerable and you&#x27;ll get over it after you see the results.  It&#x27;s great and I love it!!</li>
            <li> seriously this thing could be used as a torture device. I just got it and tried it this morning. Thank God, my youngest son, who was in the bathroom with me, can&#x27;t yet repeat the words that I yelled when I tried this thing. I have used other epilators with less pain. This one took tiny pinches of skin with it. I&#x27;m not typically what I&#x27;d call a wimp. I wax without flinching, but seriously if I had any confidential information I&#x27;d probably have spilled it. I have ice packs on both arm pits as I type trying to relieve the pain enough to get through the day. I feel like an idiot for buying this epilator. I&#x27;m gonna go back to shaving until they get laser hair removal for lighter hair.</li>
            <li> Years ago  we I bought 4 Epilator from other Factory, to my wife, my sisters and sister law. My wife working with that until she gift her Epilator, because it was coming one Remington Epilator .. Bad Rates. She says the Remington is deficient,  and she is looking her first epilator by Amazon again.&lt;br /&gt;I have one  Remington razors and I m happy by the 4 years that it work with my ... But this device was not  the same ...</li>
            <li> It is the perfect epilator with good price !!! it is realy a worth of your money.  it has many advantages:  1) do not hurt,  2) the tweeser get even the short hair,  3) corded and cordless use,  4) Good shape and easy to use very convenient.  Update  This epilator is like adviced, my legs, arm, under arm and my bikini area still silky for more than 3 weeks, it is  ***** epilator !!!!!  This epilator is a worth of money, so that I bought two others for my two sisters as gifts.  I recommand the seller and the product,</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the epilator.  I like not having stubble.  Never used and epilator before.  It does a good job if you follow the directions VERY carefully and do not try to remove the hair all at once.  Remove some hair, come back a few days later and do some more.  The legs are the least painful and the easiest to do.  The face is OK if not done all at one time, Have not done over the upper lip yet.  The under arms are very sensitive and tricky.  Have been working on them very slowly.  Shave first with the shaving attachment.  Then use the epilator very lightly on a very small area of the underarm.  Wait a few days and repeat. It will most likely take a month or more to do the underarms completely the first time.  I would recommend this product.  Just be sure to follow the directions, don&#x27;t get in a hurry, don&#x27;t use much pressure, and be patient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful at the beginning but after that is amazing!!  It was the first time that I use this type of product and let me tell you girls it&#x27;s word it!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, is excellent, it does a great job. I love it! And the shipping was really fast. It arrived before i expected!</li>
            <li> I bought it to use it as an epilator because I wanted having a smooth skin longer than shaving. The problem is that this machine cuts many of my hairs, so 2 days after its use there are hair in my legs again... I owned a silk epil duo before, and I had the same problem but it cut less hair than this one, so I was happy with that one. I don&#x27;t recommend this article for depilatory use.</li>
            <li> Much better than shaving. Ilove that Ican use with the cord plugged in. Once you get past te pain this is great for bikini area. Leaves skin smooth and hair grows back slower than shaving and no stubble.</li>
            <li> I have used a form of Epilator for 18 years. I have used a Remington Epilator for 10 years. The hair on my legs does not grow much anymore. What does come in is very light soft &amp; can&#x27;t be seen &amp; is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator. I&#x27;ve only waxed and shaved my legs. People were saying that it hurt to use the epilator. It does not hurt at all, it&#x27;s just scary because the epilator is loud. When using this epilator I do have to pass over the area several times to make sure all of the hair is gone. It&#x27;s very tedious and takes so long to epilate both legs. Even though you can use the epilator wireless, you should plug it in while using it because it is not as good at removing the hair if it is unplugged. Since it is so time consuming to do both legs I recommend this product for touch ups after waxing. If you just want to use an epilator for hair removal without having to wax or shave, then I recommend finding an epilator that has more tweezer heads.</li>
            <li> i love this product. i have never used an epilator before and it works wonders. hurts like crazy at first, but removed hair well. had red skin and bumps right after. but after using a healing lotion skin is softer than it&#x27;s ever been on my bikini line. my hair grows FAST and it&#x27;s been over a week and i have not had to shave, etc. i have never had that before. i will deal with the pain. i would recommend this for people willing to deal with some (at times a good deal of) pain but looking for long lasting results. i LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator for a good few months now, and I definitely recommend it!  This was my first time using an epilator and to be honest, I was a little nervous after seeing what it looked like upclose.  Although it does seem to resemble some sort of torture device, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I epilated my arms was very painful, I&#x27;m not going to lie, but after the first epilation, I could barely feel it at all.  I use this on my underarms now rather than shaving and it&#x27;s probably one of the best choices I&#x27;ve made in a long time....surprisingly, epilating my underarms for the first time wasn&#x27;t as painful as doing my arms.  I&#x27;ve also used this on my legs and face.  You do have to be wary of ingrown hairs when epilating - especially when epilating areas where really fine hair grows, so exfoliate.  The only area that was too sensitive to epilate in my opinion, was my bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it came with an extra head for shaving, though I&#x27;ve only used it once or twice.  It can be kinda tricky to clean, even with the little brush that comes with it, but if you take care of your product, it will definitely save you money in the end.  Would definitely recommend to family and friends.  :)</li>
            <li> I had a great epilator and it finally died. I decided to buy this one.  It was less expensive than I was expecting to pay and now I know why. It doesn&#x27;t work well. The trimmer piece is TERRIBLE!! I hate it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife.. She used it once and said that she will never use the epilator part again. She used it as a shaver on several occasions and it is rusty already. Ladies, please if you don&#x27;t want to torture yourselves- buy an electrical shaver.</li>
            <li> It hurt but I got use to it love the way it makes my leg feels and it get the job done when i need a good shave :-)</li>
            <li> does the job, i like the shape. does not get every hair but does pretty good</li>
