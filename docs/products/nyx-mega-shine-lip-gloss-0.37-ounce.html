            <li>I really love it :)</li>

            <li>It can look even better when put over lip concealer to get a truly nude effect.</li>
            <li>Overall an awesome gloss for the price range.</li>
            <li>I lOvE this lipgloss.</li>
            <li>does it again. :)</li>
            <li>I love the color of this lipgloss - not to overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet.</li>
            <li>cheap price, love the color</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone who is in the mood to feel sweet!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>, I like how easy it is to put on</li>
            <li>it is super shinny and smells like bubble gum, I love it</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy the color.</li>
            <li>but now I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>and it just looks incredibly fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love the color, it gives your lips just a bit of pop but not too much color</li>
            <li>I used it once and quickly removed it.  </li>
            <li>Sugar Pie is my new favorite</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and goes on my lip with a slight pinky color.</li>
            <li>You can wear it all day every day-it completes the look no matter what because it&#x27;s a great glossy nude with a lot of shine and a little shimmer.</li>
            <li>And will try some other colors!&lt;br /&gt;The texture is not sticky and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>But to top that off it tastes like old medicine.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite lip gloss.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>LOOKS GREAT WITH A LITTLE TAN !</li>
            <li>This was a color I was not sure about just seeing it online, but after I received it and put it on, It looks great.</li>
            <li>The result is a cool almost-silvery nude lip with intense  shine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great color that I&#x27;ve used before, however, it&#x27;s very sticky and the one I received leaks around the top especially if it warms up a little in your pocket or something and gets everywhere.</li>
            <li>I put this lipgloss overtop of my lipsticks and it looks amazing, when i want a more subtle look</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s a color that could work well on many different complexions and skin types.</li>
            <li>and sure enough it leaks all over again.</li>
            <li>This is the first Nyx Gloss I owe.</li>
            <li>Has a funny smel.</li>
            <li>Great color thick texture</li>
            <li>I probably would love it in a different color.</li>
            <li>the color is a light nude shimmer not too shimmery, it feels every soft not thick and not to tacky perfect over peach , pink or a dark nude lipstick</li>
            <li>CONS Very very sticky and very shiny.</li>
            <li>My major problem with the gloss is the smell/taste - very sickly sweet.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>very shiny</li>
            <li>5* FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>This is a very well made lip gloss</li>
            <li>It gives my lips a lovely nude pink effect</li>
            <li>I really like the color of this lipgloss.</li>
            <li>When you do big dramatic eyes, this is the perfect pairing to go with them!</li>
            <li>The only positive is that it was very inexpensive (perhaps my first clue)</li>
            <li>Not sticky, decent coverage.</li>
            <li>Would opt for a more flat lip product next time.  </li>
            <li>After I get a tan will probably look a little better because it is too close to skin color</li>
            <li>Overall though, it&#x27;s worth a shot to try.</li>
            <li>A friend bought me this lip gloss as a gift from my wishlist, and it is even better than I expected it to be, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li>Keeps lips soft and color lasts!</li>
            <li>Sheer enough to be able to layer, but enough color to wear alone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t stay on terribly long, but it&#x27;s nice for just giving my lips a little shimmer when I don&#x27;t feel like putting on full lipstick/makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you are sensitive to certain smells, this may not be for you because it has a definite sugary smell.</li>
            <li>Has replaced my old standby.</li>
            <li>and since I like the natural color so well plan to order again.</li>
            <li>Not as much when it&#x27;s on as when you open it, so that could make a difference.</li>
            <li>I have rosy lips, so this didn&#x27;t work too well for me as far as colour goes.</li>
            <li>I think it may be old.</li>
            <li>The color (sugar pie) is paler than expected, and I have to mix it with my other lip colors to make it look okay.</li>
            <li>Bought on a total whim looking for something new.</li>
            <li>very moist doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips!</li>
            <li>goes well with my cool toned very pale complexion brown hair and hazel eyes.  </li>
            <li>I wipe it down really well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super sticky but very lustrous when you look at it.</li>

            <li> This is a very well made lip gloss</li>
            <li> It gives my lips a lovely nude pink effect</li>
            <li> I really like the color of this lipgloss.</li>
            <li> When you do big dramatic eyes, this is the perfect pairing to go with them!</li>
            <li> The only positive is that it was very inexpensive (perhaps my first clue)</li>
            <li> Not sticky, decent coverage.</li>
            <li> Would opt for a more flat lip product next time.  </li>
            <li> After I get a tan will probably look a little better because it is too close to skin color</li>
            <li> Overall though, it&#x27;s worth a shot to try.</li>
            <li> A friend bought me this lip gloss as a gift from my wishlist, and it is even better than I expected it to be, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li> Keeps lips soft and color lasts!</li>
            <li> Sheer enough to be able to layer, but enough color to wear alone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t stay on terribly long, but it&#x27;s nice for just giving my lips a little shimmer when I don&#x27;t feel like putting on full lipstick/makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you are sensitive to certain smells, this may not be for you because it has a definite sugary smell.</li>
            <li> Has replaced my old standby.</li>
            <li> and since I like the natural color so well plan to order again.</li>
            <li> Not as much when it&#x27;s on as when you open it, so that could make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have rosy lips, so this didn&#x27;t work too well for me as far as colour goes.</li>
            <li> I think it may be old.</li>
            <li> The color (sugar pie) is paler than expected, and I have to mix it with my other lip colors to make it look okay.</li>
            <li> Bought on a total whim looking for something new.</li>
            <li> very moist doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips!</li>
            <li> goes well with my cool toned very pale complexion brown hair and hazel eyes.  </li>
            <li> I wipe it down really well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super sticky but very lustrous when you look at it.</li>
            <li> The color is a little to light for me (pale pink)</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time but needs to be reapplied occasionally like, every after 3 hours.</li>
            <li> This does not last long, however.</li>
            <li> Plus it stays a long time.</li>
            <li> My gloss was damage and very dry when I received it.</li>
            <li> The color I can accept with only a little bit difference from the website, but the smell and texture I do not like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like nude pink.</li>
            <li> lips are a dark pink and with the gloss over, the color payoff are of a nude baby pink.</li>
            <li> That is my only negative comment about it.</li>
            <li> I USE A LITTLE BIT OF SELF TANNER ON MY FACE/NECK TO MAKE THE LOOK</li>
            <li> I little bit lighter than I thought</li>
            <li> I compared the broken color to my Ulta one and the colors were totally different.</li>
            <li> everyday use Lip gloss</li>
            <li> but I guess my lips are too pale to pull it off, it just makes them paler and shinier</li>
            <li> which does nothing for my already pale skin tone.</li>
            <li> It had an odd smell and was thick and almost gooey.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to order lipgloss online</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have with it is that it is a little bit sticky/gummy, but not as bad as other glosses</li>
            <li> It feels like something heavily covered on your lips very uncomfortable, and the smell like nail polish, I won&#x27;t order it next time.</li>
            <li> Plus it stays on for a long time, and does not have a bad taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to go for all-out color on my lips</li>
            <li> I know everybody loves this lip gloss, but I wasn&#x27;t as crazy about it as I was expecting to be.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t feel too badly about wasting money.</li>
            <li> Worst mistake ever.</li>
            <li> smells awful.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst, products I have ever used.  </li>

            <li> Blah. I accidentally got two of these while purchasing. Worst mistake ever. It looks really gross on your lips. But to top that off it tastes like old medicine. I will never buy a NYX  cosmetic again.</li>
            <li> Great color, no smell, no taste, not sticky. Has replaced my old standby.</li>
            <li> I like this lip gloss, I mix it with different lipsticks but I really like it. It is my go to lip gloss when I need to add some shine. I really like this one, perfect for the summer.</li>
            <li> Love this gloss, it smells so good</li>
            <li> Beautifully matches my lips&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> This was a color I was not sure about just seeing it online, but after I received it and put it on, It looks great. It&#x27;s not sticky or gooey. It feels nice on my lips and it smell GREAT!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the color sugar pie.</li>
            <li> The color I can accept with only a little bit difference from the website, but the smell and texture I do not like. It feels like something heavily covered on your lips very uncomfortable, and the smell like nail polish, I won&#x27;t order it next time. I would rather go to walmart to buy lip gloss!</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is the perfect nude color. I wear it all the time! Love it! I will def buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss!!! The color is perfect very light and sheer. It goes on easy and lasts for hours. I will be repurchasing this product!!!</li>
            <li> Nice. CONS Very very sticky and very shiny. Would opt for a more flat lip product next time.  PROS Nice bright color . Excellent packaging. Shimmers. Great taste and smell.</li>
            <li> Color is ok but it&#x27;s so goopy and sticky I couldn&#x27;t wear it</li>
            <li> Love this color. It&#x27;s very natural. This is a good product it just doesn&#x27;t stay on quite as well as the L&#x27;Oreal Color Riche. It works well to prevent chapped lips and since I like the natural color so well plan to order again. I prefer this type of applicator to the slanted squeeze tube but they both apply the product well.</li>
            <li> I do like this shade and I think it&#x27;s a color that could work well on many different complexions and skin types. It&#x27;s not super moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t stay on terribly long, but it&#x27;s nice for just giving my lips a little shimmer when I don&#x27;t feel like putting on full lipstick/makeup. Also, nice that it comes in a two pack. I keep on in my handbag and one in my desk at work.</li>
            <li> Really Really Great lipgloss!!!!</li>
            <li> very shiny but i love this color</li>
            <li> I love love love this lip gloss!</li>
            <li> I chose this because of my wife, she love this kind of makeup,  I want her happy and I knew that she will be very happy with this, and I didn&#x27;t make a mistake&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> This looks just like it did online. The perfect baby lip. When you do big dramatic eyes, this is the perfect pairing to go with them!</li>
            <li> VERY NICE . I JUST LOVE THIS COLOR FOR THE SUMMER LOOK I WAS GOING FOR . LOOKS GREAT WITH A LITTLE TAN ! STAY OUT OF THE SUN LADIES . I USE A LITTLE BIT OF SELF TANNER ON MY FACE/NECK TO MAKE THE LOOK I WANTED FOR THIS LIP COLOR ... 5* FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great color that I&#x27;ve used before, however, it&#x27;s very sticky and the one I received leaks around the top especially if it warms up a little in your pocket or something and gets everywhere. I wipe it down really well and sure enough it leaks all over again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the color of the gloss. I pair it with MAC&#x27;S \\&quot;creme de nude\\&quot; and its amazing. I just don&#x27;t like the smell. It smells like liquid Tylenol.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made lip gloss it is super shinny and smells like bubble gum, I love it</li>
            <li> I love this lipgloss the color is a light nude shimmer not too shimmery, it feels every soft not thick and not to tacky perfect over peach , pink or a dark nude lipstick</li>
            <li> color is not flattering on me.</li>
            <li> This is the first Nyx Gloss I owe. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;If you like nude colors, this is the gloss for you. I love to use it on top of any nude lipstick or just alone on top of my lips.&lt;br /&gt;My lips are a dark pink and with the gloss over, the color payoff are of a nude baby pink. Definitely would recommend. And will try some other colors!&lt;br /&gt;The texture is not sticky and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love the color. Keeps lips soft and color lasts! I use some Chapstick before applying this. I noticed that helps to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lip gloss. I love NYX products, but this color is perfect. You can wear it all day every day-it completes the look no matter what because it&#x27;s a great glossy nude with a lot of shine and a little shimmer.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s one of the most pigmented glosses I have ever used. Plus it stays a long time. I&#x27;m afraid to go for all-out color on my lips so this is perfect. It gives my lips a lovely nude pink effect and I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I love the color but I guess my lips are too pale to pull it off, it just makes them paler and shinier which does nothing for my already pale skin tone. I will buy another deeper color by NYX though, I like how easy it is to put on and I like the way it feels. The bottle is also nice too, it seals good and you can feel it seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are sensitive to certain smells, this may not be for you because it has a definite sugary smell. Not as much when it&#x27;s on as when you open it, so that could make a difference. Overall though, it&#x27;s worth a shot to try.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price and it smells great too.  The color is a little to light for me (pale pink) so I gave it to my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> The con is that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and gross on your lips. I have rosy lips, so this didn&#x27;t work too well for me as far as colour goes. I&#x27;ll just have to get some lipstick to go with it.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly... love the color!! Bought on a total whim looking for something new. Sheer enough to be able to layer, but enough color to wear alone.</li>
            <li> I put this lipgloss overtop of my lipsticks and it looks amazing, when i want a more subtle look i use it on its own and it gives you a hint of colour really nice product</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. goes well with my cool toned very pale complexion brown hair and hazel eyes.  very moist doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips!</li>
            <li> Lovely color. Goes on smooth. Stays beautiful. I get many compliments on this color. Would purchase again. Thank you for this.</li>
            <li> I love the color and I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is not sticky at all I just wish it lasted longer on my lips. That is my only negative comment about it.</li>
            <li> I little bit lighter than I thought but I still love it. After I get a tan will probably look a little better because it is too close to skin color</li>
            <li> I think it may be old. The color isn&#x27;t what was advertised and I do not like the consistency. Has a funny smel.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite glosses.  The color goes with almost any lipstick but it can always be worn alone.  They smell wonderful and are no sticky.</li>
            <li> The color is awesome when applied over very light lip stain or tint. It&#x27;s like nude pink. It lasts a long time but needs to be reapplied occasionally like, every after 3 hours.</li>
            <li> cheap price, love the color</li>
            <li> Not sticky, decent coverage. This does not last long, however. It feels like satin, but it does have a cherry robitussin smell.</li>
            <li> Love the color . smells awful.</li>
            <li> Bottle cracked, all of the lipstick came out</li>
            <li> I bought this gloss and love the color. However shortly after I got it the bottle part broke. I went to Ulta (Cheaper than on here) and bought the same color (Sugar pie) When I got it from Ulta I thought the color was a bit different. I compared the broken color to my Ulta one and the colors were totally different.</li>
            <li> I really like the color of this lipgloss. It is a nude, but shimmery so it doesn&#x27;t look like your lips are coated. The only complaint I would have with it is that it is a little bit sticky/gummy, but not as bad as other glosses I&#x27;ve had and I really enjoy the color.</li>
            <li> My gloss was damage and very dry when I received it.The color is beautiful.I will go to the store next time to get it</li>
            <li> This is the perfect lip gloss for me. I wear it alone or over lipstick or lip stain and it looks wonderful! I love the smell and the texture. It&#x27;s not super sticky but very lustrous when you look at it. I love, love, love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love NYX lip gloss. Sugar Pie is my new favorite and I recommend it to anyone who is in the mood to feel sweet!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color! It&#x27;s my favorite shade of gloss! It&#x27;s like a nude with a hint of color and shine. Totally gorgeous on my skin!</li>
            <li> This gloss is not as sticky as most, which I like.  And it tastes good too!  I love the color, it gives your lips just a bit of pop but not too much color that&#x27;s it look overdone.</li>
            <li> Great color thick texture so you want to make sure you have a mirror handy so you know it spread evenly.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this lip gloss! The color, smell and even the packaging :)  I&#x27;m not going to lie though, the smell took a while to get used to but now I enjoy it. It&#x27;s very sweet.</li>
            <li> I like this lip gloss. I got the one named sugar pie. It has a great smell and goes on my lip with a slight pinky color. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Love this lip gloss. Its neutral and has great shine to it.Just wish it would stay on longer...but great over all</li>
            <li> I really love it :) I usually don&#x27;t like to order lipgloss online but I have it a try and it&#x27;s worth it it smells good it&#x27;s not nasty sticky and ya like I said it&#x27;s just awesome</li>
            <li> I know everybody loves this lip gloss, but I wasn&#x27;t as crazy about it as I was expecting to be. The color (sugar pie) is paler than expected, and I have to mix it with my other lip colors to make it look okay. It&#x27;s pretty long-lasting, which is nice, and it gives a beautiful, glossy finish. I probably would love it in a different color. My major problem with the gloss is the smell/taste - very sickly sweet. Yuck.</li>
            <li> A friend bought me this lip gloss as a gift from my wishlist, and it is even better than I expected it to be, especially for the price. The result is a cool almost-silvery nude lip with intense  shine and it just looks incredibly fantastic. It can look even better when put over lip concealer to get a truly nude effect. Overall an awesome gloss for the price range.</li>
            <li> It smells like cherries to me. I lOvE this lipgloss. It it a nude color with shine and shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I am medium skin tone(tan) so this is how it looks on me. I bought it at Ulta for $4.99.&lt;br /&gt;Nyx does it again. :)</li>
            <li> Wear it alone or over a lipstick, this is the perfect nude lip gloss. I will definitely be repurchasing this product. It&#x27;s not sticky at all and wears well... The only downfall to this product is the smell, reminds me of cough syrup. But I get past it because it&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this lipgloss - not to overwhelming. Plus it stays on for a long time, and does not have a bad taste.</li>
            <li> everyday use Lip gloss</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst, products I have ever used.  It had an odd smell and was thick and almost gooey.  The color was &amp;#34;bleh&amp;#34;.  I used it once and quickly removed it.  Then I threw it in the trash.  The only positive is that it was very inexpensive (perhaps my first clue) so I didn&#x27;t feel too badly about wasting money.</li>
