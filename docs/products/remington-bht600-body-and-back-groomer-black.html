    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The foil shaver worked perfectly on my face.</li>
            <li>: Works almost perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a great opportunity for an upgrade!</li>
            <li>This unit isn&#x27;t perfect, but it basically gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Its the perfect size for me (6&#x27;, 200 lbs)</li>
            <li>This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>The Remington is perfect for that because it gets a close trim, but not TOO close, so that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel any trauma.</li>
            <li>This shaver is awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three years, and it is the best body shaver for the money that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best products I ever used.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with this trimmer for a couple of months.</li>
            <li>I think that is very good customer service.   </li>
            <li>The shaver works completely great.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been nothing but happy with it.</li>
            <li>: Works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like this trimmer and use it happily.</li>
            <li>Maybe those who experienced problems didn&#x27;t have it fully charged?  </li>
            <li>I travel a great deal</li>
            <li>I thought the Extendable Handle worked well, allowing me to trim without strain, and the Vertical Trimmer (plus both Trimmer attachments) also worked great.    </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>One of the not so great things is the &#x27;extendable&#x27; part of it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor.</li>
            <li>Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li>This product worked great when it arrived.</li>
            <li>Great item for manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say, I don&#x27;t feel like going into great detail on my need and use for this product.</li>
            <li>its absolutely great</li>
            <li>The extender handle was great</li>
            <li>Great blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The BHT600 is also water proof, so that is very nice</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk!</li>
            <li>The attachments aren&#x27;t the greatest, but the unit itself works just fine, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>have yet to own a perfect trimmers but my Wahl is so much better.  </li>
            <li>Does a fair job when it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>The battery is good for one thorough shave say 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>The groomer is wireless, chargeable, and holds a good charge</li>
            <li>It has a good weight and sturdy feel.</li>
            <li>while it looks good it is not functional and does not let you reach the areas that need it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good trimmer, this is good.</li>
            <li>The groomer itself fits well in the hand, with good weight and balance, but feels like a drop to the floor would send it flying into a million pieces.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a good thing about the design though.  </li>
            <li>The shaver worked good</li>
            <li>This product is good for trimming body hair like the chest etc.</li>
            <li>Good item would recommend</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Good design</li>
            <li>runs fairly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product about 7 months ago and was happy with the results while using it, although I did think that it needed to hold a charge better.  </li>
            <li>Even if it had a better battery it is a great feature just in case your charge runs out when you are shaving.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the body groomer.  </li>
            <li>I own this one the mangroomer and the one by norelco</li>
            <li>He is deployed and needed a replacement for another body groomer, which he liked, but it stopped working.    </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t take forever to recharge, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to anyone, I will certainly be a more wise shopper after this.</li>
            <li>in all, though, a good product at an okay price.</li>
            <li>handy.  </li>
            <li>but I do like to keep neat and tidy and the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This groomer comes with a nice array of attachments and case, but it just doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li>This is a nice groomer.  </li>
            <li>and I liked how you could change the heads, but I wished the extended range was longer.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve seen some of his handy work via web chats and his clean shaven areas look great online.    </li>
            <li>This zipped them off with easy and with surprising control.  </li>
            <li>but if you wanted a real smooth shave the foil head does ok.</li>
            <li>When I bought it I thought this would have an adapter suitable for all voltages worldwide else</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>The first one was great.  </li>
            <li>so that was a very cheap move on the manufacture.  </li>
            <li>Except for the blade, the trimmer is very cheaply built.</li>
            <li>According to him, it&#x27;s easy to use, allows for close grooming, and has nice features.  </li>
            <li>you will need a razor, but this is good for a quick body shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent product by Remington.</li>
            <li>In about 5 minutes I was able to shave my armpit hair and hair below the waist with no problems.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it feels in my hand.</li>
            <li>Im satisfied by Shaver Outlet Inc prompt service.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for more than that on a goat though.</li>
            <li>Much more convenient that way.</li>
            <li>And you have to wait till it charges, mostly it lasts for 5-10minutes</li>
            <li>this cuts more like a 3mm with one of the attachments.  </li>
            <li>So if you travel, make sure you fully charge it before using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am pleased with this product&#x27;s ability to trim hair.  </li>
            <li>Its one of the only trimmers with a vertical head - awesome selling point!</li>
            <li>For the price point of this groomer I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
            <li>also have the Man Groomer and find that it works a lot better:</li>
            <li>The Remington does leave some prickles and while it is completely safe anywhere (yes, even those \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; areas)</li>
            <li>I like this trimmer but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>The head designed to shave the face doesn&#x27;t remove hair any better either.  </li>
            <li>ok was my fault....</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>However this shaver has turned into a dust collector for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t my favorite thing to do.</li>
            <li>Better yet, give me the Remington BHT600.</li>
            <li>Now I have to make sure it is charged before I use it ever time</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself was ok</li>
            <li>Like most people, I try things twice</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to use and great for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the exception of the battery issue on the older one, these trimmers are great.</li>
            <li>first one lasted me a good 5 years.</li>
            <li>I think the best parts of this product is how cheap it is, the different attachments, and the fact that you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the most versatile body groomer, and I think it cuts great.</li>
            <li>I can smooth it out pretty good with this.  </li>
            <li>best is that it has wet use ability.</li>
            <li>The shaver seems to still have good battery power and cuts hair but it makes so much noise and vibration</li>
            <li>It was also easy to adjust the trim length with the provided attachments.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery does keep going strong until it dies.</li>
            <li>The BHT600 keeps a strong pace until just before the end.</li>
            <li>would strongly advise against purchasing this product because of the lack of quality and longevity.</li>
            <li>Hands down best body tremor out there!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pure junk&amp;#34; !!!  </li>
            <li>Thus, I feel fairly qualified to review this new addition to the Body Grooming world, the BHT600 by Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cuts my hairs completely fine.</li>
            <li>It might work fine on a man&#x27;s legs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like this product a lot because it trims body hair, and I love ANYTHING that trims body hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for your first bodygroom, I&#x27;d suggest the Norelco I linked at the top, or the Epilator if you want wax-like results.  </li>
            <li>For a grooming device used mostly in the bathroom it needs some material modifications to prevent quick corrosion.  </li>
            <li>I think the arc in the unit makes it more useful and easy to minipulate from a distance.  </li>
            <li>Good but not as good as the previous model which had an extension handle.</li>
            <li>He said it was easy to use and performed great; he said, though, he could see why a man with a huge amount of back hair might have problems with this.    </li>
            <li>(it is a time-saving mobile tool which is important in his line of work)    - Voltage-wise, the charger works just fine in deployed locations (with plug adaptors)  </li>
            <li>The cheap plastic trimmer head that goes on this groomer does NOT stay in the setting you want.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It does not seem cheap at all</li>
            <li>It shipped (free) to me from amazon</li>
            <li>The handle is sturdy, and when extended it snaps in place securely.</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not too happy with the battery life on the internal battery of this shaver.</li>
            <li>So while this hasn&#x27;t eliminated the need to carry multiple devices - I&#x27;m happy to remove a couple of items from my go-bag and replace them with the Remington.</li>
            <li>It does not feel cheap to me.  </li>
            <li>The BHT600 comes with 5 primary trimming attachments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its extremely precise.</li>
            <li>It feels light and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Did not rate 5 stars because power supply was faulty, although I got in contact with the company and after explaining this they are sending me a replacement, free of charge.</li>
            <li>However, after a few months at best of infrequent use, it would not turn on.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap in your hands and the extendable feature is almost a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver is light and feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Comes with a nice case, seems to hold a decent charge, and well it cuts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that he uses this about once a week, and it&#x27;s been holding up great, even though we haven&#x27;t had it for too long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pressure him for more details about the usefullness of the accessories and its resilience to water, but reviewing products on amazon.com aren&#x27;t exactly a priority for deployed guys.</li>
            <li>Also, I would say that it is good primarily for trimming areas with light to moderate hair.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received my shaver in the mail</li>
            <li>When I had it charged up and used it for the first time it seemed okay.</li>
            <li>so I can clip, trim, shave and clean up my chest/</li>
            <li>and it helps me be groomed and clean.</li>
            <li>guess it works best if you have areas you want cleaned up but are not looking for very exact and precise results, especially if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all well and good to have a little travel pouch, but it&#x27;s not an ideal way to store the groomer and attachments on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>This thing worked great at first, and I only used it for body grooming and neckline stuff.</li>
            <li>Most of my life I&#x27;ve never been a very hairy person.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a low cost trimmer/shaver, that cuts good, and you can accept that it may not last for years, then the Remington BHT600 is a good choice for a man&#x27;s body groomer.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a low cost trimmer/shaver, that cuts good, and you can accept that it may not last for years, then the Remington BHT600 is a good choice for a man&#x27;s body groomer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another cool feature is that is stretches out, telescopes if you will.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Overall a good product</li>
            <li>so I looked every where for the exact same one since I had loved and had great service from it, &amp;#34; this is the same one</li>
            <li>I once had a similiar one of these, possibly an earlier model and loved it</li>
            <li>so the quality being \\&quot;very low\\&quot;, as described by others, is truthful.  </li>
            <li>The trimmers work great and are relatively safe for most parts of the body (have to be careful on the certain sensitive body part).  </li>
            <li>Nice that you can get it wet, but a longer handle would make it better.</li>
            <li>It does the job without discomfort, keeps me trim, and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>I can reach every inch of my back, and it gives a nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Received the shaver quickly.  </li>
            <li>(luckily I a Jacuzzi bath</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t give a 100% smooth shave, but pretty damn close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They shave pretty close and comfortable (closer than my Wahl).&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>The trimmer worked good in long hair.  </li>
            <li>As an all-purpose body groomer, this is probably a fine product, however, if you are getting something mostly for general face shaving or leg shaving, I would try something else.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully Remington&#x27;s new beard trimmer performs better than its body groomers.</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT , only thing i can find that i can shave my own back , dont need to gross the wife out now :)</li>
            <li>He was thrilled to receive it and likes it better than his previous body groomer  -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and sturdy, and does knock out the big manly hairs that many body groomers struggle with.  </li>
            <li>It could use some improvement but if you use the fine shaver you would almost have to use a blade to get much closer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the clipper worked well the shaving attachment didn&#x27;t really do the job on my fairly light beard.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t upset your skin if its more sensitive, but then again, it won&#x27;t give you the closest hair grooming</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly a big bucks premium razor, but for its purpose it gets the job done nice.</li>
            <li>The best way I like to use this groomer has ended up being actually giving myself rough hair cuts and grooming the rear end area of my dog (where stuff sticks to fur on the way out).</li>
            <li>Also the attachments are not as solid and sturdy as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>This is great as a trimmer but don&#x27;t expect it to give you a very close shave as this is only really a trimmer.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a groomer that offers a good cut and solid, lasting build quality, then there are better, more costly choices out there.to trim hair.  </li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a groomer that offers a good cut and solid, lasting build quality, then there are better, more costly choices out there.</li>
            <li>I contacted Remington Customer service I was given the run around and honestly talking about a body and back groomer with someone</li>
            <li>some that don&#x27;t work right (or seem ready to fall apart in my hands every time I used them) or are only good for one thing.    </li>
            <li>Also the battery life is not as good as other electric razors I have used.</li>
            <li>- Charged/working right out of the box  </li>
            <li>and I plugged it in right after using.</li>
            <li>but they were right..</li>
            <li>As a general groomer, the it has worked great, but I would not buy this just for the back extender feature in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The Remington is perfect for that because it gets a close trim, but not TOO close, so that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel any trauma.re or less only for trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li>However, the adapter is only suitable for 110v.</li>
            <li>But for Irish descent folk like me who have just a little bit of man scape-ing to do, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>you want a body groomer that doesn&#x27;t just shave the easy stuff like legs and arms, you also want one to take care of that sensitive \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; area.  </li>
            <li>Shaver Remington BHT-600 Body and Back Groomer has some really great features and several blades for all the parts of the body, and has rechargable battery.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The razor works well, and even though I am pretty flexible, shaving your own back isn&#x27;t very feasible.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable from this seller.</li>
            <li>I am very gentle with electronics</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t use this for his face, only for his body, but it enables him to do his \\&quot;man scaping\\&quot; relatively quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>When I first was considering buying this item, I came here on Amazon to see the reviews.</li>
            <li>The extender only adds about 3.5inches which I could understand isn&#x27;t the best if you aren&#x27;t flexible enough to reach your back.</li>
            <li>and I better get my money back.  </li>
            <li>I found something I truly liked; in fact the normal Detail Trimmer Attachment trimmed my facial hair</li>
            <li>so well my first thought was \\&quot;if</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has tried numerous trimmers in the past and find this one the best he has used.</li>
            <li>The device itself works great, but it just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>It is of much higher quality.    </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I ordered this groomer 6 months ago, only used it 2 or 3 times but not it doesn&#x27;t work any more, doesn&#x27;t charge or do anything.</li>
            <li>The not-so-good points are the basic uselessness of most of the attachments.</li>
            <li>After using this for over a month, the detail trimmer is the only attachment I use any more.</li>
            <li>The first thing i did was broke the clip that you press to extend the shaver, this happened while plugging in the charger.  </li>
            <li>First one...</li>
            <li>I should go get one more solid.    </li>
            <li>Returned after attempted first use.</li>
            <li>I get about 3/4 of my back trimmed, then recharge 30 more minutes to get about 2 minutes out it.</li>
            <li>and I proceeded to get it all setup for the first use.</li>
            <li>The first problem I encountered was when I went to plug it in to charge it</li>
            <li>When I first got it, it worked satisfactorily.</li>
            <li>Overall, it did an &#x27;ok&#x27; job</li>
            <li>maybe I got a bum product the first time.</li>
            <li>The attachment selection is fairly slim and while it does extend beyond a typical shaver it doesn&#x27;t really help that much.  </li>
            <li>I really hoped that this battery would last quite a bit more.</li>
            <li>He said it works great for facial shaving and other hair removal (above/below the belt)  -</li>
            <li>Unless guys are really really flexible their is no way that they will be able to reach there whole back with this thing.  </li>
            <li>The 3\\&quot; of extension you get when extending the handle is nice, but only worth it if you cant reach your back already.</li>
            <li>For $30 it was working fine and having the extension for trimming back hair was a nice touch I didn&#x27;t see in other shavers.  </li>
            <li>of the awesome features are the extendable handle and the fine cutting blades!</li>
            <li>This gives you just a few more inches, maybe half a foot at best, and really isn&#x27;t going to help you get to hard to reach places like more speciality devices would.    </li>
            <li>The blades cut well with no pulling, and charging it was easy enough.  </li>
            <li>I have to say up front that this Remington is a very decent, mid-grade product, that cuts hair just about as well as body groomers that are</li>
            <li>After a week of this temperamental behavior it gave out completely and refused to start, despite adequate charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li>The groomer does have multiple heads that attach and reattach easily.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t easy to groom the upper back with the vertical trimmer as I thought it would be; it just doesn&#x27;t cut trim very well, and it is easy to miss large areas with it.    </li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t feel like it is shaving close enough on the face and neck, and I tried it on my legs and my leg hair might be just too fine for it to do its job.  </li>
            <li>Also it really is not long enough, and honestly, the bend should be inverse since you want the trimmer part closer to skin, not farther.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a decent trimmer, give this one a try!one a try!</li>
            <li>It would be a nice, convenient little device if its battery did not die within 6 months.</li>
            <li>Blades are supposedly titanium infused, so they&#x27;ll last longer, and the whole thing is waterproof, so it can be used in the shower, etc, which is a huge benefit.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very meh about this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use all the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Beard/moustache</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>- Felt really durable and quality-made  - Looked</li>
            <li>The blue charging light at the power plug is nifty too.</li>
            <li>It runs straight out when you use the guard.  </li>
            <li>The foil shaver was comically inefficient, removing only a few hairs at most.</li>
            <li>That is definitely MUCH quicker, easier and the hair stays gone longer.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I will admit to literally just leaving it in the shower, and when needed, it is always ready to go.</li>
            <li>The attachments, especially the trimmer combs, just seem extremely cheap.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the Gillette body trimmer.</li>
            <li>so I try not to apply too much pressure so that I won&#x27;t snap the plastic.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s closest setting doesn&#x27;t trim very</li>
            <li>None of them shave hair very well.  </li>
            <li>went to Europe and didn&#x27;t realize the cheap wall adapter is only 110V, not multi voltage...</li>
            <li>but....it is highly unusual these days to have any wall transformer plug not be both 110/220 compatible.....</li>
            <li>I do not recommend them because they do not cut very well.</li>
            <li>This is even though the blue light was on</li>
            <li>If there were two hints I took from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy is that 1) always buy your shampoo and conditioner separately, not the 2-in-1 bottles, and 2) trim your body hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After you get the groomer unpacked you can tell that there isn&#x27;t much to it.  </li>
            <li>but thought they were trying to cut too much hair</li>
            <li>This one comes with a trimmer head much like a 2 or 3 inch comb that lays perpendicular to the device.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have much body hair to deal with.  </li>
            <li>but I did buy their replacement on Amazon (Wahl - which I like so much</li>
            <li>This model is great for me due to a 1.75&#x27;&#x27; wide foil shaver, which this was a main reason I got the in the first place.</li>
            <li>The detail trimmer was good at getting in rather close and did not require several passes like the other attachments did.</li>
            <li>The titanium infused steel blades have held up to a ton of use and that is better than I can say for other brands I have tried&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a decent job as a groomer, but the attachments don&#x27;t impress me much.    </li>
            <li>The good points about this trimmer are that it can be used wet or dry, and that it does not tug or pull hairs that it trims.</li>
            <li>Really the only good aspect of the groomer is that it is nice to trim the hair off my ears and trim my neck hair, or at least trim it down to where it is easier to shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>The length can extend a few extra inches, but I haven&#x27;t really found any good use for that yet.  </li>
            <li>using it in the shower has so far had no ill</li>
            <li>The price is okay but not worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I could only get one full shave before I needed to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>That may be fine for our distant evolutionary cousins, but for my money, I&#x27;ll take modern technology instead.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you are a beard wearer and want to keep it a certain length and don&#x27;t wish ot remove back hair, then this product might be useful.  </li>
            <li>It made for easy use and fairly wide swaths of hair removed.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent groomer.</li>
            <li>A more standard hair/beard trimmer, a smaller &#x27;groomer&#x27;, and a close &#x27;shaver&#x27;.    </li>
            <li>Now I have to charge it immediately before using (same morning) and it will not last more than about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>and because I thought Remington would be a decent product.</li>
            <li>Yes, you can reach more of the back area than a standard, non-extendable trimmer but you can&#x27;t get it all</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Remington BHT-600 for this purpose.    </li>
            <li>The product is also listed as a back groomer, and though I luckily do not have any back hair, even if the handle extends, I do not see anyone being able to actually being able to trim their own back with it and would need a second person to help them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a tight fit, and I would have preferred something more substantial to hold everything (including the instructions, which won&#x27;t fit in the little mesh bag along with the groomer and attachments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are a few things I would have done different with it, but overall it is a great trimmer</li>
            <li>and [[ASIN:B001E0C9LI Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional BodyGrooming System]], pluckers, and razors, waxes, Nairs, the whole works.  </li>
            <li>, I thought it might be worth the value, but in the end only one attachment is of any use to me.</li>
            <li>While not perfect the Remington BHT600 does a pretty good job.    </li>
            <li>the Foil Shaver works as well, I don&#x27;t even need my normal electric razor.\\&quot;      </li>
            <li>Maybe the other reviewers have titanium hairs growing out, but mine are normal and can be cut just fine.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to shave a large area with thick, coarse hair this probably is not going to do the job very efficiently or effectively.  </li>
            <li>With personal grooming I always use the guards, not wanting to suffer the sting of hundreds of tiny cuts, and the guards work fine.  </li>
            <li>Brand new and packaged</li>
            <li>My reason for needing a new one?  </li>
            <li>Doesnt work, not even with new batteries.</li>
            <li>(amazon can&#x27;t ship this particular item directly to APO addresses in some countries).  </li>
            <li>Okay removing unwanted back and body hair is not really something we want to talk about or admit to,</li>
            <li>With my older one, the battery started to go after 3-4 years and now it requires a charge after every use or two and frequently dies out while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>He recommends it only for those with a light to medium back hair.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I need something to trim my facial hair and thought the extender would be nice to get a few pesky backhairs.  </li>
            <li>The BHT600 lasts through shaving the sides of my head, but then runs out of power before I can get very far through my beard.</li>
            <li>The extendable handle does not extend very far, forcing the user to contort himself like he is in the yoga class from hell.  </li>
            <li>then, this is better than reaching with a small razor or a blade.</li>
            <li>Here are pros/cons based on my first impressions and his brief feedback:    PROs:  </li>
            <li>The detachable combs are too long and bulky to be useful.</li>
            <li>Using the detail and vertical trimmers without the guards works pretty well, and the naked blades do not nick or scratch the skin.</li>
            <li>Exact same circumstances, exact same issue.</li>
            <li>I have the same exact one I had bought years ago</li>
            <li>so you are left with funny looking patches of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not exactly excessive wear and tear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, shaving other areas of my body other than my face is a rather new thing for me.  </li>
            <li>The new one seems to have a better battery than my other one which I had bought at Kohls... who knows how long it was in the store.</li>
            <li>real stand-out characteristic of this groomer is the extending handle, which is supposed to make it easy for one to shave their back and possibly even legs, if one should so desire.  </li>
            <li>Love the extendable handle reaching hard to get to areas.  </li>
            <li>Remington is a manufacturer of some great products, but the BHT600 Body and Back Groomer really fails to meet expectations.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal unless you plan to travel with it a lot or really plan to store it in that pouch.     </li>
            <li>While the guard is combing sideways the razor is trying to the hairs straight up, instead of in the same direction as the comb.  </li>
            <li>Pissed off and do not waste your time and money.  </li>
            <li>Never waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;No problems reaching his back and shoulder blades thanks to the extendable arm.</li>
            <li>The extensible handle and reversible blade attachments offer a lot of flexibility, the handle extension is too short to make much of a difference, and the shape of the unit is straight enough to render the reversible attachments a moot point.</li>
            <li>I dropped the old one and it fell in a manner that bent the shearing blades.  </li>
            <li>i like the chaving action but this model did not have the extension arm attachment</li>
            <li>Completely ruined.</li>
            <li>It does not shave as close as a blade though so to completely remove hair</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I have been able to trim my back for a few years with it.</li>
            <li>While a few inches can be claimed as an extension it doesn&#x27;t really make the device anymore useful.</li>
            <li>Overall, this will give a good trim while leaving some hair behind so that men can still be men, and not boys.</li>
            <li>handle is not long enough, does&#x27;t cut properly, DONT RECOMMEND IT.Go to a decent shop and get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Also the ability to extend the razor to get back hair and other hard to reach places is great</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only extended the handle every couple of weeks when it was time to clean up the back hair, so it&#x27;s only been extended maybe 20 times.</li>
            <li>I use it regularly in my hair-removing schedule, but more or less only for trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations were lower than other reviewers, or I received a better unit - regardless, in comparison to other razors/shavers/trimmers I&#x27;ve used and/or owned...</li>
            <li>There are a couple different attachments, I prefer the Vertical Trimmer except it gets full of hair and have to constantly empty it.  </li>
            <li>The previous unit coroded quickly from storage in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The so called adjustable feature is a joke and on the lowest setting it barely even touched my longest body hair and completely missed all that I would normally trim with my Philips Norelco Trimmers which actually cut hair at 11 settings.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut very well and takes a long time.</li>
            <li>the clippers that came with it do not cut readily and I find myself making several passes when one was enough with the old one.</li>
            <li>This puppy makes grooming those hard to reach places easy so that you don&#x27;t have to bring a companion everywhere</li>
            <li>but the blades got dull and not cutting very well</li>
            <li>This Remington groomer worked very well for trimming my giant beard when I had it earlier this year.  </li>
            <li>Doing an &#x27;ok&#x27; job doesn&#x27;t really matter if the unit fails.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t quite fill any shaving needs for either one of us, but admittedly, we were both using it for something other than what it is exactly designed for.</li>
            <li>The mesh pouch it came with isn&#x27;t really big enough, but my first product came in a much bigger canvas bag</li>
            <li>My previous MB-10 ran on a pair of &#x27;AA&#x27; batteries and that pair of batteries has lasted me through multiple full trimmings.</li>
            <li>So, it does work on thick hair just fine.</li>
            <li>The back extender only extends the unit about four inches more, which is still hard to use in some places.</li>
            <li>The intent was for this to be used for general body trimming and hair touch-ups.</li>
            <li>, if I recall correctly, was too small to fit the groomer plus all the accessories at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too clear how he cleared the brush; all I did know was that his type of hair was enough to be noticeable without a shirt, but it wasn&#x27;t so dense as for him to resemble Cro-Magnon Man.     </li>
            <li>B003NCXXIS Mangroomer Sku 211-6 Professional Do-it-yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver]]</li>
            <li>It can (and will if you&#x27;re not careful) cut you and still not shave your stubble.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the professional Gillette trimmer in every way, as it feels solid and not like another piece of plastic in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Apparently, if you keep this plugged in after it is charged, it destroys the battery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not great but not terrible.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Remington BHT600 body groomer (~$37) for my fiance based on other reviewer comments and because it looked really sleek.  </li>
            <li>I ended up tossing in last night and going back to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>The power of the razor works fine for light growth, but he said he could see where it&#x27;d be bogged down if the hair growth was thick.</li>
            <li>I have another set of clippers, but it&#x27;s wider and so not good for precise trimming.  </li>
            <li>replacement for old one that lasted very long time ...</li>
            <li>the plastic and everything is the same but the motor barely turns on it, I had read reviews from others saying the same thing</li>
            <li>This probably would have killed the battery after a short period if, by some miracle, it did not fall apart first.  </li>
            <li>As far as the build quality of the groomer and the included accessories, I guess it comes down to that old adage</li>
            <li>As far as the build quality of the groomer and the included accessories, I guess it comes down to that old adage</li>
            <li>Naturally I was not very happy the first time it died mid-groom</li>
            <li>it have a long blade attachment for larger surface areas, great idea, bad design.</li>
            <li>The vertical comb cut some hair, but not consistently, and required several passes for a very rough trim that wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
            <li>The whole trimmer broke in half, dangling by the internal wires.</li>
            <li>The cutting heads all work pretty well, although the foil head is a little uncomfortable to use on the facial area because it vibrates more strongly than a regular facial razor and is much louder.</li>
            <li>I have to say that the handle is a little short for reaching really hard to reach places, but it is definitely better than no extension at all.  </li>
            <li>The extension of the shaver is such a useful feature since it can be hard to get the hairs on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li>Unlike my old barber, my current one does not take out the foam and straight razor for the back of my neck, so it gets a little rough back there.  </li>
            <li>There are good &amp; bad things about this</li>
            <li>In both of those areas, I will say unfortunately this Remington doesn&#x27;t match up with Norelco&#x27;s fantastic body groomer, which is so sensitive you can shave your balls while brushing your teeth, and get a close shave while you&#x27;re at it.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to only get worse and this morning I went to use it to clean up some hair around my beard when the whole thing literally broke in half and wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The foil shaver worked perfectly on my face.</li>
            <li> : Works almost perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a great opportunity for an upgrade!</li>

            <li> This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> The Remington is perfect for that because it gets a close trim, but not TOO close, so that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel any trauma.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three years, and it is the best body shaver for the money that I&#x27;ve had.</li>

            <li> : Works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like this trimmer and use it happily.</li>
            <li> Maybe those who experienced problems didn&#x27;t have it fully charged?  </li>
            <li> I travel a great deal</li>
            <li> I thought the Extendable Handle worked well, allowing me to trim without strain, and the Vertical Trimmer (plus both Trimmer attachments) also worked great.    </li>
            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> One of the not so great things is the &#x27;extendable&#x27; part of it.  </li>
            <li> This is a great razor.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> This product worked great when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Great item for manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say, I don&#x27;t feel like going into great detail on my need and use for this product.</li>
            <li> its absolutely great</li>
            <li> The extender handle was great</li>
            <li> Great blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The BHT600 is also water proof, so that is very nice</li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk!</li>
            <li> The attachments aren&#x27;t the greatest, but the unit itself works just fine, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> have yet to own a perfect trimmers but my Wahl is so much better.  </li>
            <li> Does a fair job when it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> The battery is good for one thorough shave say 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li> The groomer is wireless, chargeable, and holds a good charge</li>
            <li> It has a good weight and sturdy feel.</li>
            <li> while it looks good it is not functional and does not let you reach the areas that need it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good trimmer, this is good.</li>
            <li> The groomer itself fits well in the hand, with good weight and balance, but feels like a drop to the floor would send it flying into a million pieces.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a good thing about the design though.  </li>
            <li> The shaver worked good</li>
            <li> This product is good for trimming body hair like the chest etc.</li>
            <li> Good item would recommend</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> Good design</li>
            <li> runs fairly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 7 months ago and was happy with the results while using it, although I did think that it needed to hold a charge better.  </li>
            <li> Even if it had a better battery it is a great feature just in case your charge runs out when you are shaving.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the body groomer.  </li>
            <li> I own this one the mangroomer and the one by norelco</li>
            <li> He is deployed and needed a replacement for another body groomer, which he liked, but it stopped working.    </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t take forever to recharge, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone, I will certainly be a more wise shopper after this.</li>
            <li> in all, though, a good product at an okay price.</li>
            <li> handy.  </li>
            <li> but I do like to keep neat and tidy and the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This groomer comes with a nice array of attachments and case, but it just doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice groomer.  </li>
            <li> and I liked how you could change the heads, but I wished the extended range was longer.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve seen some of his handy work via web chats and his clean shaven areas look great online.    </li>
            <li> This zipped them off with easy and with surprising control.  </li>
            <li> but if you wanted a real smooth shave the foil head does ok.</li>
            <li> When I bought it I thought this would have an adapter suitable for all voltages worldwide else</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> The first one was great.  </li>
            <li> so that was a very cheap move on the manufacture.  </li>
            <li> Except for the blade, the trimmer is very cheaply built.</li>
            <li> According to him, it&#x27;s easy to use, allows for close grooming, and has nice features.  </li>
            <li> you will need a razor, but this is good for a quick body shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent product by Remington.</li>
            <li> In about 5 minutes I was able to shave my armpit hair and hair below the waist with no problems.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it feels in my hand.</li>
            <li> Im satisfied by Shaver Outlet Inc prompt service.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for more than that on a goat though.</li>
            <li> Much more convenient that way.</li>
            <li> And you have to wait till it charges, mostly it lasts for 5-10minutes</li>
            <li> this cuts more like a 3mm with one of the attachments.  </li>
            <li> So if you travel, make sure you fully charge it before using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this product&#x27;s ability to trim hair.  </li>
            <li> Its one of the only trimmers with a vertical head - awesome selling point!</li>
            <li> For the price point of this groomer I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
            <li> also have the Man Groomer and find that it works a lot better:</li>
            <li> The Remington does leave some prickles and while it is completely safe anywhere (yes, even those \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; areas)</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> The head designed to shave the face doesn&#x27;t remove hair any better either.  </li>
            <li> ok was my fault....</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> However this shaver has turned into a dust collector for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t my favorite thing to do.</li>
            <li> Better yet, give me the Remington BHT600.</li>
            <li> Now I have to make sure it is charged before I use it ever time</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself was ok</li>
            <li> Like most people, I try things twice</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to use and great for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the exception of the battery issue on the older one, these trimmers are great.</li>
            <li> first one lasted me a good 5 years.</li>
            <li> I think the best parts of this product is how cheap it is, the different attachments, and the fact that you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the most versatile body groomer, and I think it cuts great.</li>
            <li> I can smooth it out pretty good with this.  </li>
            <li> best is that it has wet use ability.</li>
            <li> The shaver seems to still have good battery power and cuts hair but it makes so much noise and vibration</li>
            <li> It was also easy to adjust the trim length with the provided attachments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery does keep going strong until it dies.</li>
            <li> The BHT600 keeps a strong pace until just before the end.</li>
            <li> would strongly advise against purchasing this product because of the lack of quality and longevity.</li>
            <li> Hands down best body tremor out there!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pure junk&amp;#34; !!!  </li>
            <li> Thus, I feel fairly qualified to review this new addition to the Body Grooming world, the BHT600 by Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts my hairs completely fine.</li>
            <li> It might work fine on a man&#x27;s legs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like this product a lot because it trims body hair, and I love ANYTHING that trims body hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for your first bodygroom, I&#x27;d suggest the Norelco I linked at the top, or the Epilator if you want wax-like results.  </li>
            <li> For a grooming device used mostly in the bathroom it needs some material modifications to prevent quick corrosion.  </li>
            <li> I think the arc in the unit makes it more useful and easy to minipulate from a distance.  </li>
            <li> Good but not as good as the previous model which had an extension handle.</li>
            <li> He said it was easy to use and performed great; he said, though, he could see why a man with a huge amount of back hair might have problems with this.    </li>
            <li> (it is a time-saving mobile tool which is important in his line of work)    - Voltage-wise, the charger works just fine in deployed locations (with plug adaptors)  </li>
            <li> The cheap plastic trimmer head that goes on this groomer does NOT stay in the setting you want.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It does not seem cheap at all</li>
            <li> It shipped (free) to me from amazon</li>
            <li> The handle is sturdy, and when extended it snaps in place securely.</li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not too happy with the battery life on the internal battery of this shaver.</li>
            <li> So while this hasn&#x27;t eliminated the need to carry multiple devices - I&#x27;m happy to remove a couple of items from my go-bag and replace them with the Remington.</li>
            <li> It does not feel cheap to me.  </li>
            <li> The BHT600 comes with 5 primary trimming attachments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its extremely precise.</li>
            <li> It feels light and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Did not rate 5 stars because power supply was faulty, although I got in contact with the company and after explaining this they are sending me a replacement, free of charge.</li>
            <li> However, after a few months at best of infrequent use, it would not turn on.</li>
            <li> It feels cheap in your hands and the extendable feature is almost a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver is light and feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Comes with a nice case, seems to hold a decent charge, and well it cuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that he uses this about once a week, and it&#x27;s been holding up great, even though we haven&#x27;t had it for too long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pressure him for more details about the usefullness of the accessories and its resilience to water, but reviewing products on amazon.com aren&#x27;t exactly a priority for deployed guys.</li>
            <li> Also, I would say that it is good primarily for trimming areas with light to moderate hair.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received my shaver in the mail</li>
            <li> When I had it charged up and used it for the first time it seemed okay.</li>
            <li> so I can clip, trim, shave and clean up my chest/</li>
            <li> and it helps me be groomed and clean.</li>
            <li> guess it works best if you have areas you want cleaned up but are not looking for very exact and precise results, especially if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all well and good to have a little travel pouch, but it&#x27;s not an ideal way to store the groomer and attachments on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This thing worked great at first, and I only used it for body grooming and neckline stuff.</li>
            <li> Most of my life I&#x27;ve never been a very hairy person.  </li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a low cost trimmer/shaver, that cuts good, and you can accept that it may not last for years, then the Remington BHT600 is a good choice for a man&#x27;s body groomer.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Another cool feature is that is stretches out, telescopes if you will.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Overall a good product</li>
            <li> so I looked every where for the exact same one since I had loved and had great service from it, &amp;#34; this is the same one</li>
            <li> I once had a similiar one of these, possibly an earlier model and loved it</li>
            <li> so the quality being \\&quot;very low\\&quot;, as described by others, is truthful.  </li>
            <li> The trimmers work great and are relatively safe for most parts of the body (have to be careful on the certain sensitive body part).  </li>
            <li> Nice that you can get it wet, but a longer handle would make it better.</li>
            <li> It does the job without discomfort, keeps me trim, and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> I can reach every inch of my back, and it gives a nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Received the shaver quickly.  </li>
            <li> (luckily I a Jacuzzi bath</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t give a 100% smooth shave, but pretty damn close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They shave pretty close and comfortable (closer than my Wahl).&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked good in long hair.  </li>
            <li> As an all-purpose body groomer, this is probably a fine product, however, if you are getting something mostly for general face shaving or leg shaving, I would try something else.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully Remington&#x27;s new beard trimmer performs better than its body groomers.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT , only thing i can find that i can shave my own back , dont need to gross the wife out now :)</li>
            <li> He was thrilled to receive it and likes it better than his previous body groomer  -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and sturdy, and does knock out the big manly hairs that many body groomers struggle with.  </li>
            <li> It could use some improvement but if you use the fine shaver you would almost have to use a blade to get much closer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the clipper worked well the shaving attachment didn&#x27;t really do the job on my fairly light beard.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t upset your skin if its more sensitive, but then again, it won&#x27;t give you the closest hair grooming</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly a big bucks premium razor, but for its purpose it gets the job done nice.</li>
            <li> The best way I like to use this groomer has ended up being actually giving myself rough hair cuts and grooming the rear end area of my dog (where stuff sticks to fur on the way out).</li>
            <li> Also the attachments are not as solid and sturdy as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> This is great as a trimmer but don&#x27;t expect it to give you a very close shave as this is only really a trimmer.</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for a groomer that offers a good cut and solid, lasting build quality, then there are better, more costly choices out there.to trim hair.  </li>
            <li> But if you are looking for a groomer that offers a good cut and solid, lasting build quality, then there are better, more costly choices out there.</li>
            <li> I contacted Remington Customer service I was given the run around and honestly talking about a body and back groomer with someone</li>
            <li> some that don&#x27;t work right (or seem ready to fall apart in my hands every time I used them) or are only good for one thing.    </li>
            <li> Also the battery life is not as good as other electric razors I have used.</li>
            <li> - Charged/working right out of the box  </li>
            <li> and I plugged it in right after using.</li>
            <li> but they were right..</li>
            <li> As a general groomer, the it has worked great, but I would not buy this just for the back extender feature in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The Remington is perfect for that because it gets a close trim, but not TOO close, so that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel any trauma.re or less only for trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li> However, the adapter is only suitable for 110v.</li>
            <li> But for Irish descent folk like me who have just a little bit of man scape-ing to do, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> you want a body groomer that doesn&#x27;t just shave the easy stuff like legs and arms, you also want one to take care of that sensitive \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; area.  </li>
            <li> Shaver Remington BHT-600 Body and Back Groomer has some really great features and several blades for all the parts of the body, and has rechargable battery.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The razor works well, and even though I am pretty flexible, shaving your own back isn&#x27;t very feasible.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable from this seller.</li>
            <li> I am very gentle with electronics</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t use this for his face, only for his body, but it enables him to do his \\&quot;man scaping\\&quot; relatively quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> When I first was considering buying this item, I came here on Amazon to see the reviews.</li>
            <li> The extender only adds about 3.5inches which I could understand isn&#x27;t the best if you aren&#x27;t flexible enough to reach your back.</li>
            <li> and I better get my money back.  </li>
            <li> I found something I truly liked; in fact the normal Detail Trimmer Attachment trimmed my facial hair</li>
            <li> so well my first thought was \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has tried numerous trimmers in the past and find this one the best he has used.</li>
            <li> The device itself works great, but it just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It is of much higher quality.    </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I ordered this groomer 6 months ago, only used it 2 or 3 times but not it doesn&#x27;t work any more, doesn&#x27;t charge or do anything.</li>
            <li> The not-so-good points are the basic uselessness of most of the attachments.</li>
            <li> After using this for over a month, the detail trimmer is the only attachment I use any more.</li>
            <li> The first thing i did was broke the clip that you press to extend the shaver, this happened while plugging in the charger.  </li>
            <li> First one...</li>
            <li> I should go get one more solid.    </li>
            <li> Returned after attempted first use.</li>
            <li> I get about 3/4 of my back trimmed, then recharge 30 more minutes to get about 2 minutes out it.</li>
            <li> and I proceeded to get it all setup for the first use.</li>
            <li> The first problem I encountered was when I went to plug it in to charge it</li>
            <li> When I first got it, it worked satisfactorily.</li>
            <li> Overall, it did an &#x27;ok&#x27; job</li>
            <li> maybe I got a bum product the first time.</li>
            <li> The attachment selection is fairly slim and while it does extend beyond a typical shaver it doesn&#x27;t really help that much.  </li>
            <li> I really hoped that this battery would last quite a bit more.</li>
            <li> He said it works great for facial shaving and other hair removal (above/below the belt)  -</li>
            <li> Unless guys are really really flexible their is no way that they will be able to reach there whole back with this thing.  </li>
            <li> The 3\\&quot; of extension you get when extending the handle is nice, but only worth it if you cant reach your back already.</li>
            <li> For $30 it was working fine and having the extension for trimming back hair was a nice touch I didn&#x27;t see in other shavers.  </li>
            <li> of the awesome features are the extendable handle and the fine cutting blades!</li>
            <li> This gives you just a few more inches, maybe half a foot at best, and really isn&#x27;t going to help you get to hard to reach places like more speciality devices would.    </li>
            <li> The blades cut well with no pulling, and charging it was easy enough.  </li>
            <li> I have to say up front that this Remington is a very decent, mid-grade product, that cuts hair just about as well as body groomers that are</li>
            <li> After a week of this temperamental behavior it gave out completely and refused to start, despite adequate charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li> The groomer does have multiple heads that attach and reattach easily.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t easy to groom the upper back with the vertical trimmer as I thought it would be; it just doesn&#x27;t cut trim very well, and it is easy to miss large areas with it.    </li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t feel like it is shaving close enough on the face and neck, and I tried it on my legs and my leg hair might be just too fine for it to do its job.  </li>
            <li> Also it really is not long enough, and honestly, the bend should be inverse since you want the trimmer part closer to skin, not farther.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a decent trimmer, give this one a try!one a try!</li>
            <li> It would be a nice, convenient little device if its battery did not die within 6 months.</li>
            <li> Blades are supposedly titanium infused, so they&#x27;ll last longer, and the whole thing is waterproof, so it can be used in the shower, etc, which is a huge benefit.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very meh about this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use all the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Beard/moustache</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> - Felt really durable and quality-made  - Looked</li>
            <li> The blue charging light at the power plug is nifty too.</li>
            <li> It runs straight out when you use the guard.  </li>
            <li> The foil shaver was comically inefficient, removing only a few hairs at most.</li>
            <li> That is definitely MUCH quicker, easier and the hair stays gone longer.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I will admit to literally just leaving it in the shower, and when needed, it is always ready to go.</li>
            <li> The attachments, especially the trimmer combs, just seem extremely cheap.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the Gillette body trimmer.</li>
            <li> so I try not to apply too much pressure so that I won&#x27;t snap the plastic.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s closest setting doesn&#x27;t trim very</li>
            <li> None of them shave hair very well.  </li>
            <li> went to Europe and didn&#x27;t realize the cheap wall adapter is only 110V, not multi voltage...</li>
            <li> but....it is highly unusual these days to have any wall transformer plug not be both 110/220 compatible.....</li>
            <li> I do not recommend them because they do not cut very well.</li>
            <li> This is even though the blue light was on</li>
            <li> If there were two hints I took from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy is that 1) always buy your shampoo and conditioner separately, not the 2-in-1 bottles, and 2) trim your body hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After you get the groomer unpacked you can tell that there isn&#x27;t much to it.  </li>
            <li> but thought they were trying to cut too much hair</li>
            <li> This one comes with a trimmer head much like a 2 or 3 inch comb that lays perpendicular to the device.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have much body hair to deal with.  </li>
            <li> but I did buy their replacement on Amazon (Wahl - which I like so much</li>
            <li> This model is great for me due to a 1.75&#x27;&#x27; wide foil shaver, which this was a main reason I got the in the first place.</li>
            <li> The detail trimmer was good at getting in rather close and did not require several passes like the other attachments did.</li>
            <li> The titanium infused steel blades have held up to a ton of use and that is better than I can say for other brands I have tried&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a decent job as a groomer, but the attachments don&#x27;t impress me much.    </li>
            <li> The good points about this trimmer are that it can be used wet or dry, and that it does not tug or pull hairs that it trims.</li>
            <li> Really the only good aspect of the groomer is that it is nice to trim the hair off my ears and trim my neck hair, or at least trim it down to where it is easier to shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> The length can extend a few extra inches, but I haven&#x27;t really found any good use for that yet.  </li>
            <li> using it in the shower has so far had no ill</li>
            <li> The price is okay but not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I could only get one full shave before I needed to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> That may be fine for our distant evolutionary cousins, but for my money, I&#x27;ll take modern technology instead.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you are a beard wearer and want to keep it a certain length and don&#x27;t wish ot remove back hair, then this product might be useful.  </li>
            <li> It made for easy use and fairly wide swaths of hair removed.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent groomer.</li>
            <li> A more standard hair/beard trimmer, a smaller &#x27;groomer&#x27;, and a close &#x27;shaver&#x27;.    </li>
            <li> Now I have to charge it immediately before using (same morning) and it will not last more than about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> and because I thought Remington would be a decent product.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can reach more of the back area than a standard, non-extendable trimmer but you can&#x27;t get it all</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Remington BHT-600 for this purpose.    </li>
            <li> The product is also listed as a back groomer, and though I luckily do not have any back hair, even if the handle extends, I do not see anyone being able to actually being able to trim their own back with it and would need a second person to help them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a tight fit, and I would have preferred something more substantial to hold everything (including the instructions, which won&#x27;t fit in the little mesh bag along with the groomer and attachments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are a few things I would have done different with it, but overall it is a great trimmer</li>
            <li> and [[ASIN:B001E0C9LI Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional BodyGrooming System]], pluckers, and razors, waxes, Nairs, the whole works.  </li>
            <li> , I thought it might be worth the value, but in the end only one attachment is of any use to me.</li>
            <li> While not perfect the Remington BHT600 does a pretty good job.    </li>
            <li> the Foil Shaver works as well, I don&#x27;t even need my normal electric razor.\\&quot;      </li>
            <li> Maybe the other reviewers have titanium hairs growing out, but mine are normal and can be cut just fine.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to shave a large area with thick, coarse hair this probably is not going to do the job very efficiently or effectively.  </li>
            <li> With personal grooming I always use the guards, not wanting to suffer the sting of hundreds of tiny cuts, and the guards work fine.  </li>
            <li> Brand new and packaged</li>
            <li> My reason for needing a new one?  </li>
            <li> Doesnt work, not even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> (amazon can&#x27;t ship this particular item directly to APO addresses in some countries).  </li>
            <li> Okay removing unwanted back and body hair is not really something we want to talk about or admit to,</li>
            <li> With my older one, the battery started to go after 3-4 years and now it requires a charge after every use or two and frequently dies out while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> He recommends it only for those with a light to medium back hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I need something to trim my facial hair and thought the extender would be nice to get a few pesky backhairs.  </li>
            <li> The BHT600 lasts through shaving the sides of my head, but then runs out of power before I can get very far through my beard.</li>
            <li> The extendable handle does not extend very far, forcing the user to contort himself like he is in the yoga class from hell.  </li>
            <li> then, this is better than reaching with a small razor or a blade.</li>
            <li> Here are pros/cons based on my first impressions and his brief feedback:    PROs:  </li>
            <li> The detachable combs are too long and bulky to be useful.</li>
            <li> Using the detail and vertical trimmers without the guards works pretty well, and the naked blades do not nick or scratch the skin.</li>
            <li> Exact same circumstances, exact same issue.</li>
            <li> I have the same exact one I had bought years ago</li>
            <li> so you are left with funny looking patches of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not exactly excessive wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, shaving other areas of my body other than my face is a rather new thing for me.  </li>
            <li> The new one seems to have a better battery than my other one which I had bought at Kohls... who knows how long it was in the store.</li>
            <li> real stand-out characteristic of this groomer is the extending handle, which is supposed to make it easy for one to shave their back and possibly even legs, if one should so desire.  </li>
            <li> Love the extendable handle reaching hard to get to areas.  </li>
            <li> Remington is a manufacturer of some great products, but the BHT600 Body and Back Groomer really fails to meet expectations.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal unless you plan to travel with it a lot or really plan to store it in that pouch.     </li>
            <li> While the guard is combing sideways the razor is trying to the hairs straight up, instead of in the same direction as the comb.  </li>
            <li> Pissed off and do not waste your time and money.  </li>
            <li> Never waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No problems reaching his back and shoulder blades thanks to the extendable arm.</li>
            <li> The extensible handle and reversible blade attachments offer a lot of flexibility, the handle extension is too short to make much of a difference, and the shape of the unit is straight enough to render the reversible attachments a moot point.</li>
            <li> I dropped the old one and it fell in a manner that bent the shearing blades.  </li>
            <li> i like the chaving action but this model did not have the extension arm attachment</li>
            <li> Completely ruined.</li>
            <li> It does not shave as close as a blade though so to completely remove hair</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I have been able to trim my back for a few years with it.</li>
            <li> While a few inches can be claimed as an extension it doesn&#x27;t really make the device anymore useful.</li>
            <li> Overall, this will give a good trim while leaving some hair behind so that men can still be men, and not boys.</li>
            <li> handle is not long enough, does&#x27;t cut properly, DONT RECOMMEND IT.Go to a decent shop and get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Also the ability to extend the razor to get back hair and other hard to reach places is great</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only extended the handle every couple of weeks when it was time to clean up the back hair, so it&#x27;s only been extended maybe 20 times.</li>
            <li> I use it regularly in my hair-removing schedule, but more or less only for trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my expectations were lower than other reviewers, or I received a better unit - regardless, in comparison to other razors/shavers/trimmers I&#x27;ve used and/or owned...</li>
            <li> There are a couple different attachments, I prefer the Vertical Trimmer except it gets full of hair and have to constantly empty it.  </li>
            <li> The previous unit coroded quickly from storage in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The so called adjustable feature is a joke and on the lowest setting it barely even touched my longest body hair and completely missed all that I would normally trim with my Philips Norelco Trimmers which actually cut hair at 11 settings.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut very well and takes a long time.</li>
            <li> the clippers that came with it do not cut readily and I find myself making several passes when one was enough with the old one.</li>
            <li> This puppy makes grooming those hard to reach places easy so that you don&#x27;t have to bring a companion everywhere</li>
            <li> but the blades got dull and not cutting very well</li>
            <li> This Remington groomer worked very well for trimming my giant beard when I had it earlier this year.  </li>
            <li> Doing an &#x27;ok&#x27; job doesn&#x27;t really matter if the unit fails.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t quite fill any shaving needs for either one of us, but admittedly, we were both using it for something other than what it is exactly designed for.</li>
            <li> The mesh pouch it came with isn&#x27;t really big enough, but my first product came in a much bigger canvas bag</li>
            <li> My previous MB-10 ran on a pair of &#x27;AA&#x27; batteries and that pair of batteries has lasted me through multiple full trimmings.</li>
            <li> So, it does work on thick hair just fine.</li>
            <li> The back extender only extends the unit about four inches more, which is still hard to use in some places.</li>
            <li> The intent was for this to be used for general body trimming and hair touch-ups.</li>
            <li> , if I recall correctly, was too small to fit the groomer plus all the accessories at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too clear how he cleared the brush; all I did know was that his type of hair was enough to be noticeable without a shirt, but it wasn&#x27;t so dense as for him to resemble Cro-Magnon Man.     </li>
            <li> B003NCXXIS Mangroomer Sku 211-6 Professional Do-it-yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver]]</li>
            <li> It can (and will if you&#x27;re not careful) cut you and still not shave your stubble.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the professional Gillette trimmer in every way, as it feels solid and not like another piece of plastic in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Apparently, if you keep this plugged in after it is charged, it destroys the battery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great but not terrible.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Remington BHT600 body groomer (~$37) for my fiance based on other reviewer comments and because it looked really sleek.  </li>
            <li> I ended up tossing in last night and going back to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> The power of the razor works fine for light growth, but he said he could see where it&#x27;d be bogged down if the hair growth was thick.</li>
            <li> I have another set of clippers, but it&#x27;s wider and so not good for precise trimming.  </li>
            <li> replacement for old one that lasted very long time ...</li>
            <li> the plastic and everything is the same but the motor barely turns on it, I had read reviews from others saying the same thing</li>
            <li> This probably would have killed the battery after a short period if, by some miracle, it did not fall apart first.  </li>
            <li> As far as the build quality of the groomer and the included accessories, I guess it comes down to that old adage</li>
            <li> As far as the build quality of the groomer and the included accessories, I guess it comes down to that old adage</li>
            <li> Naturally I was not very happy the first time it died mid-groom</li>
            <li> it have a long blade attachment for larger surface areas, great idea, bad design.</li>
            <li> The vertical comb cut some hair, but not consistently, and required several passes for a very rough trim that wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
            <li> The whole trimmer broke in half, dangling by the internal wires.</li>
            <li> The cutting heads all work pretty well, although the foil head is a little uncomfortable to use on the facial area because it vibrates more strongly than a regular facial razor and is much louder.</li>
            <li> I have to say that the handle is a little short for reaching really hard to reach places, but it is definitely better than no extension at all.  </li>
            <li> The extension of the shaver is such a useful feature since it can be hard to get the hairs on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> Unlike my old barber, my current one does not take out the foam and straight razor for the back of my neck, so it gets a little rough back there.  </li>
            <li> There are good &amp; bad things about this</li>
            <li> In both of those areas, I will say unfortunately this Remington doesn&#x27;t match up with Norelco&#x27;s fantastic body groomer, which is so sensitive you can shave your balls while brushing your teeth, and get a close shave while you&#x27;re at it.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to only get worse and this morning I went to use it to clean up some hair around my beard when the whole thing literally broke in half and wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  </li>
            <li> I shave the sides of my head, and have a full beard I trim down heavily every so often.</li>
            <li> though there is less hassle, the Remington is less powerful than my hair clippers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many negative reviews, but it can cut hair fairly short, although not razor close to the skin.  </li>
            <li> but the batteries don&#x27;t last long enough for my liking.</li>
            <li> Although the cutting ability of this device is quite good, I feel that the build quality is somewhat below average.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried various different shaving products trying to get that single product</li>
            <li> The battery charge has always lasted for as long as I needed it to go over my entire head of hair and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s obvious from my use that it can stay in water for a long time.</li>
            <li> Hello fellow Amazon shoppers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have written this review a LONG time again (back in January when I bought it).</li>
            <li> Then the other clipper head gets it down real close to the skin.</li>
            <li> you need to reach a back hair in a hard to reach location, the ability to extend this product works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just feel as though this product is not built to last very long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I saw this groomer I thought that it might be helpful in clipping those few, wild hairs that show up on my shoulders and back.  </li>
            <li> They have for some reason gone away from the same design as other back and body shavers.</li>
            <li> The vertical shaver head included for this purpose does not shave, but merely trims hairs short -- preventing a further trim until the hairs regrow to an an adequate length for another trim.</li>
            <li> However after about 2 months of gentle use, its on/off switch became finicky and when it would run, it was not running properly and not good for trimming hair at all.</li>
            <li> and I expect it to do the job well for a long time.    </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cut anything, no matter how taut the skin was held or how long I kept moving the attachment in circles against my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Remington MB-10 for a long time now.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> But recently I have had the opportunity to try a few different body grooming devices, including this BHT600 Body and Back Groomer by Remington.  </li>
            <li> which is a big minus too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery takes a long time to charge, can&#x27;t use it with the adapter plugged.</li>
            <li> Arrest me.</li>
            <li> but forget about using it for long.</li>
            <li> so it takes a long time to use.</li>
            <li> The handle extends to reach further down a person&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> The construction is not very high</li>
            <li> Of course other male areas (I won&#x27;t go into) need a bit of grooming now and</li>
            <li> And the clipper-style attachment scraped skin, necessitating use of the back attachment for the entire body, with predictably lamentable results.</li>
            <li> the extension is nice for use in removing annoying back hair.  </li>
            <li> it and its never pulled a single hair or cut/nicked me once.</li>
            <li> I disliked older batteries where they started out strong, and slowly dwindled down to a very slow pace.</li>
            <li> The handle only extends a few inches, so if you&#x27;re a big person, you might have trouble reaching areas of your back.</li>
            <li> It works well either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I found that the shave was closer than the Norelco body groomer I had used previously, but I did not think the back extender was all that helpful.</li>
            <li> CONs:  - The only one I can think of is the included black, mesh-like storage pouch</li>
            <li> As stated in a previous review the charge on mine Remington was only 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old machine which was bought in 2010 this has little less performance...</li>
            <li> The blades cut really well, even with my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After looking long and hard for a general use shaver</li>
            <li> The hand, which is intended to extend enough to reach the back&#x27;s tough middling areas, does not extend nearly enough.</li>
            <li> Great concept, terrible product.  </li>
            <li> The one attachment that did work to cut hair as expected was the detail trimmer.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t quiet understand the harsh reviews for this.</li>
            <li> I just spent 40 minutes in a shower trying to it all the hair and it looks like I have done nothing.  </li>
            <li> For me, that&#x27;s a minus, because I don&#x27;t use a groomer all that often, so I don&#x27;t want to have to remember to keep it charged.</li>
            <li> be careful not to drop it otherwise</li>
            <li> Over a few years my 2nd one broke and moving to another brand/model.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted enough money on these</li>
            <li> While I hardly have the heavy back hair may dad used to have there are some wild hairs that occasionally take a contorted reach with a small scissors to get.  </li>
            <li> trimmer is also very sharp so it is easy to scrape while cutting when using it without the plastic trimmer head.</li>
            <li> First one I thought might be a bad egg but the 2nd one did the same thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once the user twists himself into position the user must go over and over the same spot until the skin is rubbed raw.  </li>
            <li> and when I took it off and tried just using the clippers in direct skin contact, it still did almost no good.  </li>
            <li> Anything other than that, you may want to keep looking around.</li>
            <li> The plastic guard provided for it doesn&#x27;t work either, so using it on other body parts</li>
            <li> It comes with multiple attachments and a small carrying case that everything fits inside.</li>
            <li> The storage bag is too small to hold the shaver, charger, and all of the attachments properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably never use the shaver attachment, but the other two look to come in</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and will be stepping up to a better brand and shaver.  </li>
            <li> How do I use it in countries with other voltage?</li>
            <li> The other attachments just don&#x27;t seem to work as well.    </li>
            <li> my other appliances don&#x27;t work that way.</li>
            <li> I had the first one replaced promptly through Amazon, but the replacement failed too...  </li>
            <li> Either I carried a normal electric razor and strained my back and arms getting to some difficult spots, or I&#x27;m forced to carry along multiple devices,</li>
            <li> Sooner or later, the battery will completely fail you and you&#x27;ll find yourself either reaching for your old hair clippers, or wearing a hat to the barber shop down the road.</li>
            <li> other smaller complaint is the pouch.</li>
            <li> Only reason I needed to buy another one was because it fell, hit a hard floor and the structure on the inside broke</li>
            <li> but it was still hard to reach my back even when the razor was extended.  </li>
            <li> - He hasn&#x27;t complained about knicks, cuts, razor bumps, low battery charge or anything else      </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I charged this sucker</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to reach the center of your back with, but after a little practice this can be done.</li>
            <li> the handle slipped down and the button went flying off along with the springs that hold it in place.</li>
            <li> This groomer does a good job of cutting hair, but I find that trying to cut hair when it is wet is not nearly as effective as cutting it dry.  </li>
            <li> Battery has less backup and in between machine slows down.</li>
            <li> the motor is way too weak it barely works, save your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> I had one previously that died when I dropped it.</li>
            <li> and I had to walk around with half groomed legs until it was fully charged again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it less than a month and will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Really odd.</li>
            <li> I found this a bit awkward to hold and manipulate at first, but once I got used to it, I had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> All my hair is fairly thick and long and this had no problem cut through it with the vertical attachment.</li>
            <li> This is a necessary feature for this trimmers due to the poor battery life.  </li>
            <li> If I could give it 3 1/2 stars I would, but since we don&#x27;t have half stars on Amazon I will round it up to 4.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp and cut through my very thick hair without binding up or having to be cleaned out constantly!</li>
            <li> while I found that all of the attachments worked well and meet or exceeded expectations - the Foil Shaver was the one weak link the entire setup.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy or recommend it to anyone with my dimensions, though am not sure how it applies to folks with other dimensions (height and width).</li>
            <li> The detail trimmer attachment looks to be designed to handle the heavy hair with little issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap crap that doesn&#x27;t shave anywhere well and looks like a little toy for a child with little plastic pieces that fall off.  </li>
            <li> My wife used this to trim the edges when cutting the hair on my head, and it did very well at that.</li>
            <li> then it quits - battery is dead.</li>
            <li> The Vertical Trimmer attachment guard does not hold on too well after I adjusted it a few</li>
            <li> you have ti change the heads all the time not comfortable .  </li>
            <li> But it is not uncommon for included storage or travel bags to be of low quality and too small.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The back attachment does a poor job.</li>
            <li> However a waste of time for shaving.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t like the Wahl I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on this Remington.</li>
            <li> The other complaint is that you cannot leave it plugged in when in use.  </li>
            <li> I had a nail clipper with a straight shaft that always seemed impossible to reach with because it wan not curved.     </li>
            <li> All of the heads leave long stubble behind as well.  </li>
            <li> However, after a few months it started doing this weird thing where it would almost &#x27;pause&#x27; while running... and god forbid if you had it in contact with your facial hair when it decided to take a break, it would pull on the hairs on your face...</li>
            <li> The machine is very weak and has not enough power .  </li>
            <li> Once in hand this groomer looked decidedly mediocre, but even worse it didn&#x27;t cut particularly well.</li>
            <li> We used it to trim regular body hair, thin and thick, and also even goat hair, which is extremely thick.</li>
            <li> Small blade surface</li>
            <li> The extention helps shaving my back in the places that are difficult to reach.</li>
            <li> I have found several design flaws that make this a very poor shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have had a few body and back shavers and this is by far the worst.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the worst trimmer I ever got, it ran out of charge very quickly.</li>
            <li> Even at the end of it&#x27;s life, it still worked while half broken.</li>
            <li> so it should be hard to trim it.</li>
            <li> This product has the ability to reach those &#x27;spots&#x27; that are hard to get at.</li>
            <li> way you have no issue getting those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I hardly use the shaver because it&#x27;s embarrassing to use.</li>
            <li> I need to groom places that are hard to reach sometimes.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to get them plugged in under the bathtub</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hitting the gym, but not that hard.</li>
            <li> As you can see, there are negative reviews about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Love that it is (at least) water resistant.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not really meet my expectations for grooming body hair.</li>
            <li> The attachments slid off while in use and the cutting foil deformed after the second attempt.</li>
            <li> cutting blades allow for bi-directional trimming, which definitely speeds up the grooming process.  </li>
            <li> You have to make at least three or four passes on one area to get the clippers to cut.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> It tore through my thick beard like nothing else in this price class that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> so it is very difficult to get to all areas on my back.</li>
            <li> had one real complaint and one small complaint about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The worst thing about it was that after about 9 months (using once a month) it would only last about 5 minutes and now it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge at all.  </li>
            <li> Finally sick of it and going to buy the Mangroomer Ultimate Pro to replace.</li>
            <li> Overall I am disappointed and would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard</li>
            <li> It actually works well for that, but I am doubtful that it would be helpful to those with Robin William&#x27;s type of fur</li>
            <li> works well but poor quality.  </li>
            <li> My advice, don&#x27;t buy it - poor quality.</li>
            <li> I charged it for hours before, it worked with a very weak charge for about a minute</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ordered this unit when there were No Reviews...</li>
            <li> The guide is flimsy and useless...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this wasn&#x27;t the case,</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 months now and it hasnt failed me once, hasnt pulled any hairs nor has it cut my skin like another trimming product which will remain nameless.  </li>
            <li> product package also includes a power adapter and a rather sad storage bag.  </li>
            <li> I went to use it this week and the motor just completely failed.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality!</li>
            <li> For that reason and that reason alone, I cannot recommend this product as the quality is very poor and it should have been recalled.</li>
            <li> bad product, just after the warranty ends, and not charging the battery,do not spend your money on a disposable machine</li>
            <li> Just bad luck, nothing to do with the design.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this product for this purpose, then you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really disappointed</li>
            <li> Very awkward  to use.</li>
            <li> very unhappy</li>
            <li> The foil trimmer was absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> There is also a foil attachment which is basically worthless.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this item.  </li>
            <li> you need to trim your beard, choose another product as this is horrible at it.</li>
            <li> These are horrible clippers.</li>
            <li> very painful!  </li>
            <li> Battery is terrible.</li>
            <li> Awful product, don&#x27;t waist your money!!!  </li>
            <li> Battery life is terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There are good &amp; bad things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to reach a back hair in a hard to reach location, the ability to extend this product works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to trim your beard, choose another product as this is horrible at it. The cheap plastic trimmer head that goes on this groomer does NOT stay in the setting you want. It is constantly going to a lower setting while shaving causing me to have bald spots in my beard. I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard so it should be hard to trim it. I have tried holding it at different angles to prevent the setting from changing, but it is hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is also very sharp so it is easy to scrape while cutting when using it without the plastic trimmer head.</li>
            <li> I like the 3 interchangeable blades for different shaving purposes. Also the ability to extend the razor to get back hair and other hard to reach places is great</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ordered this unit when there were No Reviews...and now I am the second to report this as junk.  This razor is proof that Remington doesn&#x27;t do product testing before launching their products.   The so called adjustable feature is a joke and on the lowest setting it barely even touched my longest body hair and completely missed all that I would normally trim with my Philips Norelco Trimmers which actually cut hair at 11 settings.  The guide is flimsy and useless...and when I took it off and tried just using the clippers in direct skin contact, it still did almost no good.  I spent 40 mins NOT doing the job that my Norelco (which died of old age) did in 10 mins.       I have to say am pissed off that Amazon sold this junk...and I am returning the product.</li>
            <li> When I first was considering buying this item, I came here on Amazon to see the reviews. As you can see, there are negative reviews about it. So I wasn&#x27;t going to buy it, but I was strolling in Target and had an impulse shopping moment. So I purchased the item and knew if I didn&#x27;t like it I could just take it back. Well, I kept the item. The shaver works completely great. It is also waterproof on the detachable parts so it&#x27;s easy to clean. It cuts my hairs completely fine. The foil shaver worked perfectly on my face. Maybe the other reviewers have titanium hairs growing out, but mine are normal and can be cut just fine. The extension of the shaver is such a useful feature since it can be hard to get the hairs on the back of my legs. Overall, an excellent product by Remington.</li>
            <li> In about 5 minutes I was able to shave my armpit hair and hair below the waist with no problems. I used 2 of the attachments with NO pinching. It works well either wet or dry. I think the best parts of this product is how cheap it is, the different attachments, and the fact that you can use it in the shower. The extender only adds about 3.5inches which I could understand isn&#x27;t the best if you aren&#x27;t flexible enough to reach your back. If you have that problem, get your partner or specialist to wax your back...    I only intend to use this product to fix my sideburns, cut my pubes, and my arm pit hair...and I expect it to do the job well for a long time.    Also includes a mesh bag for carrying product, which wasn&#x27;t mentioned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very meh about this product.  It&#x27;s not great but not terrible.  The quality of the product is about what I expect for the price - not the sturdiest feeling product out there, but I also don&#x27;t fear I&#x27;ll break it any second.  It won&#x27;t upset your skin if its more sensitive, but then again, it won&#x27;t give you the closest hair grooming either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it works best if you have areas you want cleaned up but are not looking for very exact and precise results, especially if you have sensitive skin.  Anything other than that, you may want to keep looking around.</li>
            <li> I picked this up for my husband a few months ago, and he really likes it.  According to him, it&#x27;s easy to use, allows for close grooming, and has nice features.  He doesn&#x27;t use this for his face, only for his body, but it enables him to do his \\&quot;man scaping\\&quot; relatively quickly and easily.  I&#x27;d say that he uses this about once a week, and it&#x27;s been holding up great, even though we haven&#x27;t had it for too long.  He&#x27;s been nothing but happy with it.</li>
            <li> I received this item through the Amazon Prime program. I found that the shave was closer than the Norelco body groomer I had used previously, but I did not think the back extender was all that helpful. The back extender only extends the unit about four inches more, which is still hard to use in some places. As a general groomer, the it has worked great, but I would not buy this just for the back extender feature in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Does a fair job when it&#x27;s working. The battery is good for one thorough shave say 10-15 minutes then it quits - battery is dead. Recharge takes hours. Back trimming requires the skills of Cirque du Soleil contortionist given the short handle extension. Also plan for several passes to get the job done.  Cannot recommend this one. Definitely recommend this one: [[ASIN:B003NCXXIS Mangroomer Sku 211-6 Professional Do-it-yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned it before and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. I don&#x27;t really use all the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Beard/moustache: Works almost perfectly for me. I&#x27;d give it 9 outta 10.&lt;br /&gt;ears, nose: I don&#x27;t use the attachment, and it trims well enough.&lt;br /&gt;Body: Works great. Won&#x27;t give a 100% smooth shave, but pretty damn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it is (at least) water resistant. It could extend a lil further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first one lasted me a good 5 years. Only reason I needed to buy another one was because it fell, hit a hard floor and the structure on the inside broke (It actually still works, but you cant extend it without it falling apart.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> While I hardly have the heavy back hair may dad used to have there are some wild hairs that occasionally take a contorted reach with a small scissors to get.  This zipped them off with easy and with surprising control.  I think the arc in the unit makes it more useful and easy to minipulate from a distance.  I had a nail clipper with a straight shaft that always seemed impossible to reach with because it wan not curved.     Unlike my old barber, my current one does not take out the foam and straight razor for the back of my neck, so it gets a little rough back there.  I can smooth it out pretty good with this.  Of course other male areas (I won&#x27;t go into) need a bit of grooming now and then, this is better than reaching with a small razor or a blade. It&#x27;s not exactly a big bucks premium razor, but for its purpose it gets the job done nice.</li>
            <li> Given this body groomer comes with a number of attachments (detail trimmer, vertical comb, foil trimmer), I thought it might be worth the value, but in the end only one attachment is of any use to me. The foil trimmer was absolutely worthless. It didn&#x27;t cut anything, no matter how taut the skin was held or how long I kept moving the attachment in circles against my skin. All it left me with was irritated skin where I kept moving the groomer against it. The vertical comb cut some hair, but not consistently, and required several passes for a very rough trim that wasn&#x27;t worth the effort. The one attachment that did work to cut hair as expected was the detail trimmer. The detail trimmer was good at getting in rather close and did not require several passes like the other attachments did. This will not give you a close shave, but will leave obvious stubble.     The best way I like to use this groomer has ended up being actually giving myself rough hair cuts and grooming the rear end area of my dog (where stuff sticks to fur on the way out). The battery charge has always lasted for as long as I needed it to go over my entire head of hair and then some.    Unfortunately, this product did not really meet my expectations for grooming body hair. I would recommend giving something else a try before settling for this.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t quiet understand the harsh reviews for this. I own this one the mangroomer and the one by norelco and if I had to choose only one this would be it. It does not seem cheap at all( remember it&#x27;s only $40). It&#x27;s by far the most versatile body groomer, and I think it cuts great. On a scale of one to ten on how hairy I am I&#x27;m close to a 9. All my hair is fairly thick and long and this had no problem cut through it with the vertical attachment. Then the other clipper head gets it down real close to the skin. You could proabally just stop there but if you wanted a real smooth shave the foil head does ok. It could use some improvement but if you use the fine shaver you would almost have to use a blade to get much closer. The only problem I have with this is the handle could be longer. It is a little hard to reach the center of your back with, but after a little practice this can be done. As I said though, If you only had one body groomer you could buy, this should be it.</li>
            <li> Once in hand this groomer looked decidedly mediocre, but even worse it didn&#x27;t cut particularly well. The attachments slid off while in use and the cutting foil deformed after the second attempt.</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington BHT600 body groomer (~$37) for my fiance based on other reviewer comments and because it looked really sleek.  He is deployed and needed a replacement for another body groomer, which he liked, but it stopped working.    It shipped (free) to me from amazon and then I shipped it to him (amazon can&#x27;t ship this particular item directly to APO addresses in some countries).  Here are pros/cons based on my first impressions and his brief feedback:    PROs:  - Charged/working right out of the box  - Felt really durable and quality-made  - Looked/felt just as sleek as it does in pictures online  - He was thrilled to receive it and likes it better than his previous body groomer  - He said it works great for facial shaving and other hair removal (above/below the belt)  - He likes the extension feature for hard-to-reach back hairs  - The groomer is wireless, chargeable, and holds a good charge (it is a time-saving mobile tool which is important in his line of work)    - Voltage-wise, the charger works just fine in deployed locations (with plug adaptors)  - I&#x27;ve seen some of his handy work via web chats and his clean shaven areas look great online.    - He hasn&#x27;t complained about knicks, cuts, razor bumps, low battery charge or anything else      CONs:  - The only one I can think of is the included black, mesh-like storage pouch, if I recall correctly, was too small to fit the groomer plus all the accessories at the same time.  Not a big deal unless you plan to travel with it a lot or really plan to store it in that pouch.     I give the BHT600 only 4 stars not because of the pouch, but because I don&#x27;t have enough info to give it 5 and he has only used it a couple months.  I&#x27;d pressure him for more details about the usefullness of the accessories and its resilience to water, but reviewing products on amazon.com aren&#x27;t exactly a priority for deployed guys.</li>
            <li> Most of my life I&#x27;ve never been a very hairy person.  In fact, a former girlfriend who was of Mediterranean heritage used to refer to me as a exemplary specimen of the \\&quot;Presbyterian Hairless\\&quot; species.  As we age however, well... hair shows up in places that were once barren.  When I saw this groomer I thought that it might be helpful in clipping those few, wild hairs that show up on my shoulders and back.  It actually works well for that, but I am doubtful that it would be helpful to those with Robin William&#x27;s type of fur coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the clipper worked well the shaving attachment didn&#x27;t really do the job on my fairly light beard.  If I could give it 3 1/2 stars I would, but since we don&#x27;t have half stars on Amazon I will round it up to 4.</li>
            <li> The razor works well, and even though I am pretty flexible, shaving your own back isn&#x27;t very feasible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many negative reviews, but it can cut hair fairly short, although not razor close to the skin.  As another reviewer mentioned, the handle is way too short to be of use.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Remington MB-10 for a long time now. Seeing the Remington BHT600 I thought it would be a great opportunity for an upgrade! There are some improvements, and some things that I still prefer about the MB-10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the awesome features are the extendable handle and the fine cutting blades! The handle is sturdy, and when extended it snaps in place securely. I don&#x27;t worry about it breaking or wearing out. The blades cut really well, even with my very thick hair. The BHT600 is also water proof, so that is very nice too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not too happy with the battery life on the internal battery of this shaver. I shave the sides of my head, and have a full beard I trim down heavily every so often. The BHT600 lasts through shaving the sides of my head, but then runs out of power before I can get very far through my beard. I have to charge it to finish. My previous MB-10 ran on a pair of &#x27;AA&#x27; batteries and that pair of batteries has lasted me through multiple full trimmings. I really hoped that this battery would last quite a bit more. Also the attachments are not as solid and sturdy as I would have liked. The Vertical Trimmer attachment guard does not hold on too well after I adjusted it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery does keep going strong until it dies. I disliked older batteries where they started out strong, and slowly dwindled down to a very slow pace. The BHT600 keeps a strong pace until just before the end. The blades are very sharp and cut through my very thick hair without binding up or having to be cleaned out constantly! The detail trimmer attachment looks to be designed to handle the heavy hair with little issue. It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this trimmer and use it happily. There are a few things I would have done different with it, but overall it is a great trimmer and I love the way it feels in my hand. It has a good weight and sturdy feel. The blue charging light at the power plug is nifty too. If you are looking for a decent trimmer, give this one a try!one a try!</li>
            <li> This unit isn&#x27;t perfect, but it basically gets the job done.  The cutting heads all work pretty well, although the foil head is a little uncomfortable to use on the facial area because it vibrates more strongly than a regular facial razor and is much louder. It did an alright job, though.    The handle only extends a few inches, so if you&#x27;re a big person, you might have trouble reaching areas of your back. My wife used this to trim the edges when cutting the hair on my head, and it did very well at that. It also doesn&#x27;t take forever to recharge, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I have had a few body and back shavers and this is by far the worst.  I have found several design flaws that make this a very poor shaver.  1) it have a long blade attachment for larger surface areas, great idea, bad design. It runs straight out when you use the guard.  So this if you can imagine in you mind is like trying to run your lawn mower on its side. While the guard is combing sideways the razor is trying to the hairs straight up, instead of in the same direction as the comb.  2)  Unless guys are really really flexible their is no way that they will be able to reach there whole back with this thing.  They have for some reason gone away from the same design as other back and body shavers. while it looks good it is not functional and does not let you reach the areas that need it. 3) it does not cut the hair I just spent 40 minutes in a shower trying to it all the hair and it looks like I have done nothing.  I would not recommend this to anyone, I will certainly be a more wise shopper after this.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this item.  The shave adapter does not shave close.</li>
            <li> They should be ashamed to call this a man&#x27;s shaver and I better get my money back.  It&#x27;s cheap crap that doesn&#x27;t shave anywhere well and looks like a little toy for a child with little plastic pieces that fall off.  Pissed off and do not waste your time and money.  Returning today.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my BHT-650, which I had for over 3 years (which still worked but lost it while traveling). The price is very reasonable from this seller. This model is great for me due to a 1.75&#x27;&#x27; wide foil shaver, which this was a main reason I got the in the first place. I placed the order on Thursday night &amp; I received it by Saturday. Im satisfied by Shaver Outlet Inc prompt service.</li>
            <li> This product has several flaws, so I&#x27;ll get them out of the way to save time. The hand, which is intended to extend enough to reach the back&#x27;s tough middling areas, does not extend nearly enough. The vertical shaver head included for this purpose does not shave, but merely trims hairs short -- preventing a further trim until the hairs regrow to an an adequate length for another trim. The plastic guard provided for it doesn&#x27;t work either, so using it on other body parts you DO want trimmed, not shaved, will get you nowhere. The foil shaver was comically inefficient, removing only a few hairs at most. And the clipper-style attachment scraped skin, necessitating use of the back attachment for the entire body, with predictably lamentable results. Finally, the battery would give out within 30 minutes, its buzzing mechanism giving way to a struggling groan and finally not even a whisper. Hopefully Remington&#x27;s new beard trimmer performs better than its body groomers.</li>
            <li> As an all-purpose body groomer, this is probably a fine product, however, if you are getting something mostly for general face shaving or leg shaving, I would try something else.  My husband doesn&#x27;t feel like it is shaving close enough on the face and neck, and I tried it on my legs and my leg hair might be just too fine for it to do its job.  It might work fine on a man&#x27;s legs.  It didn&#x27;t quite fill any shaving needs for either one of us, but admittedly, we were both using it for something other than what it is exactly designed for.</li>
            <li> This is a definite TRIMMER, not a close SHAVER.  Also, I would say that it is good primarily for trimming areas with light to moderate hair.  If you are looking to shave a large area with thick, coarse hair this probably is not going to do the job very efficiently or effectively.  I personally recommend/prefer a bottle of Neet and a one of those long-handled lotion applicators over using using a body groomer/trimmer.  That is definitely MUCH quicker, easier and the hair stays gone longer.</li>
            <li> It is always a battle... getting rid of those hairs you don&#x27;t want where they continue to grow. It is similar to weeds in a garden. You have to keep up with nature - these things just want to keep growing... This product has the ability to reach those &#x27;spots&#x27; that are hard to get at. Some of the areas that need &#x27;shaving&#x27; are a bit sensitive, so you have to be a bit careful. Over all, I would say - keep to the task, men...</li>
            <li> This is a decent groomer. It comes with multiple attachments and a small carrying case that everything fits inside. We used it to trim regular body hair, thin and thick, and also even goat hair, which is extremely thick. We were trimming around their hooves for a show. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for more than that on a goat though. So, it does work on thick hair just fine. Maybe those who experienced problems didn&#x27;t have it fully charged?  It&#x27;s water proof, which is a plus. Also, I like how it has a sliding guard for changing the length of the trim. Much more convenient that way.</li>
            <li> Operates as described. Nice that you can get it wet, but a longer handle would make it better. Also the battery life is not as good as other electric razors I have used.</li>
            <li> While not perfect the Remington BHT600 does a pretty good job.    I travel a great deal and I&#x27;ve tried various different shaving products trying to get that single product so I can clip, trim, shave and clean up my chest/back/under arms without resorting to lugging around different devices for different areas.  Either I carried a normal electric razor and strained my back and arms getting to some difficult spots, or I&#x27;m forced to carry along multiple devices, some that don&#x27;t work right (or seem ready to fall apart in my hands every time I used them) or are only good for one thing.    With the Remington BHT600 I found something I truly liked; in fact the normal Detail Trimmer Attachment trimmed my facial hair so well my first thought was \\&quot;if the Foil Shaver works as well, I don&#x27;t even need my normal electric razor.\\&quot;      Unfortunately this wasn&#x27;t the case, while I found that all of the attachments worked well and meet or exceeded expectations - the Foil Shaver was the one weak link the entire setup.  The process should have been simple; trim then shave - however the shaver required repeated passes, didn&#x27;t cut at all or the shave wasn&#x27;t nearly as close as you&#x27;d have expected.  I thought the Extendable Handle worked well, allowing me to trim without strain, and the Vertical Trimmer (plus both Trimmer attachments) also worked great.    Maybe my expectations were lower than other reviewers, or I received a better unit - regardless, in comparison to other razors/shavers/trimmers I&#x27;ve used and/or owned...I&#x27;d have given the Remington BHT600 a 5-of-5 rating if the foil shaver had cut closer. So while this hasn&#x27;t eliminated the need to carry multiple devices - I&#x27;m happy to remove a couple of items from my go-bag and replace them with the Remington.</li>
            <li> replacement for old one that lasted very long time ... great product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst trimmer I ever got, it ran out of charge very quickly. And you have to wait till it charges, mostly it lasts for 5-10minutes i would say. Never waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> You press the power button, it stays on for a second and then turns off.  Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 months now and it hasnt failed me once, hasnt pulled any hairs nor has it cut my skin like another trimming product which will remain nameless.  Its the perfect size for me (6&#x27;, 200 lbs) I can get everywhere without straining.  It does not feel cheap to me.  My only two complaints is that there should be an attachment for \\&quot;scruffy-like\\&quot; (1mm) this cuts more like a 3mm with one of the attachments.  The other complaint is that you cannot leave it plugged in when in use.  It wont turn on.  So if you travel, make sure you fully charge it before using it.</li>
            <li> The machine is very weak and has not enough power .  you have ti change the heads all the time not comfortable .  thanks</li>
            <li> The trimmers work great and are relatively safe for most parts of the body (have to be careful on the certain sensitive body part).  I highly recommend the Remington BHT-600 for this purpose.    If you have coarse hair, however, then the foil shaver is not for you.  It can (and will if you&#x27;re not careful) cut you and still not shave your stubble.  If you&#x27;re buying this product for this purpose, then you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is great as a trimmer but don&#x27;t expect it to give you a very close shave as this is only really a trimmer. My boyfriend has tried numerous trimmers in the past and find this one the best he has used. I have tried this too and it&#x27;s very easy to use and great for anyone with sensitive skin. There were no nicks or cuts from using this. If you are looking for a good trimmer, this is good. It came with a ton of different attachments as well but I found they don&#x27;t all need to be used. Find the one that works for you and go for it. Overall, this will give a good trim while leaving some hair behind so that men can still be men, and not boys.</li>
            <li> I have another set of clippers, but it&#x27;s wider and so not good for precise trimming.  This Remington groomer worked very well for trimming my giant beard when I had it earlier this year.  The blades cut well with no pulling, and charging it was easy enough.  It was also easy to adjust the trim length with the provided attachments.  Supposedly this thing works in the shower, but I haven&#x27;t had the need to try that yet.</li>
            <li> Okay removing unwanted back and body hair is not really something we want to talk about or admit to, but hey let&#x27;s face it, we all need maintenance and shaving our bodies is one of those things. I must say this groomer can take a beating. I will admit to literally just leaving it in the shower, and when needed, it is always ready to go. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I charged this sucker and it is always responsive and works well. It&#x27;s not a close shave like a razor blade, but you can definitely get those stray hairs, or neaten up whatever you need to. The handle extends to reach further down a person&#x27;s back. The unit rinses well and it&#x27;s obvious from my use that it can stay in water for a long time. All in all, I would recommend this unit. I like it.</li>
            <li> Good but not as good as the previous model which had an extension handle.</li>
            <li> I have two of these. With my older one, the battery started to go after 3-4 years and now it requires a charge after every use or two and frequently dies out while I&#x27;m using it. With my newer one, it can go several uses before it needs to be charged again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the exception of the battery issue on the older one, these trimmers are great. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these and they have both died and stopped charging within a year of ownership. The device itself works great, but it just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, shaving other areas of my body other than my face is a rather new thing for me.  But recently I have had the opportunity to try a few different body grooming devices, including this BHT600 Body and Back Groomer by Remington.  I have to say up front that this Remington is a very decent, mid-grade product, that cuts hair just about as well as body groomers that are twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real stand-out characteristic of this groomer is the extending handle, which is supposed to make it easy for one to shave their back and possibly even legs, if one should so desire.  I have to say that the handle is a little short for reaching really hard to reach places, but it is definitely better than no extension at all.  The BHT600 comes with 5 primary trimming attachments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Detail Trimmer Attachment&lt;br /&gt;2.  Detail Trimmer Comb&lt;br /&gt;3.  Vertical Trimmer Attachment&lt;br /&gt;4.  Vertical Trimmer Comb&lt;br /&gt;5.  Foil Shaver Attachment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product package also includes a power adapter and a rather sad storage bag.  The storage bag is too small to hold the shaver, charger, and all of the attachments properly.  But it is not uncommon for included storage or travel bags to be of low quality and too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting blades allow for bi-directional trimming, which definitely speeds up the grooming process.  This groomer does a good job of cutting hair, but I find that trying to cut hair when it is wet is not nearly as effective as cutting it dry.  Although the cutting ability of this device is quite good, I feel that the build quality is somewhat below average.  The groomer itself fits well in the hand, with good weight and balance, but feels like a drop to the floor would send it flying into a million pieces.  The attachments, especially the trimmer combs, just seem extremely cheap.  The power button of the grooming device also seems somewhat flimsy.  I just feel as though this product is not built to last very long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this product&#x27;s ability to trim hair.  I didn&#x27;t notice any pulling, and it seemed to cut evenly.  As far as the build quality of the groomer and the included accessories, I guess it comes down to that old adage, \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot;  So if you are looking for a low cost trimmer/shaver, that cuts good, and you can accept that it may not last for years, then the Remington BHT600 is a good choice for a man&#x27;s body groomer.  But if you are looking for a groomer that offers a good cut and solid, lasting build quality, then there are better, more costly choices out there.to trim hair.

            <li> I found this a bit awkward to hold and manipulate at first, but once I got used to it, I had no problem with it. The attachments aren&#x27;t the greatest, but the unit itself works just fine, in my opinion. I like that it extends, but that you can also operate it without extending it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one real complaint and one small complaint about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you can&#x27;t operate it while it&#x27;s plugged in, so you have to keep it charged at all times. For me, that&#x27;s a minus, because I don&#x27;t use a groomer all that often, so I don&#x27;t want to have to remember to keep it charged. I have always had plug-in ones before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other smaller complaint is the pouch. It&#x27;s all well and good to have a little travel pouch, but it&#x27;s not an ideal way to store the groomer and attachments on a regular basis. It&#x27;s such a tight fit, and I would have preferred something more substantial to hold everything (including the instructions, which won&#x27;t fit in the little mesh bag along with the groomer and attachments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, a good product at an okay price.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;shaver&#x27; comes with three separate attachments.  A more standard hair/beard trimmer, a smaller &#x27;groomer&#x27;, and a close &#x27;shaver&#x27;.    Blades are supposedly titanium infused, so they&#x27;ll last longer, and the whole thing is waterproof, so it can be used in the shower, etc, which is a huge benefit.    One of the not so great things is the &#x27;extendable&#x27; part of it.  This gives you just a few more inches, maybe half a foot at best, and really isn&#x27;t going to help you get to hard to reach places like more speciality devices would.    I&#x27;ll probably never use the shaver attachment, but the other two look to come in handy.  Comes with a nice case, seems to hold a decent charge, and well it cuts.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Gillette body trimmer. It is of much higher quality.    The back attachment does a poor job. It doesn&#x27;t cut very well and takes a long time. I&#x27;m flexible enough to do the job with a regular trimmer, so this piece is collecting dust. The 3\\&quot; of extension you get when extending the handle is nice, but only worth it if you cant reach your back already. I prefer the professional Gillette trimmer in every way, as it feels solid and not like another piece of plastic in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Love the extendable handle reaching hard to get to areas.  Its one of the only trimmers with a vertical head - awesome selling point!</li>
            <li> I paid 29.99 cause of army discount at the PX. This is a great razor. I haven&#x27;t had to do any maintenance too it and its never pulled a single hair or cut/nicked me once. Its extremely precise. The only cons are that its has a very low battery life and it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair all the way from the groove. Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> This product worked great when it arrived. Exactly as advertised. However after about 2 months of gentle use, its on/off switch became finicky and when it would run, it was not running properly and not good for trimming hair at all. After a week of this temperamental behavior it gave out completely and refused to start, despite adequate charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not advise anyone to get this product.</li>
            <li> It works well but the batteries don&#x27;t last long enough for my liking.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old machine which was bought in 2010 this has little less performance... Blades are not sharper.. Battery has less backup and in between machine slows down.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 7 months ago and was happy with the results while using it, although I did think that it needed to hold a charge better.  But no biggie.  For $30 it was working fine and having the extension for trimming back hair was a nice touch I didn&#x27;t see in other shavers.  I went to use it this week and the motor just completely failed.  You can hear it trying to rev up but it&#x27;s like your car won&#x27;t quite turn over and start.  I was disappointed and will be stepping up to a better brand and shaver.  Looks like Norelco for me!</li>
            <li> When I bought it I thought this would have an adapter suitable for all voltages worldwide else how can one use this when travelling (it comes with a travel case after all). However, the adapter is only suitable for 110v. How do I use it in countries with other voltage?</li>
            <li> Great item for manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful not to drop it otherwise the clipper end gets dinged and it will then scratch the skin. I bought replacement clipper ends from the company directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a plastic extension handle to help with trimming back bear hair. Very awkward  to use. Just get the missus to help (provided she doesn&#x27;t gag....)</li>
            <li> I ordered this groomer 6 months ago, only used it 2 or 3 times but not it doesn&#x27;t work any more, doesn&#x27;t charge or do anything. very unhappy</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT , only thing i can find that i can shave my own back , dont need to gross the wife out now :)</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. I had one previously that died when I dropped it. Works on every part of the body with ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not hairy all over but I do like to keep neat and tidy and the [[ASIN:B002BA5KNO Remington BHT600 Body and Back Groomer]] works well for my needs.  I like the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; attachment and appreciate the body shaver attachment though I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s built to provide a close shave anyway.    With personal grooming I always use the guards, not wanting to suffer the sting of hundreds of tiny cuts, and the guards work fine.  Too short and everything starts to itch anyways.  The extension feature does feel a but wobbly when fully extended so I try not to apply too much pressure so that I won&#x27;t snap the plastic.    For the price point of this groomer I&#x27;m satisfied.  It does the job without discomfort, keeps me trim, and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> This groomer comes with a nice array of attachments and case, but it just doesn&#x27;t work that well. I found it flimsy. The attachments fall off when you try to use it. Overall I am disappointed and would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s closest setting doesn&#x27;t trim very close.&lt;br /&gt;- It feels light and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;- The attachments tend to fall off.&lt;br /&gt;- The construction is not very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the Man Groomer and find that it works a lot better: [[ASIN:B000HQ0L2E MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver]]</li>
            <li> Does what it has to do efficiently. Did not rate 5 stars because power supply was faulty, although I got in contact with the company and after explaining this they are sending me a replacement, free of charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd one of these in about 10 years.  I like it because you can use it in the shower which makes clean-up a breeze.  The two heads are convenient depending on what part of you that you are grooming. Have used others as well, but I keep coming back to this model.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s not the hairy type, but my brother&#x27;s struggled with the hairy back phenom since puberty. I wasn&#x27;t too clear how he cleared the brush; all I did know was that his type of hair was enough to be noticeable without a shirt, but it wasn&#x27;t so dense as for him to resemble Cro-Magnon Man.     I gave him the Remington back shaver to try, and he raved about it. He said it was easy to use and performed great; he said, though, he could see why a man with a huge amount of back hair might have problems with this.    The power of the razor works fine for light growth, but he said he could see where it&#x27;d be bogged down if the hair growth was thick. He recommends it only for those with a light to medium back hair.</li>
            <li> This may sound kind of weird, but I am obsessed with any device that removes body hair.  I don&#x27;t believe in just \\&quot;Man-Scaping\\&quot; I want ALL my body hair gone.  Chest, Legs, Arms, Groin, Arm Pits - all of it.  I use [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]] and [[ASIN:B001E0C9LI Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional BodyGrooming System]], pluckers, and razors, waxes, Nairs, the whole works.  Thus, I feel fairly qualified to review this new addition to the Body Grooming world, the BHT600 by Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me,  you want a body groomer that doesn&#x27;t just shave the easy stuff like legs and arms, you also want one to take care of that sensitive \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; area.  You want something that doesn&#x27;t just \\&quot;trim\\&quot; off the big hairs, but gets close without leaving prickles.  In both of those areas, I will say unfortunately this Remington doesn&#x27;t match up with Norelco&#x27;s fantastic body groomer, which is so sensitive you can shave your balls while brushing your teeth, and get a close shave while you&#x27;re at it.  The Remington does leave some prickles and while it is completely safe anywhere (yes, even those \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; areas) it doesn&#x27;t quite have the design that gets every corner of your skin like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a good thing about the design though.  It&#x27;s strong and sturdy, and does knock out the big manly hairs that many body groomers struggle with.  That&#x27;s probably why it can boast as a Back Groomer as well.  The length can extend a few extra inches, but I haven&#x27;t really found any good use for that yet.  It is washable, but that&#x27;s not the same as wet/dry which is a big minus too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product a lot because it trims body hair, and I love ANYTHING that trims body hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for your first bodygroom, I&#x27;d suggest the Norelco I linked at the top, or the Epilator if you want wax-like results.  I haven&#x27;t tossed the BHT600 aside, though.  I use it regularly in my hair-removing schedule, but more or less only for trimming my beard.  I have super sensitive skin on my face that just freaks out if I use blades or electric shavers, so I just have to leave stubble all the time.  The Remington is perfect for that because it gets a close trim, but not TOO close, so that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel any trauma.re or less only for trimming my beard.

            <li> Shaver Remington BHT-600 Body and Back Groomer has some really great features and several blades for all the parts of the body, and has rechargable battery.&lt;br /&gt;The best is that it has wet use ability. Now I&#x27;m not telling you that it can be used in the bath, but using it in the shower has so far had no ill effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problems reaching his back and shoulder blades thanks to the extendable arm. The titanium infused steel blades have held up to a ton of use and that is better than I can say for other brands I have tried&lt;br /&gt;Another cool feature is that is stretches out, telescopes if you will.&lt;br /&gt;This way you have no issue getting those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say, I don&#x27;t feel like going into great detail on my need and use for this product. That said, it was definitely up to the task that spurred me to get it.</li>
            <li> Left for a business trip without it and after awhile I decided my chest hairs needed trimming, so bought another. The new one seems to have a better battery than my other one which I had bought at Kohls... who knows how long it was in the store. The Amazon one seems fresher.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer but don&#x27;t love it. It does a decent job as a groomer, but the attachments don&#x27;t impress me much.    The good points about this trimmer are that it can be used wet or dry, and that it does not tug or pull hairs that it trims. The not-so-good points are the basic uselessness of most of the attachments. After using this for over a month, the detail trimmer is the only attachment I use any more. The other attachments just don&#x27;t seem to work as well.    The extensible handle and reversible blade attachments offer a lot of flexibility, the handle extension is too short to make much of a difference, and the shape of the unit is straight enough to render the reversible attachments a moot point. It isn&#x27;t easy to groom the upper back with the vertical trimmer as I thought it would be; it just doesn&#x27;t cut trim very well, and it is easy to miss large areas with it.    The detachable combs are too long and bulky to be useful. Nothing gets trimmed when I try to use them. Using the detail and vertical trimmers without the guards works pretty well, and the naked blades do not nick or scratch the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice groomer.  Handle extends, has swivel head.  Is reasonably quiet.  Works well.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome. I can reach every inch of my back, and it gives a nice smooth shave.  No problems at all using this.</li>
            <li> This is my second unit.  The first one was great.  I got a second one but the clippers that came with it do not cut readily and I find myself making several passes when one was enough with the old one.</li>
            <li> I am 6&#x27;1&#x27;&#x27; and this does not reach my shoulder. I would not buy or recommend it to anyone with my dimensions, though am not sure how it applies to folks with other dimensions (height and width).</li>
            <li> This body and back groomer works as intended.  I needed to make several passes, but nothing to annoy me.  If you are looking for this type of product, give it a try.</li>
            <li> This product markets itself as a shaver to remove unwanted back hair.  I bought it for just that purpose.  The extendable handle does not extend very far, forcing the user to contort himself like he is in the yoga class from hell.  The groomer does have multiple heads that attach and reattach easily.  None of them shave hair very well.  Once the user twists himself into position the user must go over and over the same spot until the skin is rubbed raw.  The head designed to shave the face doesn&#x27;t remove hair any better either.  All of the heads leave long stubble behind as well.  I suppose if you are a beard wearer and want to keep it a certain length and don&#x27;t wish ot remove back hair, then this product might be useful.  However, it does not do the job it was intended to.</li>
            <li> Received the shaver quickly.  Brand new and packaged well.  The shaver worked good but it was still hard to reach my back even when the razor was extended.  Needs to be even longer.  The trimmer worked good in long hair.  Overall a good product</li>
            <li> The first thing i did was broke the clip that you press to extend the shaver, this happened while plugging in the charger.  Somehow if you hold the lower end of the handle while inserting the charger it breaks. Not a problem for me because i don&#x27;t intend to extend this for any reason.   This product is good for trimming body hair like the chest etc. However a waste of time for shaving. This hurts when trying to shave my beard and facial hair. The next day i noticed bumps on my skin as though it rooted out the hair instead of shaved it. Maybe it&#x27;s just the sensitivity of my skin. The price is okay but not worth it to me. I wanted this to be an all in one as advertised on the package, however it&#x27;s not.  I prefer buy a Gillette Fusion for shaving.</li>
            <li> I have been buying groomers for 20 years and this one has lasted and doesn&#x27;t cut.. I recommend this groomer..</li>
            <li> works well but poor quality.  Over a few years my 2nd one broke and moving to another brand/model.  I don&#x27;t use them that much so to have 2 break in a few years is a lot.  First one...ok was my fault....went to Europe and didn&#x27;t realize the cheap wall adapter is only 110V, not multi voltage...but....it is highly unusual these days to have any wall transformer plug not be both 110/220 compatible.....so that was a very cheap move on the manufacture.  2nd one the plastic body came apart and won&#x27;t snap back together so you can see the wires and batteries.  I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted enough money on these I should go get one more solid.    Update:  1/19/15:  I was contacted by customer service based on the review and offered a replacement.  I think that is very good customer service.   I have to admit as the warranty was out, I didn&#x27;t call them on asking for a replacement but perhaps should have given the chance to remedy.</li>
            <li> These are horrible clippers. I do not recommend them because they do not cut very well. You have to make at least three or four passes on one area to get the clippers to cut.</li>
            <li> The product had a crack when i recieved it. I informed it to you guys the same day.....but no action.........disappointed</li>
            <li> its absolutely great I love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three years, and it is the best body shaver for the money that I&#x27;ve had. In fact I only use the regular trimming head and the extending handle to get everything I need to get clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I&#x27;m not that hairy. If you are a Sasquatch then maybe this isn&#x27;t for you. But for Irish descent folk like me who have just a little bit of man scape-ing to do, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> could reach all my back with it</li>
            <li> I bought this in September and, 8 months later, it&#x27;s in the trash.  I bought it because I need something to trim my facial hair and thought the extender would be nice to get a few pesky backhairs.  The extender handle was great (hence the two stars vs. one star!)  However, after a few months it started doing this weird thing where it would almost &#x27;pause&#x27; while running... and god forbid if you had it in contact with your facial hair when it decided to take a break, it would pull on the hairs on your face... very painful!  Seemed to only get worse and this morning I went to use it to clean up some hair around my beard when the whole thing literally broke in half and wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  It&#x27;s now sitting in my garbage buzzing until the battery dies.  My advice, don&#x27;t buy it - poor quality.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift to replace my Norelco. As stated in a previous review the charge on mine Remington was only 5-10 minutes. Also the site description did not mention that you can only use it while not plugged in. Was not going to wait a day to use it. Returned after attempted first use.</li>
            <li> Good item would recommend</li>
            <li> handle is not long enough, does&#x27;t cut properly, DONT RECOMMEND IT.Go to a decent shop and get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Battery is terrible. Battery stopped holding a charge after just about 1 year. Now I have to charge it immediately before using (same morning) and it will not last more than about 5 minutes. I get about 3/4 of my back trimmed, then recharge 30 more minutes to get about 2 minutes out it. Finally sick of it and going to buy the Mangroomer Ultimate Pro to replace. Also it really is not long enough, and honestly, the bend should be inverse since you want the trimmer part closer to skin, not farther. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I have been able to trim my back for a few years with it. I trim about once every four months.</li>
            <li> Hello fellow Amazon shoppers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have written this review a LONG time again (back in January when I bought it). The intent was for this to be used for general body trimming and hair touch-ups. However this shaver has turned into a dust collector for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking long and hard for a general use shaver I stock with this one because of price and because I thought Remington would be a decent product. I was so excited when I received my shaver in the mail and I proceeded to get it all setup for the first use. The first problem I encountered was when I went to plug it in to charge it the handle slipped down and the button went flying off along with the springs that hold it in place. I managed to find one of the springs but never could get it to work properly again. I didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal because the handle somewhat stays in place and figured I could contact the company about the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted Remington Customer service I was given the run around and honestly talking about a body and back groomer with someone isn&#x27;t my favorite thing to do. Since they weren&#x27;t helpful and I didn&#x27;t want to pay to return the item I figured I would just keep it. When I had it charged up and used it for the first time it seemed okay. It had enough battery power, speed, and was remarkably quiet. However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I hardly use the shaver because it&#x27;s embarrassing to use. The shaver seems to still have good battery power and cuts hair but it makes so much noise and vibration I don&#x27;t want to use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly advise against purchasing this product because of the lack of quality and longevity.</li>
            <li> Do not buy. I bought it about 5 months back and used it about 4 times. Battery takes a long time to charge, can&#x27;t use it with the adapter plugged. Had only used it 4 times, and when I was about to use it again this week, it died. I charged it for hours before, it worked with a very weak charge for about a minute and then it died. I recharged it for a while, but it didn&#x27;t work after that.&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed</li>
            <li> Awful product, don&#x27;t waist your money!!!  The motor took a carp on the clippers both times I purchased the clippers</li>
            <li> Great concept, terrible product.  I won&#x27;t buy another Remington product.  They break within months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no Sasquatch, but I am covered in hair--which IS one of the qualifications for being a mammal. So there, I admit it. I&#x27;m a mammal. I need to groom places that are hard to reach sometimes. Arrest me. Better yet, give me the Remington BHT600. This puppy makes grooming those hard to reach places easy so that you don&#x27;t have to bring a companion everywhere you go to do it for you like a chimpanzee in a zoo. That may be fine for our distant evolutionary cousins, but for my money, I&#x27;ll take modern technology instead. You should too. Buy this and say goodbye to Sasquatch.</li>
            <li> when on the go i use it and it helps me be groomed and clean. the extension is also one of those addatives you dont know how you lived without</li>
            <li> When I first got it, it worked satisfactorily. However, after a few months at best of infrequent use, it would not turn on. This is even though the blue light was on and I plugged it in right after using. I contacted Remington and they sent out another. Exact same circumstances, exact same issue. Apparently, if you keep this plugged in after it is charged, it destroys the battery. Good thing my other appliances don&#x27;t work that way. For that reason and that reason alone, I cannot recommend this product as the quality is very poor and it should have been recalled. Good design but forget about using it for long.</li>
            <li> If there were two hints I took from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy is that 1) always buy your shampoo and conditioner separately, not the 2-in-1 bottles, and 2) trim your body hair.  Prior to getting the Remington Body Groomer I had been using hair clippers to trim my body hair which can start to look like Austin Powers if it goes untrimmed.  One big drawback to the hair clipper is that it is corded and it is hard to get them plugged in under the bathtub (luckily I a Jacuzzi bath otherwise my cord would not make it to the shower).  So the cordless Remington model should cut done on the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though there is less hassle, the Remington is less powerful than my hair clippers and I have to go over a couple times to get an even cut.  There are a couple different attachments, I prefer the Vertical Trimmer except it gets full of hair and have to constantly empty it.  There is also a foil attachment which is basically worthless.  The product is also listed as a back groomer, and though I luckily do not have any back hair, even if the handle extends, I do not see anyone being able to actually being able to trim their own back with it and would need a second person to help them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest flaw of the Remington Groomer is that it has no charge indicator.  Naturally I was not very happy the first time it died mid-groom and I had to walk around with half groomed legs until it was fully charged again.  Now I have to make sure it is charged before I use it ever time so I do not repeat it dying mid-trim.  Really the only good aspect of the groomer is that it is nice to trim the hair off my ears and trim my neck hair, or at least trim it down to where it is easier to shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Target and used it like once a month. The trimmer itself was ok and I liked how you could change the heads, but I wished the extended range was longer.  The worst thing about it was that after about 9 months (using once a month) it would only last about 5 minutes and now it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge at all.  Would not buy again.  Why don&#x27;t they ever make these CORDED?!?!</li>
            <li> bad product, just after the warranty ends, and not charging the battery,do not spend your money on a disposable machine</li>
            <li> Remington is a manufacturer of some great products, but the BHT600 Body and Back Groomer really fails to meet expectations.  The Remington name and the packaging all make you think you are getting a quality device.  However, I found the build quality to be sub-par and unimpressive.  It feels cheap in your hands and the extendable feature is almost a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you get the groomer unpacked you can tell that there isn&#x27;t much to it.  The shaver is light and feels cheap.  I found it to be under-powered.  The attachment selection is fairly slim and while it does extend beyond a typical shaver it doesn&#x27;t really help that much.  While a few inches can be claimed as an extension it doesn&#x27;t really make the device anymore useful.</li>
            <li> It would be a nice, convenient little device if its battery did not die within 6 months. I had the first one replaced promptly through Amazon, but the replacement failed too...  Poor quality!</li>
            <li> I have the same exact one I had bought years ago but the blades got dull and not cutting very well so I looked every where for the exact same one since I had loved and had great service from it, &amp;#34; this is the same one but it&#x27;s pure junk&amp;#34; !!!  the plastic and everything is the same but the motor barely turns on it, I had read reviews from others saying the same thing but thought they were trying to cut too much hair but they were right.. the motor is way too weak it barely works, save your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> I once had a similiar one of these, possibly an earlier model and loved it so when I found this one I grabbed it up.  This one comes with a trimmer head much like a 2 or 3 inch comb that lays perpendicular to the device.  It made for easy use and fairly wide swaths of hair removed.  The mesh pouch it came with isn&#x27;t really big enough, but my first product came in a much bigger canvas bag so i&#x27;m just using it.  My reason for needing a new one?  I dropped the old one and it fell in a manner that bent the shearing blades.  Just bad luck, nothing to do with the design.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best products I ever used.</li>
            <li> Purchased this trimmer about a year ago and used it about 6 times.  After that it just died.  It seems like the on/off switch is faulty.  It wanted to run but just couldn&#x27;t.  Overall, it did an &#x27;ok&#x27; job but I don&#x27;t have much body hair to deal with.  Doing an &#x27;ok&#x27; job doesn&#x27;t really matter if the unit fails.  There is no &#x27;charge&#x27; indicator to tell you when it&#x27;s fully charged and it does not have an auto &#x27;off&#x27; when fully charged.  This probably would have killed the battery after a short period if, by some miracle, it did not fall apart first.  I am very gentle with electronics so the quality being \\&quot;very low\\&quot;, as described by others, is truthful.  Buy at your own risk!</li>
            <li> Underpowered.  Cheaply made.  Do not use ShaverOutlet.  For returns you pay no reimb etc...........bad customer service.</li>
            <li> i like the chaving action but this model did not have the extension arm attachment so it is very difficult to get to all areas on my back.</li>
            <li> Hands down best body tremor out there!</li>
            <li> Doesnt work, not even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I try things twice cause maybe I got a bum product the first time. But the battery in this product fails to produce a charge to last more than one use around the head, and I shave my head so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m using it to groom and take my time. Sooner or later, the battery will completely fail you and you&#x27;ll find yourself either reaching for your old hair clippers, or wearing a hat to the barber shop down the road. By pass on this shaver...don&#x27;t tell ya I didn&#x27;t warn you.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these, the 2nd one being a replacement for the 1st one after 3 months.  I didn&#x27;t buy these at Amazon but I did buy their replacement on Amazon (Wahl - which I like so much better).&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) They shave pretty close and comfortable (closer than my Wahl).&lt;br /&gt;2) It extends giving you some extra reach (but not enough as you&#x27;ll see in the cons).&lt;br /&gt;3) runs fairly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) No durability.  First one I thought might be a bad egg but the 2nd one did the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;2) Battery life is terrible.  I could only get one full shave before I needed to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;3) Can&#x27;t use when it is plugged in.  This is a necessary feature for this trimmers due to the poor battery life.  Even if it had a better battery it is a great feature just in case your charge runs out when you are shaving.&lt;br /&gt;4) Extension is WAY too short to be a back trimmer.  Yes, you can reach more of the back area than a standard, non-extendable trimmer but you can&#x27;t get it all so you are left with funny looking patches of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to own a perfect trimmers but my Wahl is so much better.  Even if you don&#x27;t like the Wahl I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on this Remington.</li>
            <li> Bought this groomer recently and after several uses it no longer works. I&#x27;ve had it less than a month and will be returning it. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this trimmer for a couple of months. In addition to back hair, I tried it as a beard trimmer. It tore through my thick beard like nothing else in this price class that I&#x27;ve ever used. Great blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only extended the handle every couple of weeks when it was time to clean up the back hair, so it&#x27;s only been extended maybe 20 times. Not exactly excessive wear and tear. Tonight, the internal screws literally tore the casing to shreds as they ripped out of their holes. The whole trimmer broke in half, dangling by the internal wires. I&#x27;ve been hitting the gym, but not that hard. Completely ruined. Except for the blade, the trimmer is very cheaply built. Don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 6 months now, I use it once a month and the battery is already fading. Small blade surface so it takes a long time to use. I ended up tossing in last night and going back to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> This thing worked great at first, and I only used it for body grooming and neckline stuff. However, within about 8 months pieces of plastic from this groomer literally started falling off in my hand. It would still work though. Over time, it just started falling apart in my hand as I used it. Really odd. Even at the end of it&#x27;s life, it still worked while half broken. Just wasn&#x27;t built very solidly in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the body groomer.  The extention helps shaving my back in the places that are difficult to reach.</li>
            <li> I had to return this one and get a replacement after it stopped working suddenly.  The previous unit coroded quickly from storage in the bathroom.  For a grooming device used mostly in the bathroom it needs some material modifications to prevent quick corrosion.  Overall it works well though on all parts of the body and the extension is nice for use in removing annoying back hair.  It does not shave as close as a blade though so to completely remove hair you will need a razor, but this is good for a quick body shave.</li>
