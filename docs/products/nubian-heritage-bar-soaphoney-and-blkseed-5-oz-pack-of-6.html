            <li>The price, smell, and feel make this an awesome buy - coming back for more.</li>
            <li>I love the soaps made buy this company.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re searching for a good soap product that leaves your skin feeling fresh instead or irritated but yet still cleans well, then this would be the soap product for you.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well on my face, but has helped the rest of my body more than any prescription or otc product ever before.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and since I shave my head, I use this in place of shampoo...</li>
            <li>Buying it on Amazon gave me a better price.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap.</li>
            <li>I even use it on my kids and they love</li>
            <li>I love this soap and now I am ordering 5 pack.</li>
            <li>and I am not buying Dove any more.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this soap.</li>
            <li>I bought this from street vendors a couple of years ago and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>This soap smells wonderful, light, not a perfume type, just clean, whole.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brand of soap for years because it leaves my skins feeling smooth and clean and smells good.</li>
            <li>I think it has a pretty good lather and one bar</li>
            <li>Really good for extremely dry skin and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this soap, it smells lovely, gets my body clean and lathers well.</li>
            <li>This is great, natural product without the garbage or toxins in it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li>Gentle on skin and very easy on the nose, even an hour or two after use the scent is still present, which is a good thing in this case!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>All natural and good for your skin.</li>
            <li>It smells good and leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I buy these at Grand square superstore, which has a good soap variety but limited lotions....</li>
            <li>At first I too got that impressions when I opened the box, but when you use the soap and give it a chance it smells more like musky/honey/floral-spa.</li>
            <li>I feel clean not stripped.</li>
            <li>They not only work wonderfully at evening skintone and clarifying, but they both smell like their natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This smells infinitely better and the exfoliating grit is nice without being too much for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed it so much, I jumped on line to see what else this company has to offer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain about any of the Nubian Heritage products I&#x27;ve purchased, I just happen to like some of them better than others based on how they smell or what they do for my type of skin.</li>
            <li>I love this soap so much</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t stripping, and just leaves me feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>The item was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and the smell of the soap you could smell through the packaging.  </li>
            <li>very gentle and has improved the quality of my skin...would not want to be without it!</li>
            <li>this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I left it on my face while washing the rest, then rinsed with warm then cool water.</li>
            <li>Neeedless to say I will be back for more!</li>
            <li>My teen boys love using it!  </li>
            <li>Nice lather, lasting fragrance, long lasting, and a great price!</li>
            <li>Nubian Heritage has some great products and the Honey and Black Seed Soap is my favorite bar of soap thus far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon offers a value pack, so I can start ordering here now and save some bucks.</li>
            <li>Now I just use it for upper body and to get a nice lather on my legs for shaving.</li>
            <li>Thank you Nubian Heritage, and thanks to Amazon for making it accessible for lower prices than the coops offer.</li>
            <li>The soap that has just black seed and no honey is also a good choice.</li>
            <li>great smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I love NH products, and especially this soap.</li>
            <li>They love it, too for the same reasons.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin is looking, my entire family is using it.</li>
            <li>Excellent cleaning, if a little too dry.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean and can be a bit irritating/drying on your sensitive lady bits, so I used it there once and won&#x27;t be making that mistake again.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin extremely smooth and it smells like the sweetest most tropical delight imaginable (without any of that fake perfumy smell that plagues so many beauty products).</li>
            <li>; I will certainly be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>I feel like a traitor, as I had been really enthusiastic about Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap, and despite a positive experience with that soap, I decided to venture out a little and see what else was out there.  </li>
            <li>It really has saved my skin.</li>
            <li>and it cleans the skin very well</li>
            <li>I ordered a whole pack from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves you clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li>It also has a gorgeous lather that makes it an especially long lasting bar.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this from a local store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was wrapped in plastic shrink wrap and not taped onto the box like most other reviews.</li>
            <li>but I really had lost all hope for ever having decent skin.</li>
            <li>Some other soaps I have used, seem to leave a residue, but this soap just leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time today, wow.</li>
            <li>When you first use it, it feels a little different than what you may be used to, but after a little while it feels great!</li>
            <li>Honey and black seed soap from Nubian Heritage has to be in my top 2 favorites of the scents this company provides.</li>
            <li>you will not be sorry, thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried high end washes, treatments, beauty brushes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Nubian Heritage for the professional service.</li>
            <li>In fact, this soap smells exactly like a generic brand of plain bar soap--the kind of soap we&#x27;ve been trying to avoid by buying these natural brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sending it back right away in exchange for my trusted Nubian Heritage coconut</li>
            <li>A little messy in the shower but a great soap.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is, I wish it would last a little longer, but what good soap does.  </li>
            <li>I bought this soap because I&#x27;m a huge fan of Nubian Heritage black soap and coconut papaya soap.</li>
            <li>The dry season (Nov-Jan) is a nightmare for me, cos I have extremely dry cracked skin that becomes even more cracked-as if that was possible- and looks very unattractive.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this soap to anyone with sensitive skin or someone who prefers to use natural products.  </li>
            <li>I purchased 6 bars (price was reasonable) and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>like that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad and works up to a nice rich lather.</li>
            <li>subtle scent make it my favorite soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, with normal skin with the occasional hormonal breakout.  </li>
            <li>I have very bad allergies to a lot of products, but this soap is amazing and makes my skin so buttery smooth!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use anything else to clean my face and body since I first tried honey black seed soap a few months ago.</li>
            <li>The lather is soft, silky like whipped butter, not greasy, the little seeds are very gentle on even your face and wakes up your thighs and arms.</li>
            <li>The ONLY soap I can use for my sensitive, super-picky skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a long long time and it has never failed.</li>
            <li>I have acneic skin and a little bit of localized eczema, and this has cleared my acne up entirely and helped my eczema tremendously.</li>
            <li>you are new to Nubian Heritage, I highly suggest the coconut papaya and/or black soaps.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily keep it from getting less oily through out the day, but it does a good job of cleaning deep down in my pores without leaving it stripped or irritated and less clogged</li>
            <li>It has some great ingredients in it minus all of the bad stuff found in grocery store bars of soap.</li>

            <li> At first I too got that impressions when I opened the box, but when you use the soap and give it a chance it smells more like musky/honey/floral-spa.</li>
            <li> I feel clean not stripped.</li>
            <li> They not only work wonderfully at evening skintone and clarifying, but they both smell like their natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This smells infinitely better and the exfoliating grit is nice without being too much for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed it so much, I jumped on line to see what else this company has to offer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really complain about any of the Nubian Heritage products I&#x27;ve purchased, I just happen to like some of them better than others based on how they smell or what they do for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap so much</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t stripping, and just leaves me feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and the smell of the soap you could smell through the packaging.  </li>
            <li> very gentle and has improved the quality of my skin...would not want to be without it!</li>
            <li> this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I left it on my face while washing the rest, then rinsed with warm then cool water.</li>
            <li> Neeedless to say I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> My teen boys love using it!  </li>
            <li> Nice lather, lasting fragrance, long lasting, and a great price!</li>
            <li> Nubian Heritage has some great products and the Honey and Black Seed Soap is my favorite bar of soap thus far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon offers a value pack, so I can start ordering here now and save some bucks.</li>
            <li> Now I just use it for upper body and to get a nice lather on my legs for shaving.</li>
            <li> Thank you Nubian Heritage, and thanks to Amazon for making it accessible for lower prices than the coops offer.</li>
            <li> The soap that has just black seed and no honey is also a good choice.</li>
            <li> great smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love NH products, and especially this soap.</li>
            <li> They love it, too for the same reasons.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin is looking, my entire family is using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning, if a little too dry.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean and can be a bit irritating/drying on your sensitive lady bits, so I used it there once and won&#x27;t be making that mistake again.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin extremely smooth and it smells like the sweetest most tropical delight imaginable (without any of that fake perfumy smell that plagues so many beauty products).</li>
            <li> ; I will certainly be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I feel like a traitor, as I had been really enthusiastic about Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap, and despite a positive experience with that soap, I decided to venture out a little and see what else was out there.  </li>
            <li> It really has saved my skin.</li>
            <li> and it cleans the skin very well</li>
            <li> I ordered a whole pack from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves you clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li> It also has a gorgeous lather that makes it an especially long lasting bar.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this from a local store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was wrapped in plastic shrink wrap and not taped onto the box like most other reviews.</li>
            <li> but I really had lost all hope for ever having decent skin.</li>
            <li> Some other soaps I have used, seem to leave a residue, but this soap just leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time today, wow.</li>
            <li> When you first use it, it feels a little different than what you may be used to, but after a little while it feels great!</li>
            <li> Honey and black seed soap from Nubian Heritage has to be in my top 2 favorites of the scents this company provides.</li>
            <li> you will not be sorry, thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried high end washes, treatments, beauty brushes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Nubian Heritage for the professional service.</li>
            <li> In fact, this soap smells exactly like a generic brand of plain bar soap--the kind of soap we&#x27;ve been trying to avoid by buying these natural brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sending it back right away in exchange for my trusted Nubian Heritage coconut</li>
            <li> A little messy in the shower but a great soap.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is, I wish it would last a little longer, but what good soap does.  </li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I&#x27;m a huge fan of Nubian Heritage black soap and coconut papaya soap.</li>
            <li> The dry season (Nov-Jan) is a nightmare for me, cos I have extremely dry cracked skin that becomes even more cracked-as if that was possible- and looks very unattractive.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this soap to anyone with sensitive skin or someone who prefers to use natural products.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 6 bars (price was reasonable) and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> like that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad and works up to a nice rich lather.</li>
            <li> subtle scent make it my favorite soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, with normal skin with the occasional hormonal breakout.  </li>
            <li> I have very bad allergies to a lot of products, but this soap is amazing and makes my skin so buttery smooth!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else to clean my face and body since I first tried honey black seed soap a few months ago.</li>
            <li> The lather is soft, silky like whipped butter, not greasy, the little seeds are very gentle on even your face and wakes up your thighs and arms.</li>
            <li> The ONLY soap I can use for my sensitive, super-picky skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long long time and it has never failed.</li>
            <li> I have acneic skin and a little bit of localized eczema, and this has cleared my acne up entirely and helped my eczema tremendously.</li>
            <li> you are new to Nubian Heritage, I highly suggest the coconut papaya and/or black soaps.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily keep it from getting less oily through out the day, but it does a good job of cleaning deep down in my pores without leaving it stripped or irritated and less clogged</li>
            <li> It has some great ingredients in it minus all of the bad stuff found in grocery store bars of soap.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and other soaps bother me.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing as you want to smell as pleasant as possible after a shower.</li>
            <li> Not to sound dramatic</li>
            <li> Natural good stuff without all the bad synthetic, harsh ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> seems to last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Had to use it on my face this morning and despite having really sensitive skin, I made it through the day without issues that I would have had trying this using a typical bar</li>
            <li> WOW, it has been 40 min ago, and my skin feels tight.</li>
            <li> Skip this honey and black seed &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a major loser!</li>
            <li> This one lathers so nicely, do not even need to use much.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting,worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve tried this soap, I never went back to any other soap.</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell natural, like , I don&#x27;t know, HONEY AND BLACK SEED, perhaps apricot (due to the apricot oil).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or dry.</li>
            <li> i lather up, let dry and use as an exfoliator</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin</li>
            <li> It smells like an old church lady, like heavy soapy floral (yuck!).</li>
            <li> I have tried the Coconut&amp; papaya(really lightens complexion but be careful when using on ur face, cos</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer, I have rough skin,</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make it break out as other soaps did.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stain, and lathers extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I do not need try any other soap</li>
            <li> the black seed has helped with dark spots and dry skin</li>
            <li> Im darker than average olive toned.</li>
            <li> ; that was until I discovered the Honey &amp; black seed</li>
            <li> pores results into less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin, hard water and changing climates (hot/cold); this helps my skin survive.</li>
            <li> in the past I have used La mer, Sisley, Thalgo and so on...</li>
            <li> I not sure if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> No more rashes or scratching like crazy.</li>
            <li> But this soap stinks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the scent of this soap is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> The truth is, I hope I can always use their products because I&#x27;m used to them and how healing they are to my skin and would hate to have to switch to another product!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT!! Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> A little messy in the shower but a great soap.  Long lasting,worth the price.  Pleasant, light clean scent.  Leaves skin smooth and feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have very bad allergies to a lot of products, but this soap is amazing and makes my skin so buttery smooth! I will defiantly be buying again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 4-5 years now, non-stop, on my face and all over body. I&#x27;m glad Amazon offers a value pack, so I can start ordering here now and save some bucks. Ever since I&#x27;ve tried this soap, I never went back to any other soap. This soap is the best I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or dry. Doesn&#x27;t make it break out as other soaps did. Smells wonderful. And I love the all-natural ingredients. Thank you NH !!!</li>
            <li> LOVE (ABSOLUTELY LOVE) THE SOAP! I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT AS WELL AS ORDERING FROM THE COMPANY!!!!!! :-)</li>
            <li> We have 2 seasons in my home country, harmattan/dry and rainy seasons. The dry season (Nov-Jan) is a nightmare for me, cos I have extremely dry cracked skin that becomes even more cracked-as if that was possible- and looks very unattractive. Until I stumbled upon NH soaps, I just grinned and suffered in silence. Well, not anymore! Be warned, once u start using these soaps, I guarantee u will never go back to others. I have tried the Coconut&amp; papaya(really lightens complexion but be careful when using on ur face, cos it burns); carrot &amp; pomegranate (jury&#x27;s still out, but not my favorite); Lemongrass &amp; teatree(hmmm....very drying, but good for acne);Chai &amp; rose ( probably good for fair/sensitive skin, but did absolutey nothing for me);Raw shea butter soap &amp; cream (this is exquisite and has healed my cracked skin completely); that was until I discovered the Honey &amp; black seed soap(once a week  i lather up, let dry and use as an exfoliator, my skin actually glows-this is my favourite). I buy these at Grand square superstore, which has a good soap variety but limited lotions....in the past I have used La mer, Sisley, Thalgo and so on...literaly spending Thousands of $s... I am so grateful to the pple at NH and intend to use these products for life.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, very mild and smells beautiful!</li>
            <li> Trader Joes sells this and it is my favorite scent off all the great nubian heritage soaps. All natural and good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it smells lovely, gets my body clean and lathers well. The price is excellent, of all the soaps I&#x27;ve ordered via Amazon this is my new favorite. Neeedless to say I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time today, wow. I have used homemade soaps as they are non drying. This soap smells wonderful, light, not a perfume type, just clean, whole. The lather is soft, silky like whipped butter, not greasy, the little seeds are very gentle on even your face and wakes up your thighs and arms. I left it on my face while washing the rest, then rinsed with warm then cool water. WOW, it has been 40 min ago, and my skin feels tight. Im in my 40&#x27;s. This is great, natural product without the garbage or toxins in it. I feel clean not stripped. My skin feels softer, I have rough skin, Im darker than average olive toned. I want the 6 pack. And the coconut sounds lovely. I enjoyed it so much, I jumped on line to see what else this company has to offer.</li>
            <li> This is one thy very  best soaps I have ever used if there is someone out there that&#x27;s thinking about it buy it you will not be sorry, thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap...great smell and long lasting. Excellent cleaning, if a little too dry.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the feel, the smell.....it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I use this for my toddler at bath time, and she smells so good when she gets done! Gentle on skin and very easy on the nose, even an hour or two after use the scent is still present, which is a good thing in this case! Thank you Nubian Heritage, and thanks to Amazon for making it accessible for lower prices than the coops offer.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I&#x27;m a huge fan of Nubian Heritage black soap and coconut papaya soap. The ratings here state over and over that the scent of this soap is amazing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the scent of this soap is AWFUL. I thought it would smell natural, like , I don&#x27;t know, HONEY AND BLACK SEED, perhaps apricot (due to the apricot oil). But this soap stinks! It smells like an old church lady, like heavy soapy floral (yuck!). In fact, this soap smells exactly like a generic brand of plain bar soap--the kind of soap we&#x27;ve been trying to avoid by buying these natural brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this soap was so offensive and overpowering, I couldn&#x27;t even use it, bc it was making me gag. I&#x27;m sending it back right away in exchange for my trusted Nubian Heritage coconut soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to Nubian Heritage, I highly suggest the coconut papaya and/or black soaps. They not only work wonderfully at evening skintone and clarifying, but they both smell like their natural ingredients. Skip this honey and black seed &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a major loser!</li>
            <li> I was given this soap as a gift. I could tell the difference in my skin after using one bar. I love the way it makes my skin so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Really good for extremely dry skin and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I feel like a traitor, as I had been really enthusiastic about Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap, and despite a positive experience with that soap, I decided to venture out a little and see what else was out there.  This smells infinitely better and the exfoliating grit is nice without being too much for sensitive skin.  Had to use it on my face this morning and despite having really sensitive skin, I made it through the day without issues that I would have had trying this using a typical bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t lather white but it doesn&#x27;t stain, and lathers extremely well.  The price, smell, and feel make this an awesome buy - coming back for more.</li>
            <li> I love the soaps made buy this company. Natural good stuff without all the bad synthetic, harsh ingredients in it. I use this on my oily face and it does a good job. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily keep it from getting less oily through out the day, but it does a good job of cleaning deep down in my pores without leaving it stripped or irritated and less clogged pores results into less breakouts. It smells really good but not too strong. If you&#x27;re searching for a good soap product that leaves your skin feeling fresh instead or irritated but yet still cleans well, then this would be the soap product for you.</li>
            <li> I did not get i yet, but I know this soap, and is wonderful. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Really nice packaging.</li>
            <li> Product received as promised, No problems.</li>
            <li> Nubian Heritage has some great products and the Honey and Black Seed Soap is my favorite bar of soap thus far. It seems helpful to my dryer skin, cleanses well and the soap has a nice smell to it. I think it has a pretty good lather and one bar seems to last quite a long time. It has some great ingredients in it minus all of the bad stuff found in grocery store bars of soap. I can&#x27;t really complain about any of the Nubian Heritage products I&#x27;ve purchased, I just happen to like some of them better than others based on how they smell or what they do for my type of skin. The truth is, I hope I can always use their products because I&#x27;m used to them and how healing they are to my skin and would hate to have to switch to another product!</li>
            <li> smells great the black seed has helped with dark spots and dry skin</li>
            <li> I love NH products, and especially this soap. It really has saved my skin. I have acneic skin and a little bit of localized eczema, and this has cleared my acne up entirely and helped my eczema tremendously. Not to sound dramatic but I really had lost all hope for ever having decent skin. It doesn&#x27;t work as well on my face, but has helped the rest of my body more than any prescription or otc product ever before. It also isn&#x27;t stripping, and just leaves me feeling clean and fresh. It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad and works up to a nice rich lather.</li>
            <li> purchased this soap just on an impulse but after one bar went online and purchased a multi bar pack.  I love the smell and since I shave my head, I use this in place of shampoo...very gentle and has improved the quality of my skin...would not want to be without it!</li>
            <li> I found this is a local store but then they  sold out.  Buying it on Amazon gave me a better price.  This soap smells incredible, is gently exfoliating and helped my itchy skin!  Really, the scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered quickly. I have been using this brand of soap for years because it leaves my skins feeling smooth and clean and smells good.</li>
            <li> Love it... Nice size bars. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Smells wonderful (not perfumey at all). The exfoliating pieces are quite nice and the soap bar is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> This soap is to die for. I am not joking you--I am on maybe my 40th bar of it? I&#x27;ve been using it for a long long time and it has never failed. It keeps my skin extremely smooth and it smells like the sweetest most tropical delight imaginable (without any of that fake perfumy smell that plagues so many beauty products). It also has a gorgeous lather that makes it an especially long lasting bar. I shower a lot and use a lot of product when I use it but just for comparison, a standard Dove bar lasts me one week. This bar lasts me one month. It rinses clean and can be a bit irritating/drying on your sensitive lady bits, so I used it there once and won&#x27;t be making that mistake again. Now I just use it for upper body and to get a nice lather on my legs for shaving. Tropical paradise!</li>
            <li> I love this soap so much I gave  a bar to each of my 3 nieces.  They love it, too for the same reasons.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smell great it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and it cleans the skin very well I would recommend this soap to anyone with sensitive skin or someone who prefers to use natural products.  The delivery was quick and the smell of the soap you could smell through the packaging.  Thanks Nubian Heritage for the professional service.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful.  It smells awesome.  I purchased 6 bars (price was reasonable) and use it daily.  It helps moisturize my skin and at my age, I need all the help I can get! :)  I would highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap. I don&#x27;t use anything else to clean my face and body since I first tried honey black seed soap a few months ago. I even use it on my kids and they love it.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans well, rinses well, smells great, and soothes skin. Great purchase</li>
            <li> Honey and black seed soap from Nubian Heritage has to be in my top 2 favorites of the scents this company provides.</li>
            <li> Someone review this product as smelling like a grandma. I would disagree. I originally purchased this from a local store. At first I too got that impressions when I opened the box, but when you use the soap and give it a chance it smells more like musky/honey/floral-spa. I not sure if that makes sense. I liked it so much I ordered a whole pack from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was wrapped in plastic shrink wrap and not taped onto the box like most other reviews. Happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> Nice lather, lasting fragrance, long lasting, and a great price! It&#x27;s awesome exfoliating in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin is looking, my entire family is using it. My son complains of itching skin and since he is using this soap his itching skin has eased.</li>
            <li> This soap is by far the best soap out there.  It smells good and leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best! When you first use it, it feels a little different than what you may be used to, but after a little while it feels great! It is soothing on the skin and I would recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> I  have to add my own review too. I love this soap and now I am ordering 5 pack. It is absolutely the best soap I ever used. It makes my skin soooooo clean and it does smell very nice too. I do not need try any other soap and I am not buying Dove any more. This one lathers so nicely, do not even need to use much.  And I can use it all over my body, not just a face.</li>
            <li> My daughter skin as improved drastically.  So glad I found this soap. No more rashes or scratching like crazy. Great product. This is our second order. We will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, with normal skin with the occasional hormonal breakout.  I&#x27;ve tried high end washes, treatments, beauty brushes.  I always come back to this soap. It works the best.  Keeps my skin clear.  Smells amazing.  May be the teensiest bit drying in the winter.  I counteract with extra moisturizer at night.  It all works out.  I also recommend the aquasana shower filter.  Best combo I&#x27;ve found for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap!  My teen boys love using it!  It has a gender neutral smell and they and I have both noticed an improvement in acne with its use.  The soap that has just black seed and no honey is also a good choice.</li>
            <li> I like the smell. I  like that it&#x27;s natural. Smell is not overpowering.  Softens skin.  I like this and the coconut one. My skin is sensitive and other soaps bother me.</li>
            <li> I bought this from street vendors a couple of years ago and fell in love.  It&#x27;s richness, non-drying formula, and subtle scent make it my favorite soap.  It&#x27;s especially good in winter.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Has helped close the blackheads on my nose and you can see how well it exfoliates in the shower.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap!  The smell is amazing and my skin feels great after each use.  Some other soaps I have used, seem to leave a residue, but this soap just leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. The only thing is, I wish it would last a little longer, but what good soap does.  Thank you for offering this on Amazon, otherwise, I have to drive an hour away from home to buy it!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Leaves you clean but not dry.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> The ONLY soap I can use for my sensitive, super-picky skin. A great price here; I will certainly be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> This soap used to have a very pleasant smell to it, but now it seems to have no smell at all. Very disappointing as you want to smell as pleasant as possible after a shower.</li>
            <li> This is just wonderful.  It provides a rich lather and feels wonderful.  I suffer from dry skin, hard water and changing climates (hot/cold); this helps my skin survive.</li>
            <li> I like the soap,moisturizing. Problem was the color left stain on my ivory washcloths.</li>
