            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>good all around product and price.</li>
            <li>Amazing soap</li>
            <li>I have used it most of my life and it is still as good as ever, nothing can replace it for the use I use it.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the store.  </li>
            <li>We love Lava soap in this family so, of course, we are pleased with out purchase - my husband even uses it to bathe with -</li>
            <li>Better prices here than grocery stores.</li>
            <li>What happened to the OLD great Lava Soap???</li>
            <li>Great product when on the property with poison oak and general cleanup.</li>
            <li>said it gets his hands clean as a whistle &amp; it makes</li>
            <li>Nice soap but not as gritty as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>better price and does the same job as Go Jo.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live with out it!!</li>
            <li>As an aritst, working with many different matierals, I depended on it, and even tried all the new cleansers.</li>
            <li>Both of these cut WAY down on its abilituy to really scrub and be the great gritty cleanser it used to be, that gets stuff OFF your hands.  </li>
            <li>and it really cleans his hands well.</li>
            <li>He highly recommends it!</li>
            <li>Removes paint; stain; engine grease; most anything from your skin and exfoliates rough areas at the same time.  </li>

            <li>his hands&lt;br /&gt;feel soft.  </li>
            <li>it is great for removing dead skin and keeping you soft and clean not to mention that extra cleaning power for dirty hands...</li>

            <li> Our family has been using Lava soap for over 25 years.  Removes paint; stain; engine grease; most anything from your skin and exfoliates rough areas at the same time.  Amazing soap</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the store.  Husband a farmer and it really cleans his hands well.</li>
            <li> What happened to the OLD great Lava Soap??? It used to beat ALL the other newcomers in getting just about everything off my hands. As an aritst, working with many different matierals, I depended on it, and even tried all the new cleansers. But now they have added Moisturizers!!!! And WD-40! WHY?!! Both of these cut WAY down on its abilituy to really scrub and be the great gritty cleanser it used to be, that gets stuff OFF your hands.  Now it&#x27;s like any hand soap with just a touch of grit. This was definitely a case of &amp;#34;if it works don&#x27;t change it.&amp;#34; And I am stuck with 12 bars that will cost too much to ship back.</li>
            <li> Great product when on the property with poison oak and general cleanup.</li>
            <li> We love Lava soap in this family so, of course, we are pleased with out purchase - my husband even uses it to bathe with - it is great for removing dead skin and keeping you soft and clean not to mention that extra cleaning power for dirty hands...</li>
            <li> Only hand soap my husband will use after a days work...</li>
            <li> diesel mechanic by trade and its the only thing that works well.</li>
            <li> Nice soap but not as gritty as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> have used this for years.  Removes lots of things.</li>
            <li> It was everything that I expected. The soap does the job well.</li>
            <li> Bought this oldie-but-goodie brand of soap for my mechanic son.&lt;br /&gt;He said it gets his hands clean as a whistle &amp; it makes his hands&lt;br /&gt;feel soft.  He highly recommends it!</li>
            <li> good all around product and price. on time delivery. recommend this purchase. been using Lava since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like???</li>
            <li> Works great.  Pretty expensive for 1 bar though. I accidently ordered it.  I knew Lava works great!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with out it!!</li>
            <li> better price and does the same job as Go Jo.</li>
            <li> If you use the soap why do you need to grade it?  I have used it most of my life and it is still as good as ever, nothing can replace it for the use I use it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find but it&#x27;s still the best work soap. Better prices here than grocery stores.</li>
