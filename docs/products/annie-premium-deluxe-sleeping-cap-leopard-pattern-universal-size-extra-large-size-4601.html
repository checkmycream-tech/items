            <li>The night cap works great on my flexi rods sets and oil treatments when I go to sleep.</li>
            <li>This is a very lovely bonnet.</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I love this bonnet!</li>
            <li>I have a really nice satin sleep cap that I bought on Etsy and use every night, but I was looking for a satin cap that I could keep in my travel bag.  </li>
            <li>with many attempts to wear it, I&#x27;ve decided that I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s OK for the price, but there are better options out there.</li>
            <li>I love the scarf alot</li>
            <li>What cute sleeping cap.</li>
            <li>Not only does the elastic have a great fit, but the design looks even better than it looks on the package!</li>
            <li>Could have nicer material but overall great</li>
            <li>so I love that it fits right around my head an stuff</li>
            <li>Very nicely sewn bonnet just wish it were bigger.</li>
            <li>, RIGHT?!)  </li>
            <li>inside is not satin, very hot on head</li>
            <li>Its so silky and soft :) ,</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised that this sleeping cap was a really comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>The cap looks exactly like the picture and is made of lightweight material:</li>
            <li>This however is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>The satin on this is OK, but it&#x27;s not super soft and silky, and the inner lining is a mesh that doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be great for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Super soft and no stains on your pillowcases.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t too much like the inside layer of the cap because it had cotton instead of satin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like this bonnet.</li>
            <li>will last me awhile, but if the elastic keeps bothering me, I will look for a different kind.</li>
            <li>Wearing a sleeping cap is very new to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a zebra print fanatic and i love my bonnet!</li>
            <li>This runs very small, but is cute!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, a few inches past my shoulders, and a small head, and this holds all  my hair, tied up in a pony tail, perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Quiet big and can cover the hair with bold braids on and stays on all through the night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural and it just fits my hair.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why especially when I was excited that it is Leopard print.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because it stated that it&#x27;s an XL bonnet--I planned on using this to sleep when I put my hair on flexi rods but it is not even remotely what I consider to be extra large.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Wearing a sleeping cap is very new to me.  I just started using the Deva Curl products and a cap is recommended to help keep your curls from not getting ruined from  tossing and turning in bed.  I ordered the Leopard cap because it matches my leopard nightgown. However, when I wear something else to bed I can reverse the cap to the other side, which is white.  (A Deva must ALWAYS  match, RIGHT?!)  The cap looks exactly like the picture and is made of lightweight material: satin on one side,  lined with mesh on the other.  I have fine hair, a few inches past my shoulders, and a small head, and this holds all  my hair, tied up in a pony tail, perfectly.  It would not work for someone with really thick, long hair.  An elastic band around the edge of the cap is what keeps it on, but sometimes it bothers me and I end up taking it off in my sleep.  I will also have an indentation on my forehead from where the elastic was.  Some of the edging on the ruffles is  not sewn well and the material where the parts were missed is beginning to fray &amp; I&#x27;ve only had this a couple of weeks.  I have not tried to wash it yet, but will definitely wash it by hand when I do.  It  was a great price and I&#x27;m sire will last me awhile, but if the elastic keeps bothering me, I will look for a different kind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a zebra print fanatic and i love my bonnet! Thank you</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t too much like the inside layer of the cap because it had cotton instead of satin. I did like the print but it was smaller than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair. I&#x27;m natural and it just fits my hair. Very nicely sewn bonnet just wish it were bigger.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this bonnet. I bought it because it stated that it&#x27;s an XL bonnet--I planned on using this to sleep when I put my hair on flexi rods but it is not even remotely what I consider to be extra large. I also wanted to use it to preserve my curls when I put my hair in a pineapple instead of using my satin scarf. All bad.... every time I used it, it made my head sweat. I tried it several times and it was the same result each time. I&#x27;m not really sure about the purpose of the lining but I could have done without buying this. I was drawn to it because of the leopard print and the &amp;#34;XL&amp;#34; size but with many attempts to wear it, I&#x27;ve decided that I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I have a really nice satin sleep cap that I bought on Etsy and use every night, but I was looking for a satin cap that I could keep in my travel bag.  The satin on this is OK, but it&#x27;s not super soft and silky, and the inner lining is a mesh that doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be great for your hair.  I may end up just turning this inside out to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s OK for the price, but there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> Love them! Doesn&#x27;t moe around and not too tight! Lots of room inside. Super soft and no stains on your pillowcases.</li>
            <li> Its so silky and soft :) , but on the other hand outta of no where the edges started tearing. When all I do is take it off when time to and put it on when needed to.</li>
            <li> I love this bonnet! Not only does the elastic have a great fit, but the design looks even better than it looks on the package! Great buy!</li>
            <li> The satin is on the outside. I am not sure why especially when I was excited that it is Leopard print.  The label does say &amp;#34;Reversible&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair products in hair and off pillow. Fits my head and stays on.</li>
            <li> Nice design, fits perfectly I have a small head so I love that it fits right around my head an stuff</li>
            <li> Could have nicer material but overall great</li>
            <li> This runs very small, but is cute!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this cap because of the print. It has started to fray a little. That is the only issue.</li>
            <li> inside is not satin, very hot on head</li>
            <li> I love the scarf alot it fits my big head and I have a lot of hair just gotta get used to keeping it on my head</li>
            <li> What cute sleeping cap. It stays in place and I like it.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised that this sleeping cap was a really comfortable fit. The size was just as described and the quality of the fabric is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased Satin Sleep Caps in the past that were just horrible and seriously a waste of money. This however is exactly what I wanted and yes I will recommend this item to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> The night cap works great on my flexi rods sets and oil treatments when I go to sleep. I took off both night cap and silk scarf in the morning and see the results. I felt blessed when my hair turn out curly,wavy, and moisture from oils.</li>
            <li> This is a very lovely bonnet. Quiet big and can cover the hair with bold braids on and stays on all through the night. I will definitely recommend it.</li>
