            <li>Really good soap especially on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>when I was intimate with someone it kind of freaked them out.</li>
            <li>I have been using this soap for months and it not only smells great but is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin beautifully smooth.</li>
            <li>They enjoyed the product so much they requested more of it....</li>
            <li>It lathers beautifully and lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li>you are looking for something like this, or mix up a new soap for your daily regimen, I believe you will be very happy with the Manuka soap.</li>
            <li>I originally sent this to a family member who had an issue with skin sensitivity after taking a medication.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, softens skin, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>but after you use it, it leaves a light sweet</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited to get in the shower as soon as I received the package.</li>
            <li>I have been using this soap to help my mother keep her pressure wounds clean</li>
            <li>I have been using facial soaps for about 10 years to try and rid myself of pimples, so far this is the best.</li>
            <li>Very nice and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and the bars are generously sized, so they last for a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sweet smelling and gentle, love this soap</li>
            <li>make the skin feel fresh and comfortable feel</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to love this soap.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and has a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the honey, propolis and mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The soaps are octagonal and very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, and my Mom loves it!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t quite get a good grip the first couple of weeks, but it does last me months.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it keep your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>so I am always looking around for gentle soaps and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>We were on the hunt for some more natural preventive solutions to help her.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice personal touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh, it rinses off without leaving a film.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the soap smells divine, lathers well and feels good going on and rinses away well; however, it dried my skin out which is what I didn&#x27;t want it to do.</li>
            <li>First the positive:</li>
            <li>Size better than expected, love the aroma of honey from soap, skin feels softer as result from using soap, will buy in the future</li>
            <li>Gentle and soothing on my skin (which is oily and acne-prone and pretty much allergic to everything).</li>
            <li>As a result of the synthetic dyes, I can&#x27;t recommend this soap and certainly won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t this product alone since I have changed quite a few things, but this will stay in the rotation for sure!</li>
            <li>Now everyone wants to use it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The whole family uses this.</li>
            <li>It does very well what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>The scent translated very well on the skin</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>My only concern is my skin is not so smoothly, maybe it&#x27;s because it is organic.</li>
            <li>Now, that may not be a negative to some as I passed one off to my mother and she loved it.</li>
            <li>and I felt an overall clean sensation.</li>
            <li>my dog and husband developed the exact symptoms.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not exactly &amp;#34;pretty.&amp;#34; But as a teenage (and sometimes current) afflicted facial acne sufferer, this is the greatest soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the h3ll is in it, I think it may use some kind of dark magic, but it could be made with the tears of small children</li>
            <li>As I broke open the package I noticed the pleasant smell, not strong, but distinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked up natural skin remedies and found multiple articles talking about how raw Manuka honey and propolis, which is found in the wax that bees create, does great things for skin restoration.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d had it in high school.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this article.</li>
            <li>only does it leave my skin feeling clean and soft but razor burn no more!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product</li>
            <li>I tried this in New Zealand and had to buy some additional bars.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have tried face/ skinwashes aplenty.</li>
            <li>My mom has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This did not leave my face moisturized and soft like my normal routine.</li>
            <li>In 2 weeks her legs were clear.  </li>
            <li>It exfoliates and leaves my skin ever so soft.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural healing power.</li>
            <li>Our young daughter was having frequent MRSA skin infections requiring oral antibiotics.  </li>
            <li>This soap in addition to a \\&quot;as needed\\&quot; naturally antibiotic lotion (contains:</li>
            <li>Propolis is known for it&#x27;s anti-blemish and natural antibacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a much higher quality product than I expected.</li>
            <li>My husband also has skin problems and we can see a significant improvement in only a few days.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is a decent albeit pricey soap since I will use it for guests and hand washing only....</li>
            <li>She is generally a \\&quot;rashy\\&quot; kid.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it clear up acne and prevent it from coming back, but even cuts bruises heal faster with this stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin has changed dramatically over the past few months for the better.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m on a honey bee kick here as of late and was very intrigued in seeing a propolis soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s bigger than I expected-</li>
            <li> soap has calmed down my entire household and we are so grateful to include this in our daily regimen.</li>
            <li> a total tragedy in my life until we found this soap and lots of other remedies.  </li>
            <li> you know how well it treats dry chapped lips.</li>
            <li> My mom has had very dry skin on her legs creating scaly itchy  and sometimes scabbed areas.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling dry like other soaps and washes.</li>
            <li> It was tight and dry.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> used after surgery and i healed with out any problems.</li>
            <li> nuxe but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Size better than expected, love the aroma of honey from soap, skin feels softer as result from using soap, will buy in the future</li>
            <li> I love this product, it keep your skin very soft.  I will continue to use it and I also recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I had some discoloration and scarring in my &amp;#34;bathing suit&amp;#34; area that was kind of upsetting because when I was intimate with someone it kind of freaked them out. I looked up natural skin remedies and found multiple articles talking about how raw Manuka honey and propolis, which is found in the wax that bees create, does great things for skin restoration. If you&#x27;ve ever used Burts Bees wax you know how well it treats dry chapped lips. So when I found this soap I was stoked.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a week, every time I shower and I can already see results which is great.</li>
            <li> This is a much higher quality product than I expected. I have been using this soap to help my mother keep her pressure wounds clean and since we have been using Medihoney we decided to buy a honey soap. Now everyone wants to use it. If you care about your skin I truly recommend you try this. It&#x27;s a small investment in your skin health.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Works good for someoe that suffer with MRSA. My grandaughter use to have bad break outs and now she doesn&#x27;t. The soap does last a loooooooooooong time as long as u leave it out of way of over spray from the shower. O and it has nice scent also</li>
            <li> make the skin feel fresh and comfortable feel</li>
            <li> This soap is the best. My husband had this weird rash on his legs and in 4 days healing after months and different medications from the dr. My skin has never been better. This is now the only soap we buy.</li>
            <li> Only bar soap I use.  Very nice and lasts a long time.  Like manuka honey in products because of skin allergies to other products.</li>
            <li> This soap is one of nicest cleansers I&#x27;ve ever showered with.  It exfoliates and leaves my skin ever so soft.  My husband, who has problem skin is also impressed and believes it has improved his skin.</li>
            <li> I volunteered at a local hospice and caught the worst strain ever of MRSA at a nursing home.  Be sure you can get this infection ANYWHERE these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It ruined my life.  I almost died from the colonization.  I cried for days thinking MRSA would surely kill me.  Everything I tried just worked temporarily and then it would come back stronger than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my dog and husband developed the exact symptoms.  We all still have it months later.  I have found that remedies known to cure it can make it even stronger as it builds resistance.  So beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a total tragedy in my life until we found this soap and lots of other remedies.  You have to throw everything but the kitchen sink at MRSA with all you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has calmed down my entire household and we are so grateful to include this in our daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this soap to a lot of my friends already&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it leave my skin feeling clean and soft but razor burn no more!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product</li>
            <li> I appreciate the honey, propolis and mild fragrance.  However, I don&#x27;t like the synthetic dyes that this soap contains and wish I would have know about them before making the purchase.  As a result of the synthetic dyes, I can&#x27;t recommend this soap and certainly won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
            <li> Best smelling soap ever made. Gentle and soothing on my skin (which is oily and acne-prone and pretty much allergic to everything). Great smell and the bars are generously sized, so they last for a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soaps are octagonal and very pretty. You could totally set this out as a fancy hand soap if you&#x27;re having houseguests.</li>
            <li> I originally sent this to a family member who had an issue with skin sensitivity after taking a medication.  They enjoyed the product so much they requested more of it.... Wonderful stuff.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this soap. I was a forever Dove soap person until someone in the family caught staph. I did a lot of research and found out Manuka is great at fighting off staph. Manuka is such a wonderful ingredient. I wish people knew more about it&#x27;s natural healing power. The whole family uses this. I highly recommend it. it can also help those with eczema and other skin issues.</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling and gentle, love this soap</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to love this soap. I was checking out all the other reviews; and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for me and my &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; skin. I suffer from dermatitis and have dry, scaly skin in summer and winter and at times it can be an oil slick. I have tried several soaps, creams, medications, you-name-it, I&#x27;ve probably tried it. My skin is impossible. Anyway, the soap smells divine, lathers well and feels good going on and rinses away well; however, it dried my skin out which is what I didn&#x27;t want it to do. Overall, it is a decent albeit pricey soap since I will use it for guests and hand washing only....maybe it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for months and it not only smells great but is good for sensitive skin. Lathers well and the lowest price i have seen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to usually provide beauty tips. I&#x27;m not exactly &amp;#34;pretty.&amp;#34; But as a teenage (and sometimes current) afflicted facial acne sufferer, this is the greatest soap I&#x27;ve ever used. I wish I&#x27;d had it in high school. Not only does it clear up acne and prevent it from coming back, but even cuts bruises heal faster with this stuff. I don&#x27;t know what the h3ll is in it, I think it may use some kind of dark magic, but it could be made with the tears of small children and I wouldn&#x27;t care. This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I tried this in New Zealand and had to buy some additional bars. It lathers beautifully and lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing these manuka honey soaps for years. Great for oily skin or skin that is just breaking out. Will continue to purchase this product time and time again.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried face/ skinwashes aplenty. I did some research about Manuka Honey and thought I would give the soap a try. I have been using it as a face wash for about 2months now and have been very impressed. I&#x27;am prone to breakouts and with the help of this soap it has helped tame my skin(fingers crossed) It doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling dry like other soaps and washes. I have been using facial soaps for about 10 years to try and rid myself of pimples, so far this is the best. May not work for all but, I&#x27;am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Excellent soap and great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This soap did the trick. It definitely helped my dog&#x27;s skin problem. It&#x27;s also great for my prickly heat rash.</li>
            <li> Our young daughter was having frequent MRSA skin infections requiring oral antibiotics.  We were on the hunt for some more natural preventive solutions to help her.  She is generally a \\&quot;rashy\\&quot; kid.  This soap in addition to a \\&quot;as needed\\&quot; naturally antibiotic lotion (contains: aloe vera gel, green tea extract, eucalyptus smithii, frankincense, geranium, lavender, orange, rosalina, rosemary and tea tree) has changed her (and our) lives.  Since using this soap(about a year now)she has not required oral antibiotics even one time.  It smells great and lasts quite a long time.  I can&#x27;t reccommend it enough!</li>
            <li> Have  already repurchased some.  I no longer use traditional soap, I only use this. My skin has changed dramatically over the past few months for the better.  It wasn&#x27;t this product alone since I have changed quite a few things, but this will stay in the rotation for sure!</li>
            <li> Beautiful soap with a rich lather that smells wonderfully.  If you love your skin this soap is for you. I would recommend to anyone and I will be purchasing more as well.</li>
            <li> Smells great, softens skin, lasts a long time. It&#x27;s wonderful Manuka honey properties are great for people with skin problems, too!</li>
            <li> I can tell such a difference in my skin since beginning using this product!  I have acne on my face and back (not severe) and this cleared it up.  My husband also has skin problems and we can see a significant improvement in only a few days.  We ordered this because we both have has problems with staph infections.  We are hoping this will help prevent more outbreaks of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could smell the soap through two boxes and the packaging it came in when it arrived at the house and it smells amazing!  It is very strong just sitting there but after you use it, it leaves a light sweet scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that they put a company card in the packing.  It was a nice personal touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering this again and hopefully from Koru Naturals LLC.</li>
            <li> My partner and I love this soap!  It lathers very well and has a lovely scent.  It leaves the skin beautifully smooth. We intend to buy some more for us and to give as Christmas stocking gifts.</li>
            <li> My mom has very sensitive skin so I am always looking around for gentle soaps and this fit the bill.  Very gentle, and my Mom loves it! I will continue to keep her supplied with this great product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to have purchased this item. It does very well what it is supposed to do. I highly recommend this article.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a honey bee kick here as of late and was very intrigued in seeing a propolis soap. Propolis is known for it&#x27;s anti-blemish and natural antibacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to get in the shower as soon as I received the package. As I broke open the package I noticed the pleasant smell, not strong, but distinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got in the shower and absolutely loved how this soap felt. The scent translated very well on the skin and I felt an overall clean sensation. Feels very good on the face as well, it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something like this, or mix up a new soap for your daily regimen, I believe you will be very happy with the Manuka soap.</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to eczema breakouts when the weather gets dry/cold. I hadn&#x27;t had to deal with eczema until recent years. But when I breakout, it can get painful to bathe.  I had been searching manuka oil  products on Amazon when I came upon this soap. It was such a relief for my cracked, itchy skin.  It won&#x27;t heal it eczema, but at least it made bathing tolerable. Such a life saver for me at the times I break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bigger than I expected- about 3 inches across, and octagonal in shape. Can&#x27;t quite get a good grip the first couple of weeks, but it does last me months.</li>
            <li> First the positive: the packaging and design of these soaps are so adorable. The octagon shape is helpful to minimize slippage in the shower or at the sink. Now on to the negative: The smell is not indicative of honey at all. It smells like public bathroom soap. Now, that may not be a negative to some as I passed one off to my mother and she loved it. I bought these in hopes it would replace my usual (messier) routine of washing my face with regular manuka honey in a jar. This did not leave my face moisturized and soft like my normal routine. It was tight and dry. Which might be good for you if you have oily skin. I was also put off by the rather long list of dyes and other questionable ingredients. My hunt will continue for a manuka honey soap/ cleanser. I&#x27;m relegating this to the bathroom for hand soap.</li>
            <li> My mom has had very dry skin on her legs creating scaly itchy  and sometimes scabbed areas.  We had tried all sorts of creams and soaps with no help. I bought this soap and asked her to try it. In 2 weeks her legs were clear.  The smell is fresh, it rinses off without leaving a film. Just ordered again for the 3rd time.</li>
            <li> Its smells good, but pricey. I wish it could last longer</li>
            <li> Really good soap especially on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Really liked this soap.  Very moisturizing.  Stops me from itching, which is always a problem for me in the winter.  Delivery was quick.  Planning on buying more.</li>
            <li> Love the soap. It feels great on the skin and I have a sensitive skin. Also it is a long lasting</li>
            <li> i like it, the smell is very good. My only concern is my skin is not so smoothly, maybe it&#x27;s because it is organic.</li>
