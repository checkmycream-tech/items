            <li>I don&#x27;t think it sets foundation nicely</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I liked the packaging-</li>
            <li>After hearing all the buzz on the Ben Nye powder, I called my makeup artist friend and asked if I can use it once to see if I liked it.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is very nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW- shipping was quick and the seller was great.</li>
            <li>If you are fair, light, or light/ medium, do not buy this powder.  </li>

            <li>I have always wanted to try banana powder because of all the hype around it and am so glad I got to try this Graftobian HD LuxeCashmere setting powder.</li>
            <li>This gives way more color than I had hoped.</li>
            <li>This ok i feel like bananna powder would be better make sure to apply with sponge or something damp</li>
            <li>Not cakey  and perfect for all over your face if you have yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>The ben nye banana powder is much better.</li>
            <li>I love love this üçå powder</li>
            <li>This is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It was pretty good...</li>
            <li>It prevents my concealer from creasing and keeps it looking flawless all day long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth, I like it better than Ben Nye&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>Love this for setting my under eye concealer, it is so smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it went on easily.</li>
            <li>I would say if you are medium to dark complected, this will be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li>This powder is finely milled, so it doesn&#x27;t clump up on your skin...</li>
            <li>Not as finely milled and this clumps up.</li>
            <li>Its so finely milled it feels like silk and keeps my concealer in place all day.</li>
            <li>in particular i love the fact the powder isnt transparent, i use it for only my undreyes and its great!</li>
            <li>Fast quick delivery and a good alternative for Ben nye banana powder.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super excited to have the opportunity to try this one out!  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic setting powder for my under eye concealer.</li>
            <li>I have really light skin</li>
            <li>, read that it was a super fine powder</li>
            <li>Omg the product is amazing their isn&#x27;t any powdery flash back in picture or nothing I love it.</li>
            <li>I still have basically a full jar, not to mention</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this works on many skin tones as I have been sharing it with my niece and we have completely different skin tones.  </li>
            <li>It gives a natural smooth and matte finish that I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery will order again</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it alot and will be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li>Still liked it enough to order it, until I came online</li>
            <li>and this actually turned out really nice,</li>
            <li>I cant use it for a setting powder due to the color and my fair skin.</li>
            <li>so if you like a light powder it will be satisfactory but for high coverage preference, it will need a bit of work.</li>
            <li>Texture is a bit more fine as well and doesn&#x27;t leave so much of that yellow cast as banana powder does.</li>
            <li>It is super soft and smooth and blends effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Waaaaaaaaay better than Ben Nye banana powder, especially on darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>I applied it with my flat top kabuki</li>
            <li>The powder is super soft and blends very well!  </li>
            <li>I have never tried any other brands banana powder but this will not disappoint if you want a good professional product don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
            <li>The ingredients feel a bit coarse; I would say like finely grounded cornmeal.  </li>
            <li>Graftobian was kind of cakey like blending was a little harder with a puff...but blended ok with a brush.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face mostly matte but does let me get a little naturally dewy which make my foundation look natural and like skin not like makeup which I love.</li>
            <li>This has not irritated my skin and really helps to keep my foundation in place all day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this powder!</li>
            <li>Really like this powder, will purchase again.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t apply very well.</li>
            <li>Plus this company does not provide tool to apply powder; a puff/sponge would have been appreciated...</li>
            <li>the size is very generous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tired Ben NYe...</li>
            <li>It just does not measure up to dermablend original (white)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than other banana setting powders</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic setting powder that does not irritate and keeps foundation in place all day long.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this powder because I was looking for something to compare to another popular banana setting powder that&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; and soft.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s authentic</li>
            <li>I even shared my purchase with a very skeptical close friend who definitely agreed that this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>I love how the color helps to correct skin discoloration, especially for dark circles under the eye.  </li>
            <li>and my face gets very blotchy , enlarged pores and very red  </li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the Ben Nye powder felt quite heavy on my skin</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much at all, a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>The colour is as described, very natural looking yellow shade.</li>
            <li>This powder did the exact opposite on my skin and made my under eye area look very dark.  </li>

            <li> Great dupe for the Ben Nye banana powder. I use the Soniaxfyza method to buff my product into the skin (oily skin) and it works well for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great on all skin types and tones.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Omg the product is amazing their isn&#x27;t any powdery flash back in picture or nothing I love it. I will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> This powder is finely milled, so it doesn&#x27;t clump up on your skin... It&#x27;s so smooth, I like it better than Ben Nye&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Feels very light on your face this is just as good as ben nye it seals your concealer in place perfectly</li>
            <li> I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion/feedback.  I have been looking for a good setting powder for quite some time and I&#x27;m super excited to have the opportunity to try this one out!  The powder is super soft and blends very well!  I love the fact that this works on many skin tones as I have been sharing it with my niece and we have completely different skin tones.  This has not irritated my skin and really helps to keep my foundation in place all day. It also helps with setting my under the eye concealer.  I highly recommend this powder!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and absolutely loved it! Fast quick delivery and a good alternative for Ben nye banana powder.The texture is very soft,smooth and finely blended to provide an excellent setting powder.I even shared my purchase with a very skeptical close friend who definitely agreed that this product is awesome.Five stars to the seller!!Reorder is a must have and now I have someone else purchasing this wonderful item!Thank you so much!Thanks also too Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am completely pleased with the tone, texture, and coverage of this setting powder. I am very light skinned and this matched my complection perfectly. The coverage is very nice and smooth. I did receive this product for an honest unbiased review. My over all opinion of this setting powder is that it is a great product with very nice packaging.</li>
            <li> Not as finely milled as banana powder unfortunately</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful setting powder.  I am giving it two stars, because I could not use it.  I would say if you are medium to dark complected, this will be perfect for you.  If you are fair, light, or light/ medium, do not buy this powder.  I purchased to set my under eye concealer as yellow powder typically brightens your under eye.  This powder did the exact opposite on my skin and made my under eye area look very dark.  Not a fan.</li>
            <li> This is nothing compared to my Ben bye banana powder! I only kept this because of the container! the consistency is way more talc like. Not as finely milled and this clumps up. Nothing like Ben bye!</li>
            <li> Makes my makeup look flawless!</li>
            <li> As an MUA this isn&#x27;t bad. Its not as good as Anastasia or Ben nye but it is good and I use it personally and on clients.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic setting powder that does not irritate and keeps foundation in place all day long.  It gives a natural smooth and matte finish that I absolutely love.  Some powders irritate my skin and leave me itching after a while.  This powder has none of those irritants and I can leave it on all day without any problems.  It is the perfect finishing touch to my daily make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled that I received a complimentary sample of this setting powder exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Blends well and does not look like a mask when your pic is taken. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Really like this powder, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the yellow color on my face</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t decided if I like this yet.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time. Worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this powder because I was looking for something to compare to another popular banana setting powder that&#x27;s hard to find. I love this powder. Its so finely milled it feels like silk and keeps my concealer in place all day. I will be repurchasing when this runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW- shipping was quick and the seller was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not suggesting that this powder is bad by giving it 3stars. It just does not measure up to dermablend original (white) atleast in my opinion... The ingredients feel a bit coarse; I would say like finely grounded cornmeal.  I don&#x27;t think it sets foundation nicely and it doesn&#x27;t apply very well. Plus this company does not provide tool to apply powder; a puff/sponge would have been appreciated...&lt;br /&gt;Just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Definitely will not be a return customer, I&#x27;ve returned to Dermablend; sold in Ulta, Sephora or JC Penny.</li>
            <li> Little sunshine on your face.</li>
            <li> This is a great setting powder, looks great on chocolate skin.</li>
            <li> I love this powder! It is super soft and smooth and blends effortlessly. This shade is amazing in that it works on so many skin tones. I have very fair skin. I usually have to wear the lightest shade of foundation that any particular line carries. This powder works beautifully to set my foundation, and also by itself.</li>
            <li> Thank u to the seller n Amazon it&#x27;s a very good product those love to do contouring n highlighting...it&#x27;s better than other banana setting powders</li>
            <li> very nice powder... it&#x27;s really &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; and soft.  I can&#x27;t say I liked the packaging- it was taped in a graftobian box? but the rating is for the actual product. I&#x27;m happy with that</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! I have fair skin and this works great with it. It does not appear yellow on my face at all. I have rosecea and my face gets very blotchy , enlarged pores and very red  and this covers that up beautifully. I really enjoy it alot and will be getting more in the future. I highly recommend this product. It is the total bomb. Must try.&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased reviews of all products I use and enjoy</li>
            <li> I love this more than the banana powder from ben nye</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s authentic</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. It minimizes pores and gets rid of shine brilliantly</li>
            <li> it seemed gritty compared to the ones I have used in the past such as Bobbie Brown. Graftobian was kind of cakey like blending was a little harder with a puff...but blended ok with a brush.</li>
            <li> Love this banana powder! So smooth! Blends effortlesy</li>
            <li> After hearing all the buzz on the Ben Nye powder, I called my makeup artist friend and asked if I can use it once to see if I liked it.  It was pretty good...I love how the color helps to correct skin discoloration, especially for dark circles under the eye.  It&#x27;s an amazing highlighting powder if you contour your face as well. The only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the Ben Nye powder felt quite heavy on my skin and it didn&#x27;t go on even with the best kabuki brush ever. Still liked it enough to order it, until I came online ( I shop for anything and everything on Amazon!!) and I found a much less expensive version in a different brand (this Graftobian), read that it was a super fine powder so I gave it a chance! So incredibly surprised at how this powder holds up at a fraction of other brands! It feels like velvet on your skin but without the dryness.  Sone days when I;m in a hurry I only dust this product all over my face and I&#x27;m good to go! It&#x27;s fool proof, feels and looks so good on your skin, helps control shine all day, won&#x27;t break you out....I can&#x27;t think of single bad thing to say, I&#x27;m in love with this!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery will order again</li>
            <li> love it! in particular i love the fact the powder isnt transparent, i use it for only my undreyes and its great!</li>
            <li> Love this for setting my under eye concealer, it is so smooth.  A little goes along way and I bought mine in June 2014 and it&#x27;s now Dec 2014 I still have basically a full jar, not to mention the size is very generous. I have never tried any other brands banana powder but this will not disappoint if you want a good professional product don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
            <li> This is a great banana powder, and much more affordable than Ben Nye.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic setting powder for my under eye concealer. It prevents my concealer from creasing and keeps it looking flawless all day long. I have always wanted to try banana powder because of all the hype around it and am so glad I got to try this Graftobian HD LuxeCashmere setting powder. I have really light skin and this actually turned out really nice, didn&#x27;t turn orange or yellow and you couldn&#x27;t tell it was on. You don&#x27;t need much at all, a lot goes a long way. I applied it with my flat top kabuki and it went on easily. It has a great matte finish, lasts all day, and goes on so smoothly. I definitely recommend this setting powder! *discount received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once since buying it. I like the texture and the powder is &#x27;build-able&#x27; so if you like a light powder it will be satisfactory but for high coverage preference, it will need a bit of work. The quality is good. I have not had any skin reactions from it. The colour is as described, very natural looking yellow shade. Reliable seller.</li>
            <li> This gives way more color than I had hoped. I cant use it for a setting powder due to the color and my fair skin.</li>
            <li> This ok i feel like bananna powder would be better make sure to apply with sponge or something damp</li>
            <li> Waaaaaaaaay better than Ben Nye banana powder, especially on darker skin tones. Texture is a bit more fine as well and doesn&#x27;t leave so much of that yellow cast as banana powder does. Awesome....great job Graftobian *thumbs up*</li>
            <li> This powder is amazing! Not cakey  and perfect for all over your face if you have yellow undertones. Keeps my face mostly matte but does let me get a little naturally dewy which make my foundation look natural and like skin not like makeup which I love.</li>
            <li> It looks to cakey.  The ben nye banana powder is much better.</li>
            <li> I love love this üçå powder it&#x27;s amazing üëå</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tired Ben NYe... I was looking for an alternative and a price within reason... So I came across this on Amazon! Thank God I did! It looks great! And when I take a selfie with a flash it looks flawless!!! This is great for setting and highlighting and contouring!!! Buy it you will like it!</li>
            <li> I love this powder!!!</li>
