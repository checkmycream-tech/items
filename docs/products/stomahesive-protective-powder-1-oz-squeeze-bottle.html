            <li> I use this powder ALL THE TIME on my daughter for her g-tube.  She has a good deal of leakage and this helps protect her skin from damage.  I love the way it pours/sprays out of the bottle and always have some on hand for keeping the stoma dry!</li>
            <li> this Seller Plenty of Cosas- very poor service, I purchased 4 bottles of Stomahesive Protective Powder for my  Ileostomy around my stoma.  I made the purchase 11sep.2013 and just received it today, October 4.&lt;br /&gt;All 4 bottles exprire in 4MONTHS - FEB 2014.&lt;br /&gt;THERE IS NO WAY I WILL USE 4 BOTTLES in this short period of Validity date&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides my complaint from the seller, Stomahesive Protective Powder is a great product for patients with Ileostomy. helps irritating skin around&lt;br /&gt;the stoma.  It is a must to have one of this Powders handly together with the skin Prep .</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Protects &amp; heals raw skin areas.</li>
            <li> Works as expected (with Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film spray). No experience of using any other product so can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> We were recommended to use this powder by a surgeon&#x27;s office at University of Michigan Medical Center.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
            <li> This is a product used by people with stomas--it works--often relieveing pain from raw tissues after one or two uses.  I would highly recommend all individuals with stomas to keep the product on hand.</li>
            <li> Very good; fast delivery, etc., etc.</li>
            <li> I use this on top of applied Cavilon skin barrier for the really stubborn skin sores under a Ostomy flange with good results in just a couple days . Does not take much of this powder as directed to get results .I have it in my med. kit as well.</li>
            <li> Daughter had terrible diaper rash for one month due to constant wet farts.  Pediatrician had me get this to mix into her Desitin.  Worked like a charm!  Cleared the rash in 3 days whereas no other OTC diaper rash treatment was able to clear it at all.</li>
            <li> It works so good for broken skin. Have been using for years when needed and this seller was A+ in my book</li>
            <li> We actually used this for our baby in a Level 4 NICU at a Naval hospital.  Not for a stoma, but for broken skin due to diaper rash.  Yes, when this product gets wet, it reacts and forms a BARRIER that you have to gently wash off with lots of patience if the skin is still broken.  This was wonderful for our tiny baby - it did not harm her skin and prevented her seepy diaper rash from worsening due to any contamination from bladder and bowel movements.  She and her little brother are too big to have that kind of diaper rash anymore, but until they were, this is the ONLY product we used for broken skin.  For plain diaper rash, we used COLOPLAST BARRIER PASTE in the NICU, and it was (and is) the only diaper balm we use.</li>
            <li> This powder is a must have for those times when stoma irritation occurs.  It is very effective in helping to clear up sores, rashes and skin separation.  I would recommend using it with 3M Cavalion liquid barrier spray to ensure satisfactory adhesion of the ostomy wafer.</li>
            <li> Works great to protect skin from peg tube feeding leak. Redness is gone - effective on first application! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I used this to mix with diaper rash cream so it would not rub off on diaper.  It really helped clear up my baby&#x27;s diaper rash quickly.</li>
            <li> I have had a stoma for over 10 years.  I always use the protective powder before applying the drainage bag.  I have never had a skin break down. I contribute that to always protecting the skin around the stoma with Stomahesive Protective Powder.</li>
            <li> My mom uses this powder and she says it is the only protective powder that helps keep moisture away from her skin.&lt;br /&gt;She says she would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As advertised, quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Use it all the time.</li>
