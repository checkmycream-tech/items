            <li>This stand does a great job holding the aforementioned stuff.</li>

            <li> My greatest area of dissatisfaction is in the wooden base.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well the wood base will stand up to the damp conditions of a bathroom, but this is a very nice stand for the price.</li>
            <li> They would be a good addition to help keep the wooden base up out of any water puddles on your counter, as well as to protect the countertop, itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wide at the front (~5\\&quot; across) and tapering towards the back</li>
            <li> I bought the Merkur Long</li>
            <li> and I simply wipe down my mug, razor and dry my brush of excess water by rubbing the bristles downward and splaying them out before putting everything back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the good:  The wooden base appears to be a piece of solid, hard wood.  </li>
            <li> This is harder to find than you might think.</li>
            <li> We did add some rubber feet to the corners to keep it from slipping off the counter.</li>
            <li> The wooden base has no cushions or pads to keep it elevated off of the counter top.  </li>
            <li> The base is made of what is essentially a nicely stained, repurposed wall-plaque.  </li>
            <li> My razor and my shave brush hang down about half the stand&#x27;s height.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the \\&quot;slightly deceptive\\&quot; part.  </li>
            <li> I added little rubber feet to the ends to stabilize it and that worked for stability.  </li>
            <li> The two screws do have a tendency to want to unscrew, but based on another users comments, a little locktite took care of that.</li>
            <li> Again, the addition of some aftermarket rubber feet to the base would be a worthy modification.</li>
            <li> This Stand is not top</li>
            <li> So, before putting this Stand into service, I went to the local hardware store &amp; got a can of semi-gloss poly &amp; put several coats on this base.  </li>
            <li> Wood base is solid.</li>
            <li> The base is fairly solid and stable.</li>
            <li> The base is approximately 7\\&quot; deep and 1/2\\&quot; tall.  </li>
            <li> The odd angle the picture was taken at kinda leaves the impression that the base is rectangular.  </li>
            <li> I put four little rubber feet on the bottom of the wood base so that it doesn&#x27;t sit in any standing water on the counter tops.</li>
            <li> This will prevent water from dripping onto the wood base that would eventually warp.</li>
            <li> Now the base is elevated off of the counter &amp; allows air to circulate/dry puddles of wetness that always accompanies my shaving efforts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wood base and metal brush and shaver holder works quite well.</li>
            <li> somehow the change in temp and humidity must have warped the base.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It looked nice at first, but a couple months later both the wood and metal parts looked really bad.</li>
            <li> The stand looks great, but after a week of use the wooden base split.  I&#x27;m going to fix it since I know how to and make it look good as new, so it isn&#x27;t that huge of a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Good design. Razor looks more valuable on that.</li>
            <li> I treated myself to an old-school shaving kit as a birthday present.  I picked this stand out pretty much based on looks and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture is both accurate and deceptive at the same time.  The base is made of what is essentially a nicely stained, repurposed wall-plaque.  There&#x27;s a nice indentation to hold your shave bowl.  The indentation is probably about 4\\&quot; around.  A tub of Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream fits comfortably, still with a good bit of room to slide around.  It does NOT come with rubber feet.  They would be a good addition to help keep the wooden base up out of any water puddles on your counter, as well as to protect the countertop, itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor stand portion is a solid, hefty piece of metal.  I&#x27;m guessing from the weight that it&#x27;s chromed brass.  It&#x27;s very elegant looking, and tall - probably a good 7\\&quot; tall.  My razor and my shave brush hang down about half the stand&#x27;s height.  The holder comfortably fits the Escali Badger Hair Brush, and my Edwin Jagger DE86BL razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the \\&quot;slightly deceptive\\&quot; part.  The odd angle the picture was taken at kinda leaves the impression that the base is rectangular.  It&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s a trapezoid.  Wide at the front (~5\\&quot; across) and tapering towards the back (~3.5\\&quot; across).  The base is approximately 7\\&quot; deep and 1/2\\&quot; tall.  It still looks very nice, I was just surprised when it showed up and it wasn&#x27;t rectangular. Again, the addition of some aftermarket rubber feet to the base would be a worthy modification.</li>
            <li> this stand looks good, works well and doesn&#x27;t take up a whole lot of room in my bathroom, would definetly recomend</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband.  he had gotten a set for the holidays that was a cup, brush and razor but no stand.  he loves it.  everything fits perfectly and it is very sturdy</li>
            <li> Pretty good looking stand but it is bare wood so buy some plastic stick-on feet so it sits off the counter out of any water.</li>
            <li> Great to display all of your old fashion shaving tools. No rubber feet as plenty of reviewers mention, but that is a simple fix. Already added them and it sits perfect. Well built and fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Be sure to dry your brush with some flicks into your sink before hanging the brush on the stand. This will prevent water from dripping onto the wood base that would eventually warp.</li>
            <li> I purchased as part of my return to &amp;#34;old fashion,&amp;#34; shaving.  I liked the rich wood appearance that I saw in the product description picture.  Yes, I am pleased, but to be completely objective I did have to make a few modifications to reach my current level of satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the good:  The wooden base appears to be a piece of solid, hard wood.  Maybe walnut?  The routed shave mug detail perfectly holds the mug I purchased, (Col Conk No.127 Shaving Mug with Pewter Caddy).  The Razor/Brush Stand seems well constructed and sturdy.  This Stand is not top heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opportunity for improvement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Although the brush I purchased fits perfect, the razor is a slightly different story.  I bought the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor 38c which length fits perfect; however, for lack of a better term, the neck of the razor, just below the head, where this razor hangs in this Stand does not accept the Merkur 38c well.  Don&#x27;t misunderstand me- it fits, but not well.  Unless you are the one that is hanging the razor you wouldn&#x27;t know that, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  My greatest area of dissatisfaction is in the wooden base.  This beautiful piece of solid wood comes out of the box very nicely stained &amp; polished; however, I do not feel/see much of a protective sealer applied.  I worried that one water &amp; any shave soap residue finds it&#x27;s was into the wood pores/gain, the wood needed to be sealed, or at the least- better sealed.  So, before putting this Stand into service, I went to the local hardware store &amp; got a can of semi-gloss poly &amp; put several coats on this base.  After approx 3 coats on top/bottom I was pleased with the finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The wooden base has no cushions or pads to keep it elevated off of the counter top.  Again, an easy fix by picking up some vinyl adhesive backed stick on cushions that I applied.  Now the base is elevated off of the counter &amp; allows air to circulate/dry puddles of wetness that always accompanies my shaving efforts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m please with this product &amp; want to give it more stars but I did have to make the modifications/after marker add-on&#x27;s before achieving my state of satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Well constructed stand.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome stand to hold the ceramic shaving soap mug, razor and brush.  t was a great valentines day gift!</li>
            <li> I wanted a stand that held the shaving mug, brush, and razor. This is harder to find than you might think. This stand does a great job holding the aforementioned stuff. Wood base is solid. Metal stand attaches well and isn&#x27;t flimsy. I put four little rubber feet on the bottom of the wood base so that it doesn&#x27;t sit in any standing water on the counter tops. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product, cleans up the clutter. This brings a refreshing twist to a classic shaving process. The wood base and metal brush and shaver holder works quite well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great little stand!! Does its job perfectly!</li>
            <li> This complements the wooden shave soap dish and brush handle along with the stainless steel Merkur razor.  I only wish the wooden stand came with a water-resistant finish.</li>
            <li> I wish the metal were the same color as the Merkur Razors. Other than this, this is a great looking product.</li>
            <li> The metal post is very solid and well engineered.  I don&#x27;t know how well the wood base will stand up to the damp conditions of a bathroom, but this is a very nice stand for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and it is perfect. It feels and looks like a great quality piece. We did add some rubber feet to the corners to keep it from slipping off the counter. The soap dish and razor that he already had fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> For what it is and the price tag it has,  I am calling this a winner. It is traditional and very elegant and of high craftsmanship. Yes I would recommend it to all of you are looking for a nice caddy, I am going to purchase another as a christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product for awhile.  It looks nice and appeared well built.  It was fine on my Formica counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I moved...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand was in storage for awhile and somehow the change in temp and humidity must have warped the base.  It warped so that the ends went up and the middle stayed low.  I added little rubber feet to the ends to stabilize it and that worked for stability.  But, the middle rested on the counter on the wood bled.  This did not do good things to my stone counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now in the market for something that works as well as this did but won&#x27;t damage my counters.</li>
            <li> Stand is very easy to set up, and the wood has a deep rich texture.  It looks very nice on my bathroom stand.</li>
            <li> This stand looks great on the bathroom counter, and holds everything where it&#x27;s dry and clean. My wife even remarked how much she loves the look of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When assembling it, I recommend putting some Blue Loctite on the threads, as the shaft wants to unscrew itself  as you use it otherwise.</li>
            <li> Holds my DE razor and Brush perfectly. The base is fairly solid and stable. Would have preferred something a bit thicker, because I have a feeling too much water will eventually cause this to either warp, crack or discolor, but at 20 bucks, I can&#x27;t complain. The base holds my large mug perfectly and I love the contrast of the wood to the chrome tower which then looks really nice on my granite counter-top.  The two screws do have a tendency to want to unscrew, but based on another users comments, a little locktite took care of that. As for the water, it&#x27;s far enough away on my counter to not pick any up and I simply wipe down my mug, razor and dry my brush of excess water by rubbing the bristles downward and splaying them out before putting everything back. I have yet to discover any water on it the next day.</li>
