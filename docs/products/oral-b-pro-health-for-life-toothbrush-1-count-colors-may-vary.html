            <li>The bristles are really good, and that&#x27;s, to me,</li>

            <li>This was a good sturdy toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality brush...</li>
            <li>and the bristles are still all in good shape.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Oral B tooth brushes and this one was no exception.</li>
            <li>It is an over all good tooth brush, one I would by for myself or anyone in my family.</li>
            <li>I also liked the grip.  </li>
            <li>This was the feature my Mom liked best about the brush, and it is quite useful to her, as she has had two strokes and drops things easily.</li>
            <li>These, in fact, do not even qualify as soft - they are medium at best.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is really easy on my teeth and also effective.</li>
            <li>Additional note: There seem to be more bristles per centimeter, so I feel like I&#x27;m getting more surface covered, and thus a better cleaning.</li>
            <li>It does a much better job of removing material from in between teeth in those crevices.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to be able to get into every spot it needs to .&lt;br</li>
            <li>length and angle of the bristles helps to sweep away and remove more plaque.  </li>
            <li>From using it it seems as though it gets most places</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Others might be ok with it</li>
            <li>I will keep buying this brush because I feel it really is a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The search for a better brush continues.</li>
            <li>I have a mouth full of dental work, implants, a bridge that is implanted and loads of crowns, I could have bought a luxury car if I had had better teeth!</li>
            <li>the most important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: The Pro-Health handle is a lot fatter, making for an easy, comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>Best of all, after a month of use, I see little to no wear and tear.  </li>
            <li>Is it worth more than the cheaper toothbrushes?  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great toothbrush</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a soft bristle toothbrush, this is a good model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good toothbrush, kind of different.</li>
            <li>The handle doesn&#x27;t break, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out, it fits my mouth, and my teeth feel clean when I use it.  </li>
            <li>It has regular bristles that do a good job of brushing without sticking your gums.  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt, this Pro-Health for Life brush has the most gentle bristles that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The soft brush was nice -- it didn&#x27;t poke my gums like some brushes do.  </li>
            <li>Works great other than that</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush, I would highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>One of the best features is the bristles at the tip of the brush that are higher than the rest; it makes it easier to reach \\&quot;the back of the back teeth.\\</li>
            <li>In my opinion the extraordinary thickness of the handle makes it possibly more comfortable for a man&#x27;s hands, but for mine, the extra thickness makes the handle unwieldy and cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li>The grip is good and important, but not nearly as important as the bristles.  </li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable, the brush feels gentle on my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been loving the extra-soft brush for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I noticed my gums rarely bleed now.</li>
            <li>I would not go out and buy another one of these when it is beyond its useful life.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do any better than a good flossing and using a \\&quot;standard\\&quot; brush for at least a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li>Worth a buy.</li>
            <li>much better for sensitive gums</li>
            <li>and I love the way it seems to fit into the various nooks and crannies in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>OK but not as soft as another company&#x27;s</li>
            <li>At a competitive price, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In closing, worth buying if the handle is an issue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Turned out just right.</li>
            <li>My gums aren&#x27;t as tough as they used to be and the extra-soft brush makes brushing a much more pleasant experience&lt;</li>
            <li>The handle of the toothbrush is huge and really easy to grip, it makes you feel as if you have ultimate control of the brush.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve used, but not all that different from the standard, quality soft bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the extra soft brushes available and this is the best of all the extra soft bristle brushes.</li>
            <li>But, no matter what your age, it&#x27;s never too early to start taking as good of care as possible of your teeth and</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to grip, the brush is full of nice long bristles, and the power tip makes cleaning the larger sections efficient.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I love the bristles in which in the back</li>
            <li>longer on the top and bottom than in the middle.</li>
            <li>For many years I have used various types of manual Oral-B toothbrushes; it is my preferred brand.  </li>
            <li>Of course, you cannot return such an item, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more.  </li>
            <li>Then again, you could soak it with hot water and hope for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her meals are quite consistent and I check her teeth after every brushing</li>
            <li>I thought this toothbrush was a step above many of the products out there.  </li>
            <li>, the grip is good and firm.  </li>
            <li>you have Essix (clear) retainers or Invisalign trays that you need to brush clean</li>
            <li>Despite being soft, the bristles differ in direction which makes your teeth feel completely clean.</li>
            <li>While it is designed for those 50 years or older, I found it to be just as well suited for those who have yet to reach their &#x27;golden years&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I almost get the feeling that they tried to make it look as complicated as any brush I&#x27;ve ever seen more as a marketing gimmick than as a superior teeth cleaning device.  </li>
            <li>The angled bristles do not cause any extra pressure and, overall, I feel it does as good a job as any.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I might pay more attention in the future because I really did like this</li>
            <li>Since we often use regular Oral B brushes in our house, I had a good chance to compare the Pro-Health with our regular brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right and do good cleaning job without being too hard on my gums.  </li>
            <li>a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the deal: this toothbrush costs you a few pennies more than the cheap ones - how much do you like to hear that high-pitched whine of the dentist&#x27;s drill?</li>
            <li>The package does not indicate on it why it is better suited for older folks than a standard toothbrush</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;extra-soft\\&quot; bristles don&#x27;t feel much different from the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; bristles that I&#x27;m used to, but I liked the way they are denser at the top of the brush - definitely adds extra cleaning power.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a super soft toothbrush this is not it.</li>
            <li>It has an overly large handle, maybe that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>While this may be just a toothbrush, it certainly is an updated one.  </li>
            <li>I usually use a medium toothbrush, but this soft brush was actually quite wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure what the difference is between this brush (marketed to the over 50 crowd) and a standard soft brush, but it is still a great product!</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of thIs toothbrush on my sensative gums.</li>
            <li>Recommended by a gum specialist and really like it.  </li>
            <li>, there is a real difference.</li>
            <li>It should also be compared to how much one likes to hear the high-pitched whine of a dentist&#x27;s drill.</li>
            <li>As we age, we lose enamel on our teeth so a really vigorous brushing may not be needed.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really see how it stands out among the rest.</li>
            <li>I found this toothbrush to be very ergonomic and sturdy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not like it makes much of a difference.</li>
            <li>and I cannot see any real difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something the buyer HAS TO BUY, and they don&#x27;t really care what brand it is.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is very sturdy and won&#x27;t bend improperly upon use like some brushes will.  </li>
            <li>This one feels more like a traditional soft brush in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how much better I could get around my teeth with this smaller head/soft brush!</li>
            <li>I have had other ES toothbrushes that just felt more gentle.</li>
            <li>It makes me teeth feel clean and is gentle enough to use on my gums as well.</li>
            <li>There are many different \\&quot;recommended\\&quot; way to brush teeth, and with the different angles and types of bristles on this brush, it really isn&#x27;t evident just how it was designed to be used.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it does a better job of this than other Oral-B brushes I have used, but it does seem to work</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t see much difference in it and a standard toothbrush, in regard to what makes it special for user over 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft on the outer edges with a strong strip in the middle.</li>
            <li>This may sound like a strange thing to say, but I almost wished there were directions for use.  </li>
            <li>I really miss the extra soft Oral B that used to be available on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>for my own teeth, I usually use an Oral-B electric toothbrush at home, but this Pro-Health For Life toothbrush is what I bring in my purse if I need to brush my teeth while I&#x27;m out and about.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush was supposed to be extra soft, but it felt more like a medium soft bristle.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers liked the larger handle, but I have other toothbrushes that have handles just as large.  </li>
            <li>The easy grip handle makes maneuvering the brush practically klutz proof, even with wet</li>
            <li>that said, I don&#x27;t particularly like it.  </li>
            <li>If it costs more because it is somehow supposed to be \\&quot;special\\&quot; then I would advise not spending the extra money as it seems to be just a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought a couple of these to replace my last Oral B extra-soft toothbrush, and my old toothbrush&#x27;s bristles were significantly softer than these.</li>
            <li>The forward bristle are little more densly placed than the others.</li>
            <li>If you like the colors and the look and the softer bristles, which clean almost as well as a regular soft brush then this is a acceptable option.</li>
            <li>Unless you were using advanced equipment, it would be hard to tell a difference, but if you&#x27;re going to buy a special brush</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is that special except that it says extra soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I will stay with this new type.</li>
            <li>This happened when the toothbrush was new.</li>
            <li>My dentist gives me a new one of these with each 6-month checkup/cleaning.</li>
            <li>I chose this on a whim since I was in the market for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive teeth you may want to keep looking.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally buy soft toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I brush pretty aggressively and they do last about that length of time before needing</li>
            <li>Took some getting used to but overall worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a fan of Oral-B toothbrushes, and if this toothbrush does not cost more than other Oral-B brushes, I will definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I was excited when I saw this brush by Oral B; my Mom is over 50, disabled, and I really worry about her teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several ways, and it does a reasonable decent job of cleaning teeth \\&quot;squeaky clean,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I can imagine, after a few more weeks and the calcified remains of the toothpaste accumulate, it&#x27;ll be back to normal.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t really anything special about this toothbrush other than that it has extra soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I know that I brush too hard, so I am sure that my teeth and gums will appreciate the softer bristles too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in my early 30s).  </li>
            <li>I would say it is medium leaning towards soft.</li>
            <li>Up until this point, I have used Oral-B soft brushes exclusively.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten this one if I had realized it was a soft one.</li>
            <li>or when I can&#x27;t use it, my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Oral-B soft bristle brush.  </li>
            <li>my old toothbrush did.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles have been around for some time, and have always been recommended to me by dentists even when well below 50.</li>
            <li>I have never used a soft bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I just never thought that it made that much difference, but I will be buying them in the future.  </li>
            <li>has all the bells and whistles they&#x27;ve developed over the years.</li>
            <li>While I prefer medium bristles, rather than soft, this brush still got the job done and didn&#x27;t hurt my gums.</li>
            <li>The bristles, though very clearly angled differently than the regular Oral B brushes I use, seemed to be no more effective at removing plaque or even food debris than Mom&#x27;s old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Often when I use soft tooth brushes I feel feel like my teeth just don&#x27;t get clean enough and that I brush harder to try and compensate for that fact but that wasn&#x27;t the case with this one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Oral-B toothbrushes for years, but I&#x27;ve never been particular about which one of the various designs I choose.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how much softer it was until I went back to my regular soft Oral-B</li>
            <li>If, like me, you are trying to go easy on your gums because your dentist has told you that you brush too hard, please don&#x27;t make the mistake of assuming this is an extra-soft toothbrush just because that&#x27;s what it says on the package.</li>
            <li>The extra soft cleans just as well as the soft brush</li>
            <li>I am now 65 and find that at times my gums do bleed, even when using toothbrushes marked as extra soft.  </li>
            <li>But, this one does have a good, thick, firm grip, so that is just added bonus</li>
            <li>On the other hand, these daily necessities have come a long way in the last 20-30 years and are much more efficient than those made when I was a kid.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish was different is the head of the toothbrush, while it is soft and easy to control, it&#x27;s a little smaller than most.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I might be missing something, and it is well made, but I&#x27;m not sure why they consider it better suited to us older users.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush says that it is extra soft.</li>
            <li>Brush is not extra soft.  </li>
            <li>The package does indeed say &amp;#34;Extra Soft,&amp;#34; but these bristles are NOT extra soft.</li>
            <li>Our little Mama reported it feels exactly the same as her old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main feature it promotes is extra soft bristles, which can be found on other toothbrushes for all ages.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize there was such a big difference between soft and extra-soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Along with regular cleanings at the dentist, this Oral B soft brush is certainly enough.</li>
            <li>It is too big and it isn&#x27;t soft enough for my liking.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was a little to skinny at first glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I usually buy the regular size brush because I buy in bulk from a super store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an adequate toothbrush, but I didn&#x27;t find enough difference from ordinary toothbrushes for people under 50 or not.</li>
            <li>Pretty stiff.</li>
            <li>Still, though, the features in this brush can be found on other&#x27;s, so don&#x27;t feel like you need this particular model to get the same benefits.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a soft bristle--which I usually don&#x27;t buy--I find it to be a really decent toothbrush.</li>

            <li> Is it worth more than the cheaper toothbrushes?  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great toothbrush</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a soft bristle toothbrush, this is a good model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good toothbrush, kind of different.</li>
            <li> The handle doesn&#x27;t break, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out, it fits my mouth, and my teeth feel clean when I use it.  </li>
            <li> It has regular bristles that do a good job of brushing without sticking your gums.  </li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this Pro-Health for Life brush has the most gentle bristles that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The soft brush was nice -- it didn&#x27;t poke my gums like some brushes do.  </li>
            <li> Works great other than that</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush, I would highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> One of the best features is the bristles at the tip of the brush that are higher than the rest; it makes it easier to reach \\&quot;the back of the back teeth.\\</li>
            <li> In my opinion the extraordinary thickness of the handle makes it possibly more comfortable for a man&#x27;s hands, but for mine, the extra thickness makes the handle unwieldy and cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> The grip is good and important, but not nearly as important as the bristles.  </li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable, the brush feels gentle on my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been loving the extra-soft brush for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I noticed my gums rarely bleed now.</li>
            <li> I would not go out and buy another one of these when it is beyond its useful life.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do any better than a good flossing and using a \\&quot;standard\\&quot; brush for at least a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> Worth a buy.</li>
            <li> much better for sensitive gums</li>
            <li> and I love the way it seems to fit into the various nooks and crannies in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> OK but not as soft as another company&#x27;s</li>
            <li> At a competitive price, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In closing, worth buying if the handle is an issue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Turned out just right.</li>
            <li> My gums aren&#x27;t as tough as they used to be and the extra-soft brush makes brushing a much more pleasant experience&lt;</li>
            <li> The handle of the toothbrush is huge and really easy to grip, it makes you feel as if you have ultimate control of the brush.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve used, but not all that different from the standard, quality soft bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the extra soft brushes available and this is the best of all the extra soft bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> But, no matter what your age, it&#x27;s never too early to start taking as good of care as possible of your teeth and</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to grip, the brush is full of nice long bristles, and the power tip makes cleaning the larger sections efficient.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I love the bristles in which in the back</li>
            <li> longer on the top and bottom than in the middle.</li>
            <li> For many years I have used various types of manual Oral-B toothbrushes; it is my preferred brand.  </li>
            <li> Of course, you cannot return such an item, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more.  </li>
            <li> Then again, you could soak it with hot water and hope for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her meals are quite consistent and I check her teeth after every brushing</li>
            <li> I thought this toothbrush was a step above many of the products out there.  </li>
            <li> , the grip is good and firm.  </li>
            <li> you have Essix (clear) retainers or Invisalign trays that you need to brush clean</li>
            <li> Despite being soft, the bristles differ in direction which makes your teeth feel completely clean.</li>
            <li> While it is designed for those 50 years or older, I found it to be just as well suited for those who have yet to reach their &#x27;golden years&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I almost get the feeling that they tried to make it look as complicated as any brush I&#x27;ve ever seen more as a marketing gimmick than as a superior teeth cleaning device.  </li>
            <li> The angled bristles do not cause any extra pressure and, overall, I feel it does as good a job as any.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I might pay more attention in the future because I really did like this</li>
            <li> Since we often use regular Oral B brushes in our house, I had a good chance to compare the Pro-Health with our regular brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right and do good cleaning job without being too hard on my gums.  </li>
            <li> a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the deal: this toothbrush costs you a few pennies more than the cheap ones - how much do you like to hear that high-pitched whine of the dentist&#x27;s drill?</li>
            <li> The package does not indicate on it why it is better suited for older folks than a standard toothbrush</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;extra-soft\\&quot; bristles don&#x27;t feel much different from the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; bristles that I&#x27;m used to, but I liked the way they are denser at the top of the brush - definitely adds extra cleaning power.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a super soft toothbrush this is not it.</li>
            <li> It has an overly large handle, maybe that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> While this may be just a toothbrush, it certainly is an updated one.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a medium toothbrush, but this soft brush was actually quite wonderful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure what the difference is between this brush (marketed to the over 50 crowd) and a standard soft brush, but it is still a great product!</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of thIs toothbrush on my sensative gums.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a gum specialist and really like it.  </li>
            <li> , there is a real difference.</li>
            <li> It should also be compared to how much one likes to hear the high-pitched whine of a dentist&#x27;s drill.</li>
            <li> As we age, we lose enamel on our teeth so a really vigorous brushing may not be needed.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really see how it stands out among the rest.</li>
            <li> I found this toothbrush to be very ergonomic and sturdy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not like it makes much of a difference.</li>
            <li> and I cannot see any real difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something the buyer HAS TO BUY, and they don&#x27;t really care what brand it is.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very sturdy and won&#x27;t bend improperly upon use like some brushes will.  </li>
            <li> This one feels more like a traditional soft brush in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how much better I could get around my teeth with this smaller head/soft brush!</li>
            <li> I have had other ES toothbrushes that just felt more gentle.</li>
            <li> It makes me teeth feel clean and is gentle enough to use on my gums as well.</li>
            <li> There are many different \\&quot;recommended\\&quot; way to brush teeth, and with the different angles and types of bristles on this brush, it really isn&#x27;t evident just how it was designed to be used.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it does a better job of this than other Oral-B brushes I have used, but it does seem to work</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t see much difference in it and a standard toothbrush, in regard to what makes it special for user over 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft on the outer edges with a strong strip in the middle.</li>
            <li> This may sound like a strange thing to say, but I almost wished there were directions for use.  </li>
            <li> I really miss the extra soft Oral B that used to be available on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> for my own teeth, I usually use an Oral-B electric toothbrush at home, but this Pro-Health For Life toothbrush is what I bring in my purse if I need to brush my teeth while I&#x27;m out and about.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush was supposed to be extra soft, but it felt more like a medium soft bristle.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers liked the larger handle, but I have other toothbrushes that have handles just as large.  </li>
            <li> The easy grip handle makes maneuvering the brush practically klutz proof, even with wet</li>
            <li> that said, I don&#x27;t particularly like it.  </li>
            <li> If it costs more because it is somehow supposed to be \\&quot;special\\&quot; then I would advise not spending the extra money as it seems to be just a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these to replace my last Oral B extra-soft toothbrush, and my old toothbrush&#x27;s bristles were significantly softer than these.</li>
            <li> The forward bristle are little more densly placed than the others.</li>
            <li> If you like the colors and the look and the softer bristles, which clean almost as well as a regular soft brush then this is a acceptable option.</li>
            <li> Unless you were using advanced equipment, it would be hard to tell a difference, but if you&#x27;re going to buy a special brush</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is that special except that it says extra soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I will stay with this new type.</li>
            <li> This happened when the toothbrush was new.</li>
            <li> My dentist gives me a new one of these with each 6-month checkup/cleaning.</li>
            <li> I chose this on a whim since I was in the market for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive teeth you may want to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy soft toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I brush pretty aggressively and they do last about that length of time before needing</li>
            <li> Took some getting used to but overall worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a fan of Oral-B toothbrushes, and if this toothbrush does not cost more than other Oral-B brushes, I will definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw this brush by Oral B; my Mom is over 50, disabled, and I really worry about her teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several ways, and it does a reasonable decent job of cleaning teeth \\&quot;squeaky clean,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I can imagine, after a few more weeks and the calcified remains of the toothpaste accumulate, it&#x27;ll be back to normal.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really anything special about this toothbrush other than that it has extra soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I know that I brush too hard, so I am sure that my teeth and gums will appreciate the softer bristles too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in my early 30s).  </li>
            <li> I would say it is medium leaning towards soft.</li>
            <li> Up until this point, I have used Oral-B soft brushes exclusively.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten this one if I had realized it was a soft one.</li>
            <li> or when I can&#x27;t use it, my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Oral-B soft bristle brush.  </li>
            <li> my old toothbrush did.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles have been around for some time, and have always been recommended to me by dentists even when well below 50.</li>
            <li> I have never used a soft bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I just never thought that it made that much difference, but I will be buying them in the future.  </li>
            <li> has all the bells and whistles they&#x27;ve developed over the years.</li>
            <li> While I prefer medium bristles, rather than soft, this brush still got the job done and didn&#x27;t hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> The bristles, though very clearly angled differently than the regular Oral B brushes I use, seemed to be no more effective at removing plaque or even food debris than Mom&#x27;s old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Often when I use soft tooth brushes I feel feel like my teeth just don&#x27;t get clean enough and that I brush harder to try and compensate for that fact but that wasn&#x27;t the case with this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Oral-B toothbrushes for years, but I&#x27;ve never been particular about which one of the various designs I choose.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how much softer it was until I went back to my regular soft Oral-B</li>
            <li> If, like me, you are trying to go easy on your gums because your dentist has told you that you brush too hard, please don&#x27;t make the mistake of assuming this is an extra-soft toothbrush just because that&#x27;s what it says on the package.</li>
            <li> The extra soft cleans just as well as the soft brush</li>
            <li> I am now 65 and find that at times my gums do bleed, even when using toothbrushes marked as extra soft.  </li>
            <li> But, this one does have a good, thick, firm grip, so that is just added bonus</li>
            <li> On the other hand, these daily necessities have come a long way in the last 20-30 years and are much more efficient than those made when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was different is the head of the toothbrush, while it is soft and easy to control, it&#x27;s a little smaller than most.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I might be missing something, and it is well made, but I&#x27;m not sure why they consider it better suited to us older users.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush says that it is extra soft.</li>
            <li> Brush is not extra soft.  </li>
            <li> The package does indeed say &amp;#34;Extra Soft,&amp;#34; but these bristles are NOT extra soft.</li>
            <li> Our little Mama reported it feels exactly the same as her old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main feature it promotes is extra soft bristles, which can be found on other toothbrushes for all ages.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there was such a big difference between soft and extra-soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Along with regular cleanings at the dentist, this Oral B soft brush is certainly enough.</li>
            <li> It is too big and it isn&#x27;t soft enough for my liking.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a little to skinny at first glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I usually buy the regular size brush because I buy in bulk from a super store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an adequate toothbrush, but I didn&#x27;t find enough difference from ordinary toothbrushes for people under 50 or not.</li>
            <li> Pretty stiff.</li>
            <li> Still, though, the features in this brush can be found on other&#x27;s, so don&#x27;t feel like you need this particular model to get the same benefits.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a soft bristle--which I usually don&#x27;t buy--I find it to be a really decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> could feel the softer touch at first, but after a few weeks of use, it&#x27;s starting to feel less soft.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I do not like about the brush is that the handle is much more thick and wide than other toothbrushes; also, for some reason, probably ergonomics, gel has been built into the back of the handle.  </li>
            <li> For a soft bristle, it&#x27;s very firm, and the thick handle makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re clear retainers, they look just like Invisalign trays) with other regular toothbrushes or my Oral-B electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The long bristles, the short bristles, set against the grain and with the grain, the extra sized bristles for the back of your teeth, a rubber handle, and</li>
            <li> This was a small brush, so I will probably experiment with the medium to large brushes to see if I like them</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this small size brush again.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles for massaging gums to keep from wearing down gums.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s different enough to make anyone choose it over other Oral-B products.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say this brush is much different from the standard Oral-B soft brush although it does have a soft, round power tip I&#x27;ve not seen in the other brushes I use and slightly longer bristles.  </li>
            <li> : The bristles are soft, but no more than Ultra Soft bristles of other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it might be too soft, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> I am a pretty rough brusher--probably brush too hard, or so the dentist has advised.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pro-Health For Life Toothbrush is NOT nearly as soft as the  Dr. Collins Perio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral B brushes for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> so long I can&#x27;t tell you what age</li>
            <li> This was a surprise to me and it feels kinda strange to use because of that.  </li>
            <li> If it has a slight advantage it&#x27;s barely noticeable in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Usually I buy a brush that has a smaller head size; although the head on this brush is the standard length, the width is narrower, and there are longer, angled bristles at the tip of the head which make it easier for me to reach my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> The part that goes around the front teeth is too narrow and deep for standard toothbrush bristles to get in there, but this Pro-Health For Life&#x27;s longer bristles get in there</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are different than your average toothbrush...</li>
            <li> I usually go with a soft brush as that helps the gums deal with the harshness, but often that approach leads to a rapidly deteriorating brush.  </li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in how that softer power tip at the front cleans and the slightly stiffer, similar tip on my other toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up with pink though</li>
            <li> Other than that it looks like any other toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> I was never aware of any \\&quot;dental conditions people over 50</li>
            <li> soft\\&quot; and that is no lie, the bristles are noticably softer than that of other toothbrushes I have used.  </li>
            <li> I prefer \\&quot;soft\\&quot; bristles, but other than that</li>
            <li> I have not bought any Oral-B products in the past, so I came to this brush with an open mind.</li>
            <li> What a difference it makes getting in small tight places like your back teeth.</li>
            <li> Throughout my life I used medium bristles and perhaps brushed too hard because I would get some gum bleed.</li>
            <li> You might have some slight preferences, but you&#x27;ll use something else in a pinch.</li>
            <li> head of the toothbrush is compact and the handle is slightly angled, making it easier to access hard-to-reach areas.  </li>
            <li> However, I bought this for the longer bristles at the tip because I was having trouble cleaning the inside of my Essix orthodontic retainers</li>
            <li> I had trouble with the bristles coming out when I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> It also does not fit into normal-sized toothbrush holders.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are supposed to be extra-soft, but compared to other extra-soft brushes I have used, they are a bit hard.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrushes for the past few months and thought I would give this a spin.</li>
            <li> Should have looked closer, but this was the small, child size</li>
            <li> Not sure why this is marketed towards those 50 years and up, as receding gums from brushing too hard can happen well before the age of 50</li>
            <li> , I recommend this toothbrush, or if your dentist has told you you&#x27;re brushing too hard, the softer bristles on this toothbrush will help.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too hard on my teeth or gums but seemed to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth somewhat hard</li>
            <li> if I brush too hard some of my dental work will fall out.</li>
            <li> The handle, though, is very thick.  </li>
            <li> get me wrong...</li>
            <li> I am always afraid</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s just that the replacement brushes are so expensive!)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I dont think you would be disappointed with this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s where we were disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried all the extra soft brushes available and this is the best of all the extra soft bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this is marketed towards those 50 years and up, as receding gums from brushing too hard can happen well before the age of 50 (I just had gum grafts on 6 teeth and I&#x27;m in my early 30s).  However, I bought this for the longer bristles at the tip because I was having trouble cleaning the inside of my Essix orthodontic retainers (they&#x27;re clear retainers, they look just like Invisalign trays) with other regular toothbrushes or my Oral-B electric toothbrush.  The part that goes around the front teeth is too narrow and deep for standard toothbrush bristles to get in there, but this Pro-Health For Life&#x27;s longer bristles get in there perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my own teeth, I usually use an Oral-B electric toothbrush at home, but this Pro-Health For Life toothbrush is what I bring in my purse if I need to brush my teeth while I&#x27;m out and about.  I like it a lot, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have Essix (clear) retainers or Invisalign trays that you need to brush clean, I recommend this toothbrush, or if your dentist has told you you&#x27;re brushing too hard, the softer bristles on this toothbrush will help.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush says that it is extra soft. I have been using it twice a day. I would say it is medium leaning towards soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrushes for the past few months and thought I would give this a spin. The Oral-B Pro-Health For Life Toothbrush is NOT nearly as soft as the  Dr. Collins Perio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a super soft toothbrush this is not it.</li>
            <li> Up until this point, I have used Oral-B soft brushes exclusively. I didn&#x27;t realize there was such a big difference between soft and extra-soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been loving the extra-soft brush for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My gums aren&#x27;t as tough as they used to be and the extra-soft brush makes brushing a much more pleasant experience&lt;br /&gt;2. The extra soft cleans just as well as the soft brush&lt;br /&gt;3. The extra-soft brush actually seems to make it easier to get to the difficult spots (maybe because it is more flexible)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience with this brush, I will be switching to the extra-soft brushes. This was a small brush, so I will probably experiment with the medium to large brushes to see if I like them better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/18/12 Additional note: There seem to be more bristles per centimeter, so I feel like I&#x27;m getting more surface covered, and thus a better cleaning.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great toothbrush but I don&#x27;t see the need to market a toothbrush specifically for people over fifty. I don&#x27;t think there is enough different about this toothbrush to necessitate marketing it as especially beneficial for seniors. I always use Oral-B toothbrushes and think this is a quality product but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s different enough to make anyone choose it over other Oral-B products.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was supposed to be extra soft, but it felt more like a medium soft bristle. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy soft toothbrushes and I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten this one if I had realized it was a soft one. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised! Often when I use soft tooth brushes I feel feel like my teeth just don&#x27;t get clean enough and that I brush harder to try and compensate for that fact but that wasn&#x27;t the case with this one! It makes me teeth feel clean and is gentle enough to use on my gums as well. I didn&#x27;t like the fact that I couldn&#x27;t choose the color and I ended up with pink though but oh well.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of thIs toothbrush on my sensative gums. It cleans as well as my regular oral B type that I have used for years but I noticed my gums rarely bleed now. I will stay with this new type.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say.  This is an Oral-B manual toothbrush and works the way it should.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a gum specialist and really like it.  Didn&#x27;t realize how much softer it was until I went back to my regular soft Oral-B, there is a real difference.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with the bristles coming out when I brush my teeth. This happened when the toothbrush was new.</li>
            <li> Brush is not extra soft.  Pretty stiff.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. The end of the brush has longer bristles than the rest of it to get it he very back teeth. Good price if you are an Amazon Prime member. Soft bristles for massaging gums to keep from wearing down gums. Non-slip handle.</li>
            <li> Good sturdy toothbrush but I don&#x27;t feel like it truly is ES. I have had other ES toothbrushes that just felt more gentle. This one feels more like a traditional soft brush in my opinion. If you have very sensitive teeth you may want to keep looking.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Pro-Health For Life toothbrush is state of the art in toothbrushes. I know, I know...it&#x27;s just a toothbrush! On the other hand, these daily necessities have come a long way in the last 20-30 years and are much more efficient than those made when I was a kid. It should also be compared to how much one likes to hear the high-pitched whine of a dentist&#x27;s drill. Enough said?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, what I like about this tooth brush is the opposing angles of each cluster of bristles. Any way you move this brush, you have clusters that are aggressively brushing while another cluster (angled in the opposite direction) is moving away food particles and plaque from the teeth and gums. It does a much better job of removing material from in between teeth in those crevices. My dentist gives me a new one of these with each 6-month checkup/cleaning. I brush pretty aggressively and they do last about that length of time before needing a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the deal: this toothbrush costs you a few pennies more than the cheap ones - how much do you like to hear that high-pitched whine of the dentist&#x27;s drill? Keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> This may sound like a strange thing to say, but I almost wished there were directions for use.  There are many different \\&quot;recommended\\&quot; way to brush teeth, and with the different angles and types of bristles on this brush, it really isn&#x27;t evident just how it was designed to be used.  I&#x27;ve tried several ways, and it does a reasonable decent job of cleaning teeth \\&quot;squeaky clean,\\&quot; but I am left wondering if I&#x27;m using it to its fullest potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I don&#x27;t particularly like it.  Just personal preference, but it feels odd in my mouth, and I have already gone back to my sonic type toothbrush mainly or when I can&#x27;t use it, my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Oral-B soft bristle brush.  I would not go out and buy another one of these when it is beyond its useful life.  I almost get the feeling that they tried to make it look as complicated as any brush I&#x27;ve ever seen more as a marketing gimmick than as a superior teeth cleaning device.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to do any better than a good flossing and using a \\&quot;standard\\&quot; brush for at least a couple of minutes.  (The electric sonic style brush does great - it&#x27;s just that the replacement brushes are so expensive!)</li>
            <li> I picked this toothbrush up for my mother since it is designed for people over the age of 50. There isn&#x27;t really anything special about this toothbrush other than that it has extra soft bristles. That is the only gimmick. Other than that it looks like any other toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> As we age, we lose enamel on our teeth so a really vigorous brushing may not be needed. Along with regular cleanings at the dentist, this Oral B soft brush is certainly enough. Oral-B is a trusted brand that one can rely upon. For your next toothbrush purchase consider this instrument. You&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral B brushes for as long as I can remember but I usually buy the regular size brush because I buy in bulk from a super store. I was really surprised how much better I could get around my teeth with this smaller head/soft brush! What a difference it makes getting in small tight places like your back teeth. I love this tooth brush, I would highly recommend giving it a try. I will absolutely buy this small size brush again.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little to skinny at first glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be able to get into every spot it needs to .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angle is perfect like  a REACH toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turned out just right.</li>
            <li> This is a really good toothbrush.  I love the bristles in which in the back they angle up for deeper scrubbing.  The bristles are really good, and that&#x27;s, to me, the most important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the grip is good and firm.  The grip is good and important, but not nearly as important as the bristles.  I can take a toothbrush that has no grip at all.  But, this one does have a good, thick, firm grip, so that is just added bonus points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length and angle of the bristles helps to sweep away and remove more plaque.  The package says \\&quot;helps defend against dental conditions people over 50 experience\\&quot;.  But, no matter what your age, it&#x27;s never too early to start taking as good of care as possible of your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I chose this on a whim since I was in the market for a new toothbrush. Even though this states it&#x27;s for seniors *g* and it&#x27;s a soft bristle--which I usually don&#x27;t buy--I find it to be a really decent toothbrush. For a soft bristle, it&#x27;s very firm, and the thick handle makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I was never aware of any \\&quot;dental conditions people over 50 experience,\\&quot; my dentist never mentioned anything, so I think it&#x27;s just a marketing ploy. The main feature it promotes is extra soft bristles, which can be found on other toothbrushes for all ages. Still, it&#x27;s a good toothbrush. Throughout my life I used medium bristles and perhaps brushed too hard because I would get some gum bleed. With this brush, I can still brush as vigorously but I haven&#x27;t made my gums bleed. The angled bristles do not cause any extra pressure and, overall, I feel it does as good a job as any. Still, though, the features in this brush can be found on other&#x27;s, so don&#x27;t feel like you need this particular model to get the same benefits.</li>
            <li> This was a good sturdy toothbrush. It wasn&#x27;t too hard on my teeth or gums but seemed to get the job done. Worth a buy.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush isn&#x27;t bad but I don&#x27;t really see how it stands out among the rest. From using it it seems as though it gets most places my old toothbrush did. If it has a slight advantage it&#x27;s barely noticeable in my opinion. Granted, it does its job. If you like the colors and the look and the softer bristles, which clean almost as well as a regular soft brush then this is a acceptable option.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an adequate toothbrush, but I didn&#x27;t find enough difference from ordinary toothbrushes for people under 50 or not. It has an overly large handle, maybe that&#x27;s it. The forward bristle are little more densly placed than the others. Soft bristles have been around for some time, and have always been recommended to me by dentists even when well below 50. If you want a big handle maybe it&#x27;ll be worthwile.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush...but I can&#x27;t see much difference in it and a standard toothbrush, in regard to what makes it special for user over 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong...I might be missing something, and it is well made, but I&#x27;m not sure why they consider it better suited to us older users.</li>
            <li> I have never used a soft bristle toothbrush. I just never thought that it made that much difference, but I will be buying them in the future.  I love this toothbrush.  It has regular bristles that do a good job of brushing without sticking your gums.  Then there is a power tip at the front that sweeps across the teeth. I can tell a difference in how that softer power tip at the front cleans and the slightly stiffer, similar tip on my other toothbrush.  I know that I brush too hard, so I am sure that my teeth and gums will appreciate the softer bristles too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I need this brush because I am over fifty?  I have been using this type of brush so long I can&#x27;t tell you what age I was when I started, so I don&#x27;t know if this is that special except that it says extra soft bristles. Is it worth more than the cheaper toothbrushes?  The handle doesn&#x27;t break, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out, it fits my mouth, and my teeth feel clean when I use it.  So my answer is yes.</li>
            <li> I found this toothbrush to be very ergonomic and sturdy. The bristles are soft on the outer edges with a strong strip in the middle. I brush my teeth somewhat hard but I have been using this for about a month now and the bristles are still all in good shape. I dont think you would be disappointed with this toothbrush should you choose to purchase it.</li>
            <li> It says for people over 50 but I didn&#x27;t see that till after I got it but it&#x27;s not like it makes much of a difference. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good toothbrush, kind of different. The bristles on the brush are different than your average toothbrush... longer on the top and bottom than in the middle. Took some getting used to but overall worked pretty well. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> The package does indeed say &amp;#34;Extra Soft,&amp;#34; but these bristles are NOT extra soft. I bought a couple of these to replace my last Oral B extra-soft toothbrush, and my old toothbrush&#x27;s bristles were significantly softer than these. These, in fact, do not even qualify as soft - they are medium at best. The bristles are stiff to the touch. This product was mislabeled. If, like me, you are trying to go easy on your gums because your dentist has told you that you brush too hard, please don&#x27;t make the mistake of assuming this is an extra-soft toothbrush just because that&#x27;s what it says on the package.</li>
            <li> much better for sensitive gums&lt;br /&gt;Try it</li>
            <li> For many years I have used various types of manual Oral-B toothbrushes; it is my preferred brand.  I am now 65 and find that at times my gums do bleed, even when using toothbrushes marked as extra soft.  Without a doubt, this Pro-Health for Life brush has the most gentle bristles that I have ever used.  In the two weeks that I have been using it, my gums have not bled.  Usually I buy a brush that has a smaller head size; although the head on this brush is the standard length, the width is narrower, and there are longer, angled bristles at the tip of the head which make it easier for me to reach my back teeth.  The one thing that I do not like about the brush is that the handle is much more thick and wide than other toothbrushes; also, for some reason, probably ergonomics, gel has been built into the back of the handle.  In my opinion the extraordinary thickness of the handle makes it possibly more comfortable for a man&#x27;s hands, but for mine, the extra thickness makes the handle unwieldy and cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pro-Health for Life toothbrush was advertised as being made for people over 50.  The package does not indicate on it why it is better suited for older folks than a standard toothbrush and I cannot see any real difference.  Some reviewers liked the larger handle, but I have other toothbrushes that have handles just as large.  The bristles are supposed to be extra-soft, but compared to other extra-soft brushes I have used, they are a bit hard.  The toothbrush does work well and I love the way it seems to fit into the various nooks and crannies in my teeth.  I don&#x27;t know why it does a better job of this than other Oral-B brushes I have used, but it does seem to work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of Oral-B toothbrushes, and if this toothbrush does not cost more than other Oral-B brushes, I will definitely buy it again.  If it costs more because it is somehow supposed to be \\&quot;special\\&quot; then I would advise not spending the extra money as it seems to be just a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I usually use a medium toothbrush, but this soft brush was actually quite wonderful. Despite being soft, the bristles differ in direction which makes your teeth feel completely clean. The handle is a rubberized grip to prevent slips and give you enough to hold onto. This is a fantastic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what the difference is between this brush (marketed to the over 50 crowd) and a standard soft brush, but it is still a great product!</li>
            <li> It is too big and it isn&#x27;t soft enough for my liking.  Others might be ok with it but I had to stop using it.  Of course, you cannot return such an item, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more.  I really miss the extra soft Oral B that used to be available on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> OK but not as soft as another company&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Do you know what a \\&quot;Hostage Product\\&quot; is? It&#x27;s something the buyer HAS TO BUY, and they don&#x27;t really care what brand it is. You might have some slight preferences, but you&#x27;ll use something else in a pinch. Toothbrushes are like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has all the bells and whistles they&#x27;ve developed over the years. The long bristles, the short bristles, set against the grain and with the grain, the extra sized bristles for the back of your teeth, a rubber handle, and yeah, it&#x27;s softer, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could feel the softer touch at first, but after a few weeks of use, it&#x27;s starting to feel less soft. I can imagine, after a few more weeks and the calcified remains of the toothpaste accumulate, it&#x27;ll be back to normal. Then again, you could soak it with hot water and hope for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a soft bristle toothbrush, this is a good model.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very sturdy and won&#x27;t bend improperly upon use like some brushes will.  The handle, though, is very thick.  This was a surprise to me and it feels kinda strange to use because of that.  It also does not fit into normal-sized toothbrush holders.  That can be a nuisance and may be something to consider before purchasing.</li>
            <li> While this may be just a toothbrush, it certainly is an updated one.  The handle of the toothbrush is huge and really easy to grip, it makes you feel as if you have ultimate control of the brush.  While it is designed for those 50 years or older, I found it to be just as well suited for those who have yet to reach their &#x27;golden years&#x27;.  The head is \\&quot;extra soft\\&quot; and that is no lie, the bristles are noticably softer than that of other toothbrushes I have used.  The only thing I wish was different is the head of the toothbrush, while it is soft and easy to control, it&#x27;s a little smaller than most.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall this is a great toothbrush and I would purchase it again.  I am not sure I will be able to go back to the small handled models.</li>
            <li> I have a mouth full of dental work, implants, a bridge that is implanted and loads of crowns, I could have bought a luxury car if I had had better teeth! This toothbrush is really easy on my teeth and also effective. I am always afraid if I brush too hard some of my dental work will fall out. The handle is comfortable, the brush feels gentle on my teeth. I will keep buying this brush because I feel it really is a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Oral-B toothbrushes for years, but I&#x27;ve never been particular about which one of the various designs I choose.  I prefer \\&quot;soft\\&quot; bristles, but other than that I probably grab whatever one is on sale.  Having said that, I might pay more attention in the future because I really did like this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of the toothbrush is compact and the handle is slightly angled, making it easier to access hard-to-reach areas.  The \\&quot;extra-soft\\&quot; bristles don&#x27;t feel much different from the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; bristles that I&#x27;m used to, but I liked the way they are denser at the top of the brush - definitely adds extra cleaning power.  The easy grip handle makes maneuvering the brush practically klutz proof, even with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a product that I&#x27;d recommend and would purchase again myself.</li>
            <li> Should have looked closer, but this was the small, child size and I like a larger brush size. Works great other than that</li>
            <li> I am a pretty rough brusher--probably brush too hard, or so the dentist has advised.  I usually go with a soft brush as that helps the gums deal with the harshness, but often that approach leads to a rapidly deteriorating brush.  I am not quite over 50, but I like the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and figured I&#x27;d give Oral-B&#x27;s similarly minded toothbrush a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say this brush is much different from the standard Oral-B soft brush although it does have a soft, round power tip I&#x27;ve not seen in the other brushes I use and slightly longer bristles.  The handle is easy to grip, the brush is full of nice long bristles, and the power tip makes cleaning the larger sections efficient.  Best of all, after a month of use, I see little to no wear and tear.  Perhaps the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve used, but not all that different from the standard, quality soft bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have not bought any Oral-B products in the past, so I came to this brush with an open mind. While I prefer medium bristles, rather than soft, this brush still got the job done and didn&#x27;t hurt my gums. At a competitive price, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw this brush by Oral B; my Mom is over 50, disabled, and I really worry about her teeth. Since we often use regular Oral B brushes in our house, I had a good chance to compare the Pro-Health with our regular brushes. The breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HANDLE: The Pro-Health handle is a lot fatter, making for an easy, comfortable grip. This was the feature my Mom liked best about the brush, and it is quite useful to her, as she has had two strokes and drops things easily. She hasn&#x27;t dropped this brush once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEEL: The bristles are soft, but no more than Ultra Soft bristles of other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING POWER: Here&#x27;s where we were disappointed. The bristles, though very clearly angled differently than the regular Oral B brushes I use, seemed to be no more effective at removing plaque or even food debris than Mom&#x27;s old toothbrush. Her meals are quite consistent and I check her teeth after every brushing (she is at risk for choking in her sleep). The debris is the same. Unless you were using advanced equipment, it would be hard to tell a difference, but if you&#x27;re going to buy a special brush I think you should see a difference. Our little Mama reported it feels exactly the same as her old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, worth buying if the handle is an issue. The search for a better brush continues. As it is, the Oral B Pro-Health rates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE: B-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Oral B tooth brushes and this one was no exception. I was a little worried that it might be too soft, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. The bristles are just right and do good cleaning job without being too hard on my gums.  The grip fits my hand well. It is an over all good tooth brush, one I would by for myself or anyone in my family.</li>
            <li> I thought this toothbrush was a step above many of the products out there.  The soft brush was nice -- it didn&#x27;t poke my gums like some brushes do.  I also liked the grip.  One of the best features is the bristles at the tip of the brush that are higher than the rest; it makes it easier to reach \\&quot;the back of the back teeth.\\&quot;  I would use this product again.</li>
    </ol>
