            <li>This is my favorite hairspray!</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my hair stylist and I love it!  </li>
            <li>If you want to be able to pick up a chunk of hair, put it in place, spray it, and know that 4 hours from now it&#x27;s still going to be where you put it, this is your hair spray!</li>
            <li>Who could ask for more?!</li>
            <li>It is great because it is a fine spray so it does not glop on your hair.  </li>

            <li>works well on my fine fly away hair , smells good and the smell is like a light perfume that stays with you</li>

            <li>Love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>My favorite hairspray</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray, I order it from here every time and its always on time or sooner.</li>
            <li>Cheaper and way better.  </li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite hair spray.  </li>
            <li>Best part is that it get&#x27;s better the second day.</li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look shiny</li>
            <li>(more matte than shiny).</li>
            <li>This is probably my all time favorite spray.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a strong hold but doesn&#x27;t make your hair too crunchy.</li>
            <li>I love how fine and misty</li>
            <li>Great product - holds well, while leaving hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>It is great because #4 holds my soft, &amp;#34;body-free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Lightweight for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>They make a nice travel size too that is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product, good pricing, good packing, quick delivery and less $.</li>
            <li>It was originally recommended to me by my stylist.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This hairspray is awesome and really hard to find (except at salons).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; but I can say &amp;#34;I like it very much&amp;#34;, which is better than the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, blonde hair, and this provides a strong hold without making my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>Even if I have to go out in the wind, my hair will return to the original style when I come back inside and tidy it with my hands.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and trying to find a product that holds my hair but looks natural has been problematic.  </li>
            <li>One caveat - the nozzle of the Sebastian product does get gummed up and has to be washed in very hot water every once and a while to get the right misting quality.  </li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave hair dried out, as it has no alcohol in it.</li>
            <li>Held curls all night at wedding and not hard or crunchy!!!</li>
            <li>(if you absolutely have to shampoo you can use a dry shampoo) and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, flat hair.</li>
            <li>But this thing makes your hair smell funny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and have white hair that is fine.</li>
            <li>Too much of a hassle to try to return or get refund.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hairspray.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this and will order again as soon as the can is half empty to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>A few hours later when I re-comb/brush it it still looks nice.</li>
            <li>The stream of this hairspray is way too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li>and my can itself has several fairly large dents.</li>
            <li>I like the L&#x27;Oreal spray because it isn&#x27;t sticky and leaves the hair reasonably soft.  </li>
            <li>This can last several months so worth the price.</li>
            <li>After styling, I spray my hair and it feels a little stiff which is a good thing to let me know where I have sprayed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE this hairspray. I have super thin hair! This hairspray controls my hair and gives it a little extra texture. Love, Love, Love it!!</li>
            <li> I like the L&#x27;Oreal spray because it isn&#x27;t sticky and leaves the hair reasonably soft.  I have used it for years.  However, the last time I bought a can, the sprayer stopped working almost immediately.  Too much of a hassle to try to return or get refund.  Hope it was just a one time problem.  They make a nice travel size too that is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray. Doesn&#x27;t make hair feel sticky and stiff. I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; but I can say &amp;#34;I like it very much&amp;#34;, which is better than the 4 stars. I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and have white hair that is fine.I do like the way my hair is after I spray and let it set in place. It&#x27;s not sticky and it is very light yet holds in place. A few hours later when I re-comb/brush it it still looks nice. Hair is shiny. It has become my # 1 choice.</li>
            <li> The best hair spray ever made. Light weight, great hold and smells fresh. Great Job L&#x27;Oreal!!! You did it again!!!</li>
            <li> Great hold! no crunchy or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray! Flexible hold but not so flexible your curl falls out. Lightweight for fine hair.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is awesome and really hard to find (except at salons).  It was originally recommended to me by my stylist.  She gave me a sample, and I was hooked.  I have very fine, blonde hair, and this provides a strong hold without making my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted! However, I do want to mention that the deal clasp was broken but still intact and my can itself has several fairly large dents. Still functions great!!</li>
            <li> Great product - holds well, while leaving hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> The stream of this hairspray is way too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Lots of people think that hairspray is hairspray but they must not have tried L&#x27;Oreal Texture Expert.  This hairspray is just wonderful and the best I have found in 40+ years of using hairspray.  There are several hold strengths and this #4 is the strongest hold.  It is great because it is a fine spray so it does not glop on your hair.  It is great because you can spray and then rearrange the hair to get it &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;.  It is great because #4 holds my soft, &amp;#34;body-free&amp;#34; hair in place all day.  Even if I have to go out in the wind, my hair will return to the original style when I come back inside and tidy it with my hands.  It is so great that I am willing to send away for it.  It is so great that I am willing to pay more for it than most hair sprays.  It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I ever finished a hairspray in my life until I found this one. Best hairspray ever.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray, I order it from here every time and its always on time or sooner. I have never received a bottle that didnt spray and I wouls recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hair stylist and I love it!  It holds my hair without any stickiness and gives it body, which I need for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used!! Light weight but great hold! A sample size was given to me by the stylist who did my hair for my daughter&#x27;s wedding and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since!</li>
            <li> Not sure about the positive reviews left by others.  I have fine hair and once I sprayed this on I could not move my hair - it was frozen in place.  When I tried to comb/brush it to adjust, hair was actually pulled out.  I recommend trying Sebastian Shaper Zero G (which can be purchased at CVS) or online.  Cheaper and way better.  One caveat - the nozzle of the Sebastian product does get gummed up and has to be washed in very hot water every once and a while to get the right misting quality.  Otherwise perfect.</li>
            <li> Tried in humid Maui on my heavy stick straight hair.  Held curls all night at wedding and not hard or crunchy!!! loved</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite hair spray.  It smells great but doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume.  Sometimes I even spray it on my dry hair then re-style with my hair blower.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used! Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard but keeps it in place.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for flexible, touchable hold, this is NOT for you. If you want to be able to pick up a chunk of hair, put it in place, spray it, and know that 4 hours from now it&#x27;s still going to be where you put it, this is your hair spray! Think 1950&#x27;s up-do, or Marilyn Monroe, or Amy Winehouse. Best part is that it get&#x27;s better the second day. Not crackly and flaky like cheaper brands, but fuller and thicker....just style and re-spray (if you absolutely have to shampoo you can use a dry shampoo) and you&#x27;re good to go. No doubt, you can absolutely feel the difference between the L&#x27;Oreal and the less expensive extreme hold brands. This just feels like luxury.</li>
            <li> This is not an extreme hold product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It holds well.  I have fine hair and I use this product to give my hair some texture and body.  I then use their Freezing Mist as my hairspray.  A++</li>
            <li> I like this hair spray because it&#x27;s light weight, but holds great! Just wish I could find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I love how fine and misty the spray is. Love that it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look shiny (more matte than shiny). But this thing makes your hair smell funny.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, good pricing, good packing, quick delivery and less $. Who could ask for more?!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, flat hair. After styling, I spray my hair and it feels a little stiff which is a good thing to let me know where I have sprayed. After a few minutes, the spray &#x27;stickiness&#x27; goes away, and the hair is soft just like it was never sprayed-however, the product continues to hold the style-ALL DAY! I have even restyled the hair and it continues to hold again. I am so pleased with this and will order again as soon as the can is half empty to make sure I don&#x27;t run out. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not really liking this stuff.</li>
            <li> works well on my fine fly away hair , smells good and the smell is like a light perfume that stays with you</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product. I love that it has a strong hold but doesn&#x27;t make your hair too crunchy. This can last several months so worth the price.</li>
            <li> Shipped wrong product</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave hair dried out, as it has no alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray. I have very fine hair and trying to find a product that holds my hair but looks natural has been problematic.  Tnis product fits the bill.  I can spray my hair in the morning and not worry about it all day.  I would recommend this product to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is probably my all time favorite spray.  It holds well and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy or wet like other sprays can.</li>
