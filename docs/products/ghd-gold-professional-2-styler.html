            <li>Great, it was nicely wrapped in a beautiful box with a heat control case to stopped the heat after use.</li>
            <li>but it has what appears to me metalic, and does not straighten as good</li>
            <li>but I decided I wanted to spend some money for good quality.</li>

            <li>I love my Ghd straightener.  </li>
            <li>Its even better than the iron in the picture.  </li>
            <li>I have used it 4 times and i love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought the wider 2 inch iron.</li>
            <li>I have been straightening my hair for many years and this flat iron is the best I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
            <li>Love it, the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought, A+++</li>
            <li>Im so happy with my new Ghd :)</li>
            <li>i love it so far so good.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>As for now it is working fine.</li>
            <li>I always buy the best when I am buying her something I am not familiar with, and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I am not the user of this product, but I enjoy it nonetheless...</li>
            <li>The Ghd Gold 2 inch is quick,doesn&#x27;t catch on the hair, and leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I think it did a fantastic job on my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and I cannot tell you how excited she was...</li>
            <li>I bought it used,  it says it was just opened,  really it was new, and it works very nice</li>
            <li>I missed my uk ones so much as the voltage meant they weren&#x27;t hot enough in the US, so these were a great replacement!</li>
            <li>I love how fast it heats up and the design is really clean.</li>
            <li>Super fast heat up time, works great, &amp; travels well with international voltage!</li>
            <li>Since it heats quickly, its not an issue.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the flat iron, it heats very quickly and is smooth.</li>
            <li>It gets hot in seconds and my hair is supper silky and smooth and i have curly hair.</li>
            <li>well worth buying super</li>
            <li>She loves and says it gets her hair straight like nothing ever before!!</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have really liked that feature because you don&#x27;t want to worry about it being left on after you leave the house.</li>
            <li>Do not buy way over priced and does not live but to its own write up.  </li>
            <li>Also the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Ready in seconds and works like a charm!</li>
            <li>The place of the on/off button is not in the best location (on the inside of the appliance) but this is the only con which is not a big deal since it&#x27;s a hot appliance and extra care has to be exercised at all times anyway regardless of where the button is placed.</li>
            <li>The only thing i would change is no heat control knobs other then that its a great product.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and it pretty much gets straight within 15 mins.</li>
            <li>Get your hair ready in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy a GHD gold since I really like the</li>
            <li>But if you take this precaution into consideration, this is a very effect item.</li>
            <li>so it is real...</li>
            <li>This iron its so much better than what i&#x27;ve expected...</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I would like my usage light to moderate.</li>
            <li>and this makes it much easier to get it straight.</li>
            <li>but I saw it for myself, it took me slightly more than that, thick frizzy hair or an almost first time straightener user, not bad at all.</li>
            <li>My other hair-straightening friends love it too and</li>
            <li>The outside of the iron doesn&#x27;t get very hot either which allows me to rest it on wood, carpet, any surface without damage.  </li>
            <li>i would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Brand new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 4 years and still works like new.  </li>
            <li>Takes little time to heat up and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Be aware, this straightener gets MUCH hotter than the average straightener.  </li>
            <li>Last time she used a Gold model and it was fast (either this one or the 1 inch)</li>
            <li>I have been getting so many compliments lately as my hair look so shiny after using it.</li>
            <li>I have tried cheap stuff in the past and it never worked so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t doubt the product is good, I just got a bad one.  </li>

            <li> She has owned other flat irons, and this by far is the one she is the happiest with.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling this will last for a long time</li>
            <li> like to use mine instead of their flat iron whenever they can.  </li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair but can style it perfectly straight in about five minutes.</li>
            <li> Tried several other brands of straighteners.</li>
            <li> Had to go and get the plug changed at the electrical store due to this appliance having an american plug on it.&lt;br /&gt;This was not stated in the product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not even make my hair look frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li> Nothing special to be that expensive</li>
            <li> It definitely took me less time to straighten it than I am used to.</li>
            <li> Did not heat up to expected temperature.</li>
            <li> I turned it off and on a few times and I hit test/reset on the unit several times.</li>
            <li> Product is NOT a real ghd straightner!</li>
            <li> I have short, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> : The price is unbeatable after I checked a few other places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed that the plug is larger and so is my hair dryer</li>
            <li> wife had a thinner version of this that she loaned out and came back broken.</li>
            <li> It takes few minutes to do the job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straighten my hair everyday because I don&#x27;t want the heat damage.</li>
            <li> I went to use my straightener a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> The straightener was completely dead.</li>
            <li> I have bought $20 straighteners from Walmart that have lasted for YEARS with heavy use.</li>
            <li> Gave one to my daughter who has long VERY thick hair</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> She always likes to play with my hair, I&#x27;m too lazy to do it because I have thick frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> You can fins something at Wal-Mart that will heat up the same ::((((</li>
            <li> Unable to register products.</li>
            <li> It was really expensive at $198</li>
            <li> This was really disappointing.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that I had to pay the shipping to return a product that never worked.  </li>

            <li> Purchased for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Did not heat up to expected temperature. The plates pulled my hair. Too bulky. Paul Mitchell has a better product.</li>
            <li> Get your hair ready in 10 minutes. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and I cannot tell you how excited she was...I think she was happier than the day I proposed to her! I always buy the best when I am buying her something I am not familiar with, and this does not disappoint. She has owned other flat irons, and this by far is the one she is the happiest with. I have a feeling this will last for a long time and it has a solid, well-built feel.</li>
            <li> Great, it was nicely wrapped in a beautiful box with a heat control case to stopped the heat after use. Brand new. i love it so far so good.

At the recommendation of a friend, she replaced it with another brand, and wasn&#x27;t as happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so NOT my department, but with the encouragement of our daughter I decided to surprise her and get her another GHD. I went for the 2 inch iron in case it saved her time in the morning, and it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it and I love how she looks, moreover I get points for being a caring husband who pays attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may buy a couple more to bring out and give to her when I&#x27;m in the dog house. ;-)</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it on cloudy days and my hair doesn&#x27;t get frizzy. I love it.</li>
            <li> Do not buy way over priced and does not live but to its own write up.  You can fins something at Wal-Mart that will heat up the same ::((((</li>

            <li> This the best styling iron I have ever used. Takes little time to heat up and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Product is NOT a real ghd straightner! Unable to register products. They do not come with a hologram code. Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> As advertised, and awesome! Super fast heat up time, works great, &amp; travels well with international voltage! LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.</li>
            <li> well worth buying super</li>
            <li> I bought it used,  it says it was just opened,  really it was new, and it works very nice, it took 1 minute to be ready.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Tried several other brands of straighteners. The Ghd Gold 2 inch is quick,doesn&#x27;t catch on the hair, and leaves my hair smooth. Well worth the investment. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Silky smooth hair, Love it!</li>

            <li> Christmas gift for the girlfriend! She loves and says it gets her hair straight like nothing ever before!! Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> My sister has been using GHD&#x27;s for over 6 years now. She always likes to play with my hair, I&#x27;m too lazy to do it because I have thick frizzy hair. Last time she used a Gold model and it was fast (either this one or the 1 inch) so I decided to buy a GHD gold since I really like the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Efficient product: I think one reviewer said it took them 10 mins and I didn&#x27;t believe it, but I saw it for myself, it took me slightly more than that, thick frizzy hair or an almost first time straightener user, not bad at all. The width of the plate makes the difference I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricing: The price is unbeatable after I checked a few other places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pseudo-con: The place of the on/off button is not in the best location (on the inside of the appliance) but this is the only con which is not a big deal since it&#x27;s a hot appliance and extra care has to be exercised at all times anyway regardless of where the button is placed.</li>
            <li> Be aware, this straightener gets MUCH hotter than the average straightener.  You must use some kind of product (designed for used with straighteners) your hair prior to use of straightener to prevent sever damage of your hair.  But if you take this precaution into consideration, this is a very effect item.</li>
            <li> I have tried cheap stuff in the past and it never worked so I decided to make that investment and this was the best. A friend of mine has been using it for 10 years and swears by it. Pricy but well worth it. I have wavy hair and it pretty much gets straight within 15 mins. Very good and I registered it online so it is real...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 4 years and still works like new.  Definitely  authentic.  I have two daughters and we won&#x27;t use anything else now to straighten our hair.</li>
            <li> I had bought one of these about 8 years ago, same brand that had ceramic plates  this did not have ceramic but it has what appears to me metalic, and does not straighten as good, it takes several time running it through your hair verses one time with the ceramic plates</li>
            <li> Had to go and get the plug changed at the electrical store due to this appliance having an american plug on it.&lt;br /&gt;This was not stated in the product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter was very happy with this for her xmas gift.</li>
            <li> great product! Love this brand!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the flat iron, it heats very quickly and is smooth. At first I was disappointed that the plug is larger and so is my hair dryer so I cannot have them both plugged in at the same time. Since it heats quickly, its not an issue.</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for many years and this flat iron is the best I&#x27;ve come across.  My other hair-straightening friends love it too and like to use mine instead of their flat iron whenever they can.  This baby can straighten!  It doesn&#x27;t have any settings as it self-adjusts the temperature to straighten.  I have had my GHD for six years now and it&#x27;s still going strong.  The outside of the iron doesn&#x27;t get very hot either which allows me to rest it on wood, carpet, any surface without damage.  When mine (eventually) dies, I will definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended ghd to me. I&#x27;ve had mine for several years - I have short, thick, wavy hair. Gave one to my daughter who has long VERY thick hair and she lives it too.</li>
            <li> I love my Ghd straightener.  I have been getting so many compliments lately as my hair look so shiny after using it. It does not even make my hair look frizzy or dry. It takes few minutes to do the job. Definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Superb- very fast to get hot</li>
            <li> This iron its so much better than what i&#x27;ve expected... Its even better than the iron in the picture.  THANKS A LOT!!! Im so happy with my new Ghd :)</li>
            <li> Love it, the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought, A+++</li>
            <li> Nothing special to be that expensive</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener September 16th 2014. I did a lot of research and it looked like this was a great product. It was really expensive at $198 but I decided I wanted to spend some money for good quality. I think it did a fantastic job on my hair. It definitely took me less time to straighten it than I am used to. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair everyday because I don&#x27;t want the heat damage. I would like my usage light to moderate. The straightener has a fail-safe shutoff if you leave it on. I have really liked that feature because you don&#x27;t want to worry about it being left on after you leave the house. I went to use my straightener a few weeks ago and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I checked the electrical box to see if it tripped a fuse/switch. I turned it off and on a few times and I hit test/reset on the unit several times. The straightener was completely dead. After contacting Amazon they allowed me to return the item, but charged a $29.70 re-stocking fee. Now I am out the straightener and the money for the restocking fee. It was a great product while it worked. I have bought $20 straighteners from Walmart that have lasted for YEARS with heavy use. This was really disappointing. Buyer Beware: Works great while it works...</li>
            <li> the plates doesn&#x27;t fully close</li>
            <li> I have used it 4 times and i love it. It gets hot in seconds and my hair is supper silky and smooth and i have curly hair. Im a happy customer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought the wider 2 inch iron. I have long wavy hair and this makes it much easier to get it straight. Great product!</li>
