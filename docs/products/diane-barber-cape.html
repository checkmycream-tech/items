            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>and this works fine.</li>
            <li>I think this bib is fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li>the fabric is perfect for repelling wet hair, yet cool and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>... material doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>The snaps make it adjustable to fit everyone in my household</li>
            <li>The material has a smooth almost slippery feel.  </li>
            <li>Looks like a nice classic cape, but is not.</li>
            <li>, the fabric has a very smooth/slick feel that makes it very easy for hair to slide off.  </li>
            <li>It looks nice and professional.  </li>
            <li>The old barber cape that came with my clippers from years ago was made of some kind of plastic and became brittle and cracked with age</li>
            <li>Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
            <li>It also folds and rolls up very compactly to fit in the drawer with</li>
            <li>I like the classic style pattern and the nylon material, hair slips off of it easily.</li>
            <li>Hair slides right off</li>
            <li>/&gt;It just catches the hair and slides right off.</li>
            <li>And it came very fast</li>
            <li>will last for many years...</li>
            <li>The neck has a number of snaps for fitting around different sized necks.</li>
            <li>(most of the hair clippings slide right down).  </li>
            <li>This one has such a fine weave that the hair cannot penetrate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Large cape with a very adjustable neck.</li>
            <li>Received the Barber Cape in 2 days as promised, and the cape does its thing very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well-made and very adjustable around the neck</li>
            <li>does the job really well, works for kids or grown ups.</li>
            <li>Seems to fit just abbout any neck (lots of snaps to pick from for different sizes).  </li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like the cape itself</li>
            <li>Nice coverage for the customer, especially for larger men.</li>
            <li>Its a good cape for kids, but WAY too small for an adult.  </li>
            <li>but the fabric is durable enough to last many years.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that I wish it had more snap-buttons on the collar to accomidate a larger variety of neck sizes.</li>
            <li>and it is just like new.  </li>
            <li>I guess I should have figured out that this cape was really meant for a barber chair since it really has almost no back to it.</li>
            <li>Due too much static after use it it was so hard to clean up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is large enough and does not hold the hair.  </li>
            <li>but - since it really has no protection at the rear - hair will get all over your back.</li>
            <li>this if you are a professional or hobbiest that likes to butcher you kids hair</li>
            <li>My 5 year son loves it because the material is soft and breathes.  </li>
            <li>it was hard to decide which cape to get over the net without actually seeing and feeling, but i took the chance and I was very satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li>I have been too many barbers in the past and not all capes are equal.</li>
            <li>It is also dense enough so the hair falls off easily with just a little shaking.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that this cape would fit a small child.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This cape protects from all sides and even on the neck you can make it tight enough to make sure no hair trickles down on your back.</li>

            <li> It covers all the spot no more hair clipping on your cloths or body, going pro at home.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend cutting off the inside of the neck label, it has scrapped some of my customers.  </li>
            <li> Folds up very small and compact to store in my clipper case.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little expensive</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this if you are trying to do haricuts at home.</li>
            <li> i have no negatives on this item, except that i felt it was a drop expensive.</li>
            <li> Cutting cape is 100% polyester.</li>

            <li> Wish they were larger in size</li>
            <li> Received the Barber Cape in 2 days as promised, and the cape does its thing very well (most of the hair clippings slide right down).  Tough to beat the low price and timely delivery...I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for to do my buzz cut at home and save $15 a pop.    I would recommend this product to anyone wanting for use at home or their own shop.</li>
            <li> nice and cool in the summer time</li>
            <li> works great for home haircuts... material doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. will last for many years...would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I guess I should have figured out that this cape was really meant for a barber chair since it really has almost no back to it. You can&#x27;t tell this from either the description or the picture for the product - which is kind of deceptive advertising. It&#x27;s well-made and very adjustable around the neck but - since it really has no protection at the rear - hair will get all over your back. Not too happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This cape is awesome.  Very good quality for a low price.  Shipped very quickly. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this if you are trying to do haricuts at home.</li>

            <li> It looks nice and professional.  Seems to fit just abbout any neck (lots of snaps to pick from for different sizes).  Covers nicely also so you won&#x27;t get hair on your legs.  It is also dense enough so the hair falls off easily with just a little shaking.  What else can I say I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Get this if you are a professional or hobbiest that likes to butcher you kids hair so he will be humiliated at school.  Don&#x27;t ask me how I know about this (darn you Dad).&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Rok H.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my product it does everything it&#x27;s suppose to do and I could not be more happy. And it came very fast</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the home haircuts I give my lad.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have been using this for over a year and it is just like new.  Sanp closure is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the appearance and quality of the product.  It arrived timely and appeared as it did in the ad.  The price was appropriate for the product.  I would recommend others purchase the product.</li>
            <li> Like it.  Easy to put on with handy snaps and lightweight material.  Grandson likes the way it keeps the hair off him.</li>
            <li> I was using a plastic cape for my son. This one is much better. Nice snap closure. Hair slides right off so it&#x27;s easy to keep nice.</li>
            <li> My 5 year son loves it because the material is soft and breathes.  Best of all, it fits his tiny neck.</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose. Light but good quality.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair off cloths</li>
            <li> Nice coverage for the customer, especially for larger men. Substantial weight and feel.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> They get close to a lot of different neck sizes but I find myself either trying to choke someone with this case or looking for the thickest neck strips I can find. This pattern can cause some vertigo as well.</li>
            <li> Due too much static after use it it was so hard to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;It holds too many hairs on it.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it</li>
            <li> It is large enough and does not hold the hair.  I thought it was a little expensive but the fabric is durable enough to last many years.</li>
            <li> It is a nice weight nylon, not plastic or vinyl feel, replacement for the cheapo plastic one that came with our clipper set.  The snaps make it adjustable to fit everyone in my household and it cleans off with just a shake.  It also folds and rolls up very compactly to fit in the drawer with the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived yesterday and dear husband insisted on a haircut today to break it in.  NIce to have barber shop quality at home, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Just as described</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my theatre prop.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!</li>
            <li> Very well made. This first-rate cape will last a lifetime. Great size with nice snap closure. Material is very comfortable. Perfect for professional or home barbering. Nice price too!</li>
            <li> This is a nice size cape. A little bigger than the average cape, but not as large as a plus size cape. I use it every day at work.</li>
            <li> Just as pictured and described - plenty of snap closure choices for different neck sizes.  Plenty of length and coverage, and the fabric is perfect for repelling wet hair, yet cool and comfortable.  Very easy to fold up neatly to stow away or travel, but doesn&#x27;t wrinkle.</li>
            <li> It covers all the spot no more hair clipping on your cloths or body, going pro at home.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that this cape would fit a small child.  Well don&#x27;t worry; not only is it professional-grade, it had adjustable snaps at the neck that fits all the way down to a five year old.  I tried it out last night on my son and it worked great!  Yes, it&#x27;s somewhat open in the back, but you have to remember it&#x27;s a barber&#x27;s cape and not a hospital dressing gown.  The intent is for the person receiving a trim to be sitting in a full-back chair.  When you do this, it gives the same coverage as you would receive at a barber shop.  I recommend it.  A++</li>
            <li> Perfect for my husband&#x27;s neck size.  It&#x27;s very smooth and silky and doesn&#x27;t cause you to sweat underneath it.  Great cape for the price.  Folds up very small and compact to store in my clipper case.</li>
            <li> Well made, great quality,very functional and easy to use.  Still using after three years of monthly use. Wonderful deal!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Just what the barber ordered!</li>
            <li> Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
            <li> i will change this after i&#x27;ve used it for a while to see how the snaps hold up.  i do like the stripes.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair. This product works soooo much better. No hair down your neck &amp; back. Win-win situation.</li>
            <li> i rate this product 4 out of 5.  looks good, light and cool.  works ok for me.  i would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Large cape with a very adjustable neck. However, the snaps loosen after a while and won&#x27;t stay snapped.</li>
            <li> this cape is really perfect for giving at home haircuts because it gives the ability to keep clothes still clean.</li>
            <li> Does what it was designed to do.  The material has a smooth almost slippery feel.  Hair will not stick to this synthetic material and lets it all fall to the floor.  The neck has a number of snaps for fitting around different sized necks.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard or just like to trim your hair on your own for maintenance between visit to your barber or hairdresser, this is the Cape for you. I use this all the time and it is much better than using a towel around your neck. Hair does not stick to this cape. I have been too many barbers in the past and not all capes are equal. This one has such a fine weave that the hair cannot penetrate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just catches the hair and slides right off.</li>
            <li> and this works fine. It doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant feel to the fabric, but it&#x27;s not repulsive, either. I think this bib is fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to buy such a cape for a long time and now that I finally did, I can&#x27;t be happier. This cape protects from all sides and even on the neck you can make it tight enough to make sure no hair trickles down on your back. Great buy</li>
            <li> The old barber cape that came with my clippers from years ago was made of some kind of plastic and became brittle and cracked with age so I shopped around a bit and decided on this one.  It arrived promptly and in good condition.  I really like the cape itself, the fabric has a very smooth/slick feel that makes it very easy for hair to slide off.  The quality seems excellent in the fabric itself and in the construction.  I figure this should last quite a few years.</li>
            <li> Have not used yet. I&#x27;m sure it will be OK</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cape and it works well. My only issue is that I wish it had more snap-buttons on the collar to accomidate a larger variety of neck sizes.</li>
            <li> Its a good cape for kids, but WAY too small for an adult.  The cape stops around the knee, all of my clients get out of my chair with hair on their knees.</li>
            <li> I like the classic style pattern and the nylon material, hair slips off of it easily. I would only recommend cutting off the inside of the neck label, it has scrapped some of my customers.  I would of like to see some heavier duty stitching on the neck line.</li>
            <li> Good size. Great material.</li>
            <li> Great quality, just like a barber shop.</li>
            <li> Cutting cape is 100% polyester. Would have been nice to know that in the description. I was wanting and expecting a nice poly blend or poplin. Looks like a nice classic cape, but is not. Thin enough to see through. 2 stars for the nice cloth snap closure.</li>
