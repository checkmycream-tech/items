            <li> I think this is one is my favorite! Smells great! I love to pair it with the lotion &amp; it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the same fragrance as the Body by Victoria.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the same at all.</li>
            <li> This smells so good, you can wear it by itself or paired with another light scent. Either way the compliments won&#x27;t stop and everybody wants it and men love it</li>
            <li> What a wonderful perfume- mist combo!!! Subtle, sweet, girly &amp; smells like heaven!!!&lt;br /&gt;Compliments keep showering on me when I wear this one!!! Ladies, this is a must have!</li>
            <li> Not the fragrance I was looking for, but goes by same name.  This is the old discontinued version and was not stated in description.  Nothing wrong with shipping and handling</li>
            <li> it took a long time but i finally found my signature fragrance! Ladies buy this fragrance, you will not be sorry &amp; you will get so many compliments on it, use it with the lotion too!  BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday! I absolutely love this scent and I&#x27;m so happy I found it for a cheaper price on amazon than having to pay way more if I were to purchase it from Victoria&#x27;s Secret!</li>
            <li> My wife is very dissatisfied and disappointed with this fragrance mist.  It has very little fragrance to it.  I noticed that the bottle is different from the last one I bought her through Amazon, but I thought it must be a new design.  Now I&#x27;m thinking this must be old and way past it&#x27;s shelf life.  I am unhappy and embarrassed because it was a gift and one of my wife&#x27;s favorites. I&#x27;ll be sending it back. It is NO bargain!!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites!  Light, fresh smell - not overwhelming.  Great for working out and other outings as well!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing loved it</li>
            <li> I was SO disappointed when I tried it on, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like Body, HOWEVER, it smells really, really good! If it was what I had expected I&#x27;d give it five stars, but it smells great. Disappointed, but I&#x27;ll get over it :) I like it, but it is not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> After hunting for this item in the stores I took to amazon and yes there is was, and someone&#x27;s Christmas wish was met.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the fragrance I expected. I thought it was from the line of fragrances they use to carry called..BODY, by Victoria Secrets. This fragrance is not that fragrance at all and it doesn&#x27;t last but a few minutes when applied, so I really wasn&#x27;t happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells light and pretty.  Not a heavy perfumy smell.  So far my fav by VS!  Hope they come out with a more citrusey smelling one, like tangerine or orange.</li>
            <li> I was so bummed when VS stopped selling this and am so excited I found the mist on amazon.. one of my favs!!</li>
            <li> It smells so good...for about 30 seconds :(&lt;br /&gt;Too bad the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last....</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!!! It was an easy buy!!</li>
            <li> ladies ya&#x27;ll need to get this fragrance mist it has a mild scent to it and smells really good it last long as well.</li>
