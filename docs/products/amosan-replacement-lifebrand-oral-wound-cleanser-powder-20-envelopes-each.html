            <li>It is the best oral rinse for inflamed/irritated gums, even better than warm salt water!</li>
            <li>I also thought the taste was pleasant.</li>

            <li>I have used this product for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>This  a good item to  have in your  medicine chest</li>
            <li>Imagine our happiness when we found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li>and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Amosan.</li>
            <li>THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ORAL WOUND MOUTH WASH AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET;I WAS SURPRISE TO GET IT FROM CANADA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It tastes pleasant and is highly effective in controlling the problem.  </li>
            <li>I also wanted to recommend Gly-Oxide (available on Amazon for about $10) which gets very good reviews.</li>
            <li>is as good as the original product that I used for years and loved!</li>
            <li>priced right and works fine!!!!</li>
            <li>All i can say is it better work!</li>
            <li>So glad I found it again!</li>
            <li>nout at easy to find but a great addition to oral health regime</li>
            <li>It seems as effective, and I&#x27;m so glad someone still makes it!  </li>
            <li>It is really amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how using this product relieves some of the pain and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I use it any time I get any kind of mouth sore.  </li>
            <li>Recommend this product to people with any kind of mouth sores.</li>
            <li>The powder had cristalized and formed lumps and therefore did not dissolve properly in warm water.</li>
            <li>my Go-To drug for any kind of dental discomfort.    </li>
            <li>but if it were marketed more effectively for what it was, a superior rinse then it still would certaintly be a viable product for Oral-B.</li>
            <li>works effectively.</li>
            <li>IF YOU LIKED AMOSAN</li>
            <li>Instead I use warm water and peroxide to rinse my mouth.</li>
            <li>You just need to mix the two powders together yourself and mix in warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a fresh bottle of peroxide, and ideally mix it with a purified or distilled water stored in a sterile bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product  is good; however, not as effective as the original Oral B Amosan.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most effective mouthwash I have ever used and am so glad that I was able to purchase it online!  </li>
            <li>I do recommend this as a suitable alternative.</li>
            <li>Worked but not as good as the original Amosan</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff for healing any kind of open sore in your mouth or sore gums I have ever tried and I have tried a lot of products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to Amosan many years ago by my dentist for a gum irritation.  </li>
            <li>believe if they promoted this item better it would be their top selling product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, and the taste is quite pleasant too.</li>
            <li>It works ok but is not Amosan as it was represented.</li>
            <li>But I thank you for being able to have product.</li>
            <li>This one he seemed to tolerate much better and</li>
            <li>It is the generic substitute of Amosan - which I always found to be the best for Oral Wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;haninius</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, nothing works better on canker sores.</li>
            <li>and I guess he is OK with it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Amosan for many years to heal my mouth when I have a sore.  </li>
            <li>Hadn&#x27;t used this in years, but it is magic.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Wish it were cheaper like I used to be able to buy.  </li>
            <li>So glad to have located this product again.</li>
            <li>Amosan is the most reliable oral would cleanser</li>
            <li>I have been using AMOSAN for many many Years.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, most people just don&#x27;t know about this product because it wasn&#x27;t advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have found it again.</li>
            <li>But my gums are grateful it still exists (unlike so many products that work well</li>
            <li>It was basically a home remedy, now you have to go to a dentist and spend more money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many others, I miss Amosan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For more convenience (plus a minty taste)</li>
            <li>using it for more than 20 years.how could youall.</li>
            <li>great product, clean fresh mouth and breath</li>
            <li>it is wonderful, although in Spain it does not exist anymore, it is a pity....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>We have used Amosan by oral B for many years, however this product works as well as the original.</li>
            <li>Had major irritation from dental work and this product helped great.</li>
            <li>I would be OK with the cost except for the fact that it is not the same very effective Oral-B product that I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li>works absolutely perfectly and tastes exactly the same as Amosan.</li>
            <li>It works more quickly than any others I have tried</li>
            <li>Really hard to find this product any more works like magic!!!!!!</li>
            <li>They had a huge markup and presumably profit on this product.</li>
            <li>I rarely have to do it more than once.</li>
            <li>Amazon, if you can locate this product, PLEASE make it available for purchase.</li>
            <li>There is nothing else like it available....</li>
            <li>Not only does it help with mouth sores, but is great for Strep, Post-Dental work, and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>It seems they bought up all the available Amosan when it was available and now are</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just add that this is the only truly great oral rinse if you&#x27;re seeking relief from canker sores or oral injuries.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why it is no longer available in pharmacies.</li>
            <li>Great to see it back.</li>
            <li>I suspect if they charged a more reasonable price, they would sell more.</li>
            <li>IF YOU LIKED AMOSAN, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone with any kind of mouth sore, injury, etc.</li>
            <li>OK, BUT NOT AS STRONG OR AS FAST AS ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li>It does not work quite as well as the original, but when you need relief, and it is 3 times the price of original</li>
            <li>seems to work as well as original Amosan</li>
            <li>The original product sold for about 8.99 when it was on the shelf and this knock off is 3 times that amount.</li>
            <li>It works -the original Amosan was better--this powder crystallizes but does dissolve in water-</li>
            <li>It was first recommended to me by my dentist after my family doctor wasn&#x27;t able to cure a sore throat that turned into inflamed gums.</li>
            <li>Keep making it and having it available for your loyal customers.</li>
            <li>I truly have discovered that no other rinse available is as effective.</li>
            <li>I used Amosan years ago after oral surgery and it heals and soothes any irritation you might have with gums, I wish it was not so hard to find because it is the best!</li>
            <li>This product satifies my very peticular mother and the price was cheaper than what she had been paying for many years.</li>
            <li>For a while they stopped making it and there was much travail inch from many others.</li>
            <li>Just as good as Amosan, same results.</li>
            <li>Went to P&amp;G/Oral B web site and sent e-mail, but popular demand is the only thing that will bring this great product back.</li>
            <li>The most effective&lt;br /&gt;treatment &amp; fast healing of cancer sores.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to see this on the market, as it an almost identical product to that of Oral B, this LIFE product worked exactly as advertised (same as the old Oral B product)</li>
            <li>Great product due to Amosan gone in all US stores</li>
            <li>Quickly clears up even say infections from wisdom teeth</li>
            <li>It quickly spread to all my gums and I was in unbearable pain.</li>
            <li>Soothing pain and promoting healing like no other product of it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li>I used Amosan for many years when I lived in New York.  </li>
            <li>She uses it to calm and combact inflamation under her gums around a dental bridge.</li>
            <li>I used product a few years ago with great success.  </li>
            <li>my mouth FRESH all</li>
            <li>Greed always wins.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s healing worth.</li>
            <li>This generic brand was not as effective as the Oral B product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I&#x27;ve depended on Amosan for many (35) years.</li>
            <li>Nothing seems to take the place of The original Amosan by Oral B. Cost too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Turns out you can get a pretty effective approximation of Amosan by mixing 2tsp/10ml of common first-aid type hydrogen peroxide (10 volume/3% strength) with 2tsp/10ml of warm water.</li>
            <li>You know when you get a little cankor sore or bite you cheek or have a cut on the top of your mouth from eating a great but crunchy sanswich on french bread.</li>
            <li>The price needs to be reduced but other than that very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This product was first recommended to me by an oral surgeon after some tooth surgery.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Amosan for many years and found the generic works as well as the brand name.  </li>
            <li>just desolve in warm water and swish in mouth for a couple of sec.</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing it over the internet, I would search around to find a store that sold the product and buy any where from 6 to 20 boxes at a time because so many people would ask me for it.</li>
            <li>It actually works, and has saved many trips to dentist office.  </li>
            <li>Then rinse exactly as you did with Amosan.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product, and the generic has been getting the same praise as the original.</li>
            <li>I just bought and used a generic of Gly-Oxide at CVS (as I needed it fast and didn&#x27;t want to pay the $15 that Walgreens was charging for Gly-Oxide, and so far am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not avaiable any more on German Market which is really a pitty.</li>
            <li>As you might be aware Amosan sold for as much as $50 a box online after it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the manufacturer for responding to a real need!</li>
            <li>The Amosan helped sooth and quickly heal the sensitive tissue.</li>
            <li>HOW can we get large companies to care about people?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose I understand seeing as I hardly ever used it, but when I needed it I really loved to have</li>
            <li>This product can be hard to come across in stores, so I&#x27;m glad to see that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I swear I will boycott and not buy any Oral-B, Gilette or P&amp;B products until I receive a REASONABLE ANSWER</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Thanks for writing.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Thanks again for contacting us.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laure&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B Team&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it  really helped.</li>
            <li>I am wondering if I paid WAAAAYYYY too much for this product.  </li>
            <li>He has cancer and the chemo causes his mouth to get very sore on occasion.</li>
            <li>and it works fast.</li>
            <li>Makes one think they are getting the real Amosan  when they are not....</li>
            <li>, see that the stuff I still have expired in 2011 and go online to see how much it is</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I bit the bullet and spent $25 USD on two boxes of this, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>YOU ARE TO THE REAL DEAL..</li>
            <li>The REAL cost of this product in Canada now, is about $7-$8</li>
            <li>Very healing.</li>
            <li>Does it really have to cost over $25 for 20 envelopes?</li>
            <li>SO WHAT if they&#x27;re not selling as much of it as they would like to.</li>
            <li>My dentist gave me an alternative when I could not find it and it did not hold a candle to how fast Amosan works.</li>
            <li>When I found this product available under a different supplier, I had to get it.  </li>
            <li>its really worked.bring it back.the redicilious price on amazone is unheard</li>
            <li>I stock this in my first aid kit, a little warm water one packet of this and a quick rinse will help sooth irritation from braces, damage to your gum, and extensive dental work.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE SECOND ORDER OF THIS PRODUCT AND EVEN THOUGH IS NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT,IT REALLY WORKS ,  DON&#x27;T HESITATE.....</li>
            <li>She has used this product for 15 years and she has found that this product helps her more than any other product on the market.</li>
            <li>It works better and quicker than any other mouth sore product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Yup, the same stuff you&#x27;ve used for years to clean cuts and scrapes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had used Amosan when I had my wisdom teeth removed, naturally my gums were pretty beat up from the process.</li>
            <li>i wonder how many like me, just cant pay $30 for something we know costs less than a 1/3 of the asking price?</li>
            <li>So many people are going to needlessly suffer without this product as it has helped them for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have just ordered this Canadian alternative, despite the high price, and hope that it works like Amosan.</li>
            <li>Amosan Oral Wound Cleanser Powder easily handles mouth sores from &amp;#34;fever&amp;#34; blisters to wounds from crackers or other foods.</li>
            <li>Great for pains, sores, bleeding gums and anything else wrong with the mouth.</li>
            <li>The generic one I received  did not seem fresh.</li>
            <li>and swish and hold it in my mouth against the sore area as long as I can, until the bubbles as full in my mouth as I can hold.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else for stopping bleeding gums (after heavy doses of cortisone).</li>
            <li>: Why don&#x27;t you sell the right to make Amosan to a smaller company so they can make it?</li>
            <li>\\&quot;You might find a new favorite!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would willingly pay double what I used to to have a continued supply of this.  </li>
            <li>I am always biting the inside of my mouth or my tongue, or burning the roof of my mouth on hot pizza or soup and getting those horrid white sores and this product heals them faster than anything I have tried.</li>
            <li>This should be advertised more clearly rather than titled as the original product, especially when you are charging this ridiculously over priced amount!</li>
            <li>I have found that, in addition to cleaning surgical wounds, it also eliminates any cold sores within a day or two, and it greatly relieves soar throats.  </li>
            <li>My mother has used this product since the early &#x27;70s; now it has been discontinued for some reason.</li>
            <li>an old time remedy for oral ulcers....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below is my old review.</li>
            <li>I was not healing properly, so I ordered Amosan and really help me with the gum&#x27;s swelling.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that with in a day my sores were nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>It did not seem to have the fast acting, overnight relief.</li>
            <li>REAL AMOSAN  is BACK !!!!!</li>
            <li>I received completely another product which is not manufactured by Oral-B at all.</li>
            <li>nothing works like old remedies.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the current manufacturer who provides it.  </li>
            <li>Is was worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Product is good for oral wound cleanser, and its sad Oral B stop production of this oral wound cleanser.</li>
            <li>I mix a half a package or envelope with only a tablespoon of hot water (not so hot that IT burns your mouth!)</li>
            <li>I would not buy this product again, especially considering the high price.</li>
            <li>I started using it several years ago and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>When I first came to Florida, I did find it, in a very limited amount in pharmacies.  </li>
            <li>The original works alot quicker and this one taste a little different</li>
            <li>here is, this product is no longer available in the US, and it is hard to find in Canada.</li>
            <li>It was introduced to him by his father, a general practitioner, for years before.</li>
            <li>It was completely reliable every time at healing occasional sore spots in my mouth that nothing else could cure.</li>
            <li>It is not a loose pdr.but</li>
            <li>Amosan Oral Wound Cleanser Powder works very well for canker sores or other mouth sores.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted the taste/texture is a very little bit different than Amosan, but that&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>There are little packets which you just stir into about two tablespoons of hot water and then rinse around in your mouth for a minute.</li>
            <li>Apparently this product has been in existence for decades, although no one I&#x27;ve asked about it ever heard of it until very recently when it began popping up on store shelves everywhere, supposedly in response to Amosan being discontinued.</li>
            <li>I seldom get canker sores bad enough to warrent a prompt solution other then good ole salt and warm water, but recently I got a really angry one near the back of my throat</li>

            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I have used Amosan by Oral B for many years and it was the best I had ever found for mouth irritations.</li>
            <li> It is the best oral rinse for inflamed/irritated gums, even better than warm salt water!</li>
            <li> I also thought the taste was pleasant.</li>
            <li> Easily the best over the counter product for any sort of mouth wound.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic and will make your mouth comfortable in a day or two!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> This  a good item to  have in your  medicine chest</li>
            <li> Imagine our happiness when we found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li> and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Amosan.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ORAL WOUND MOUTH WASH AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET;I WAS SURPRISE TO GET IT FROM CANADA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It tastes pleasant and is highly effective in controlling the problem.  </li>
            <li> I also wanted to recommend Gly-Oxide (available on Amazon for about $10) which gets very good reviews.</li>
            <li> is as good as the original product that I used for years and loved!</li>
            <li> priced right and works fine!!!!</li>
            <li> All i can say is it better work!</li>
            <li> So glad I found it again!</li>
            <li> nout at easy to find but a great addition to oral health regime</li>
            <li> It seems as effective, and I&#x27;m so glad someone still makes it!  </li>
            <li> It is really amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how using this product relieves some of the pain and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I use it any time I get any kind of mouth sore.  </li>
            <li> Recommend this product to people with any kind of mouth sores.</li>
            <li> The powder had cristalized and formed lumps and therefore did not dissolve properly in warm water.</li>
            <li> my Go-To drug for any kind of dental discomfort.    </li>
            <li> but if it were marketed more effectively for what it was, a superior rinse then it still would certaintly be a viable product for Oral-B.</li>
            <li> works effectively.</li>
            <li> IF YOU LIKED AMOSAN</li>
            <li> Instead I use warm water and peroxide to rinse my mouth.</li>
            <li> You just need to mix the two powders together yourself and mix in warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a fresh bottle of peroxide, and ideally mix it with a purified or distilled water stored in a sterile bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product  is good; however, not as effective as the original Oral B Amosan.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most effective mouthwash I have ever used and am so glad that I was able to purchase it online!  </li>
            <li> I do recommend this as a suitable alternative.</li>
            <li> Worked but not as good as the original Amosan</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for healing any kind of open sore in your mouth or sore gums I have ever tried and I have tried a lot of products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Amosan many years ago by my dentist for a gum irritation.  </li>
            <li> believe if they promoted this item better it would be their top selling product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, and the taste is quite pleasant too.</li>
            <li> It works ok but is not Amosan as it was represented.</li>
            <li> But I thank you for being able to have product.</li>
            <li> This one he seemed to tolerate much better and</li>
            <li> It is the generic substitute of Amosan - which I always found to be the best for Oral Wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;haninius</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, nothing works better on canker sores.</li>
            <li> and I guess he is OK with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Amosan for many years to heal my mouth when I have a sore.  </li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t used this in years, but it is magic.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Wish it were cheaper like I used to be able to buy.  </li>
            <li> So glad to have located this product again.</li>
            <li> Amosan is the most reliable oral would cleanser</li>
            <li> I have been using AMOSAN for many many Years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, most people just don&#x27;t know about this product because it wasn&#x27;t advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found it again.</li>
            <li> But my gums are grateful it still exists (unlike so many products that work well</li>
            <li> It was basically a home remedy, now you have to go to a dentist and spend more money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many others, I miss Amosan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For more convenience (plus a minty taste)</li>
            <li> using it for more than 20 years.how could youall.</li>
            <li> great product, clean fresh mouth and breath</li>
            <li> it is wonderful, although in Spain it does not exist anymore, it is a pity....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> We have used Amosan by oral B for many years, however this product works as well as the original.</li>
            <li> Had major irritation from dental work and this product helped great.</li>
            <li> I would be OK with the cost except for the fact that it is not the same very effective Oral-B product that I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> works absolutely perfectly and tastes exactly the same as Amosan.</li>
            <li> It works more quickly than any others I have tried</li>
            <li> Really hard to find this product any more works like magic!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They had a huge markup and presumably profit on this product.</li>
            <li> I rarely have to do it more than once.</li>
            <li> Amazon, if you can locate this product, PLEASE make it available for purchase.</li>
            <li> There is nothing else like it available....</li>
            <li> Not only does it help with mouth sores, but is great for Strep, Post-Dental work, and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> It seems they bought up all the available Amosan when it was available and now are</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just add that this is the only truly great oral rinse if you&#x27;re seeking relief from canker sores or oral injuries.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why it is no longer available in pharmacies.</li>
            <li> Great to see it back.</li>
            <li> I suspect if they charged a more reasonable price, they would sell more.</li>
            <li> IF YOU LIKED AMOSAN, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone with any kind of mouth sore, injury, etc.</li>
            <li> OK, BUT NOT AS STRONG OR AS FAST AS ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li> It does not work quite as well as the original, but when you need relief, and it is 3 times the price of original</li>
            <li> seems to work as well as original Amosan</li>
            <li> The original product sold for about 8.99 when it was on the shelf and this knock off is 3 times that amount.</li>
            <li> It works -the original Amosan was better--this powder crystallizes but does dissolve in water-</li>
            <li> It was first recommended to me by my dentist after my family doctor wasn&#x27;t able to cure a sore throat that turned into inflamed gums.</li>
            <li> Keep making it and having it available for your loyal customers.</li>
            <li> I truly have discovered that no other rinse available is as effective.</li>
            <li> I used Amosan years ago after oral surgery and it heals and soothes any irritation you might have with gums, I wish it was not so hard to find because it is the best!</li>
            <li> This product satifies my very peticular mother and the price was cheaper than what she had been paying for many years.</li>
            <li> For a while they stopped making it and there was much travail inch from many others.</li>
            <li> Just as good as Amosan, same results.</li>
            <li> Went to P&amp;G/Oral B web site and sent e-mail, but popular demand is the only thing that will bring this great product back.</li>
            <li> The most effective&lt;br /&gt;treatment &amp; fast healing of cancer sores.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to see this on the market, as it an almost identical product to that of Oral B, this LIFE product worked exactly as advertised (same as the old Oral B product)</li>
            <li> Great product due to Amosan gone in all US stores</li>
            <li> Quickly clears up even say infections from wisdom teeth</li>
            <li> It quickly spread to all my gums and I was in unbearable pain.</li>
            <li> Soothing pain and promoting healing like no other product of it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li> I used Amosan for many years when I lived in New York.  </li>
            <li> She uses it to calm and combact inflamation under her gums around a dental bridge.</li>
            <li> I used product a few years ago with great success.  </li>
            <li> my mouth FRESH all</li>
            <li> Greed always wins.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s healing worth.</li>
            <li> This generic brand was not as effective as the Oral B product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I&#x27;ve depended on Amosan for many (35) years.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to take the place of The original Amosan by Oral B. Cost too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Turns out you can get a pretty effective approximation of Amosan by mixing 2tsp/10ml of common first-aid type hydrogen peroxide (10 volume/3% strength) with 2tsp/10ml of warm water.</li>
            <li> You know when you get a little cankor sore or bite you cheek or have a cut on the top of your mouth from eating a great but crunchy sanswich on french bread.</li>
            <li> The price needs to be reduced but other than that very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product was first recommended to me by an oral surgeon after some tooth surgery.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Amosan for many years and found the generic works as well as the brand name.  </li>
            <li> just desolve in warm water and swish in mouth for a couple of sec.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing it over the internet, I would search around to find a store that sold the product and buy any where from 6 to 20 boxes at a time because so many people would ask me for it.</li>
            <li> It actually works, and has saved many trips to dentist office.  </li>
            <li> Then rinse exactly as you did with Amosan.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product, and the generic has been getting the same praise as the original.</li>
            <li> I just bought and used a generic of Gly-Oxide at CVS (as I needed it fast and didn&#x27;t want to pay the $15 that Walgreens was charging for Gly-Oxide, and so far am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not avaiable any more on German Market which is really a pitty.</li>
            <li> As you might be aware Amosan sold for as much as $50 a box online after it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the manufacturer for responding to a real need!</li>
            <li> The Amosan helped sooth and quickly heal the sensitive tissue.</li>
            <li> HOW can we get large companies to care about people?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose I understand seeing as I hardly ever used it, but when I needed it I really loved to have</li>
            <li> This product can be hard to come across in stores, so I&#x27;m glad to see that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I swear I will boycott and not buy any Oral-B, Gilette or P&amp;B products until I receive a REASONABLE ANSWER</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Thanks for writing.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Thanks again for contacting us.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laure&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B Team&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it  really helped.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if I paid WAAAAYYYY too much for this product.  </li>
            <li> He has cancer and the chemo causes his mouth to get very sore on occasion.</li>
            <li> and it works fast.</li>
            <li> Makes one think they are getting the real Amosan  when they are not....</li>
            <li> , see that the stuff I still have expired in 2011 and go online to see how much it is</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I bit the bullet and spent $25 USD on two boxes of this, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> YOU ARE TO THE REAL DEAL..</li>
            <li> The REAL cost of this product in Canada now, is about $7-$8</li>
            <li> Very healing.</li>
            <li> Does it really have to cost over $25 for 20 envelopes?</li>
            <li> SO WHAT if they&#x27;re not selling as much of it as they would like to.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me an alternative when I could not find it and it did not hold a candle to how fast Amosan works.</li>
            <li> When I found this product available under a different supplier, I had to get it.  </li>
            <li> its really worked.bring it back.the redicilious price on amazone is unheard</li>
            <li> I stock this in my first aid kit, a little warm water one packet of this and a quick rinse will help sooth irritation from braces, damage to your gum, and extensive dental work.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE SECOND ORDER OF THIS PRODUCT AND EVEN THOUGH IS NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT,IT REALLY WORKS ,  DON&#x27;T HESITATE.....</li>
            <li> She has used this product for 15 years and she has found that this product helps her more than any other product on the market.</li>
            <li> It works better and quicker than any other mouth sore product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Yup, the same stuff you&#x27;ve used for years to clean cuts and scrapes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had used Amosan when I had my wisdom teeth removed, naturally my gums were pretty beat up from the process.</li>
            <li> i wonder how many like me, just cant pay $30 for something we know costs less than a 1/3 of the asking price?</li>
            <li> So many people are going to needlessly suffer without this product as it has helped them for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have just ordered this Canadian alternative, despite the high price, and hope that it works like Amosan.</li>
            <li> Amosan Oral Wound Cleanser Powder easily handles mouth sores from &amp;#34;fever&amp;#34; blisters to wounds from crackers or other foods.</li>
            <li> Great for pains, sores, bleeding gums and anything else wrong with the mouth.</li>
            <li> The generic one I received  did not seem fresh.</li>
            <li> and swish and hold it in my mouth against the sore area as long as I can, until the bubbles as full in my mouth as I can hold.</li>
            <li> It works better than anything else for stopping bleeding gums (after heavy doses of cortisone).</li>
            <li> : Why don&#x27;t you sell the right to make Amosan to a smaller company so they can make it?</li>
            <li> \\&quot;You might find a new favorite!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would willingly pay double what I used to to have a continued supply of this.  </li>
            <li> I am always biting the inside of my mouth or my tongue, or burning the roof of my mouth on hot pizza or soup and getting those horrid white sores and this product heals them faster than anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> This should be advertised more clearly rather than titled as the original product, especially when you are charging this ridiculously over priced amount!</li>
            <li> I have found that, in addition to cleaning surgical wounds, it also eliminates any cold sores within a day or two, and it greatly relieves soar throats.  </li>
            <li> My mother has used this product since the early &#x27;70s; now it has been discontinued for some reason.</li>
            <li> an old time remedy for oral ulcers....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below is my old review.</li>
            <li> I was not healing properly, so I ordered Amosan and really help me with the gum&#x27;s swelling.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that with in a day my sores were nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> It did not seem to have the fast acting, overnight relief.</li>
            <li> REAL AMOSAN  is BACK !!!!!</li>
            <li> I received completely another product which is not manufactured by Oral-B at all.</li>
            <li> nothing works like old remedies.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the current manufacturer who provides it.  </li>
            <li> Is was worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Product is good for oral wound cleanser, and its sad Oral B stop production of this oral wound cleanser.</li>
            <li> I mix a half a package or envelope with only a tablespoon of hot water (not so hot that IT burns your mouth!)</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again, especially considering the high price.</li>
            <li> I started using it several years ago and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I first came to Florida, I did find it, in a very limited amount in pharmacies.  </li>
            <li> The original works alot quicker and this one taste a little different</li>
            <li> here is, this product is no longer available in the US, and it is hard to find in Canada.</li>
            <li> It was introduced to him by his father, a general practitioner, for years before.</li>
            <li> It was completely reliable every time at healing occasional sore spots in my mouth that nothing else could cure.</li>
            <li> It is not a loose pdr.but</li>
            <li> Amosan Oral Wound Cleanser Powder works very well for canker sores or other mouth sores.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted the taste/texture is a very little bit different than Amosan, but that&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> There are little packets which you just stir into about two tablespoons of hot water and then rinse around in your mouth for a minute.</li>
            <li> Apparently this product has been in existence for decades, although no one I&#x27;ve asked about it ever heard of it until very recently when it began popping up on store shelves everywhere, supposedly in response to Amosan being discontinued.</li>
            <li> I seldom get canker sores bad enough to warrent a prompt solution other then good ole salt and warm water, but recently I got a really angry one near the back of my throat</li>
            <li> A lot less espensive than buying it in New Zeland.</li>
            <li> It really helps with small cuts</li>
            <li> It only took a few days for the redness to completely go away.</li>
            <li> the other reviewer said, how can they justify so many rudundant manual tooth brushes that hardly anyone ever uses anymore, and not sell this, you would think they could just raise the price and sell it in small amounts or something, Bring back Oral-B Amosan.</li>
            <li> I searched everywhere to find this stuff and in the meantime used several other products that were only of limited benefit.</li>
            <li> It has been increasingly difficult to find through the years, and I am extremely perplexed as how I will control this problem without having to ingest a systemic product.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s fairly expensive, I wish it had arrived in a-one condition, or were available in the stores, as Amosan used to be.  </li>
            <li> I used the original Amosan for years and this fake does not perform at all.</li>
            <li> As it is packaged it has a long life of effectiveness!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re at this product page, you most likely have bad canker sores, you used to use Amosan from Oral-B, and you&#x27;re wondering if this product is an equivalent.</li>
            <li> Applied differently (just put a few drops undiluted on the oral wound) but similar pain relief and hopefully healing.</li>
            <li> If there was not a high enough demand it was due to the manufacturer not advertising it.  </li>
            <li> I understand that perhaps the customer demand was limited</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been off the shelves until my last supply dwindled down to nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about twenty years, paid  much less, but it is NOT the same product.</li>
            <li> he actually admitted it may have helped a little.</li>
            <li> hard to fix old products on the market to buy that work like they should.</li>
            <li> I use the hottest water I can tolerate, empty the packet in the water and swish it around my mouth at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> For the last few years, I could not find it in any of them.  </li>
            <li> Mouthwash with alcohol didn&#x27;t do a thing, nor did careful flossing or brushing.  </li>
            <li> It is BEYOND bitter to the point of not useable.  </li>
            <li> It was just too bitter to describe.</li>
            <li> One problem:  the envelopes appear to have gotten wet along the way (warehouse?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked that not only has this product has been DC&#x27;d, but that the sellers on Amazon, who still have a limited supply, have jacked the price up tremendously.  </li>
            <li> not good as old amosan</li>
            <li> I ran back to Amazon to buy some more, only to be confronted with the terrible reality that it&#x27;s not even being produced anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wrong in my first review.  </li>
            <li> ORAJEL is just like the other products on the market which gives people, who are unfamiliar with AMOSAN, no motivation to buy ORAGEL.</li>
            <li> (and thousands of other products)</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive, but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> One can buy the active ingredient, sodium perborate monohydrate, as a cleaning agent for ~ $6 a pound.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to get out of the packet (which wastes some), and harder to dissolve.  </li>
            <li> active ingredient in Amosan is (or rather was) sodium perborate.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s much too expensive.</li>
            <li> Showed up several days late even though I had prime.</li>
            <li> That said - while I haven&#x27;t purchased it for several years, the price has at least quadrupled.</li>
            <li> It was a let down.</li>
            <li> This product is not the same as the (oral-B) but worked very well healing painful spots in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Yes, in less than a minute a lingering problem was fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t believe this product is seriously gone, This stuff actually works</li>
            <li> Its being sold on Amazon for less than this product&lt;</li>
            <li> and apparently it was a well&lt;br /&gt;kept secret.  </li>
            <li> That plus a little buffer and flavor and foil packaging and they sold it for $6/box, which has ~ 25 grams.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but the Oral-B Amosan Oral Rinse has been discontinued and it&#x27;s no longer available.\\&quot; \\&quot;Generally, decisions to start or stop making products are based on consumer demand, so feedback like yours is extremely valuable.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very picky and tried several diffferent mouthwashes, but hated them all.  </li>
            <li> a sticky mess, hard to get out of the packet.</li>
            <li> I chewed nicotine gum to rid myself of a bad habit; during this time, my mouth was absolutely on fire if I ate any acidic food.</li>
            <li> Usually when I wake up the pain is gone.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is a FDA approved product.</li>
            <li> You should not advertise a false brand that is nation wide know and switch products.</li>
            <li> All the packages in the box are hard and caked together, almost like they got wet and dried into lumps, very difficult to dissolve, not at all like the previous box</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also annoyed at the ridiculous, and seemingly endless amount of styles of tooth brushes and flavors of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it in the stores, that&#x27;s why I order on-line</li>
            <li> A hard to find item but found it here and was so helpful in healing my mouth after dental surgery.</li>
            <li> I just have the kids use saltwater if they catch it early to save on cost and save the Amosan for when they get a bad one.</li>
            <li> This is not a question, this is a complaint.  </li>
            <li> Used it for at least 20 years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Then after I have spit it out, I don&#x27;t rinse for at least 10 minutes and it will keep working for a while after that.</li>
            <li> It was an expensive product, so don&#x27;t waste your time hoping it will work for you!</li>
            <li> Very hard to find product.</li>
            <li> If you ever hurt the inside of your mouth by biting, or if you ever have surgery of get false teeth, use this-</li>
            <li> I think it should be a crime to discontinue a product that cures such painful and dangerous conditions.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Why OralB stopped is questionable.  </li>
            <li> However, it is now so wicked expensive that I will have to find an alternative.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Please be assured I&#x27;m sharing your disappointment with the rest of our team.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m have been afraid to try it.  </li>
            <li> If you have bad canker sores, $25 is nothing for the relief this product can bring.</li>
            <li> Absolutely shocked when I read it was discontinued - this is (was?)  </li>
            <li> And it was very expensive!</li>
            <li> This is a very Bad product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now, the sellers are asking anywhere from $35 to $50 for a 20-pack. GOUGING at its worst.  </li>
            <li> I had a horrible sore like I haven&#x27;t had in years</li>
            <li> I REFUSE to pay the outrageous price they&#x27;re asking for this!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good for sore mouths after dental cleaning</li>
            <li> only product that ever worked</li>
            <li> Why would this be discontinued...it is a great product.  This is the only thing that helps me with mouth pain. What is oral-b/ p &amp; g thinking?</li>
            <li> It does not work quite as well as the original, but when you need relief, and it is 3 times the price of original</li>
            <li> I love this product. I keep extra on hand and always take it on trips. You know when you get a little cankor sore or bite you cheek or have a cut on the top of your mouth from eating a great but crunchy sanswich on french bread. There are little packets which you just stir into about two tablespoons of hot water and then rinse around in your mouth for a minute. I rarely have to do it more than once. It is really amazing.</li>
            <li> My mother has used this product since the early &#x27;70s; now it has been discontinued for some reason. She doesn&#x27;t do well with changing products. Amazon, if you can locate this product, PLEASE make it available for purchase.</li>
            <li> i did not expect to receive the generic brand.  It was a let down.</li>
            <li> This is a message I wrote to Oral-B. IF YOU LIKED AMOSAN, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO DO THE SAME.    This is not a question, this is a complaint.  I discovered that Amosan was recently discontinued as all the pharmacies doesn&#x27;t have any stock.  While searching online for a substitute and a reason why that product was discontinued I found out that NO SUBSTITUTE EXIST and that you have discontinued it because there was no sufficient demand. Do you have sufficient demand to justify having OVER 20 MODELS OF MANUAL TOOTHBRUSH?  As you might be aware Amosan sold for as much as $50 a box online after it was discontinued. People don&#x27;t need Amosan every day, but when they need it, it&#x27;s the only option they got.    I swear I will boycott and not buy any Oral-B, Gilette or P&amp;B products until I receive a REASONABLE ANSWER or I see Amosan back on the shelves.</li>
            <li> They had a huge markup and presumably profit on this product. One can buy the active ingredient, sodium perborate monohydrate, as a cleaning agent for ~ $6 a pound.  See [...]  That plus a little buffer and flavor and foil packaging and they sold it for $6/box, which has ~ 25 grams.  454 grams/lb)  PS, I am NOT recommending using this as a replacement for Amosan</li>
            <li> The product is great but the cost to have it shipped to me was over $8.00 which was over the top!!! I won&#x27;t order from this company again!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff for any oral injury or problem.  I use it any time I get any kind of mouth sore.  It is the best.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Amosan many years ago by my dentist for a gum irritation.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since for occasional irritation.  I use the hottest water I can tolerate, empty the packet in the water and swish it around my mouth at bedtime.  Usually when I wake up the pain is gone. I have a hard time finding it in the stores, that&#x27;s why I order on-line</li>
            <li> Why oh why is this product discontinued??  It&#x27;s the best formula out there to relieve oral irritation.  Nothing else seems to work as well as this one.  I hope Oral B puts this back in the market.....</li>
            <li> I used Amosan for many years when I lived in New York.  It was recommended by a dentist, and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  When I first came to Florida, I did find it, in a very limited amount in pharmacies.  For the last few years, I could not find it in any of them.  Finally, I decided to check Amazon.  To my great pleasure, I found it.  It is great to help gum irritations caused by dentures.  When I run out, I know where to find it.</li>
            <li> seems to work as well as original Amosan</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as Amosan. It&#x27;s helping with sores caused by dentures. Recommend this product to people with any kind of mouth sores.</li>
            <li> Can you believe it Oral B has discontined this product.  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING.  If they only saw all the raving reviews for Amosan Oral Wound Cleanser then they never would of stop making it.  So many people are going to needlessly suffer without this product as it has helped them for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE EVERYONE......CONTACT ORAL B AND REQUEST THIS ITEM BACK IN PRODUCTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe if they promoted this item better it would be their top selling product.&lt;br /&gt;YES I BELIEVE THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted them about why it was discontinued and whether they will bring it back. This was their response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thanks for writing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but the Oral-B Amosan Oral Rinse has been discontinued and it&#x27;s no longer available.\\&quot; \\&quot;Generally, decisions to start or stop making products are based on consumer demand, so feedback like yours is extremely valuable.\\&quot;  \\&quot;Please be assured I&#x27;m sharing your disappointment with the rest of our team.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Since I don&#x27;t have a recommendation for you at this time, you may want to check our brand websites for information about our current products.\\&quot;  \\&quot;You might find a new favorite!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thanks again for contacting us.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laure&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B Team&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO THEY DON&#x27;T EVEN HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO SUBSTITUTE THE DISCONTINUED AMOSAN....&lt;br /&gt;WHATS THAT TELL YOU....THERES NOTHING LIKE AMOSAN OR EVEN CLOSE...&lt;br /&gt;SAD..</li>
            <li> I have used Amosan by Oral B for many years and it was the best I had ever found for mouth irritations. The generic one I received  did not seem fresh. The powder had cristalized and formed lumps and therefore did not dissolve properly in warm water. I would not buy this product again, especially considering the high price.</li>
            <li> OK, BUT NOT AS STRONG OR AS FAST AS ORIGINAL. OTHERWISE, SHIPPING, BENEFITS, AND INFORMATION WERE ACCEPTABLE AS THEY WERE ADVERTIZED.</li>
            <li> This was suggested by my dentist to help with any oral wounds and it is excellent.  If you ever hurt the inside of your mouth by biting, or if you ever have surgery of get false teeth, use this- it&#x27;s fantastic and will make your mouth comfortable in a day or two!!!!!</li>
            <li> an old time remedy for oral ulcers....works when nothing else does.....</li>
            <li> Product is good for oral wound cleanser, and its sad Oral B stop production of this oral wound cleanser.</li>
            <li> Get this product back on the shelves!  There is nothing else like it available....why take off a product that works well and that people want?  Is anyone at that company even thinking?</li>
            <li> Worked but not as good as the original Amosan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to find another product that calms my hypersensitive mouth as well as Amosan. I chewed nicotine gum to rid myself of a bad habit; during this time, my mouth was absolutely on fire if I ate any acidic food. Amosan, even once per day, healed the inflamed lining of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Great for pains, sores, bleeding gums and anything else wrong with the mouth. Been using for thirty years and swear by it.</li>
            <li> This product was first recommended to me by an oral surgeon after some tooth surgery.  I have found that, in addition to cleaning surgical wounds, it also eliminates any cold sores within a day or two, and it greatly relieves soar throats.  I would do commercials for this product!!  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Had major irritation from dental work and this product helped great. Would recommend .</li>
            <li> I have gum sensitivity and a tooth which continues to hurt even following root canal and crown.  One suggestion was that I use this product (not from a dentist) since nothing else has helped.  It is amazing how using this product relieves some of the pain and sensitivity.  Is was worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely shocked when I read it was discontinued - this is (was?)  my Go-To drug for any kind of dental discomfort.    How do we get Oral B to make it again?  I would willingly pay double what I used to to have a continued supply of this.  pat maley</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked that not only has this product has been DC&#x27;d, but that the sellers on Amazon, who still have a limited supply, have jacked the price up tremendously.  I paid $6.00 (for a 20-pack) in the drugstore the last time I purchased it. Now, the sellers are asking anywhere from $35 to $50 for a 20-pack. GOUGING at its worst.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used for any kind of oral discomfort and healing.  I started using it several years ago and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Amosan for over 15 years to control chronic candida (yeast) in my mouth.  It tastes pleasant and is highly effective in controlling the problem.  It has been increasingly difficult to find through the years, and I am extremely perplexed as how I will control this problem without having to ingest a systemic product.  Please, Oral B, bring this product back for sale.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Have not needed to use yet. If it performs like Amosan did, it will be great.</li>
            <li> Easily the best over the counter product for any sort of mouth wound.  Soothing pain and promoting healing like no other product of it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li> BRING AMOSAN BACK!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is my old review. I can&#x27;t believe this product has been discontinued. I&#x27;ve had a supply of it and had no clue it&#x27;s been off the shelves until my last supply dwindled down to nothing. I ran back to Amazon to buy some more, only to be confronted with the terrible reality that it&#x27;s not even being produced anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING AMOSAN BACK!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for 20 years now to help deal with my chronic canker sores. It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, and the taste is quite pleasant too. This product can be hard to come across in stores, so I&#x27;m glad to see that it&#x27;s available on Amazon. Highly recommended for anyone with any kind of mouth sore, injury, etc.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to have found the Oral-B rinse at Amazon. I purchased this product for my mother. She has used this product for 15 years and she has found that this product helps her more than any other product on the market. She uses it to calm and combact inflamation under her gums around a dental bridge. The problem was she could no longer find this product at any drug stores in the Phoenix area. The area drug stores were nolonger carring this product on their shelves. So I looked up this product on Amazon and there it was. This product satifies my very peticular mother and the price was cheaper than what she had been paying for many years. Thank You Linda</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and loved it.  If there was not a high enough demand it was due to the manufacturer not advertising it.  I think people only knew of it by word of mouth and apparently it was a well&lt;br /&gt;kept secret.  Shame on you Proctor &amp; Gamble.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help with mouth sores, but is great for Strep, Post-Dental work, and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used Amosan off and on for decades. If you ever get a mouth sore from dental treatments to whatever gremlins produce these horros, then even one rinse with Amosan should bring relief.</li>
            <li> I was wrong in my first review.  I have tried this for the last two days &amp; it seems to be working.  Also I was very impressed that the seller reached out to me &amp; was worried about my concerns.  I would  &amp; will buy this again..Thank you!</li>
            <li> I had used Amosan whenever I had a sore throat and it  really helped. I had&lt;br /&gt;bought Amosan at the local Walgreens for about $5-$6.00 for a box of 20. Oral-B no longer makes it and now the Amazon seller &#x27;Generic Amosan&#x27; is price gauging and charging $25.99 for the same product. It seems they bought up all the available Amosan when it was available and now are&lt;br /&gt;getting whatever price they can get for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B: Please make Amosan again.&lt;br /&gt;Generic Amosan: it is unconscionable what you are charging and the money you are making on this product.</li>
            <li> .....It is another brand...called Life.  I am wondering if I paid WAAAAYYYY too much for this product.  It works ok but is not Amosan as it was represented.</li>
            <li> it is wonderful, although in Spain it does not exist anymore, it is a pity....that&#x27;s why I had to buy it in USA</li>
            <li> The original works alot quicker and this one taste a little different but I&#x27;m happy just to have it. But I thank you for being able to have product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m have been afraid to try it.  Why was another brand substituted for Amosan Oral Wound Cleanser Powder?  If I get answere to this I might try it.</li>
            <li> All the packages in the box are hard and caked together, almost like they got wet and dried into lumps, very difficult to dissolve, not at all like the previous box</li>
            <li> This product is not the same as the (oral-B) but worked very well healing painful spots in my mouth. This  a good item to  have in your  medicine chest</li>
            <li> nout at easy to find but a great addition to oral health regime</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my grandson to use.  He has cancer and the chemo causes his mouth to get very sore on occasion. He&#x27;s very picky and tried several diffferent mouthwashes, but hated them all.  This one he seemed to tolerate much better and he actually admitted it may have helped a little.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years when needed and it always worked.</li>
            <li> It is the generic substitute of Amosan - which I always found to be the best for Oral Wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;haninius</li>
            <li> I like it. It does the job it suppose to  do.  I always like to keep it on hand because we use it when we need it and it works fast.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been waiting.  Now it&#x27;s here. Keep making it and having it available for your loyal customers. Thank you, Richard</li>
            <li> I thought that I was ordering Amosan Oral Wound Cleaner Powder like it&#x27;s pictured in the review pic. What i received is a generic product that I can only hope is as good as the original product that I used for years and loved! This should be advertised more clearly rather than titled as the original product, especially when you are charging this ridiculously over priced amount! The original product sold for about 8.99 when it was on the shelf and this knock off is 3 times that amount. All i can say is it better work!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, nothing works better on canker sores.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to see this on the market, as it an almost identical product to that of Oral B, this LIFE product worked exactly as advertised (same as the old Oral B product)</li>
            <li> My husband is a periodontist and has been using Amosan for thirty years, since I started practice in 1974.  It was introduced to him by his father, a general practitioner, for years before. He would use it and give it to patients for a variety of ailments., When the company stopped making it, we bought it from Australia.  Imagine our happiness when we found it on Amazon.  It is an amazing product, and the generic has been getting the same praise as the original.</li>
            <li> This is a very Bad product. I used the original Amosan for years and this fake does not perform at all. Amazon should discontinue offering it</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my grandson and I guess he is OK with it</li>
            <li> Yes!&lt;br /&gt;Love the product!&lt;br /&gt;Kept my mouth FRESH all day!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product would return asap.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for healing mouth and lip sores.  Used it for at least 20 years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Amosan for many years to heal my mouth when I have a sore.  It&#x27;s good stuff.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t used this in years, but it is magic.  Had a gum problem between two teeth.  Mouthwash with alcohol didn&#x27;t do a thing, nor did careful flossing or brushing.  One envelope cured the problem.  Yes, in less than a minute a lingering problem was fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive?  You decide.</li>
            <li> This product is not &amp;#34;AMOSAN&amp;#34;.....it is similiar.....To use the word Amosan and to show a picture of an Amosan box is misleading...Makes one think they are getting the real Amosan  when they are not....Please do not market it this way.</li>
            <li> great product, clean fresh mouth and breath</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have ever tried to cure any mouth abrasions.  It works more quickly than any others I have tried and I definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I seldom get canker sores bad enough to warrent a prompt solution other then good ole salt and warm water, but recently I got a really angry one near the back of my throat and I go looking for Amosan, see that the stuff I still have expired in 2011 and go online to see how much it is, I can&#x27;t believe this product is seriously gone, This stuff actually works I suppose I understand seeing as I hardly ever used it, but when I needed it I really loved to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other reviewer said, how can they justify so many rudundant manual tooth brushes that hardly anyone ever uses anymore, and not sell this, you would think they could just raise the price and sell it in small amounts or something, Bring back Oral-B Amosan.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Satisfied customer. Thanks</li>
            <li> The packages were damp on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;Had no effects as the OralaB Amosan did.&lt;br /&gt;It was a total loss of money.</li>
            <li> Although I was led to believe that this Oral-B product was what I would receive, I instead received a different product, in a different box. The consistency of the powder was coarser and did not dissolve well. And it was very expensive! I would be OK with the cost except for the fact that it is not the same very effective Oral-B product that I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Amosan for many years and found the generic works as well as the brand name.  I recently had a tooth pulled and was told to rinse with salt water.  It burned.  I used Amosan and the wound cleared in a short time.  I always have some on hand.</li>
            <li> Not amosan as advertised</li>
            <li> This product is no longer produced in the US. It was produced in France and does not seem to be of the same quality as the US produced mproduct</li>
            <li> For a family prone to canker sores this is a lifesaver!  Wish it were cheaper like I used to be able to buy.  I just have the kids use saltwater if they catch it early to save on cost and save the Amosan for when they get a bad one.</li>
            <li> Did not work well, did not dissolve well. It was not amosan.</li>
            <li> So glad to have located this product again. Amosan Oral Wound Cleanser Powder easily handles mouth sores from &amp;#34;fever&amp;#34; blisters to wounds from crackers or other foods.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re at this product page, you most likely have bad canker sores, you used to use Amosan from Oral-B, and you&#x27;re wondering if this product is an equivalent. Basically, yes. As other reviewers have noted the taste/texture is a very little bit different than Amosan, but that&#x27;s OK, it works just the same and it does a good job. I bit the bullet and spent $25 USD on two boxes of this, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I had a horrible sore like I haven&#x27;t had in years and this was the only thing that it responded to. If you have bad canker sores, $25 is nothing for the relief this product can bring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just add that this is the only truly great oral rinse if you&#x27;re seeking relief from canker sores or oral injuries.  I recall four or five events where I drove to the pharmacy to retrieve this item and since it&#x27;s become obsolete I truly have discovered that no other rinse available is as effective. I understand that perhaps the customer demand was limited but if it were marketed more effectively for what it was, a superior rinse then it still would certaintly be a viable product for Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Great product due to Amosan gone in all US stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about twenty years, paid  much less, but it is NOT the same product. It is not a loose pdr.but a sticky mess, hard to get out of the packet.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have used this product for years. I would recommend for any oral problem.</li>
            <li> same ingredients as Amosan. works effectively. use it for irritated gums and after dental work.</li>
            <li> It works -the original Amosan was better--this powder crystallizes but does dissolve in water-</li>
            <li> The is closest to Amosan in the olden days.  Quickly clears up even say infections from wisdom teeth</li>
            <li> Did  provide the oral aid I wanted. I don&#x27;t understand why it is no longer available in pharmacies.</li>
            <li> it works very good for mouth ulcers, but havent used in months as have had no ulcers or mouth problems</li>
            <li> Amosan is the most reliable oral would cleanser I have ever used!  I hope this works as well.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE SECOND ORDER OF THIS PRODUCT AND EVEN THOUGH IS NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT,IT REALLY WORKS ,  DON&#x27;T HESITATE..... IF YOU LIKED AMOSAN THIS IS THE CLOSEST YOU ARE TO THE REAL DEAL..THANK YOU...</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for healing any kind of open sore in your mouth or sore gums I have ever tried and I have tried a lot of products. I am always biting the inside of my mouth or my tongue, or burning the roof of my mouth on hot pizza or soup and getting those horrid white sores and this product heals them faster than anything I have tried. I mix a half a package or envelope with only a tablespoon of hot water (not so hot that IT burns your mouth!) and swish and hold it in my mouth against the sore area as long as I can, until the bubbles as full in my mouth as I can hold. Then after I have spit it out, I don&#x27;t rinse for at least 10 minutes and it will keep working for a while after that. It even makes the paid go away for a while too, which is a great added plus for me! I hope they keep making this!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is just like the one that used to be produced by Oral B. But it&#x27;s much too expensive. Instead I use warm water and peroxide to rinse my mouth.</li>
            <li> Last year I had some dental work done and the removal of one molar.  I was not healing properly, so I ordered Amosan and really help me with the gum&#x27;s swelling.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Showed up several days late even though I had prime.</li>
            <li> If you have ever experienced the pain of a canker sore and don&#x27;t want to wait the two weeks that it takes for them to heal by themselves, Amosan provides relief in one or two applications. I&#x27;m so glad I found it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking it was similar to the Oral B Amosan- that it would relieve my canker sores. I was wrong. It was an expensive product, so don&#x27;t waste your time hoping it will work for you!</li>
            <li> The best medication ever for mouth and gum sores. I always used it. I don&#x27;t know why they stopped making it in America. Thankfully, I can get it through Amazon.com. It is a little expensive, but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> great stuff. works well</li>
            <li> not good as old amosan</li>
            <li> Really hard to find this product any more works like magic!!!!!! priced right and works fine!!!! just desolve in warm water and swish in mouth for a couple of sec. will fix denture sores in a couple of Hrs......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that can prevent peritonitis.&lt;br /&gt;Problem here is, this product is no longer available in the US, and it is hard to find in Canada. The REAL cost of this product in Canada now, is about $7-$8 so this is a bit of a rip off - unless you need it - which is what they count on.&lt;br /&gt;They could still make plenty of profit by just doubling their cost and charging a moderate $5 shipping fee, but no. Greed always wins. i wonder how many like me, just cant pay $30 for something we know costs less than a 1/3 of the asking price? I suspect if they charged a more reasonable price, they would sell more. i understand the hassles of importing and that costs are associated, but this seems to be big gouge.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find product.</li>
            <li> This product was made by Oral B for years, then they discontinued it.  Had to go online to find it made by another company.  It is the best oral rinse for inflamed/irritated gums, even better than warm salt water!</li>
            <li> I had some sores in my mouth and my dentist gave me a package to try.  I was amazed that with in a day my sores were nearly gone.  It also works wonderful for canker sores. If you feel a canker sore coming on rinse with the Amosan cleanser and you will not get a canker sore.  I am sold and thankful for a great product. &lt;br /&gt;Connie</li>
            <li> It does the job for oral sores.</li>
            <li> I have been using AMOSAN for many many Years. I&#x27;ve also recommended it to dozens of people who were all amazed at its&#x27; effectiveness. I cannot imagine why Oral B would discontinue this product. Prior to purchasing it over the internet, I would search around to find a store that sold the product and buy any where from 6 to 20 boxes at a time because so many people would ask me for it. Unfortunately, most people just don&#x27;t know about this product because it wasn&#x27;t advertised.&lt;br /&gt;The ORAJEL is just like the other products on the market which gives people, who are unfamiliar with AMOSAN, no motivation to buy ORAGEL.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle item.  Why OralB stopped is questionable.  Thankful for the Canadians filling this gap.  A lot less espensive than buying it in New Zeland.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t understand why we couldn&#x27;t find Amosan on the shelves of our local pharmacies.  My dentist told me about Amosan 40 years ago.  We used it from time to time when we had a sore or gum ailment and by the next day there was no soreness.  I&#x27;m glad to have found it again.</li>
            <li> We have used Amosan by oral B for many years, however this product works as well as the original. I would definitely recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SG</li>
            <li> I used product a few years ago with great success.  It&#x27;s still the sane great product. Very healing. However, it is now so wicked expensive that I will have to find an alternative. Does it really have to cost over $25 for 20 envelopes? and the directions state it should be used multiple times a day?</li>
            <li> A hard to find item but found it here and was so helpful in healing my mouth after dental surgery. Delivered as promised and will order again.</li>
            <li> I cannot purchase this mouthwash in Billings,MT!  It&#x27;s the most effective mouthwash I have ever used and am so glad that I was able to purchase it online!  As it is packaged it has a long life of effectiveness!</li>
            <li> I had a mouth wound after some dentistry. I had used Amosan years earlier and knew of it&#x27;s healing worth. I searched everywhere to find this stuff and in the meantime used several other products that were only of limited benefit. Finding Amosan on Amazon was a mouth saver. I only had to use two packets of the product to heal up my mouth troubles.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Amosan. Nothing seems to take the place of The original Amosan by Oral B. Cost too much.</li>
            <li> I did NOT receive Amosan, but some packets called &amp;#34;Life&amp;#34;, which is supposed to be sort of like Amosan.  It is BEYOND bitter to the point of not useable.  NOTHING like Amosan, and did not help at all.  It was just too bitter to describe.</li>
            <li> This is a bag advertisement of the powder and does not come as stated.  It comes as a mouthwash instead.  If I send it back I have to pay the postage both ways.</li>
            <li> This product is, according to listed contents, an Amosan clone.  It seems as effective, and I&#x27;m so glad someone still makes it!  It works better than anything else for stopping bleeding gums (after heavy doses of cortisone). One problem:  the envelopes appear to have gotten wet along the way (warehouse? shipping?), so the contents are lumps instead of powder.  It&#x27;s harder to get out of the packet (which wastes some), and harder to dissolve.  Since it&#x27;s fairly expensive, I wish it had arrived in a-one condition, or were available in the stores, as Amosan used to be.  But my gums are grateful it still exists (unlike so many products that work well and then just disappear). Thanks to the manufacturer for responding to a real need!</li>
            <li> This product  is good; however, not as effective as the original Oral B Amosan.  It did not seem to have the fast acting, overnight relief.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and I used it as a kid when I had braces. Can&#x27;t believe this is off the market. A shame I had to pay $30 for this (which is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars)</li>
            <li> REAL AMOSAN  is BACK !!!!! I learned this by checking out Wikipedia. Its being sold on Amazon for less than this product&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Amosan-Oral-Antiseptic-Rinse/dp/B00NVR83MG</li>
            <li> I used Amosan years ago after oral surgery and it heals and soothes any irritation you might have with gums, I wish it was not so hard to find because it is the best! I don&#x27;t know why in the world it isn&#x27;t on every drugstore shelf? So glad I found it again!</li>
            <li> Amosan....yet another product that works great and they quit making it. I feel its not because of lack of demand, its because it worked! It was basically a home remedy, now you have to go to a dentist and spend more money.&lt;br /&gt;PS. I have to give this a star rating to post the review. I have never used this brand so I give it one star. I REFUSE to pay the outrageous price they&#x27;re asking for this!</li>
            <li> This product is great for mouth issues. It cleans and heals sores etc...This order was for my daughter who said she could not find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Not the brand I ordered. You should not advertise a false brand that is nation wide know and switch products.</li>
            <li> I received completely another product which is not manufactured by Oral-B at all. The brand is life, and it is made in Canada. I am not sure if it is a FDA approved product.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the Oral B product. I did&#x27;nt return it because i wanted to give it a try.This generic brand was not as effective as the Oral B product.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I&#x27;ve depended on Amosan for many (35) years. It was completely reliable every time at healing occasional sore spots in my mouth that nothing else could cure. It was first recommended to me by my dentist after my family doctor wasn&#x27;t able to cure a sore throat that turned into inflamed gums. It quickly spread to all my gums and I was in unbearable pain. I actually believe Amosan saved my life because my mouth was getting infected. (it was gross) But, immediately while swishing it around and between my teeth I felt some relief. It only took a few days for the redness to completely go away. I also thought the taste was pleasant. I think it should be a crime to discontinue a product that cures such painful and dangerous conditions. SO WHAT if they&#x27;re not selling as much of it as they would like to. HOW can we get large companies to care about people?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the Mega Corporation that owns Oral-B: Why don&#x27;t you sell the right to make Amosan to a smaller company so they can make it? I&#x27;ll bet you just don&#x27;t care, and won&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I&#x27;m also annoyed at the ridiculous, and seemingly endless amount of styles of tooth brushes and flavors of toothpaste. (and thousands of other products) There&#x27;s no way we can try them all anyway. Maybe companies could stop wasting time and money on \\&quot;frills\\&quot; and make products that we actually need.</li>
            <li> Amosan Oral Wound Cleanser Powder works very well for canker sores or other mouth sores. That said - while I haven&#x27;t purchased it for several years, the price has at least quadrupled. The manufacturer and/or the distributer, whoever priced this product - will be the last that I turn too - should I need to purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> It really helps with small cuts</li>
            <li> HAVE LOOKED FOR THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li> This stuff is as close as you will ever get to the Oral B Amosan product. It works well, but is pricey. I had used Amosan when I had my wisdom teeth removed, naturally my gums were pretty beat up from the process. The Amosan helped sooth and quickly heal the sensitive tissue. I stock this in my first aid kit, a little warm water one packet of this and a quick rinse will help sooth irritation from braces, damage to your gum, and extensive dental work. It helps in a pinch to if something happens when camping.  I do recommend this as a suitable alternative.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 30 years. It clears mouth sores and cankers in record time. For a while they stopped making it and there was much travail inch from many others. Great to see it back. My dentist gave me an alternative when I could not find it and it did not hold a candle to how fast Amosan works. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just as good as Amosan, same results. My husband says that there was no difference. The price needs to be reduced but other than that very satisfied.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ORAL WOUND MOUTH WASH AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET;I WAS SURPRISE TO GET IT FROM CANADA.&lt;br /&gt;I FULLY RECOMMENDED THE PRODUCT SELLER TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> nothing works like old remedies. hard to fix old products on the market to buy that work like they should.</li>
            <li> I can only recommend this product. It helped a lot after teeth operation. Unfortunately not avaiable any more on German Market which is really a pitty.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I miss Amosan. However, it appears that it is not coming back. I have just ordered this Canadian alternative, despite the high price, and hope that it works like Amosan. I also wanted to recommend Gly-Oxide (available on Amazon for about $10) which gets very good reviews. I just bought and used a generic of Gly-Oxide at CVS (as I needed it fast and didn&#x27;t want to pay the $15 that Walgreens was charging for Gly-Oxide, and so far am very pleased with the results. Applied differently (just put a few drops undiluted on the oral wound) but similar pain relief and hopefully healing.</li>
            <li> It actually works, and has saved many trips to dentist office.  Heals and provides relief from tooth &amp; gum pain and irritation.  There&#x27;s nothing else like it/comparable on the market. Went to P&amp;G/Oral B web site and sent e-mail, but popular demand is the only thing that will bring this great product back. My family has used this product since I was a child, and it has been recommended by dentists.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! The most effective&lt;br /&gt;treatment &amp; fast healing of cancer sores. Looks like this is being manufactured &amp; sold under a different name. Same&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> When I found this product available under a different supplier, I had to get it.  It works better and quicker than any other mouth sore product I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and was saddened when OralB discontinued it.  Thanks for the current manufacturer who provides it.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> This should help since Amosan is no longer available&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient in Amosan is (or rather was) sodium perborate. When mixed with water, sodium perborate undergoes hydrolysis to yield borate and hydrogen peroxide. Yup, the same stuff you&#x27;ve used for years to clean cuts and scrapes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out you can get a pretty effective approximation of Amosan by mixing 2tsp/10ml of common first-aid type hydrogen peroxide (10 volume/3% strength) with 2tsp/10ml of warm water. Then rinse exactly as you did with Amosan. DON&#x27;T SWALLOW THE MIXTURE! (Read the warnings on the hydrogen peroxide bottle.) Be sure to use a fresh bottle of peroxide, and ideally mix it with a purified or distilled water stored in a sterile bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more convenience (plus a minty taste) Colgate markets a 1.5% hydrogen peroxide oral rinse under the name Peroxyl. Apparently this product has been in existence for decades, although no one I&#x27;ve asked about it ever heard of it until very recently when it began popping up on store shelves everywhere, supposedly in response to Amosan being discontinued.</li>
            <li> It is perfect , the mouth wash, I was looking for that since quite while  very happy .</li>
            <li> cant believe it. its really worked.bring it back.the redicilious price on amazone is unheard of.been using it for more than 20 years.how could youall. please everyone write in!</li>
            <li> Go To Bik &amp; Bik Netherlands online and look for Bikosan bocasan  Productcode : bo082106.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikosan is the replacement of Bocasan/Amosan. Bikosan contains all substances which bocasan and Oral B AMOSAN contained. It has a cleansing and antiseptic in the mouth or throat.&lt;br /&gt;Proctor and Gamble (Oral B) withdrew Bocasan / Amosan from the market.  Bikosan works the same as Bocasan. You just need to mix the two powders together yourself and mix in warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can order it from Bik &amp; Bik Netherlands which is a Dutch pharmacy.  The Product code is bo082106 and it is called Bikosan Bocasan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works absolutely perfectly and tastes exactly the same as Amosan.</li>
