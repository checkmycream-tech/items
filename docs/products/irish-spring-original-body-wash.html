            <li>(maybe we should be showering more?</li>
            <li>Bought this for myself love it</li>
            <li>This really is a lovely body wash.  </li>
            <li>As a body wash, it makes me feels very clean -</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin, but never reacts to this, and he smalls great</li>
            <li>The color of the body wash has a beautiful color of green that reminds you of the fresh, beautiful landscapes of Ireland.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and it makes my oily hair very full and clean.  </li>
            <li>Too chemical, too strong.</li>
            <li>The smell might be too strong for some people</li>
            <li>It has a fantastic lather and smells so clean!</li>
            <li>The scent is very fresh and not too strong at all.</li>
            <li>This product covers the rag well and washed smoothly over the skin.</li>
            <li>They are sending me the replacement item free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>The smell alone was enough to win me over.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it spreads well when covering your body and rinses right off.</li>
            <li>Irish Spring Body Wash makes you feel clean, fresh and leaves you smelling good all day!</li>
            <li>but I prefer the original formula.</li>
            <li>Well, the original is what I like and I will continue to order this one from now on.</li>
            <li>It feels really clean on the skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest though he is not crazy about it and says it really burns his eyes if not</li>
            <li>If you want to feel really clean and smell good for a while, I say try Irish Springs!</li>
            <li>C&#x27;mon, everyone knows how good Irish spring is.</li>
            <li>overall good smell.</li>
            <li>A perfume or cologne would be cool, too, but I&#x27;d settle for a room spray.</li>
            <li>The body wash has a great amount of lather compared to some other body washes I have used before.</li>
            <li>is the best price even beats my local Target&#x27;s regular price.</li>
            <li>but I really like this one since the strong smell really wakes me up and feels very fresh for a while after the shower.</li>
            <li>The scent is probably fine for most people, but it&#x27;s definitely not what we are used to...</li>
            <li>I really found this product to fit my needs and expectations.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good that the scent truly does last for most of the day (depending on how much physical activity your doing).</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with the Irish Spring scent then you know how refreshing it smells.  </li>
            <li>So you will go through this pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the fresh smell that stays with you pretty much the whole day</li>
            <li>so I thought they came out with a new shampoo - cool!  </li>
            <li>The price was right and it came on time I would recommend this seller to anyone.</li>
            <li>The smell is not to strong or to light, but enough to get positive compliments from those who get close to you!</li>
            <li>what is that?&amp;#34;  This might be a bit of an odd comparison, but you know how good fresh cut grass smells?  </li>
            <li>Well at least for my husband who doesn&#x27;t always want to smell fruity like me lol..</li>
            <li>I love Irish Spring</li>
            <li>wish they would make a room spray that smells exactly like this.</li>
            <li>If your a consistent user of body wash</li>
            <li>The Irish Spring Body Wash, Original, 15 Ounce, is the BEST Irish Spring out there in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that I have used for years in several different countries.</li>
            <li>Irish Spring has always been one of my favorite scents, so much so that I wished they made a perfume or even a room</li>
            <li>The fresh scent wakes you up and leaves you smelling clean for several hours.</li>
            <li>I only use the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; scent because i find the others have much more of a masculine scent to them.&lt;br /&gt;Irish spring is my teen&#x27;s favorite because it makes him smell &amp;</li>
            <li>and so it goes a long way as you don&#x27;t need to use as much as some of the more watery body washes.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>would recommend somebody double-check the cap is securely fastened before sending it to future customers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use too much product</li>
            <li>If you like the Irish Spring scent, you had better really like it, because this body wash offers it in copious amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s body chemistry, but this soap really doesn&#x27;t smell like the original Irish Spring bar soap that he&#x27;s been using for 20+ years.</li>
            <li>The Irish Spring Body Wash, Original, 15 Ounce Bottle delivers exactly what it promises, a long lasting, clean, and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Using a small amount about the size of a quarter, it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I prefer a regular bar of soap over any other kind of wash liquid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the old familiar Irish  Spring scent.</li>
            <li>I was able to wash my whole body with just a small amount of the wash in my hand.    </li>
            <li>It makes a nice lather, but it&#x27;s really thick for body wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great in the shower, I feel clean, it&#x27;s not as drying as the bar style (don&#x27;t know why), doesn&#x27;t leave a film and the scent stays crazy long throughout the day!</li>
            <li>The cap had come off, and most of the contents spilled out in the small bag.</li>
            <li>The first thing you notice is that unmistakable Irish Spring scent.(Some things never go out of style).  </li>
            <li>DH smells fresh even after a long day at work and me, I just smell my forearm frequently throughout the day to refresh myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, a five star product with an affordable price that delivers a high quality body wash leaving you feeling fresh throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li>There is a certain simple masculinity to the product.</li>
            <li>soap&amp;#34; which teen girls seem to really like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it as a shampoo and will be one of the 3 I use regularly.  </li>
            <li>I also like old spice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it twice already and with only my brother and I using it to shower, it lasts about 2 months for the whole bottle</li>
            <li>The scent lasts on your skin all day and don&#x27;t be surprised if you hug someone</li>
            <li>The body wash lasts long in terms of scent, but as well as the dispenser, a very controlled amount comes out with a moderate squeeze.</li>
            <li>odor is much stronger than I had expected.</li>
            <li>the other scents I don&#x27;t care about them too much.</li>
            <li>It smells as if it was designed to produce a more natural appearance of the fake Christmas tree.</li>

            <li> Buy it and it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>

            <li> The Irish Spring Body Wash, Original, 15 Ounce Bottle delivers exactly what it promises, a long lasting, clean, and fresh scent. The smell is not to strong or to light, but enough to get positive compliments from those who get close to you! The body wash has a great amount of lather compared to some other body washes I have used before. The body wash lasts long in terms of scent, but as well as the dispenser, a very controlled amount comes out with a moderate squeeze. The color of the body wash has a beautiful color of green that reminds you of the fresh, beautiful landscapes of Ireland. Overall, a five star product with an affordable price that delivers a high quality body wash leaving you feeling fresh throughout the entire day. Would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best body wash. I have tried them all. This product covers the rag well and washed smoothly over the skin.</li>
            <li> I only use the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; scent because i find the others have much more of a masculine scent to them.&lt;br /&gt;Irish spring is my teen&#x27;s favorite because it makes him smell &amp;#34;like soap&amp;#34; which teen girls seem to really like.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best price even beats my local Target&#x27;s regular price.</li>
            <li> Great scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get dry, so switch to the moisture blast to see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this for years to use in my shower.  Has a very pleasant aroma, lathers generously and does seem to keep you fresh longer.  One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Very strong fragrance!</li>
            <li> The original and the best from the rest, this was my first body wash product and I fell in love with the fresh smell that stays with you pretty much the whole day, I shower every morning around 5am and by the time my shift starts at 7am, I still feel like I just stepped out of shower, it makes me feel really good, there are guys I work with who only shower maybe once a week, lol they smell bad might have to hand out a few of these for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Feel clean and smell good.  Price is awesome for the product. My man and I both use this.  I was using Dove but for the price, this is a better deal.</li>
            <li> If you like the Irish Spring scent, you had better really like it, because this body wash offers it in copious amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is much stronger than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Great product! Price was reasonable. I would recommend to those that like to use liquid soap in the shower or tub.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a little bit of  Irish Spring in your life. Well at least for my husband who doesn&#x27;t always want to smell fruity like me lol..</li>
            <li> It smells as if it was designed to produce a more natural appearance of the fake Christmas tree. Too chemical, too strong. Washes well. Reminds me of names such as Febreeze, Glade, and other Walmart-type products.</li>
            <li> Ordered thinking that this product is a twin pack. There are only 2 size options \\&quot;Twin Pack\\&quot; and \\&quot;6-Pack\\&quot;. It is also stated that this product is a twin pack.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. Amazon should refund or send me another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 11/5/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Amazon Customer Service via chat option. They are sending me the replacement item free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love Irish Spring and this was the best price I have found for this body wash even at the HugeMarts. I bought two of them. Smells great, I think. When I was in the nursing home everybody knew when I took my shower!!!</li>
            <li> The Irish Spring Body Wash, Original, 15 Ounce, is the BEST Irish Spring out there in my humble opinion. I&#x27;ve tried the Irish Spring with Conditioner but I prefer the original formula. Using a small amount about the size of a quarter, it lathers up nicely. I use it for body wash and shampoo. The fresh scent wakes you up and leaves you smelling clean for several hours. My only complaint is that the 15 ounce bottles end up empty way too soon. You&#x27;ll need to keep a spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rate this review if you found it helpful.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness the Irish Spring Body Wash came wrapped in a plastic bag.  The cap had come off, and most of the contents spilled out in the small bag. Some liquid did get past the small seal and dripped onto other items in my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend somebody double-check the cap is securely fastened before sending it to future customers.</li>
            <li> I have been using Irish Spring forever. This is a wonderful product.  The price was right and it came on time I would recommend this seller to anyone. I just love it.</li>
            <li> I hate writing two stars for this! I love the smell but the lather is non existent-- this thing just slips off your body</li>
            <li> Irish Spring Body Wash makes you feel clean, fresh and leaves you smelling good all day! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This beats the smell of anything at bath and body works.  You talk about aroma therapy!  This will cheer up anyone.</li>
            <li> C&#x27;mon, everyone knows how good Irish spring is. It&#x27;s just a good deal to buy it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I love Irish Spring but I received it all busted open. It ruined the other stuff in the package. And I was never helped with the issue when I complained.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend likes the smell. I think it&#x27;s an odd consistency though. overall good smell. I don&#x27;t know how long lasting the smell is though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body wash. It has a fantastic lather and smells so clean! A great alternative to bars of soap.</li>
            <li> Love it when my hubby uses this he smells so good.(not that he don&#x27;t normally)&lt;br /&gt;To be honest though he is not crazy about it and says it really burns his eyes if not careful.&lt;br /&gt; so not really sure if my review would actually help here.</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; but not &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; experience. I am an Irish Spring fan. I am troubled by the fact that 5 stars is defined as a &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; experience by Amazon. This is a good product that I have used for years in several different countries. There is a certain simple masculinity to the product. It is also well packaged to be not bulky, which can be conveniently thrown in a duffel bag.</li>
            <li> smells so good great stocking stuffer or just because gift.</li>
            <li> Irish Spring has always been one of my favorite scents, so much so that I wished they made a perfume or even a room spray.&lt;br /&gt;This is great in the shower, I feel clean, it&#x27;s not as drying as the bar style (don&#x27;t know why), doesn&#x27;t leave a film and the scent stays crazy long throughout the day! DH smells fresh even after a long day at work and me, I just smell my forearm frequently throughout the day to refresh myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would make a room spray that smells exactly like this. A perfume or cologne would be cool, too, but I&#x27;d settle for a room spray.</li>
            <li> This body wash is good smelling. I don&#x27;t have to use too much product so it lasts for quite some time.</li>
            <li> It is what it says.  It came on the 8th day, which was the last day of the four-day ETA.  But it got here &amp;#34;on time.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I picked this up as an impulse buy at my local drugstore - it was at the end of the shampoo isle.  I&#x27;ve always like the scent of their soap so I thought they came out with a new shampoo - cool!  After I lathered and rinsed, I looked at the bottle and it&#x27;s body wash!  So, I lathered it up all over.  Guess what?  I really like it as a shampoo and will be one of the 3 I use regularly.  Love the scent and it makes my oily hair very full and clean.  Because my hair needs shampooing daily, I cannot use any conditioner or conditioning shampoo since it leaves a film that flattens out my hair.  As a body wash, it makes me feels very clean - no film and I feel like I just came back from an Irish meadow.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> My most favorite wash soap smell. Last all day long. I also like old spice but this is my #1 choice.</li>
            <li> Arrived frozen and exploded in the packaging. I guess some things are not meant to be shipped. Hope to try again in summer.</li>
            <li> Got a great deal with subscribe and save, and therefore purchased through Amazon.  This product does what it is intended to do...it is a body wash that smells good and gets you clean.</li>
            <li> It has that trademark Irish Spring scent, but for a mass market shower gel, it&#x27;s a little pricey, and here&#x27;s why...the viscosity of the shower gel is pretty thick compared to other competing brands, like Old Spice. So you will go through this pretty quickly. If you&#x27;re not looking to spend a ton of money on soap and have to deal with buying soap all the time, don&#x27;t choose this one. Unless you want to get scientific and water this down a little.</li>
            <li> Bought this for convenience.</li>
            <li> I loved it , smells great , all family loves it and shower with it , also does not effect my ellergy</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin, but never reacts to this, and he smalls great all the time, I love this.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I&#x27;m not a body wash kind of person. I prefer a regular bar of soap over any other kind of wash liquid. But after trying Irish Springs it is making me reconsider. This body wash smells great! The scent is very fresh and not too strong at all. I try to only take one shower a day to conserve water so it&#x27;s good that the scent truly does last for most of the day (depending on how much physical activity your doing). I had a long day at school yesterday after showering with Irish springs in the morning and the scent was still faintly present. Plus, I&#x27;ve only had the body wash for two days but I can already tell it&#x27;ll last me a while. I was able to wash my whole body with just a small amount of the wash in my hand.    If your a consistent user of body wash then I recommend Irish Springs. The smell alone was enough to win me over. On top of that, it spreads well when covering your body and rinses right off. The wash is not too thick or goopy like some body washes I&#x27;ve tried before. If you want to feel really clean and smell good for a while, I say try Irish Springs!</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT, IN TIME AND IN GOOD CONDITION</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling body wash. It&#x27;s the old familiar Irish  Spring scent. It&#x27;s very thick and so it goes a long way as you don&#x27;t need to use as much as some of the more watery body washes. Can be used as an all over wash and even as shampoo. Good value!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this body wash,will use nothing else</li>
            <li> I had ordered this before but they have different flavors or smells ??? I thought they were all the same. Well, the original is what I like and I will continue to order this one from now on. the other scents I don&#x27;t care about them too much.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s body chemistry, but this soap really doesn&#x27;t smell like the original Irish Spring bar soap that he&#x27;s been using for 20+ years. The scent is probably fine for most people, but it&#x27;s definitely not what we are used to... he ended up using it as shampoo instead of body wash.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised</li>
            <li> This body wash is great. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice already and with only my brother and I using it to shower, it lasts about 2 months for the whole bottle (maybe we should be showering more? Who cares though, it&#x27;s not like you have to smell us. Geez!). Buy it and it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> The smell might be too strong for some people but I really like this one since the strong smell really wakes me up and feels very fresh for a while after the shower. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A great price for the amount you receive. its just like one you&#x27;d purchase in the store - no funny business. Good size.</li>
            <li> It makes a nice lather, but it&#x27;s really thick for body wash. A lot of unnatural ingredient</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself love it and it works great does everything it promises to do</li>
            <li> This really is a lovely body wash.  The first thing you notice is that unmistakable Irish Spring scent.(Some things never go out of style).  It feels really clean on the skin and if you like your body wash to lather up, then you want be disappointed with this wash.  It also rinses off cleanly, not leaving an oily feeling that some body washes can leave on your skin, yet still leaving your skin feeling soft.  I have sensitive skin and it has not made my skin dry in the least. If you are familiar with the Irish Spring scent then you know how refreshing it smells.  The scent lasts on your skin all day and don&#x27;t be surprised if you hug someone and they say, &amp;#34;You smell good..what is that?&amp;#34;  This might be a bit of an odd comparison, but you know how good fresh cut grass smells?  It&#x27;s like the same effect with Irish Spring with a little spice thrown in.</li>
            <li> I really found this product to fit my needs and expectations. It smells great and gives me that clean feeling I was searching for.</li>
