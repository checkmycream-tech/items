            <li> Can&#x27;t see this lasting too long, likely why the cheaper price tag.</li>

            <li> It has a subtle design and is very roomy.  </li>
            <li> Cool but the tassles on sides are useless, serve no purpose.</li>
            <li> I think then I expected.. .</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t load it too heavily as the handles are sewn on without reinforcement .</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I can also see the poor quality where the handles meet the bag.  </li>
            <li> Really thin and flemsy.</li>

            <li> So disappointed with such a cute purse! As I tested the zipper on its first go (before I even put anything in it) the zipper broke.  I can also see the poor quality where the handles meet the bag.  Can&#x27;t see this lasting too long, likely why the cheaper price tag.</li>
            <li> They forgot to put the zipper pull inside.  The black dye got on everything inside my purse and out of it for the first 3 weeks I owned this bag and the side ties come undone all the time.  But the size is great and I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> It took a while to receive it because my mail carrier returned it to sender (not sellers fault)! They were great with communication and sent it right back to me.  I really like the bag.  It has a subtle design and is very roomy.  Quality is great.</li>
            <li> I love this purse but the zipper broke less than a month after I got it and the straps are already getting warn and look like they are doing to rip. I will sew a new zipper in and figure out how to reinforce the shoulder straps. It&#x27;s such a cute bag that I&#x27;ll take the extra effort to fix it.</li>
            <li> Very cute but after 3 days the straps started ripping from the bag....</li>
            <li> This bag is as described . I love how it&#x27;s all black and yet has the skulls. Just don&#x27;t load it too heavily as the handles are sewn on without reinforcement . I haven&#x27;t had one break yet but it looks like it could be soon . Still I love it! The skulls are smiling!</li>
            <li> The outside is amazing. However, the inside is a bit cheap. You get what you paid for. I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> Really thin and flemsy. But is cute</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used it yet.  Just got it today, but just for looks I love it!</li>
            <li> Wife loves the skull pattern, room and quality of this bag.</li>
            <li> I liked it but I thought it would be stronger material!!</li>
            <li> THE BAG WAS GREAT BUT THE ONLY THING I DID NOT LIKE WERE THE STRAPS ON THE SIDE SO i CUT THEM OFF.Awesome OTHER WISE</li>
            <li> Outside is nice, inside is pretty cheap but it was only a 20 dollar bag. Even then, its still nice to use. I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> The purse I received has the skull pattern on it but it does not have the side ties and it has additional flaps on the side with studs on them. It is not the purse in the picture that I ordered.</li>
            <li> loved the bag but it started to fall apart pretty quickly... wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> broke the first time I ever used it. both straps came right off as soon as I got to school and I had to safety pin them together. VERY EMBARRASSING. gave it one star because the star rating is required.</li>
            <li> Huge bag that holds everything. Very sturdy!</li>
            <li> great deal. Arrived much sooner than I expected :)</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expect so that&#x27;s a plus . The outer material was nice but inner was cheaply made . Really light &amp; has lots of room &amp; I love it ! I feel like the zippers going to break off tho ;-; but great for the price</li>
            <li> Very nice bag... nicer I think then I expected.. . Very soft... love the subtle skull pattern... I needed a purse I could carry my offuce planner in without getting a briefcase</li>
            <li> Mine broke right when I got it</li>
            <li> Very cute bag, inside zippers are really tiny. Had the bag a week and one if the inner pockets is ripping off. Love the skulls on it wish it was better quality</li>
            <li> Cool but the tassles on sides are useless, serve no purpose. But it is a cool bag for the price.</li>
            <li> Like the purse for its price.</li>
            <li> Purse is very well worth the money love it its awesome</li>
            <li> Very Nice!. It arrived on time, packaged beautifully. It looks as good as it is advertised. It was an excellent choice. I am extremely happy with the decision to purchase this bag. It is roomy and well made. Excellent.</li>
