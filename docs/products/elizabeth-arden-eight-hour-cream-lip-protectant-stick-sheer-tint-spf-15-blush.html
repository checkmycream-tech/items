    <ol>
            <li>Still as great as ever!  </li>
            <li>the best part is that it&#x27;s a lip protectant.</li>
            <li>This lip tint is really awesome.  </li>
            <li>looks and feels beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with my order.</li>
            <li>It is super moist with just a hint of color, perfect for those run around days.  </li>
            <li>but much much better!</li>
            <li>Glides on nicely and keeps my lips moist and protected.</li>
            <li>I love a good, bright pink that&#x27;s not overpowering and this was perfect!  </li>
            <li>It also leaves a tint on the lips so that you don&#x27;t have to keep touching up.</li>
            <li>Been using it many years.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>A color that compliments many skin tones.</li>
            <li>I love this lip gloss/protectant.  </li>
            <li>I like it more than just lipstick and use it every day</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li>I find using the lip balm with a light-colored lipliner is the most attractive and natural color I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>The texture can&#x27;t be beat, and the sheer color and light, lemongrass-like taste is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking, moistens, and doesn&#x27;t look caked like most lipsticks.</li>
            <li>The smell of it is refreshing, and the color looks natural.....</li>
            <li>color looks way too pink, but when you apply to your lips - it is a beautiful natural color.</li>
            <li>Thank you very very very much</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it&#x27;s not a lipstick, it obviously has a very light hue, which I think is lovely!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>the lipstick is good, but it is very soft and broke off after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I really like the shade of this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very prompt and helpful.</li>
            <li>Not the seller&#x27;s fault (fast delivery)....</li>
            <li>Nice color, doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>This is more of a lip gloss and provides very little actual color which is fine with me</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s sheer, but not too sheer.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty shade, keeps lips moist and stays on a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is also very moisterizing and instantly enriches the skin on your lips.  </li>
            <li>It combines lip balm and a natural looking lipstick.</li>
            <li>Well, the product is nice but the color I chose was not attractive on me.</li>

            <li> Make lip look dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and not an eight hour protectant.</li>
            <li> Love this as a base for my lipstick.</li>
            <li> I have given up on all other lipstick after discovering this!</li>
            <li> I usually get from the counter, but it was a few dollars cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> it is very hard to apply and the color is lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> This lip color is not a lipstick, which usually looks painted on.  </li>
            <li> Not a good one.</li>
            <li> It brings out a soft blush to your lips which can be used alone, or as a base to another lip color.  </li>
            <li> but if you buy it expecting it to be RED, you will be disappointed.</li>
