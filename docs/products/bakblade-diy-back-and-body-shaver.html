            <li>This product is so good that I was compelled to write a review.  </li>
            <li>Loved the ease of use of the product but not the rash.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the replacement set along with it, just in case it turned out to be good.</li>
            <li>You need a mirror and this shaver and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no worries at all -- I never felt like I was going to cut myself or that it wasn&#x27;t doing a good job.</li>
            <li>DAMN GOOD</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s fairly easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and in good packaging.  </li>
            <li>A good companion product is a Loofa.  </li>

            <li>It does what it says at a good price.</li>
            <li>Good price .</li>
            <li>It peels away the hair like nothing and it feels good while you do it too.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t seem to get a good angle</li>
            <li>Good backscratcher too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe how good this product is.</li>

            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how good this thing works.  </li>

            <li>very effective, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The short story is that this thing is awesome and is the best product of it</li>
            <li>Awesome item, best back</li>
            <li>The best part is that if you have spots that grow faster than others, you can do quick touch-ups whenever needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But it wasn&#x27;t good, it was AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Works great, better than a powered shaver.</li>
            <li>I ended up trying anyway and am pleased to report that it worked great.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased I found this product.  </li>
            <li>Great product and an even better owner.</li>

            <li>The price point makes it even more attractive.</li>
            <li>Great product, does what it says which many of the products in this field do not.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with purchase</li>
            <li>And after ONE USE, according to my husband, it was the right decision and &amp;#34;The best invention since sliced bread&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>So anyways, I tried this out and after some inventive contortions, I was able to take care of underarm hair and NOT have razor burn!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed by the personal, incredibly prompt and helpful response by Matt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product!  </li>
            <li>You can use this on yourself as many times as you want and it will not damage/bleed/cut your skin!  </li>
            <li>and I was able to get every area!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve bought the Bakblade, I&#x27;ve used it, and I love it!</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I truly love this product and hope that they continue to manufacture it!</li>
            <li>I must have had a faulty unit the first time because the replacements did an excellent job.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s sure close!</li>
            <li>I’m sure they’ll be converted into a customer for life, too!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the in emotion of the decade for sure!</li>
            <li>Top notch!</li>

            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>

            <li>This product is simply amazing.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this for over a year, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I love a good backscratch.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice, close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a great product!</li>
            <li>I just want to say that I got way more than my money was worth and it&#x27;s one of the best purchases ever.  </li>
            <li>This will be another good review as I have been extremely pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>It really works great!</li>
            <li>While the laser treatment was wonderful, I still had hair that needed to disappear and a much lighter</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m coming close to another grooming, but now can take care of this in the privacy of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep a damp cloth or paper towel handy to wipe the blade off.</li>
            <li>I just purchased the baKBlade, and I&#x27;m thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>i am blown away by how simpleyet effective this is.</li>
            <li>, I took this handy tool out of the package and went to work on my &amp;#34;back-forrest&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>But buying something that works so efficiently and effectively makes you forget about the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You know there are some people complaining that the company is making it&#x27;s own reviews (1-2 star ratings</li>
            <li>really appreciate the customer service and the product is great!</li>
            <li>Just your own flexibility.</li>
            <li>This was cartoonishly effective and I am in shock.</li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t even care.</li>
            <li>Nice  jobl</li>
            <li>Inventor should get the noble prize for bringing this thing to market.</li>
            <li>I saw it falling to the floor and was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I even tried taping a disposable razor to a stick once to make my own Bakblade</li>
            <li>Gets the job done effectively with no batteries and a fraction of the pain and irritation.</li>
            <li>I also own a man groomer</li>
            <li>It beats Mangroomer (which I also own and have used for YEARS) by a mile.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the recharging types and they are just as effective, but the downfall is that when the battery stops charging you&#x27;ll have to toss it.</li>
            <li>I just have to tell you honestly that this bakBlade works as described.</li>
            <li>, I own the mangroomer</li>
            <li>and I wondered how effective could it be.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, inexpensive, effective, no hassle, done!</li>
            <li>I am excited to try the product, but it looks like a great product for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use on your own</li>
            <li>Very impressed and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and will be ordering more soon…</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have to give full 10 shiny stars to this product!</li>
            <li>I just got the new blade yesterday, it is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I thank you for inventing this wonderful blade and please let me know how I reorder new blades</li>
            <li>Just used my new Bakblade and I was absolutely impressed!  </li>
            <li>My sincere thanks and appreciation for your wonderful product.  </li>

            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Bakblade is by far the best product on the market.</li>
            <li>The thing i like most is it is honestly like shaving with a razor and</li>

            <li>This is by far the best product I have encountered.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best products I have ever bought.</li>

            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the baKblade!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>I fired my wife much to her happiness!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that I can be more confident now.</li>
            <li>It is the very best product I have ever tried for shaving my own back</li>
            <li>Excellent product, would be nice if extra blades came with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making a great and very much needed product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really great product, and really well done!</li>
            <li>I can shave just fine with no help!</li>
            <li>very light weight too-</li>
            <li>and I doubt that many women enjoy doing it, so when I stumbled across this product and read all of the great reviews I was truly excited and ordered immediately.  </li>
            <li>So easy, so amazing.  </li>
            <li>Easy and effective.  </li>
            <li>So easy and effective.</li>
            <li>It did not hurt at all, was totally easy, and I was able to do it in the privacy of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is great for the quick going to the beach or just to be comfortable taking my shirt off.</li>
            <li>Arrived here in Canada nice and quick, no brokerage charges!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay, but i&#x27;d go over and over a patch of hair and still it wouldnt cut it.</li>
            <li>love that i can do it without shaving cream</li>
            <li>I love my Prime membership so sometimes when I don&#x27;t see a product qualifies</li>
            <li>and I am forever glad i did.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like you have used an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like you have used an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>best back shaver I have used</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>No area u cannot reach and able to use it without anyone else assisting.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Should have better instructions.  </li>
            <li>Does a better job than my girlfriend does with the peanut.</li>
            <li>so if you have more bumps spots then this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Pluss custom charges were more than cost of blade</li>
            <li>it more than met my expectations</li>
            <li>Fantastic! ...</li>
            <li>Perfect is the only thing to say about this.</li>
            <li>the reviews seemed convincing, and something about it told me i needed to give it a shot...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having gotten the replacement I was finally able to use it and it worked just as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love the Product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Top Notch Seller</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing blade refills so I can enjoy using this for years to come!</li>
            <li>So glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is possibly the best purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li>Love the bak-blade.</li>
            <li>I am not the most limber guy</li>
            <li>so when I need more blades I will be able to buy them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just wish they would market this product better and be at the top of Google searches so that others would know this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad someone thought of this.  </li>
            <li>without having to see what you&#x27;re doing), and it works phenomenally.  </li>
            <li>Get this thing into stores--FAST!), and it works phenomenally.  </li>
            <li>This is the best way to get rid of the hairy ape back!!  </li>
            <li>It seemed like an interesting product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am highly satisfied with the product, and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>You WON&#x27;T regret it. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m still not overly pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love using the bakblade.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, the manufacturing quality is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used razors, Norelco Body Groomer,and my wife&#x27;s favorite waxing,she still says I screamed like a girl .</li>
            <li>Would def buy again, and glad I went ahead and got the refill blades.</li>
            <li>this is that something better.</li>
            <li>Really, really pleased with this product and plan to recommend it to my hairy brethren.</li>
            <li>Except for moles and the like, it feels safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wish the handle were about 2 inches longer, but otherwise I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I just received it today and it worked better than anything I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It will be perfect for when I travel to Maui without my personal shaver (wifey)!</li>
            <li>would give it more stars if I could</li>
            <li>but it was OK and</li>
            <li>It provides the best solution for back hair that I have ever found.</li>
            <li>Yes, many others will tell you to let the blade do the work, and it does do the work.</li>
            <li>But with a more rigid handle the bb would be easier to control and</li>
            <li>more accurate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many methods from face razor to electric, ti waxing and even laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>so you know how many uses this can use.</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about this product!!</li>
            <li>Would buy again for sure</li>
            <li>would love to see a &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; option on the blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many mysteries in life.  </li>
            <li>It is the real deal and it works great.</li>
            <li>All I can say is THANK YOU. :)</li>
            <li>I am free of her nagging!  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>As someone who struggles with unwanted hair on my back, this is great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairy back guy and this thing works great!!</li>
            <li>Bakblade works better than I thought.</li>
            <li>But after trying it, I can truly say it is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and I was able to mow the lawn in a matter of seconds.</li>

            <li>I have to say this big mouth bakblade is awesome!</li>
            <li>took me more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>The blade quality could be better in the sense of lining up the 3 blades better</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This is hands-down the best back shaver out there - and I have bought and used them all!  </li>
            <li>Please, if you like spending an hour or more rinsing and doing a inch at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more confident and feel much better about the way I look.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best thing I have ever bought, I want to advertise for this company</li>
            <li>done perfectly with no back hair at all!!</li>
            <li>Much better then the hair trimmer I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic device!</li>
            <li>An outstanding review, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best back hair remover ever!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li>The product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than the man groomer.</li>
            <li>The blade on this thing is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>It works for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;No more than 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Infact I have been able to use it immediately after shoulder rotator cuff surgery with my arm in a sling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, the blade in the package was damaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make matters better, their customer service is phenomenal.</li>

            <li>how much more confident I feel.  </li>

            <li>2-3 days before you leave. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>i would recomend this product over many ive tried on a product level</li>
            <li>Best back shaver to date.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I feel so much better about myself.  </li>
            <li>Excellent razor back or chest shaving.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Yes I will have to Shave more often than Waxing.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love ordering from bakblade.  </li>
            <li>I stuck to that promise for many years and just dealt with being</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful my experience with baKblade has been.&lt;br /&gt;Believe</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful my experience with baKblade has been.&lt;br /&gt;Believe</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right when I was thinking this would be even better if it was also adapted somehow to use in the shower and walla</li>
            <li>You can take the razor off the handle and just slide it anywhere you want, and like magic the hair is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the seller is top notch.</li>
            <li>I think I could have gotten a couple more, but I was influenced by the guidelines on the packaging.</li>
            <li>Couldnt be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>If you got hair back there, this is the perfect product to remove it without any ones help...</li>
            <li>Excellent if you want to shave your back fur.  </li>
            <li>What a simple, brilliant device!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go to the pool today.  </li>
            <li>Still love the product.</li>
            <li>Great item and works very well.</li>
            <li>Try it you will love it&lt;</li>
            <li>Possibly one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>Comically comes with directions, but if you can&#x27;t figure this out</li>
            <li>But I guess that&#x27;s the magic of it</li>
            <li>it was amazing smooth,</li>
            <li>I love  my bakblade...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Bakblade.  </li>
            <li>This has much more reach</li>
            <li>so you can imagine how much more space you can cover compared to that o</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not yet nicked myself, but the device seems safe in that regard.</li>
            <li>Better system than the Man Groomer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the electric shaver, it takes about 30 minutes and does an OK job with visible but uniform stubble.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is now THE BEST back shaver on the market.</li>
            <li>OK, OK I admit.</li>
            <li>Most might consider it pricey, but I&#x27;ll pay within reason for the time and effort someone has put into a product that does what it claims.</li>
            <li>The customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li>One of my better Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li>a satisfied customer!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Much better than the electric shavers that I used to use.</li>
            <li>this is the best back razor they have ever invented I totally love it.</li>
            <li>This worked better and way faster then the Man Groomer - the unit I was using before this one.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I&#x27;ll get better at it as I use it more but AMAZING!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the bakblade to do such an awesome job.</li>
            <li>Keep up the fantastic work!</li>
            <li>I have to say I am very impressed with just how well this back shaver works.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>But if someone enters the market at a much better price point, I will be taking my business there, instead.</li>
            <li>So I have had this shaver for about 3 months and use it and am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>The baKblade is not only painless, it feel absolutely wonderful, like the best back scratch ever.</li>
            <li>I did most of the work without even looking in a mirror, I just had to take a glance toward the end to see what areas needed touch ups.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t email many companies</li>
            <li>Better spending your money on a electric shaver with a body hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Best thing I&#x27;ve found to get rid of that pesky back hair..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and a great quality product.</li>
            <li>Need to order more blades.</li>
            <li>I have to say this was way better than using an electric razor.</li>
            <li>but it absolutely works even better than it has been described here!!</li>
            <li>so I was initially very excited about this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so comfortable and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;No shaving cream is required.</li>
            <li>Now about the product itself: It is light weight and very easy to use</li>
            <li>Great product -- Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>works great, easy to use, fast because of the blade size</li>
            <li>Without a doubt, this is the best, quickest, and easy back shaving product on the market.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is easy, fast, and, does a great job.  </li>
            <li>It feels like someone is scratching your back and is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>One of the best purchases i&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as described, saves time, and is fairly priced.</li>
            <li>I loved it after the first use, and I&#x27;m a hairy, hairy man.  </li>
            <li>impressed, they&#x27;ve made a life - long customer.</li>
            <li>This has to be one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made in a long time.  </li>
            <li>The mangroomer worked pretty well, but it took forever and caused a good deal of irritation.</li>
            <li>I received a follow up email from the company asking for feedback, and I stated that although I loved the results, I would wait until I had purchased another blade before writing a review, as the first blade had cracked.</li>
            <li>and it still never shaved as good as that first swipe.</li>
            <li>Really quick and effective.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how easy it would be using the Bakblade with both things combined.</li>
            <li>trimmers- pull out more hair than cuts, easily breaks&lt;br /&gt;Extensions</li>
            <li>I have found it best dry without any creams or water.  </li>
            <li>Got it an it amazing and quick..</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE TAKES MINS TO DO LOVE</li>
            <li>show people using the razor on dry skin, I think to use it in the shower is the best way.</li>
            <li>But if you just maintain an angle such that you feel a light scratching it cuts perfectly.</li>
            <li>Excellent product with a great company behind it.</li>
            <li>works great and it feel like a nice scratch back</li>
            <li>you guys are awesome, I continue to sing the praises  of this product to all who want a smooth back.</li>

            <li>nearly 6-months now and am totally happy.  </li>
            <li>For me, their products always arrive early and in great condition.  </li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever been able to do all my own grooming.  </li>
            <li>but I have to say this is the best 50 bucks I&#x27;ve spent on grooming.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the product and new blade and can&#x27;t wait to use it for many more years to come!  </li>
            <li>Best so far that I have come across for removing large areas of hair.  </li>
            <li>no need for shaving cream, takes off most of the hair on the first pass and is very easily to use.  </li>

            <li>Easy to use</li>

            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>When it arrived it was easy to assemble (insert blade).  </li>
            <li>I would have invented it years ago if it were easy to do that process.  </li>
            <li>It works and its easy...</li>
            <li>I think it would have easily survived shipment.  </li>

            <li>This item is Easy to use and works as described.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just so darn easy.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blades are easy to change.</li>
            <li>So easy, done in minutes.</li>
            <li>I was blown away by how easy it is to use and how well it works.</li>
            <li>the Bakblade.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so easy just to shave it again.</li>
            <li>So easy and works as it should.</li>
            <li>I tried some of the battery operated products out there, but they were not what I hoped they would be, and they broke easily.</li>
            <li>It even feels good to use, like a nice back</li>
            <li>Would be nice to be a bit of a closer shave, but for the time it saves vs. a standard razor and shave gel it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>the blade has a great size but it is not sharp?</li>
            <li>Good product, it works, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Very good, very useful, very practical well-designed item.</li>
            <li>Before a shower it takes just a couple of minutes for me to go from full wookie to Mr. Clean and considering the thickness of my man-pelt, the blades last for an impressive number of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would encourage first time users to use this in the shower as the amount of hair it takes off is amazing.</li>
            <li>First I got to say amazing customer service.</li>
            <li>It is easy, fast, very effective, and it actually feels good to use.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every product on the market, and this is the BEST hands down.</li>
            <li>Hands down awesome.  </li>
            <li>This is the best back shaver that I have ever used and is very fast.</li>
            <li>It does a very good job of getting rid of all my back hair and even as a guy that isn&#x27;t very flexible it is still very easy for me to do.  </li>
            <li>- it was light, sturdy, with an easy grip and handle.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a ton of hair and it is really fine, so</li>
            <li>and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>The customer service has been nothing less than impressive.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; glides smoothly over the skin and easily follows the contours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blade removes hair smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>It was painless and felt like scraping a fine tooth comb on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so I don&#x27;t get any stubble.  </li>
            <li>All in all it will do just fine.</li>
            <li>It DOES take time to get accustomed to working with back (everything reversed) but no, works pretty good !!!</li>
            <li>, this makes quick work of the task at hand !</li>
            <li>Super smooth!</li>
            <li>The blade is super safe</li>
            <li>will be a loyal customer!</li>
            <li>and I really appreciated his focus on satisfying the customer!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, and also works great as a back scratcher.</li>
            <li>It is fast, effective, and so easy to manage.</li>
            <li>you are special, very very special.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t provide as smooth a surface as waxing or laser removal but for those stray hairs and problem areas it does just fine</li>
            <li>No, doubt the best thing out there if u want to take care of ur hairy back (and for those that have little hair, still great product to buy).</li>
            <li>Just seems like there is a huge markup for injection molded plastic and three safety razor blades.</li>
            <li>Feels great to have a smooth back again.</li>
            <li>so you cannot cut yourself, HUGE razor head</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of work as others have accurately described but it does the job as promised.</li>
            <li>thank you guys for making such a great product....</li>
            <li>Its important to note that I am hairy.  </li>
            <li>Its also quite light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I would raise the price and give free shipping.</li>
            <li>Just a light scratch sensation.</li>
            <li>Its shave is smooth with no pain.</li>
            <li>I went from hairy to smooth and it took 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This one not only works but works great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also great back scratcher to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was easy to clean up after.</li>
            <li>The biggest issue I had was that I&#x27;m fairly fit</li>
            <li>It gets skin smooth just like a razor on your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the results and would recommend it to anyone who needs to do some maintenance on the back.</li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Please see my review for the replacement blades for this product for detailed review.</li>
            <li>I was expecting smooth</li>
            <li>free to use this feedback for review purposes.  </li>
            <li>Though humble in appearance, the tool works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Its a great product that does remove the hair as advertised and I can now groom my back without my wife&#x27;s help.</li>
            <li>but he would send out another razor and free blades.</li>
            <li>Result is not GQ-model smooth, but quite satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>All I can say same great service from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am still happy with this simple but great product that others seem to be too picky or too cheap to pay for a simple item.  </li>
            <li>I have been set free from the words &amp;#34;Honey</li>
            <li>It may not be baby-butt smooth</li>
            <li>hair free.</li>
            <li>Close and comfortable</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin looking smooth and hairless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product shaves it so much closer too and no shaving cream needed without any kind of irritation.</li>
            <li>you smooth hairless skin for a while.</li>
            <li>Nice job creating this much needed grooming tool.  </li>
            <li>The concept seems sound......</li>
            <li>My butt is also hair free now.  </li>
            <li>Wish it were available years ago.</li>
            <li>I is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>well and comfortable to use!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>BaKblade is great product for those who have back hair issues.  </li>
            <li>You can use it all the time to just stay smooth.</li>
            <li>Great back shaver.  </li>
            <li>Watch the video that is available today</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap and I can do it myself.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to use; fits my needs.</li>
            <li>to let all know, not only is the product great</li>
            <li>it feels great like scratching your back.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>and it is so smooth.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most useful things I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times with great results.</li>
            <li>I purchased this back shaver about a month ago and I am incredibly happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>My back looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>Then the owner contacted me after seeing my complaints and told me the replaceable blades had been improved and offered to send me some free replacements.</li>
            <li>Just smooth skin...</li>
            <li>The blade worked really well and to be honest</li>
            <li>This product is genuinely fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have not been hair free for like 20 ish yrs....</li>
            <li>I had such a great experience with the baKblade &amp;#34;BIGMOUTH&amp;#34; that I had to share.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to bug my wife which makes her happy because after 10 years if maraige she prefers not to have any physical contact with me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light years beyond the Mangroomer in efficiency and ease of use (the handle&#x27;s the perfect length to reach your whole back, shoulders etc.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>However, I still love this shaver and I am learning to be more gentle to reduce scrapes.</li>
            <li>After 3 shaves, so far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d most like to change right up there with my receding hairline</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a wreck right now :-)</li>
            <li>Was debating over mangroomer of baKblade glad I believe made right choice with this 1.</li>
            <li>BakSpa is a simple, but very effective product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product highly recommended</li>
            <li>Smooth, clean shave, quick and easy.</li>
            <li>The razor made clean smooth shave without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>and it looks clean, smooth, and hairless.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy and painless and</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>This was so quick and easy</li>
            <li>I received the blade, and was happy with the result, but the blade developed a crack after the first use.</li>
            <li>you can use Bakblade on your shoulder but a normal one works much better since you have more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Quick &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy and quick to use, close shave, works from any angle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use and takes almost no time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to use,</li>
            <li>I did lots of research online trying to find the product that would be easy to use, but also worked quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I loved the first shave so much</li>
            <li>This product really works and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Like so many others concerned with good grooming , this little tool does all its supposed to do and more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use making all areas of the back reachable, and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>I was completely blown away by how effective and easy this was to do.  </li>
            <li>It is fast, easy and most of all you don&#x27;t have to ask someone to help you.</li>
            <li>This back shaver is amazing!</li>
            <li>3 times better to be exact.</li>
            <li>just as described, no more help from anyone, works perfectly, buy it, you won&#x27;t forget it</li>
            <li>I bought this item for my husband and it&#x27;s been love at first use.</li>
            <li>Still using the original blade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the price of admission!</li>
            <li>I just got home from work at 11pm and checked the mail , and was excited to find my Bakblade.</li>
            <li>Then I got an email from the owner saying the post office can&#x27;t find my original package</li>
            <li>If you can use a back scratcher, you can use the BakBlade successfully.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>just like a fresh shave on the face!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got this.</li>
            <li>Great solution to a long time problem.  </li>
            <li>the blade I am using is still the original one, it has been almost 2 months, I use three times a week</li>
            <li>the blade I am using is still the original one, it has been almost 2 months, I use three times a week</li>
            <li>Buy this thing, It is by far the most useful product of it&#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
            <li>Best thing I bought from Amazon in the past year.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that was because it was my first time.</li>
            <li>Bakblade works fast and easy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new blades work amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Emailed them about it and they quickly remedied the problem by sending out another one, along with a free blade attachment.  </li>
            <li>I get a close, clean shave and have not had any issues.  </li>
            <li>My back is so smooth now, and the product even feels good to use.</li>
            <li>It shears the hair off cleanly and gets your skin feeling just like you used a mens face shaving razor.</li>
            <li>It shaves clean and close, and the guard protects cut cuts.  </li>
            <li>This product is truly one of the most amazing yet simple designs I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best back groomer I have used to date.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best back shaver on the market .</li>
            <li>and I want a clean back/shoulder look.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about wild back hairs peeking out when I wear  t-shirt, it&#x27;s Great!!</li>
            <li>Quick and easy, does a good enough job.  </li>
            <li>works very well, good for almost whole body</li>
            <li>The shoulders were the hardest for me to best angle the blade and get those pesky hairs with several pass throughs, but the learning curve is fast and I imagine it will get even easier and less time consuming over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company before I bought the product and received a prompt reply guaranteeing me that if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product, I&#x27;d get a full refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why so many positive reviews?</li>
            <li>So, originally, I found this product, and thought it sounded like a dream come true, so I started reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>More recently, with concerns about UV exposure and too much time in the sun, it became easier (and, dare I say, trendy!)</li>
            <li>I got 10 uses out of the first generation blades and just ordered the newly redesigned replacements which seem to be just as good, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very comfortable to my skin and it really gets the hair off!&lt;br /&gt;Nuff</li>
            <li>I got this product and used it right away, could not believe how easy it was.</li>
            <li>It takes some work to get some of the angles right, but it does what it promises, and it amazingly easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is especially true when most others did not write any other reviews.</li>
            <li>The President of the company himself made sure that everything was to my satisfaction--he even sent me their new blade to try out--that&#x27;s true customer service!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, will give you a trim but won&#x27;t get certain spots.</li>
            <li>but as ive stated it most certainly gets the job done in record time and removes the hair</li>
            <li>to wear a special &amp;#34;swim shirt&amp;#34; or rash guard at the beach or outdoor pool.</li>
            <li>I read tons of reviews here on Amazon and discovered several posts that loved the Bakblade and many others that claimed the positive reviews were skullduggery on the part of the product&#x27;s creator.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a certain kind of man with a specific kind of problem,</li>
            <li>Worked great the first time I used with my back hair grown out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, though watching some guy shave his back is not my idea of a good time, I did familiarize myself with the correct way to use the BakBlade by looking up some videos on Youtube.  </li>
            <li>That way, you&#x27;ll have a good idea as to proper &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, though watching some guy shave his back is not my idea of a good time, I did familiarize myself with the correct way to use the BakBlade by looking up some videos on Youtube.  </li>
            <li>That way, you&#x27;ll have a good idea as to proper &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once it is angled correctly, it works like magic and gets virtually a close shave...not quite but really damn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had imagined a product like this for years, hoping somebody would invent it, and today that dream came true.</li>
            <li>The quality of blades used to be good and one blade would last a while but not anymore.  </li>
            <li>Cool...</li>
            <li>Does a good job reaching every part of my back, I just wish the blades lasted longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, though the bb does not require much pressure to get the job done, the handle needs to be more rigid.</li>
            <li>I think this was a good idea to start with, but now I can use the bakblade regularly with ease.</li>
            <li>and it feels good like a back scratcher.</li>
            <li>It actually feels good to use this product.</li>
            <li>I am going to order more blades ASAP to have at the ready.  </li>
            <li>It actually felt quite good, as the website says.  </li>
            <li>Actually felt good.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I was able to get everywhere without much struggle at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like getting my back scratched, so this thing feels good to use.</li>
            <li>but most times it turns to a jungle and who wants to deal with that?  </li>
            <li>It worked so good on my back shaving all the hair.</li>
            <li>so it just felt REALLY different (in a good way)....</li>
            <li>but it also feels like a good back scratcher.  </li>
            <li>After seeing several demonstration videos, I was immediately sold but did think it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>This requires nothing but replacement blades, at $13 for a pack of two and with a claim of 6-7 uses per blade, it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>This is the best product in this category out there hands down!!!</li>
            <li>this thing is fantastic, virtually as close as a razor , easy and fast</li>
            <li>tell all my buddies, and and a few ladies, about the baKblade and how great and easy it is to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s been 100% super professional and courteous.</li>
            <li>If you have unwanted back hair, or even chest hair, this product is incredibly easy to use on your own.  </li>
            <li>Finally an easy way to do it myself that feels like a nice back scratch!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product, it is well designed and works quickly with the wide blade.  </li>
            <li>Result was a smooth shave right to the skin.</li>
            <li>After using the blade on my back, arms, and shoulders, I can honestly say that this product does wonder on removing unwanted body hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty easy to use and swap blades</li>
            <li>Clean cuts, smooth shaves and hot babes.</li>
            <li>Have only used it once so far, but very impressed with just the first use...</li>
            <li>Even if I let it grow back longer than normal in between, it takes like 5-10 minutes on my own, in the shower for absolutely amazing results.</li>
            <li>I opened the package and at first thought, &amp;#34;Oh, no, another cheap plastic gimmick that won&#x27;t deliver any good results.&amp;#34; I continued to unwrap the BakBlade and then immediately gave it a try on my back.</li>
            <li>Customer service was great as there was some hiccups due to an improvement in the model then shipping</li>
            <li>Quite possibly the greatest personal hygiene product ever invented.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks and I&#x27;m going to order the extra blades because this IS the BEST back shaver and my search is over....</li>
            <li>After getting used the scraping sensation caused by the blade on my skin, I watched as the hair quickly came off.  </li>
            <li>quick tips...</li>
            <li>I (or my wife) have been shaving/trimming the damn hair on my back for many, many years now.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does work many times better than a regular razor would.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was pretty sure it was not working, but then I turned and saw a pile of hair on the floor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spoke with the owner, Matt, he responded to my email with 5 minutes (not an exaggeration) and offered to send me two replacement products since deteriorating that quickly appears to have been a manufacturing defect.  </li>
            <li>My adoring partner was so happy, she asked me if I&#x27;d gotten my back</li>
            <li>This is the greatest product for male personal grooming ever!</li>
            <li>I bought replacement blades knowing that I was going to be a life-long, loyal customer.  </li>
            <li>It is simply the best solution without actually getting laser surgery.  </li>
            <li>and my back is nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, before using your product, I would refuse to do anything with my back because I was too embarrassed to get someone to shave it and too cheap to pay someone to do it.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It seems to simple but works great and gets it very close</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly a super product.</li>
            <li>I just use quickly before my shower takes about 2 minutes to go over again and done.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for your quick response.</li>
            <li>I quickly opened the package and examined the product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This really is a super invention.  </li>
            <li>But to my surprise this was by far the easiest and most comfortable system.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product that I will recommend to my brothers in my Big, Italian, Hairy Family!</li>
            <li>FINALLY SOMETHING I CAN USE ALL ON MY OWN, it gives a smooth shave like a razor,</li>
            <li>This shaver is not the solution to a perfectly hairless back or the smothest back.</li>
            <li>That said it is easy to use and pretty easy to manuver and clean up most of my back by myslf.</li>
            <li>I was not sure about this shaver when I ordered it, but is very good.  </li>
            <li>baKblade is easy to handle, easy to clean and leaves my back smooth and hairless.  </li>
            <li>The Bakblade feels smooth, like your girlfriend is scratching your back with her nails, very soothing and feels really good.</li>
            <li>I just ordered and used the baKblade last week, and I was very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic razor, but I have to admit the first time I used it</li>
            <li>There is no pain, it actually feels good like a back scratch and the design is nice</li>
            <li>It actually feels really good, like a nice back scratcher.</li>
            <li>I think my wife loves my new look :)</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll know pretty quick what the right angle is for each position from sound feel and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>it works fast, it works easy and it just works.</li>
            <li>Tried to use it again with shorter back hair and could not get it to look as good as the first time.</li>
            <li>of the most satisfying products I have bought in a long time.</li>
            <li>I was able to do the job quick and it&#x27;s easy to use when the back hair starts to return.</li>
            <li>Very ergonomic and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Easy, fast and painless.</li>
            <li>Easy to use , fast , close shave with no pain at all .</li>
            <li>It actually feels pretty good to use.</li>
            <li>Really easy to use and really works.</li>
            <li>There is nothing really fancy about this, but it is very effective at shaving the hair right off your back.  </li>
            <li>but I was very surprised and satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I know this is just a razor, but honestly, works amazingly well, very smart design and incredibly sharp without being dangerous!&lt;br /&gt;Would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li>I tested my bakblade out the other day, and I have to say, it is truly amazing!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended seller!!!</li>
            <li>My back has never been this smooth, ever!!</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of any product of this sort!</li>
            <li>Only thing keeping me from giving the baKblade another star is that the handle could have more of a curve to it - would make it easier to use if it had another 2-3 degrees of bend!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I also used it on my legs, which are pretty hairy, and the thing just works!</li>
            <li>Make sure you shave in strong short bursts.</li>
            <li>And when it came days later I couldn&#x27;t wait to see if it really worked and was amazed at how easy and effective it was.  </li>
            <li>If you have hair on your back or legs and want to be able to maintain it quickly this is the tool for you!</li>
            <li>It is very good if the hair is Thick.</li>
            <li>I was honestly a little surprised at how perfect it worked.</li>
            <li>The baKblade is easy to use and leaves my back clean with a smooth look and feel.  </li>
            <li>Postal service misplaced shipment GREAT customer service.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that the baKblade is not cheap but it works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that the baKblade is not cheap but it works great.</li>
            <li>It saves so much time and is hassel free.</li>
            <li>Product is pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Buy it, you wont regret it, is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have never written a product review before but this is worth the time.</li>
            <li>It is worth every dollar.  </li>
            <li>If it continues to work like it just did now, the price is worth it</li>
            <li>well worth it...</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Since you are using it without any kind of lubricant on your back it dryes your skin.</li>
            <li>This by far I&#x27;d the most cost effective, quickest and easiest method to remove back hair.</li>
            <li>Shave your own back in minutes while in the shower.</li>
            <li>better than trimmers by far.  </li>
            <li>(maybe the cost went into R&amp;D which was well worth it).</li>
            <li>Further it would be truly nice if the blade angle was user adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This back shaver is worth far more than what it currently sells for!&lt;br /&gt;The genius design, handle, incredible blade, etc.</li>
            <li>your back looks nice.</li>
            <li>Simple but effective shaver</li>
            <li>My partner is thrilled of not having to clip/shave my back.  </li>
            <li>Still worth getting it.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>so well it is worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>Fun.  </li>
            <li>Its worth it.</li>
            <li>Now you can shave your own back carpet by yourself!!!  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only cut myself once using this product, and to be honest</li>
            <li>During methods I had tried before I could feel the blade just gliding over the hair and not actually cutting it.  </li>
            <li>All in all a nice product and kudos to the Chris P., the supplier for following through so diligently.  </li>
            <li>Have to laugh at the results though.....  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He is thrilled to have a method of shaving his back that doesn&#x27;t rely on me or duct tape.</li>
            <li>Sleek simple design, effective and works.  </li>
            <li>Plastic guard is worth it.</li>
            <li>Simple, effective.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>and this really does a much better job and also much faster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried regular and electric razors, chemicals, and nothing has been both convenient and effective.</li>
            <li>Best product for getting the back hair and any other unwanted hair out there, dont have to worry about the battery operated ones losing charge, or the blades not cutting anymore.</li>
            <li>I tried the original mangroomer and it pulled more hair out than it actually trimmed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anything about the other back shavers, but this is the best money I ever spen and the customer service</li>
            <li>Gets the job done easily, seems safe enough and makes for a great back scratcher will you&#x27;re trimming the back 40.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of use and the short time it takes to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>This product is flat out amazing.</li>
            <li>As someone who deals with back hair on a normal basis, this was a shockingly low tech best bet.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t confirm if he is right.</li>
            <li>I received this thing a couple of days before a week-long trip to Cancun and used it right away.</li>
            <li>right out of the picture.</li>
            <li>I opened the package right away, and examined it.  </li>
            <li>Keep adjusting the angle till you get it just right.</li>
            <li>,  went right into the garage</li>
            <li>Without any hesitation he told me he would ship another one out right away.</li>
            <li>I know right?  </li>
            <li>Added bonus right?  </li>
            <li>Threw my man groomer right in the trash after I got this thing.</li>
            <li>The razor burn is gone now, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it and go right to the beach with your shirt</li>
            <li>The handle is&lt;br /&gt;nice and sturdy and the length is just right.</li>
            <li>Angle it right</li>
            <li>There were some shipping issues, but the company was right there and resolved the problem ASAP.</li>
            <li>Did a great job, the wide blade did the job faster than my wife helping me with the a normal razor or trimmer.</li>
            <li>Unless you are a total super hairy gorilla this still does a great job for people having hair not peach fuzz on the back.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close, clean shave.</li>
            <li>I hear they are working on some type of way to ensure this can be done, would make the clean up much easier.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally post reviews even though I spend 80% of my paycheck on Amazon, but after receiving the bakblade in the mail yesterday I felt compelled to tell everyone how much I now love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very easy to use and left no marks</li>
            <li>The best back shaver I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>When I tried it I was amazed at how quickly, easily, and painlessly it gave me a perfectly smooth back and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>The thing I love the most is that instead of 30 minutes I can knock out the hair in half the time and be on my way.</li>
            <li>great tool for any man wanting to take care of his own back hair or any hard to reach body hair problem areas.</li>
            <li>It is important to note that you do not get a freshly shaved smooth back from the backSPA.  </li>
            <li>It is important to note that you do not get a freshly shaved smooth back from the backSPA.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing I couldn&#x27;t find any info on the comments here is that the razor is about 1.5 feet long.</li>
            <li>buy pretty much everything on Amazon and rarely write reviews, especially for a product that I really don&#x27;t want everyone in the world to know I&#x27;m using, but I had to write this review for everyone else who is -- as I was -- hesitant because it sounds too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>the large blades make quick work out of this task.  </li>
            <li>I decided to break my promise and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The baKblade shipped quickly and discreetly and within an hour of receiving it I had laid out towels on the floor in front of the large bedroom mirror and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>Using exactly as advertised, you scratch your back (or any area you please) in an up and down motion (for best results) and it seems to MELT the hair away!</li>
            <li>the razor blade is simply too small to effectively shave each area because often one has to attack that location from different angles and my arms do not work the right way to come in at these spots from the best vantage point...</li>
            <li>It felt so good to put on a shirt and have it slide down.</li>
            <li>The blade is easy to use with both hands, and switches easily from the &amp;#34;north-south&amp;#34; long grip and choking up on it for &amp;#34;east-west&amp;#34; motion.</li>
            <li>I feel cooler (less hot, not like Fonzie), and I feel cleaner, and even though no one can see, I feel more confident.  </li>
            <li>I feel cooler (less hot, not like Fonzie), and I feel cleaner, and even though no one can see, I feel more confident.  </li>
            <li>to use, a little getting used to arching your body into different positions for best results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely works great and in little time....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s uber easy to use, much more so than other alternatives.  </li>
            <li>and they would send me a new one when available.  </li>
            <li>We BOTH noticed that the overall QUALITY of the BakBlade was FAR SUPERIOR to even the &amp;#34;TOP OF THE LINE&amp;#34; shaver(s) offered by competing company(s).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as smooth as waxing or nair obviously but still really smooth.</li>
            <li>It works, its fast, and it feels good--like a nice back scratch.</li>
            <li>I tried the system out in May when I bought them and was really surprised with how easy it works.  </li>
            <li>For me, I have a light amount of hair on my back, but their videos on their website are 100% accurate.</li>
            <li>This is the best back shaver I have ever used and I have tried a few.</li>
            <li>I tried in the shower first, but sound is your best friend here because you can hear the hair being cut, and there is no greater discomfort using it dry as opposed to wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Have used several times with same great results.  </li>
            <li>for closeness, I think you can&#x27;t get any closer even if you use regular razor, I am able to completely remove any signs of stubble with this, and the best part, you can do you entire back, shoulders, arms, etc in minutes (like 2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had ordered extra blades directly form bak blade website(you get three for 12.95, good deal) but the company sent two, I assume in error....</li>
            <li>It really cleans the back nicely.</li>
            <li>I, for one, purchased this shaver awhile back and was extremely happy with the overall results.  </li>
            <li>I experienced no cuts or nicks but the hot water in the shower stung a little bit after I used it (which wasn&#x27;t a problem as it told me the shave was really close).  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive so there was some light scratching and bleeding.</li>
            <li>obsessively read all the reviews, figured there was no way it was as good as it sounded, but plunked down the money for the shaver and extra blades anyway (better to save on shipping costs, right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bakBlade arrived today</li>

            <li>Easy to use, no mess,</li>
            <li>I felt like I was having a very nice back scratch the entire time.</li>
            <li>I have to say that BakBlades Customer Service is VERY fast to respond.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable - no stinging after like using a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>the response time was very fast.</li>
            <li>Matt, I very much like the Bigmouth shaver.</li>
            <li>I have tried other methods (wax, nair, clippers, man groomer) but this is the cleanest, most comfortable, and easiest of all of them.</li>
            <li>For myself though, it was fine, and I was happily surprised that the product, did indeed work.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how quickly this was shipped but even more surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li>Its shaped perfectly, works really fast, actually feels pretty good, and you get a crazy close shave.  </li>
            <li>New replacement blades are reasonable, and easy to install.</li>
            <li>If you like a smooth clean back in about 10 minutes with no nicks or cuts, do yourself a favor and buy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy, and relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>and you get a pretty close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>You can feel when it is at the proper angle, as you will feel the serrated blade guard just barely touching your skin.  </li>
            <li>though I have some physical inabilities which prevent me from reaching over my shoulders with the handle, my wife was able to use it on me exactly as designed.</li>
            <li>all my years,I&#x27;ve never found a better personal grooming product.  </li>
            <li>Gotta say at first glance</li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it advertises</li>
            <li>It takes my wife 10 or more minutes to shave my back, I did it in 5 !!!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I leave the blade cover on and use it as a back scratchier too! :-)</li>
            <li>They work ok, but leave me with back stubble.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t like hot tubs&amp;#34;, but it was all hogwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is totally different and works better.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says and does it well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the electric one (Mangroomer), but this is easier to use, gets better results and it is quiet.  </li>
            <li>the first time!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel the blades will last more than the prescribed 6-7 shaves.  </li>
            <li>I was definitely hesitate but extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than having to ask someone to shave your back or nothing at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works exactly as claimed.</li>
            <li>Looked into many diff ways to rid back hair from my kid shaving it{always</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I was amazed.</li>
            <li>The first time it never arrived.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;~ FAST!  </li>
            <li>Tried the baKblade for the first time as soon as I got home from work today.</li>
            <li>Thanks baKblade!</li>
            <li>Very thankful for your service!</li>
            <li>the Bakblade arrived today, I went to the washroom to try out, and it works exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if you notice it looks like a ICE SCRAPER for your car, which is EXACTLY what it is.  </li>
            <li>This might be the first item that i have decided to review .</li>
            <li>This is the first review I am ever leaving.  </li>
            <li>and I used it today for the first time.  </li>
            <li>What you see in the video is representative of the ease of use and stellar results of the BakBlade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me about 10-15 minutes on the first go around.</li>
            <li>FUNNY</li>
            <li>The first one fell apart when the blade loosened, and even the replacement blades wouldn&#x27;t stay on well.  </li>
            <li>This thing really works!</li>
            <li>Does your back look more like a sweater?</li>
            <li>this thing plowed through the overgrowth like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>However, no big deal, this thing is magic.</li>
            <li>First-</li>
            <li>If you have hair there it does the job pretty well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>This product does a better job on my back then any electric ever has.</li>
            <li>My direct contact with the company was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is the first thing I&#x27;ve bought off amazon besides textbooks</li>
            <li>The bb seems to get dulled after only 7 or 8 uses, which is how many times I have used it.</li>
            <li>Actually, I run the blade both ways, but more hair was removed when approached from the side.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Actually, I run the blade both ways, but more hair was removed when approached from the side.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Bakblade!!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time about a week ago</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t explain how that bit works exactly...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;d have the proper room to use</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s exactly what I thought</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be as close as your facial razor can do, but it&#x27;s very impressive for a wide fixed blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thanks again!  </li>
            <li>The bakblade feels like a back scratcher, it is actually enjoyable to use this.</li>
            <li>It really cuts that close!</li>
            <li>believe that this product is a bit over priced and could be more affordable when considering how simple it seems to be</li>
            <li>This thing works exactly as its said to.</li>
            <li>I find just using back and forth motions work better.</li>
            <li>Being it was my first time using it, I&#x27;m sure it will go quicker and easier nex&#x27;t time and will only have stubble maybe to trim.</li>
            <li>GIves you a pretty close shave nex&#x27;t thing to a safety razor shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>okay, I know its gross</li>
            <li>I would love to shoot a commercial for this thing!</li>
            <li>After the first swipe the hair was just smashed to the skin.</li>
            <li>So pretty satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>Order extra blades though because you will eventiall need more.</li>
            <li>I had been embarrassed by my back hair for many years</li>
            <li>I searched Amazon for a back shaver product and saw the bakblade, among many others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been recommending it to all of my friends since I first used it.</li>
            <li>Plus no expensive replacement blades to buy.</li>
            <li>Got it yesterday, used it for the first time today...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll gladly spend $30-$60/year to be rid of back hair.</li>
            <li>It just arrived and 5 mins later I was smooth like a hairless cat!  </li>
            <li>I found shaving the lower back was OK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy.  </li>
            <li>It performs exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>First, the instructions say you don&#x27;t need shave cream.</li>
            <li>Overall- love this product.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had a couple of skin scrapes.</li>
            <li>my skin may be more sencative from where i havent shaved my back for sevaral years</li>
            <li>Recommend highly!!</li>
            <li>keep maintenance is most likely once or 2x a week.  </li>
            <li>It shipped on the first day and was like I have to wait</li>
            <li>You want to know something funny?  </li>
            <li>I trim my back on a weekly schedule and have yet to use it for more than a month</li>
            <li>When I tried your product for the first time, I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this product works.</li>
            <li>Thanks baKblade!</li>
            <li>works exactly as they said it would.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about having to buy replacement blades all the time, but the blades are well built and my first two lasted 7 months with 1-2 uses per week.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It takes me about 5 - 7 minutes to get the job done; I&#x27;m a pretty hair fellow.</li>
            <li>I got 7 shaves out of my first blade.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a product that got rid of the back hair better than the man groomer.  </li>
            <li>I think it works better than a regular razor</li>
            <li>well sure enough at  2pm it arrives in the mail, and</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time and just didn&#x27;t believe it was working</li>
            <li>Nice and wide</li>
            <li>It feels better than a back scratcher.</li>
            <li>THOSE GIRLY MEN OUT CALIFORNIA WAY, BUT A REAL MAN!</li>
            <li>this thing reaches everywhere on my back and more.</li>
            <li>Although I think it&#x27;s safer than the first two areas</li>
            <li>This first use took me a while</li>
            <li>I tried it first without&lt;br /&gt;shave cream and</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of shavers including the mangroomer</li>
            <li>it arrived yesterday, and I just finished using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was able to shave around my back with ease.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to buy more refill blades.</li>
            <li>I must admit when I first saw the product I was a tad dubious about the claims.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d thrown out the first one after I switched to an electric) and found baKblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d thrown out the first one after I switched to an electric) and found baKblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>which is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I stuck to my only wish.</li>
            <li>After years of many products I think I finally found the solution to my squatchness here.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time ever shaving - wife and kids said get rid of sweatter for Bahamas trip -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy.</li>
            <li>Plus, the company charges you for shipping, which makes the overall purchase even more pricey.</li>
            <li>and I guess I expected that and in my own vanity it truly helps give me confidence now that summer is here.</li>
            <li>I used the item this morning for the first time.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>uses out of the first blade.</li>
            <li>Had more luck using the extra blade by hand.</li>
            <li>Great product with good cutting action.  </li>
            <li>It really works as it says it does!</li>
            <li>I read a few of the good reviews, then I looked at just the negatives.  </li>
            <li>I was a little too scared to try something new but after using it for about six time I believe it has been a great investment.</li>
            <li>It took me more time to vacuum up the hair than it did to remove it.  </li>
            <li>Very useful, takes a little time of getting use to it but overall very nice</li>
            <li>item was: 100% - back hairless, very quick &amp; easy to use, actually felt nice while using (like a back scratcher).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>However, putting baby powder on my back and then shaving with it dry style gives me a great shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;it made for a quick and smooth back shave!</li>
            <li>My BakBlade was a couple days late arriving, so he sent one Fed-Ex for free, to make sure I had one in a timely manner!  </li>
            <li>Finally, this back shaver does not require any shaving cream and you will have a better understand when using at the fact that it actually feels good when shaving is the cherry on the topping.  </li>
            <li>Not only can I keep my back clean but at a fraction of the cost of what it cost to have a relationship partner to shave it!!!  </li>
            <li>I am undecided at this time ive used it once it most certainly does what it says it removed all my back hair.</li>
            <li>This shaver is an amazing find and priced extremely well.</li>
            <li>I do my own full body waxing except for the middle of my back, can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li>I can’t thank you enough for sending an extra one just in case the first one was lost for good.</li>
            <li>called me immediately and learning the situation that I did not receive due to USPS delay, he did a priority fedex at his own cost and did not charge me for the additional product as he wanted me to have the product and try it</li>
            <li>Still had some hard to reach places but this is the best thing I&#x27;ve used to shave without using a actual razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other methods, and definitely there is no other best shave like the Bakblade....</li>
            <li>Seriously, it works great.</li>
            <li>and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at how effective the bakblade is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One method I&#x27;ve got with great results was take a shower and dry off and use it then, much like shaving your facial hair.</li>
            <li>sincerely appreciated the extra effort which is lacking from all too many retailers this day and age.  </li>
            <li>This item is designed very well, I was able to reach every area on my back and take care of everything within 5 minutes by myself with a hand mirror.</li>
            <li>To me though, it&#x27;s worth it because my back is so smooth.</li>
            <li>I was first made aware of this product via [...] and being very hairy</li>
            <li>You just need to make sure you do your whole back which is no fault of the product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone that wants to keep a clean back as the blade is incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no, pain, no razor burn, and most importantly no more hair.</li>
            <li>My expectations were neutral when I ordered this, though I was encouraged by the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I read all the positive reviews and became convinced this product was my answer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it or have anything but positive feedback.</li>
            <li>Not only is it very easy to use, but it takes no time at all to clean up the whole back.</li>
            <li>clothes feel SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE without back hair, (it also does the tops of shoulder blades, lower back, etc..</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I started using the product in September, using it about once every 2 weeks, and now I&#x27;m ready to replace the blade for the first time (over 2.5 to 3 months time).</li>
            <li>and it only takes a minute (two at the most) to keep my back and shoulders hair free.  </li>
            <li>pretty much resigned myself to being one of those people always wearing a t-shirt in the pool or at the beach -- in the water or out.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy, quick, clean and simple straight out the package...</li>
            <li>The blade is very wide which overall is great, but a couple passes are needed to get it all off in certain spots.</li>
            <li>So I am a 42 year old, mildly back-hairy guy, and generally have been contending with back hair getting more and more dense starting around 28 and covering more of my back and thicker as the years tick by.</li>
            <li>Very quick, comfortable and MUCH closer shave than any other electronic razor I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>It cuts extremely close, leaving your back nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>If you have back hair and want an easy way to remove it..</li>
            <li>It was so easy to get all angles of my back.</li>
            <li>Hairs get caught between the teeth and make it less effective until you wipe them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i feltmy back to ind smooth with my first time shaving it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use (probably even easier for someone younger than me!)</li>
            <li>Easy to get all spots on my back.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the back shaving products available and after first use this one is the winner for a bunch of reasons.</li>
            <li>Your product makes it so easy to maintain my back.</li>
            <li>find that dry shaving gets better results too.</li>
            <li>Makes something I always dreaded simple &amp; easy.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER DUPER HYPER sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It took about 10-15 minutes this first time, but my back is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s rear end.</li>
            <li>and I only use in the shower and the blade is still going strong....</li>
            <li>and I only use in the shower and the blade is still going strong....</li>
            <li>All were a &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;, because, I needed assistance to reach certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The large blade and forgiving comb on the blade allow you to give yourself a faster and closer shave than the the alternative.</li>
            <li>If you have an extremly large amount of hair I can see the intial use clogging the blade, however keep up at it and no problems.</li>
            <li>It can be a bit tricky to get to certain areas, like the center-mid-back, or center-low-back, but with some manuvering I always manage to get where I need to go.</li>
            <li>so I cannot speak for large amount of hair growth</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use it in the shower it will help to have a large mirror.</li>
            <li>First time I have been able to completely remove my back hair by myself.</li>
            <li>After receiving the package, he replied that he was very surprised at what was in the package his mom had sent but that it worked really well, worth the money, no complaints - and he is very particular about things.</li>
            <li>Buy this product it really works and its easy to get to areas of your back.</li>
            <li>The product was extremely easy to use, thanks to the owner Matt emailing me some basic tips on how to use the baKBlade.</li>
            <li>I stood in the mirror grinning like a fool at the results, I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy and fast Bakblade took care of my back hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who hates their back hair and wants an easy way to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>This product is easy, painless, fast, chemical-free and reaches all the parts of my back.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest guys, nobody really likes to ask their wife/girlfriend or significant other to shave their back</li>
            <li>Lol wipes that back hair off with a single swipe!!!!</li>
            <li>I just rub lotion on my back and it feels fine in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you keep up with shaving your back on a regular basis, this takes less than 2-3 minutes and does a perfect job.  </li>
            <li>Like most of the reviewers here, I am pretty hairy and a lot of other products have not lived up to their expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have fairly fine hair on my back and this took care of it</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as close as a razor but for the back it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and I&#x27;m able to reach my entire back!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Much, much wider than a blade you would use for your face, so makes removing hair in the large area very quick&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great for the little hair I do have on my back.</li>
            <li>We, men, finally have a product that can help with the back hair issue, and being a gay man, it&#x27;s nice to finally have one that works.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I immediately used it, and nicked myself a few times, but it felt good to not have those little hairs bugging me.</li>
            <li>I really only have a couple trouble ares, but could never reach those spots with the electric body groomers I had purchased, this product has great reach/coverage.</li>
            <li>finds back hair attractive guys, so pay the $37 and be free from public shame at a cost that is next to nothing when you think about the savings over waxing (and embarrassment for requesting the back wax!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not a false claim  3.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week before the shower and my back stays looking smooth and sleek for the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He immediately sent me another shaver and included a free second replacement blade.  </li>
            <li>my back was smooth.  </li>
            <li>very appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i can feel my t-shirt against my smooth back.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>no tired arms&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>no tired arms&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>and my back was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s a</li>
            <li>I thought it was too much money for this product.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>BUT REALLY</li>
            <li>It is the real deal.</li>
            <li>which is very hairy and with the learning curve.  </li>
            <li>This thing really works.  </li>
            <li>I does not get the back smooth like a razor will.</li>
            <li>and i was stunned how much hair it raked up...</li>
            <li>I have determined it was a shipping issue as the blades look very sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I learned that going too fast caused that.</li>
            <li>My back is now as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>Feels like a back scratcher and leaves you smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>I was using the mangroomer and that would not get very close.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too much hair</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>The blade seems to be at a very steep arc toward the handle.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I am a fan of the bIGblade and thanks for listening.</li>
            <li>It works really well though.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Also works much quicker than the Mangroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product I do believe my girlfriend</li>
            <li>and I will both be much happier.</li>
            <li>Really close shave</li>
            <li>Smooth back, no helper, no lube...?</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>How much hair does he have to shave?</li>
            <li>The BakBlade works as advertised in the fact that it feels like you are using a back scratcher but the end result is a back that is smooth and hair free.</li>
            <li>Amazon really needs to address this because what this guy is doing is a scam.</li>
            <li>Thanks MATT, if that is your real name, for everything you didn&#x27;t do when you scammed me.</li>
            <li>and if you apply too much pressure you can still cut yourself even with the guard.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to buy this</li>
            <li>Thanks for having this out there.  </li>
            <li>I agreed, and he promptly let me know when it was ready and communicated the shipping/tracking info as well.  </li>
            <li>Very thankful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, painless (actually stimulating, like a nice back rub) and gets the hair off immediately.  </li>
            <li>He showed a demonstration on a friend, since he, himself, did not have much hair to trim.</li>
            <li>works better than expected.</li>
            <li>My back is now smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>but we will see if it really becomes a hassle.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very affordable</li>
            <li>and it really cuts the hair close.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin completely smooth with no stubble at all and it only took me about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>THANKS BAKBLADE</li>
            <li>seemed like a real extravagance</li>
            <li>But this works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The replacement blades are $13 for 2, I really would rather not be spending that kind of money every time I started to turn back into a grizzly, I&#x27;d just as soon have someone use my clippers and take the extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have any doubts lay them aside, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making a product that works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>I have tried several other back shaving products and this one is the best by far!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>It takes the hair off much easier and faster.</li>
            <li>Thanks for creating this product.  </li>
            <li>very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>If you shave it and use it like a back scratcher you&#x27;ll get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>My whole life body hair grooming has been a thing.</li>
            <li>The DE blades are not user replaceable as the whole thing is glued shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>The baKBlade is the real deal.</li>
            <li>So much faster and easier than anything electric.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended indeed!</li>
            <li>Still, for what it delivers I&#x27;m very please with the product.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe the results and you won&#x27;t believe how fast this thing will&lt;br</li>
            <li>my back was smooth.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close, no shaving cream needed.  </li>
            <li>Wolf hairs for real.</li>
            <li>cost was much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much baKblade.</li>
            <li>Very prompt.  </li>
            <li>and it felt like I was scraping my skin leaving the area very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;Especially between the shoulder blades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really, think of it as scratching an itch that keeps moving.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s not so comfortable even with shorter back hair.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like being as hairy as I am.  </li>
            <li>Thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this on my back, which is lightly hair as I maintain it often.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it, I realized just a light touch will do and have had a smooth back shave since then.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>works very well.  </li>
            <li>Great product, somewhat irritating to the skin, but goes away in a day.</li>
            <li>I was ready to go to a pool party in no time.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say, except it really does work.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Guys!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL BUILT</li>
            <li>This is much easier (and cheaper).  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Use a very creamy soap as a lubricant while using this product.</li>
            <li>Not only was the hair gone, but my skin was completely smooth.  </li>
            <li>Not only was the hair gone, but my skin was completely smooth.  </li>
            <li>It works really, really well.  </li>
            <li>The size makes it fast too.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Really does the job as shown and advertised.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>If they come out with a 2.0 a notchable handle (like the mangroomer&#x27;s) would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li>I really like that I can use this product in the shower.</li>
            <li>your very hairy like me ...</li>
            <li>but every time it leaves my back smooth and hair-free.  </li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>It works fast.</li>
            <li>While I can understand this for the handle, i really wish the blades weren&#x27;t that way.</li>
            <li>Does it really cost 5.95 to ship blades?</li>
            <li>but it is also MUCH faster than Mangroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can have a smooth back in just a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks, Mike</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Incredibly better than expected.</li>
            <li>This is not going to give you a smooth shave like your facial razor.</li>
            <li>Really recomend this for somebody that has nobody to give a hand.</li>
            <li>An absolute must buy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Very recommended for hairy people.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I had every doubt in the world spending this freaking much for a flimsy piece of plastic with a blade; and now I am sold.</li>
            <li>My skin was so smooth that I couldn&#x27;t even tell that I have back hair.</li>
            <li>and with no cuts or even really any scratches.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you, this product is for real.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets the hair off really well, but I am suffering now.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very time consuming process.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice big clean shave in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>My first time using it took only about 4 minutes to remove all of my hair which was in full growth pattern.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product, very much worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li>I do, however, believe the product works best with people with thin back hair like me.</li>
            <li>I dream of being able to take off my shirt without young children running away screaming or worrying about making the next issue of the Sasquatch newsletter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it has a wide blade to cover more surface area.</li>
            <li>Especially if it&#x27;s the kind that only grows in one or two areas leaving you to look like a dog with mange.</li>
            <li>BakBlade just felt like a good back scratching and the wide blade</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair or fair skin, this product may irritate your skin without shaving cream or another substance to help the blade glide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young man with a few hairs on my shoulders and back and this works great, very easy to use even when using completely dry.</li>
            <li>bit of advice - this thing is like a hair machete and if you are really hairy (even if you&#x27;re NOT really hairy), put a big towel under your feet, do this outside or have a good vacuum handy because this unit will shear you</li>
            <li>In fact, after using the new BakBlade, I quickly threw my old products away without hesitation!  </li>
            <li>In fact I am confident that every claim made for products online or on TV will certainly not do a thing.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product and WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Beats using cream by far!!!  </li>
            <li>This back blade is easy, quick, and left my back looking smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today and was amazed at how quickly this took care of back hair.</li>
            <li>After using my original Mangroomer last week, which just wasn&#x27;t doing anything to trim the light hair on my back, I logged on and discovered the baKblade and had to give it a chance.</li>
            <li>Even as the blade dulls it still removed more then most other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I just used my new bakblade yesterday for the first time.</li>
            <li>I should have got it for my husband a long time ago, he thinks it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have recommended your product to numerous friends and associates and wish you much luck and success with it !  </li>
            <li>But once I got the hang of it, after my first time,  baKblade was easy to use and much neater than any other method.</li>
            <li>As far as the mess, most of the hair clings to the blade, and comes off quickly with a swipe of the finger.</li>
            <li>The length of the handle and angle of the blade head make it very easy to cover the entire back.</li>
            <li>This device is razor sharp but does the job safely.  </li>
            <li>It is not a magic bullet and comes with some setbacks, but is probably the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used to shave my back without having another individual do it for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, but the product I received is top notch!  </li>
            <li>I shave my face every other day, mostly because I&#x27;m rushed every morning, not because I don&#x27;t need to shave.</li>
            <li>Surly it was a safe guys if your suffering like the other and myself get it</li>
            <li>hopefully the blade will last as long as they say, but so far so good</li>
            <li>thinking I would again be wasting money on another back hair removing product that does not work (like the original Mangroomer)...</li>
            <li>Works better than expected!</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the construction seems a bit cheap and the price is high for what you get.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be set for 6 months of clean back shaving.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how clean and efficient the baKBlade was in shearing and cleaning my back.</li>
            <li>Now I use it every week or so to keep my back clean.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a body builder who needs to keep his back, arms and chest clean for competitions, this is going to be the product for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>to do the job (dry, and in the tub for easy cleanup)</li>
            <li>I probably should not have attempted it after a few beers, not one of my most stellar moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product it was about time someone came up with a solution for back shaving, simple and quick shave with no mess or no need of other products to get the job done</li>
            <li>The Bigmouth covers a large area and makes quick work of removing hair from the back region.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past, and this was far and away the best solution I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This item is priced high for a piece of plastic, but, it really does work.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any man who wants to be well groomed.</li>
            <li>does a great job, but it is sharp and back was bleeding from moles being sliced open, needed to be much more careful.</li>
            <li>I have used the baKBlade just 3 times over the last couple of weeks and each time I actually get excited to shave my back because of how good it actually feel using it!</li>
            <li>The supplier promptly refunded my money and recently sent me the new version free of charge.  </li>
            <li>Mine is  a special case where the issue of back hair removal is a tricky.</li>
            <li>A complete back shave was really easy to accomplish in no time at all.</li>
            <li>I wish it was available a long time ago.</li>
            <li>And, as if that wasn&#x27;t enough, Chris also gave me a full refund on my shipping costs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d like to buy the person(s) who invented this handy tool a round of beers!</li>
            <li>First off I should mention that I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This may be true if you&#x27;re using it in the shower and have a constant flow of water on you.</li>
            <li>but the baKBlade is just so effective and by far the easiest way to remove back hair that I sucked it up and ordered it for the second time.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how long the blade will last, but this shaver works great!</li>
            <li>This is a great company and since I&#x27;m only 21, they will have my business for a long, long time.</li>
            <li>The feeling is a good one that I don&#x27;t need to spend extensive time using an electric razor with weird angles to hold to make sure all the hair is gone.</li>
            <li>Use very light, short, back and forth stokes.</li>
            <li>the threads were because it left my skin a little bumpy and it didn&#x27;t and was very pleased at how smooth my back was after using it.</li>
            <li>Seriously worth every penny – it gets very close and smooth, I hated waxing and the breaking out – this makes it so easy to groom.. seriously amazing.</li>
            <li>Be sure you either keep the paperwork or write the razor name down somewhere.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do, it&#x27;s as easy as advertised, and it&#x27;s the smoothest my back has ever been outside of after waxing.  </li>
            <li>NEW!</li>
            <li>NEW!</li>
            <li>The BakBlade is an amazingly simple product but VERY well constructed, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; razors, which cut, get clogged, cause ingrown hairs and razor burn, the BakBlade has Two large blades (about 5&amp;#34; wide&amp;#34; with a serrated blade guard which prevents the blades from clogging-up, while acting like a &amp;#34;rake&amp;#34; of sorts, which causes the hair to clump-up into what my wife would call &amp;#34;hair balls&amp;#34; (like a cat&#x27;s fur).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of razorbas&#x27; over the years, i thought they were fine though i never enjoyed having to go over the same area so many times just to get all the hair...</li>
            <li>Thx Amazon , 1 less job I gotta do :) he loves it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will take less time and effort to maintain.</li>
            <li>I would recommend having your significant other help you out the first time that you use it.  </li>
            <li>Also, the blade is wide and I was able to complete my de-furring within about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It was more costly in embarrassment by NOT having this and continuing with hairy shoulders, upper arms and back.  </li>
            <li>However only because I got extra blades I was able to use it because my blade was broke upon delivery.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think of it and whoever did should be rewarded for coming up with such a great item, but for plastic and common every day blades, which I assume is what inside the cover guard shouldn&#x27;t run that much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>plastic and steel, especially with another eight bucks in shipping and handling -that was neither quick not communicative.  </li>
            <li>I was going to wait because a have a bit of limited mobility in my right shoulder and am just getting over carpal tunnel and trigger finger surgery in my right hand.</li>
            <li>The best &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; appliance for shaving your back, but not perfect.</li>
            <li>i have tried all kinds of back shavers before this only to be wishing for somethijg better.</li>
            <li>This is by far the finest tool available for shaving your back.</li>
            <li>And when you have a hairy back, this is something you almost can never get enough of! :)</li>
            <li>I kinda had to be a contortionist to do even a decent job.</li>
            <li>Decent glide to it.  </li>
            <li>It is fast and easy and the blades last pretty long.</li>
            <li>Quickly took care of my back.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a super hairy back to start out with</li>
            <li>I realized I was going to be one of those lucky dudes who had to shave his back.</li>
            <li>every one of my hairs was being individually yanked out by tiny tweezers, I figured there HAD to be a better way.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little scared when I tried it out because it felt like the blade was catching on my back.</li>
            <li>I had a lot more hair back there than I expected, but it worked and did a pretty close job.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent too much money on other back hair solutions and am very happy I finally came across something that does what it says!</li>
            <li>I cannot fault the product itself as I should have taken more care prior to shaving, but be advised this is essentially 3 straight razer blades in plastic holder with a minor level of protection.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and this company.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to rid themselves of body hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So to high light:&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>When I was in high school</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Replacement blades are high $$ though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this to any fellow Sasquatch out there.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, guys.</li>
            <li>All other back shavers are just handles that hold your own razor.</li>
            <li>I always have had a hard time shaving it,but with this it is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Finally a product that delivers exactly what it promises!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this once but can&#x27;t say enough about how excited I am about how well it worked!</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>but you do have to get a little creative</li>
            <li>Once I opened the pack I went right to work, and in a matter of less than 15 minutes I was able to see my back amidst the hair!</li>
            <li>The product works extremely well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Was amazed at how easy it was to use compared to other products I have used</li>
            <li>The back waxing gave me a nice smooth back but left me with \\&quot;backne\\&quot; and grew back to quick to justify the time and money spent on the service.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really that hairy, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older there seems to be more hair on my back, and I really needed something I could use by myself to take care of it.</li>
            <li>The blades are fantastic and I highly recommend  them for anyone that wants to remove back hair as efficiently as possible.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not nearly as thick in the front...</li>
            <li>Wow does this thing really work.</li>
            <li>You will not be sorry and rather happy that you took my advice.</li>
            <li>Just get this, don&#x27;t waste any more time reading reviews or debating what to get.</li>
            <li>Works surprisingly well and no more having to embarrassingly ask my wife to shave my hairy back!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of this product when I first saw it, but there were plenty of good reviews</li>
            <li>If you bought this last year and did not like it, give it another chance, well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>It is normally 100 plus here in the summer time and a t-shirt is over kill at this point.  </li>
            <li>And maybe most importantly, no irritation.  </li>
            <li>It was about time that someone came up with such a useful tool.  </li>
            <li>It is the first product for your back that doesnt seem to break and is very durable.</li>
            <li>First product that I use which I can do my whole back myself without calling for my wifes help.</li>
            <li>I used the man groomer along with a normal razor for the parts I could reach for about 3 years</li>
            <li>/&gt;After waiting a few months to see some more reviews and watching some of the YouTube videos out there I decided to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this rate even shaving everyday you may got through 2-3 blades a year at most.</li>
            <li>it is about time a product stand up to the test,I love this product its been a long time comming for myself with the back hair battle...</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time about 2 hours ago and it took about 5 minutes to do my whole back</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste anymore time get the bakblade and start enjoying the summer...</li>
            <li>It is not the ultimate solution but this product work enough and is far better</li>
            <li>Bakblade, simple, straight forward and very affordable!  </li>
            <li>I really like this as I have a pretty hairy back.</li>
            <li>Easy and simple to use I will definitely be buying a few more.  </li>
            <li>The other solid feature of this back shaver is the fact that the blades themselves are nice and wide thus covering more areas at once while shaving.  </li>
            <li>The baKblade is nothing short of awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Maybe they&#x27;ll add a conditioning strip to the blades or a shave lotion applicator attachment to it for those that have super sensitive skin in a future version.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, took care of my back hair and I look forward to using it in the future.</li>
            <li>Handle makes it easy to reach the hard-to-reach middle of the back.</li>
            <li>Ordering the spare blades soon, though I think the original one will last at least 10 more times for me.</li>
            <li>The man groomer sucked and would actually draw blood if you didn&#x27;t hold it right.</li>
            <li>recent trimming option have been asking for help, they never do it right by the way, plastic hanger with a cordless trimmer attatched by rubber bands(works but a pain in the @$$, and now this Bakblade.  </li>
            <li>Get this if you have a problem with a hairy back and want to shave it down on your own, you will be quite surprised!</li>
            <li>Its ergonomic design takes the guess work of where to apply pressure as the razor was built in such a way as to provide both safety, yet effectively allow for shaving coverage (dry is more my preference) in less than 5 minutes whilst at the same time getting a nice soothing back scratch with zero to little irritation.</li>
            <li>hair comes off quickly after a few gliding strokes and can easily reach any spot on the back.</li>
            <li>when I let my chest or legs go too long between shaves, the first time I shave again, I will get some irritation in certain spots.</li>
            <li>, I have never felt smooth after using any other product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who has to deal with this and does not want to ask their significant other or get waxed.</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try out the brand new baKblades from BIGblade.</li>
            <li>, the company owner (Chris) sent me the new design yesterday, and it works</li>
            <li>I was told there was a new blade design that was coming out this year</li>
            <li>I live FPO, AE.  </li>
            <li>I have used it 5 times and blade is still like new.</li>
            <li>I will order new blades soon.</li>
            <li>I will need to order a new set.  </li>
            <li>With it, I have a new found independence.</li>
            <li>or if I wanted to receive their new blade which was debuting in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Now is time to get new blades though.</li>
            <li>I contacted baKblade &amp; they shipped me a new blade &amp;</li>
            <li>I also seldom review any product, but in the case of my new Bakblade, as soon as I finished using it, I had to let everyone know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we were set to leave at 2:30pm that day, well all day I was hoping my new Bakblade would come before i had to leave,</li>
            <li>Yesterday I received the new BakBlade in the mail.  </li>
            <li>This is my review of the NEW blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just received my new Bakblade razor.</li>
            <li>It also gets to all of the hard to reach places and is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>guys, now you are not just able to get rid of all those hard to reach back hair, but also you will enjoy shaving it as much as a bear enjoys scratching his back to a tree!</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time and realized right away that it&#x27;s not a total solution for my back hair problem.  </li>
            <li>It took a few minutes to suss out the technique, but once I had it sorted, the Backspa worked great and takes just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Your product left my back smooth.</li>
            <li>First things first, the bakblade works as expected.  </li>
            <li>Being born of Indian decent, I am naturally a hairy guy and always dreaded waxing, shaving or getting laser hair removal treatments.  </li>
            <li>It left my back extremely smooth and lasted about 10-14 days before needing attention again.</li>
            <li>Seems a better product than anything else out there, but be careful if you have any bumpy areas on your back, as you may bleed out.</li>
            <li>Somehow the blade is protected so that it doesn&#x27;t cause any cuts but at the same time it gives such a close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>One thing they cannot do is tack on a detailed review history going back several years for each account they make up.</li>
            <li>Going to get a wax was kind of embarrassing, so now I can shave my back in less than 5 minutes whenever I need it done!  </li>
            <li>People who complain that these blades are expensive--and they are--don&#x27;t value their time very much, or have never paid to get their back waxed.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised how well and close</li>
            <li>Waxing lets the new hair grow in fine, thus less noticeable.</li>
            <li>the blades last a long time and the &amp;#34;bigmouth&amp;#34; is really easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aside from the blade doing a very good job I found the handle length and shape made it pretty easy to get my entire back even with my bad shoulder and slightly gimpy hand right now.</li>
            <li>I had a slight problem with one of the blades when it arrived and they sent me three new blades and a new handle for free with expedited shipping.  </li>
            <li>I just now used it on my back, and it worked exactly as its promoted.</li>
            <li>Stop having your significant other de-fur you.</li>
            <li>My back was pretty hairy</li>
            <li>I would like to see a lesser angle or maybe the option to purchase blades that are set at an angle more away from the handle, but not a big enough issue to cost a star.</li>
            <li>The blade system is nothing more than three safety razor blades packaged next to each other.  </li>
            <li>If you want a demo go out to your car and try your ICE SCRAPER first before you buy this, same results probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Mangroomer for my back grooming needs (the cheaper version when it first came out), and I was set on buying the updated version of the Mangroomer until I came across the BakBlade on Amazon and saw the customer video.</li>
            <li>First, it feels like a back scratcher as it shaves you</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I finally received the product July 23, 2015 delivered by Fedex after the first shipment was lost with USPS.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>all she said was WOW!  </li>
            <li>This product works better at removing back hair than any other method I have tried, with the exception of waxing, which is excruciating.</li>
            <li>After my first go, my girlfriend freaked out and told me to never use this again because it looked like I had hives on my back.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super hairy, but still have fine hairs that show and are unattractive.</li>
            <li>and it works a million times better than an electric razor I used in the past</li>
            <li>more waxings, hair removal products, or other such things.  </li>
            <li>First off let me start off by saying I don&#x27;t have a lot of back hair.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple to use.</li>
            <li>So simple and does exactly as you would hope.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Backspa now, a total of 6 times, since I bought it and have yet to see my first staph infection from it.</li>
            <li>I feel like my younger self again, the real me!</li>
            <li>I have an extremely hairy back (migrated from my head) and have used many products over the years.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at its solid construction and sleek design,  Having been the first time I have seen the product upclose, I inspected the blade attachment and was amazed at the design.  </li>
            <li>Many times I would often resign to letting my back hair stay rather than use these other products.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone wanting to start removing their back hair and to the seasoned.</li>
            <li>I have tried many hair removal products in the past but nothing matches the capability of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy, and hadn&#x27;t shaved my back in over a week.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not excessively hairy, I&#x27;m just being diligent in my concerns about melanoma...</li>
            <li>recently, I&#x27;ve been using one of those electric, two-headed shavers (one side trims, one side &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34;) for a couple years.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I recommend practicing first with the plastic guard on before trying to use it as a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>shave your back and then hop in the shower, clean up floor after your done.&lt;br /&gt;Again, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>The hair is removed in seconds and your back is left feeling clean and</li>
            <li>Expect to make multiple passes over your spine and to clean up your shoulders with a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I do have hair all over my back, and I can see my back clean</li>
            <li>Does it shave the hair down to smooth skin?</li>
            <li>I went to the mirror and fine-tuned a few areas, and in literally 10 minutes the baKblade had done what no other product in 20 years had been able to do.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The bakblade is not only easy and painless to use (and doesn&#x27;t leave a single scratch on you, btw)</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to remove unsightly back hair.</li>
            <li>Not only does it get rid of the hair and give you a nice back scratching at the same time, but it also exfoliates your back.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, I have a very hairy back</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quite frankly I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive products, but none are anywhere nearly as effective as the &amp;#34;bigmouth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update with the quality of the new blades, but just as far as company response, I&#x27;m truly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>took less then 1 min to shave and its really smooth.</li>
            <li>Now it takes less than 5 minutes to maintain a hair free back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original blade is still going strong, seriously this razor is amazing, as I said I use in shower, or directly after while back is still wet, no issues at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original blade is still going strong, seriously this razor is amazing, as I said I use in shower, or directly after while back is still wet, no issues at all.</li>
            <li>the razor works really good,but there&#x27;s a small learning curve to get comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li>been fighting it for pretty much my entire adult life.</li>
            <li>The blade is so wide on the bakblade that it covers alot of skin quickly</li>
            <li>I went at my back after a full winter of growing my back beard and it took about 20 minutes, but I didn&#x27;t have to bother my fiancee for help.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is relatively simple to use, its lightweight, its quick and easy, and is a no brainer as it does not have any complex</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars but that might be low because maybe my expectations were too high, but then again the 5* reviews leave me a bit curious to how people can use the product and be silky smooth, that does not happeb for men with hairy backs.</li>
            <li>Even though it was a major PITA to use and took forever, the results were decent</li>
            <li>This thing is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>--Nair for Men, Veet for women--and they were gross, smelly, and burned if you didn&#x27;t use them the right way, not to mention the fact that I had to look around to find the right kind of thing to apply it with, turn around to see myself in a mirror (and still get it on haphazardly) and then stand in the shower for an inordinate amount of time to get it off.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize I had a rather large skintag on my back until I nearly cut it off with this product!  </li>
            <li>With the new blade on the backSpa I managed the same job in under 2 minutes, and the shave was MUCH closer than with the electric.</li>
            <li>It does a better job dry than wet.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a hairless, smooth back even when shaving dry.</li>
            <li>right out of the package NO assembly required, no batteries,no shave cream needed, use dry.</li>
            <li>I used it on my back and was easy to get the entire back without any help.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a few minutes, I wish shaving my face was as easy and fast.</li>
            <li>Took me 5-10 minutes the very first time to get the entire back done.</li>
            <li>so I can easily groom myself, boost my self-esteem, wear clothing I never wore due to embarrassment, and never have to ask another person to &amp;#34;do my back&amp;#34; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial investment for the shaver itself IS a little pricey, as it is just a handle and a blade (although VERY ergonomic and easy to reach all areas of my back).</li>
            <li>You technically can use it anywhere on your body to get a large area at once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a much bigger guy with a large orangutanesque cheek and mandible.</li>
            <li>The shaver has to be at a certain angle to the skin for it to work properly.</li>
            <li>Works better then anything Ive tried and I can actually shave my whole back in less then 5 minutes now.</li>
            <li>After looking for a solution to keeping my back clean (long term girlfriend</li>
            <li>Pull the handle up and down as if raking, and it shaves the hair cleanly and without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will pull the hair from the blade as this thing cleanly mows down</li>
            <li>I can get to all the tough to reach spots on my own.</li>
            <li>the big handle can get in the way, but with a little manipulation you&#x27;ll be able to find an angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only complaints are the handle could be a little more curved.  </li>
            <li>It allows me to look a little younger, and feel more self confidence.  </li>
            <li>Later last night I started to use the BakBlade and was amazed - the blade cut the hair on my back closely, quickly, and effortlessly!  </li>
            <li>Just to make sure, I have used the baKblade every other day on dry underarms.  </li>
            <li>Works good but hard to reach middle back near spine.</li>
            <li>It really does take the hair completely off and feels a lot like a back scratcher that you&#x27;d get from a souvenir shop.</li>
            <li>Wow, wow, wow.  </li>
            <li>As far as the color goes who really cares, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to carry it in my back pocket but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear as day.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t sampled everything there is on the market but without a doubt this is near perfection.</li>
            <li>I bought the old BackSpa and it worked one time.</li>
            <li>It feels strange but no uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>It feels strange but no uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>how gently a shave my back and shoulders.</li>
            <li>It took me maybe 5 minutes to do my whole back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried razors on a stick, even electric ones I&#x27;ve taped to a handle and Bakblade works faster and easier by far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fast, I ordered a second one for a gift.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me about 25 minutes to do my whole back</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it 3 times wider than your blade (there are 3 straight blades in a row) but</li>
            <li>I have a technical background, and this thing appears to be very well engineered.  </li>
            <li>It shaved much closer than the electric back shaver I have did</li>
            <li>I really recommend this item to shave your back or any part of you</li>
            <li>It feels like a back scratch, but cuts really close to the skin.</li>
            <li>And if you email the company you will hear directly from the owner.</li>
            <li>Wow no shaving cream required..</li>
            <li>Just gently move the safety blade across you back and the hair just falls to the floor.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend likes to inform me that my back is very hairy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised it made it in tact</li>
            <li>Now I can have complete confidence without a shirt on.</li>
            <li>I am VERY thorough about researching products before I buy them, especially when buying online.</li>
            <li>since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would post a video, but am too modest to be on Youtube</li>
            <li>I was stunned and pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>(it works like one of those old barber&#x27;s scissors with the comb/blade).  </li>
            <li>So maybe someone who has sensitive skin may not like the product.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li>As an adult I waxed, had girlfriends shave me, even had a series of laser treatments done which cost thousands.</li>
            <li>Tried several battery powered/electric body hair shaver solutions and this solution/design is soooo much easier and effective...and it doesn&#x27;t need batteries or electricity.</li>
            <li>I can now go to the beach or a pool party without being self conscious.</li>
            <li>I finally feel like I am in control of my baKhair (haha) without relying on anybody else.  </li>
            <li>but like it so far.</li>
            <li>Interested to see how long the blade lasts.</li>
            <li>This is by far the easiest hair removal method I have ever had.</li>
            <li>I will never shave his back again thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>but I really wanted to lose the back hair</li>
            <li>look and so far, it has worked out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that wants to shave their back.</li>
            <li>I was completely blown away.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone who wants a grooming tool for their back.</li>
            <li>I needed some help with shipping and the owner of the company responded in short order and was very helpful</li>
            <li>and I did my whole back about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Electric</li>
            <li>and anywhere it can&#x27;t get directly against the grain.</li>
            <li>not heavy to hold.</li>
            <li>wow -</li>
            <li>This thing is really a god send to me and that is why I took the time to write such a review.</li>
            <li>But wow does this work.</li>
            <li>I finished my whole back in about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives you complete independence.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>Another problem is that while this works very well to painlessly remove hair from your back, and this is my fault, it irritates the skin a lot.  </li>
            <li>if you try it, wait to order the replacement blades (I tried to be proactive, only to spend the money that I didn&#x27;t need to, as I won&#x27;t be using this much if ever again)  </li>
            <li>Before this I had to get my brother to help me trim my back as I am very hairy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m far from Sasquatch level.  </li>
            <li>I pulled and it made a scratching noise and removed the hair completely to the skin.</li>
            <li>but so far it feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can complete the take in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Really works well to rid my back of hair.</li>
            <li>and it takes 10 minutes tops to shave whole back.  </li>
            <li>but there is still nothing that works nearly as well.</li>
            <li>any guy with back hair that wants it gone</li>
            <li>/&gt;Further, I purchased my bakBlade directly from their website.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin,</li>
            <li>However If you&#x27;ve got some real growth back there forget it.</li>
            <li>With my transaction it took nearly three weeks before I got my order.</li>
            <li>Just know that it works VERY well, and that is coming from a guy with no problem growing back hair.</li>
            <li>you cut yourself with this while you are sober..</li>
            <li>can tell you that this is BY FAR the easiest and fastest way</li>
            <li>It is designed as a back razor but the razor can really be used just about anywhere on your body (not face).</li>
            <li>Trimmed whole back in 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Not too surprised.  </li>
            <li>believe he was actually surprised it works so well.  </li>
            <li>funnier is that she showed up 10 minutes early, but I still had time to finish before she arrived.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as the handle goes, it&#x27;s long enough to reach pretty much anywhere</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but so far no issues and did not pull any hairs.  </li>
            <li>It gets dam near as close as waxing without any of the pain...  </li>
            <li>You have a choise to keep everything untrimmed and old school</li>
            <li>As I listed under another person&#x27;s review saying the same thing, the company should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li>I have a very hairy back.</li>
            <li>I shaved my whole back</li>
            <li>I came back to Amazon ready to buy that plastic apparatus again</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>So far I would definitley recommend the product to anyone that asked about it.</li>
            <li>The BakBlade is by far the quickest and easiest product I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I was young</li>
            <li>I got at least 5-6, maybe more (cant remember)</li>
            <li>only problem with the bakblade is that when i look at it i don&#x27;t see thirty-five dollars worth of (chinese?)</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to moisturize your back heavily after usage.</li>
            <li>I sent e-mail to company to ask them to fulfill the order, they promptly respond and sent an extra blade on top of the missing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I sent e-mail to company to ask them to fulfill the order, they promptly respond and sent an extra blade on top of the missing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I took a gamble, even with good reviews I was still skeptical.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but I support guys like these for their good product.</li>
            <li>The hair is more dense and thick in those areas.</li>
            <li>It is a decent back shaver, you will nick yourself if you apply any kid of pressure and if you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Firstly, the blade gets dull too quickly.</li>
            <li>The long sturdy handle made it easy to reach my entire back.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that not only do I have hair all over my back, but most other places on my body as well.  </li>
            <li>i got a clean close shave with little to no trouble or difficulty.  </li>
            <li>None of that occurred, even using this razor totally dry (I did NOT believe the &amp;#34;dry use&amp;#34; claim&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>Blades only last so long, and are expensive to replace (not the best for frequent shavers)  </li>
            <li>i loved the idea of such a wide blade getting an area 3 times larger than a conventional blade...</li>
            <li>/&gt;i managed to get my back and the back of my arms pretty smooth in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Especially when you take in to consideration the fact that no matter how well the competing brands &amp;#34;Handles&amp;#34; are designed, they still only house regular size disposable men&#x27;s razors as compared to the specially designed Wide-Mouth Razor of the BakBlade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can be used without lotion, so no mess.  </li>
            <li>The large blade covers shaves large areas at a time making it a less timely process.</li>
            <li>When I first received I used on dry skin, it worked fine, but I did notice a slight irritation on the areas I had shaved, nothing big</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Bakblade, the product works and the people behind it are fantastic!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: If you have crazy body hair, and are willing to spend the money to get it taken care of, this doesn&#x27;t take too long and is very effective, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s much less than laser removal and the other clinical BS.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, this item is so much better that the electric Mangroomer</li>
            <li>I noticed the product seems to leave pretty deep scratches in my back that stung a bit when getting in to the shower</li>
            <li>So your first thought would be that your back would be left feeling</li>
            <li>Doing it by myself was the main objective</li>
            <li>Takes off back hair, even small skin tags.&lt;br /&gt;Also, get some sun and you will feel better about how you look.</li>
            <li>This is the first back shaver I&#x27;ve used that actually works.</li>
            <li>if a comparable item comes into the market at a lower price point I will defiantly switch I am typically a brand loyal person</li>
            <li>It is simple easy to use with just a little practice.</li>
            <li>and ultimately I will use it much more often than the other methods since it is less time consuming and much easier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to get your back down to the skin smooth</li>
            <li>If you have a hairy back, I highly recommend buying this</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend to anyone with back hair issues.</li>
            <li>My only concern is the cost of replacement blades (and the high shipping cost).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend guys who have a back hair issue to get this product.  </li>
            <li>I can tell you that I am not overly flexible, but the handle of the baKblade is long and strong and made reaching the difficult areas quite easy.  </li>
            <li>My back was so smooth after using that it felt slightly odd wearing a shirt as I could feel the fabric.  </li>
            <li>arrived yesterday, and I had my back smooth in way less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Takes me less than 5 minutes for my back to go from Magilla Gorilla to stubble-free, smooth.</li>
            <li>, I put on a clean shirt and freaked out a little bit by the feeling of the cotton against my bare skin.  </li>
            <li>, I put on a clean shirt and freaked out a little bit by the feeling of the cotton against my bare skin.  </li>
            <li>I have finally been able to tame the beast!</li>
            <li>- you will get minor scratches if you go too fast.  </li>
            <li>It sometimes takes a few swipes, but it looks like I shaved with a cream and razor, which is FAR more than what I expected from this product.</li>
            <li>I have a very muscular contoured back, so where I usually had to apply pressure to a razor on a wire hanger I used to use, this you only need to GLIDE LIGHTLY to get the hair completely off.  </li>
            <li>I have normally been getting my back waxed every 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I have tried many ways of (unsuccessfully) shaving my back, including buying other, more expensive products.</li>
            <li>In only a few minutes my back was completely free of hair!</li>
            <li>This is what I expected the first time.  </li>
            <li>I had to put lotion on to calm it down.</li>
            <li>Actually it looked a little cheap out of the package -</li>
            <li>actually prefer the No No type device, which my girlfriend uses with great success, but it is expensive and I&#x27;m not sure I want my hair permanently removed.</li>

            <li>: Quicker due to larger blade width&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Areas of improvement: Addition of a smaller &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; attachment for detail areas, Articulating handle for precise angle work.</li>
            <li>Chris has already mentioned they are working to release a new model with a second blade to help provide a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After they overnighter me a entire new handle and 2 blades</li>
            <li>Definitely my new back trimmer!!</li>
            <li>The blades are obviously brand new and work trumendously!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I ordered this product, I received an e-mail from the President of the company saying they were about to release the new model in the next couple weeks and</li>
            <li>/&gt;The baKblade is going to be my new tool for clearing my back hair</li>
            <li>Actually, there is new technology allowing one&#x27;s body hair to be transplanted to one&#x27;s head - if I ever go bald, you never know...</li>
            <li>Actually, there is new technology allowing one&#x27;s body hair to be transplanted to one&#x27;s head - if I ever go bald, you never know...</li>
            <li>I am new to doing something about my back hair problem</li>
            <li>I have used the same blade 4 or 5 times and it performs as if it were new.  </li>
            <li>What other product has nearly every positive review indicated as being helpful by \\&quot;X out of X people\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>It takes me less than five minutes to clean up my hairy back.</li>
            <li>Where it used to take me 15-20 minutes to clean up my back with the mangroomer I was done in less than 5 with this product.</li>
            <li>Because the first i one i used for such a long time..</li>
            <li>I will say there is just a tiny bit of stubble you can feel, much like when you use a electric vs. traditional razor.  </li>
            <li>A few days later I received a blade in the mail free of charge.</li>
            <li>It only took me about 10min maybe to do my whole back.</li>
            <li>The jells and lotions can&#x27;t be done alone and the razor-based products take a long time and your back winds up looking like a teenager&#x27;s face the first time he shaves -- ripped to shreds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly hairy guy, and it&#x27;s so creepy to ask a girl friend or family member to shave my back.</li>
            <li>Shaving cuts the hair thick since it doesnt pull the root, so it is more noticeable when it grows back</li>
            <li>I am not new to shaving, but the blade is very abrasive.</li>
            <li>The blade stays a lot more flat when hitting the mid and lower back from the side than it does by attempting to reach all the way down.</li>
            <li>The blade stays a lot more flat when hitting the mid and lower back from the side than it does by attempting to reach all the way down.</li>
            <li>Like it because of ease of use, least expensive and electric, large blade size for greater coverage, and leaves a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Got the Bakblade the first part of this week and gave it a try the other day.</li>
            <li>With Bakblade, I can get a smooth shave and spend only five mins in the shower because the blade is long and not small like your typical razor.</li>
            <li>a little tricky to get along the spine but easy to get the hang of especially if you&#x27;ve been dealing with back hair removal forever like i have.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but it works pretty darn well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled in the past trying to reach all of the back with various razors but could never either reach the very middle along the spine, nor could I remove as much hair as the bakblade to get a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>I have used Nair for Men in the past which works pretty good, but it&#x27;s expensive, messy, and hard to apply to certain areas of one&#x27;s own back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky if I get half of my back done before having to change blades.  </li>
            <li>With how quick this works I feel the blade will last about half a year.  </li>
            <li>The baKblade shaves and cuts better than any other back shaving tool on the market hands down.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing the baKblade AND the extra 2 blades with your initial purchase.</li>
            <li>takes a little practice to get the entire back smooth.</li>
            <li>It only took about 10 minutes to completely clean up my back and arms down to just about my elbows.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was a little overanxious (not to mention my back hair was pretty long)</li>
            <li>With a personal note no less!</li>
            <li>I was shocked because of the great job this shaver did.</li>
            <li>have been using the Mangroomer Pro to clear my back hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to have to have my partner shave my back, and it always felt so awkward; now I can do it completely on my own!</li>
            <li>my back is hairless free no more embarrassment for me</li>
            <li>and there were no cuts, just a clear back.  </li>
            <li>It allows you to reach all the parts of your back without a struggle and it&#x27;s a completely close shave.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well this thing actually works.</li>
            <li>but if you are not careful, it can cut you</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t experience any averse reactions, although I do fear in grown hairs may be inevitable.</li>
            <li>The blade is big enough where you can do your whole back in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>There is no similar product out there as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>So I was back to my old clippers.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to apply to much</li>
            <li>Within minutes of sending a message to them about the damaged product I received a voice mail about an expedited replacement product, returned shipping expenses and a direct call back number!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive back this</li>
            <li>So it got me to thinking:  if this gets the hair on your back without skinning you alive, would it work on your underarms??  </li>
            <li>Only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I barely have to do it once a week.</li>
            <li>This made it easier to find a variety of different solutions for those of us who prefer not to spend their adult lives looking like Sasquatch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nearly all of the postive reviews are written by people who have only written one review...</li>
            <li>no razor bumps or ingrown hairs like when I would use a regular razor, and it is really fast to do my entire (quite hairy) back in the shower.</li>
            <li>I used it to get to the stubborn areas (shoulder blades, mid back) that were normally unreachable.</li>
            <li>It shaves as close as a normal razor and reaches every last spot on your back.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need crazy flexible shoulders or lots of mirrors to do a good job--I have even done it without any mirror</li>
            <li>So the people behind this product are truly top notch with customer service.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that this company has decided to use fake accounts to purchase their own products in order to achieve the \\&quot;Amazon verified purchase\\&quot; tag.</li>
            <li>With just a little bit of force, the blade went right to the skin surface and cut the hair off like I was shearing a sheep.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave with very little effort!  </li>
            <li>And when I say smooth, I actually mean SMOOTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope the company stays around for a long time to come because I can&#x27;t live without this thing..</li>
            <li>My only suggestion would be to include a brush for cleaning the shaver while your shaving, I used a hard bristle brush which worked fine.</li>
            <li>Actually it is kinda funny, because i was going out of town with my girlfriend the other day</li>
            <li>I have tried about 12 other solutions, including electric clippers in a special holder, standard razors with extended handles, holders for regular razors, single flat blade extra wide razors with telescoping handles, creams, and many other types of solutions.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended as a basic and simple shaver that actually works!</li>
            <li>It takes a few tries to get your technique and know the curves or your back, but then it only takes about 10 mins and you have a beach clean ready to go back.  </li>
            <li>due to the teeth on the blades and angle of the blades, so you really can&#x27;t hurt yourself&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth it as I can&#x27;t reach my back with a razor.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work a little better for me dry than wet.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know I (used) to have a skin tag on my back until I got out of the shower after shaving my back and covering my new white towel in a river of blood.</li>
            <li>Shaving my entire 48 year old, heavily forested back was a very simple, and even fun, experience.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a ton of back hair but enough that I&#x27;m self conscious of it.</li>
            <li>I always struggled with shaving my legs seeing I cannot lean forward far enough to shave my entire leg.</li>
            <li>You can complete shaving your back with this product in relatively no time.  </li>
            <li>Also if you are going to shave dry make sure to put after shave on as if you have fairly thick back hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I might need as an old man, sitting in my cold, barren room, to keep me warm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I might need as an old man, sitting in my cold, barren room, to keep me warm.</li>
            <li>Though I appreciate the extension the blade is not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>They are long and very detailed, which I find very hard to believe.  </li>
            <li>and I mean NOTHING has been easier, time-saving or comfortable for eliminating back hair.</li>
            <li>It takes only a few minutes and does the job right</li>
            <li>I did a few swipes and knew right away that this was different.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a razorba in the past (difficult to use) and also developed an extremely good range of motion in my arms from occasionally trying to shave my back with a trimmer or normal</li>
            <li>I said previously this is my first purchase of such a product</li>
            <li>I was happy to see it was working, but sad and shocked I was a lot more hairy than I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a bad purchase, but it&#x27;s kinda flimsy for the money, a few dollars more one of the electric man groomer products might be a better value.</li>
            <li>I have a very hairy back &amp; have tried other shavers,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this anywhere other than your back and shoulders just because the contour of the handle and the blade itself are really just built for reaching those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it clear my gross back in minutes</li>
            <li>i could barely feel it glide on my back</li>
            <li>Not long ago, I dropped it on the bathroom tile and it broke.</li>
            <li>Been in a few hairy chest contests, never took first, but always placed well.</li>
            <li>Same with the second one, in addition to the fact that the blades are so small that you have to keep guessing where you&#x27;re hitting and how it will turn out--and you need to use it in the shower where there&#x27;s no mirror, unless you want to clean hair out of the entire bathroom for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Waxing is painful and a huge process, a long armed buzzer tore my back to shreds, and one time I tried to nair my whole body and almost burnt my nipple right off.</li>
            <li>The BakBlade has continued to work really well, and my shaving time has come down to 5-8 minutes on each go around.</li>
            <li>I promised myself I wouldn&#x27;t waste anymore money on products that claim to be able to clear the hard to reach hair on my back and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>First use caused a little irritation, second use none as the skin got conditioned.</li>
            <li>The bb is the first I have used that actually removes the hair as one would expect, and does so with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was about to purchase the \\&quot;Mantrimmer\\&quot;, that battery operated unit because i&#x27;d read some decent reviews, when i noticed this other product called the baKBlade...</li>
            <li>First of all, I must say, I made quick assumptions by reading wrong reports earlier.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the time it took to get the product, other than that I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend commented on my back hair, which is not dark and thick, but a light blonde color and when dry, it&#x27;s noticeable.</li>
            <li>Blades are soft metal, they don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>I remember when I bought this that I read a couple reviews that stated that it is a poor product because you can cut yourself easily while using</li>
            <li>The video seemed pretty legitimate however, and the guy was just laying waste to the hair on his back.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ll take the blame for it as i tend to be a little over aggressive with new toys to see just how far they&#x27;ll go before breaking themselves or me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He was a little unsure at first, but after using it a few times, really likes it.</li>
            <li>When you shave your upper back, train yourself to use the opposite arm to shave each half of your back, the right arm for the left side of your back and vice versa.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a quick way to rid myself of back hair and hair in hard to reach places and this product did just that.</li>
            <li>Still irritating my back in certain areas but seems to be exactly what the market needed for cleaning up ones back hair.</li>
            <li>With about 30 seconds of &amp;#34;coaching&amp;#34; about the correct amount of pressure and &amp;#34;angle of attack&#x27;, my back is now clean-shaven, and the whole process took less than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i did my whole back in less than 2 or 3 minutes...</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as using the product I definitely recommend doing it dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried trimmers, and regular razors, which are very time consuming and about half the time leave me getting yet another staph</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important that those looking into buying this product know that ALL the 5 star reviews are fake.</li>
            <li>I hope your company is around for a long, long time, because you have a new, regular customer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like getting a back scratch, where at the end, you suddenly have not a single hair on your back..</li>
            <li>Black or red or blue or something would have been much appreciated.</li>
            <li>and you end up missing large areas</li>
            <li>It takes a little time to get used to, but not that much time.  </li>
            <li>however even a little was too much for me, but before I even knew your product existed</li>
            <li>The only negative I have for this product is the price but the alternatives are more expensive or less reliable or a lot more dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, when I first bought the Backspa, there was a slight delay in delivery due to an apparent misstep by the Post Office.  </li>
            <li>But the recent verified purchase reviews were positive and I was unhappy with the original mangroomer that I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>One note, however, I misplaced the paperwork on this item and found it extremely difficult to find on the net without the name of the shaver to buy replacement blades (which aren&#x27;t cheap but worth it) because the razor has no name written on it.  </li>

            <li> The best part is that if you have spots that grow faster than others, you can do quick touch-ups whenever needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t good, it was AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Works great, better than a powered shaver.</li>
            <li> I ended up trying anyway and am pleased to report that it worked great.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased I found this product.  </li>
            <li> Great product and an even better owner.</li>
            <li> Works great, better than everything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Great company and even better customer service.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to see that it worked so well.</li>
            <li> Very safe, never a cut.</li>
            <li> The price point makes it even more attractive.</li>
            <li> Great product, does what it says which many of the products in this field do not.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> And after ONE USE, according to my husband, it was the right decision and &amp;#34;The best invention since sliced bread&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So anyways, I tried this out and after some inventive contortions, I was able to take care of underarm hair and NOT have razor burn!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by the personal, incredibly prompt and helpful response by Matt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product!  </li>
            <li> You can use this on yourself as many times as you want and it will not damage/bleed/cut your skin!  </li>
            <li> and I was able to get every area!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve bought the Bakblade, I&#x27;ve used it, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I truly love this product and hope that they continue to manufacture it!</li>
            <li> I must have had a faulty unit the first time because the replacements did an excellent job.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s sure close!</li>
            <li> I’m sure they’ll be converted into a customer for life, too!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the in emotion of the decade for sure!</li>
            <li> Top notch!</li>
            <li> but after a couple more uses I should be a pro!  </li>
            <li> You will love it !</li>

            <li> This product is simply amazing.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for over a year, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I love a good backscratch.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice, close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a great product!</li>
            <li> I just want to say that I got way more than my money was worth and it&#x27;s one of the best purchases ever.  </li>
            <li> This will be another good review as I have been extremely pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> It really works great!</li>
            <li> While the laser treatment was wonderful, I still had hair that needed to disappear and a much lighter</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m coming close to another grooming, but now can take care of this in the privacy of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep a damp cloth or paper towel handy to wipe the blade off.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the baKBlade, and I&#x27;m thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> i am blown away by how simpleyet effective this is.</li>
            <li> , I took this handy tool out of the package and went to work on my &amp;#34;back-forrest&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> But buying something that works so efficiently and effectively makes you forget about the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You know there are some people complaining that the company is making it&#x27;s own reviews (1-2 star ratings</li>
            <li> really appreciate the customer service and the product is great!</li>
            <li> Just your own flexibility.</li>
            <li> This was cartoonishly effective and I am in shock.</li>
            <li> but I honestly don&#x27;t even care.</li>
            <li> Nice  jobl</li>
            <li> Inventor should get the noble prize for bringing this thing to market.</li>
            <li> I saw it falling to the floor and was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I even tried taping a disposable razor to a stick once to make my own Bakblade</li>
            <li> Gets the job done effectively with no batteries and a fraction of the pain and irritation.</li>
            <li> I also own a man groomer</li>
            <li> It beats Mangroomer (which I also own and have used for YEARS) by a mile.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the recharging types and they are just as effective, but the downfall is that when the battery stops charging you&#x27;ll have to toss it.</li>
            <li> I just have to tell you honestly that this bakBlade works as described.</li>
            <li> , I own the mangroomer</li>
            <li> and I wondered how effective could it be.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, inexpensive, effective, no hassle, done!</li>
            <li> I am excited to try the product, but it looks like a great product for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use on your own</li>
            <li> Very impressed and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and will be ordering more soon…</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have to give full 10 shiny stars to this product!</li>
            <li> I just got the new blade yesterday, it is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I thank you for inventing this wonderful blade and please let me know how I reorder new blades</li>
            <li> Just used my new Bakblade and I was absolutely impressed!  </li>

            <li> Bakblade is by far the best product on the market.</li>
            <li> The thing i like most is it is honestly like shaving with a razor and</li>

            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the baKblade!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I fired my wife much to her happiness!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that I can be more confident now.</li>
            <li> It is the very best product I have ever tried for shaving my own back</li>
            <li> Excellent product, would be nice if extra blades came with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making a great and very much needed product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really great product, and really well done!</li>
            <li> I can shave just fine with no help!</li>
            <li> very light weight too-</li>
            <li> and I doubt that many women enjoy doing it, so when I stumbled across this product and read all of the great reviews I was truly excited and ordered immediately.  </li>
            <li> So easy, so amazing.  </li>
            <li> Easy and effective.  </li>
            <li> So easy and effective.</li>
            <li> It did not hurt at all, was totally easy, and I was able to do it in the privacy of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is great for the quick going to the beach or just to be comfortable taking my shirt off.</li>
            <li> Arrived here in Canada nice and quick, no brokerage charges!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, but i&#x27;d go over and over a patch of hair and still it wouldnt cut it.</li>
            <li> love that i can do it without shaving cream</li>
            <li> I love my Prime membership so sometimes when I don&#x27;t see a product qualifies</li>
            <li> and I am forever glad i did.  </li>
            <li> It feels more like you have used an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It feels more like you have used an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> best back shaver I have used</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, a nice light movement like your trying to scratch an itch and the hair is gone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li> No area u cannot reach and able to use it without anyone else assisting.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Should have better instructions.  </li>
            <li> Does a better job than my girlfriend does with the peanut.</li>
            <li> so if you have more bumps spots then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Pluss custom charges were more than cost of blade</li>
            <li> it more than met my expectations</li>
            <li> Fantastic! ...</li>
            <li> Perfect is the only thing to say about this.</li>
            <li> the reviews seemed convincing, and something about it told me i needed to give it a shot...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having gotten the replacement I was finally able to use it and it worked just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love the Product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Top Notch Seller</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing blade refills so I can enjoy using this for years to come!</li>
            <li> So glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is possibly the best purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li> Love the bak-blade.</li>
            <li> I am not the most limber guy</li>
            <li> so when I need more blades I will be able to buy them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just wish they would market this product better and be at the top of Google searches so that others would know this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad someone thought of this.  </li>
            <li> without having to see what you&#x27;re doing), and it works phenomenally.  </li>
            <li> Get this thing into stores--FAST!), and it works phenomenally.  </li>
            <li> This is the best way to get rid of the hairy ape back!!  </li>
            <li> It seemed like an interesting product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am highly satisfied with the product, and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> You WON&#x27;T regret it. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m still not overly pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love using the bakblade.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, the manufacturing quality is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used razors, Norelco Body Groomer,and my wife&#x27;s favorite waxing,she still says I screamed like a girl .</li>
            <li> Would def buy again, and glad I went ahead and got the refill blades.</li>
            <li> this is that something better.</li>
            <li> Really, really pleased with this product and plan to recommend it to my hairy brethren.</li>
            <li> Except for moles and the like, it feels safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wish the handle were about 2 inches longer, but otherwise I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I just received it today and it worked better than anything I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It will be perfect for when I travel to Maui without my personal shaver (wifey)!</li>
            <li> would give it more stars if I could</li>
            <li> but it was OK and</li>
            <li> It provides the best solution for back hair that I have ever found.</li>
            <li> Yes, many others will tell you to let the blade do the work, and it does do the work.</li>
            <li> But with a more rigid handle the bb would be easier to control and</li>
            <li> more accurate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many methods from face razor to electric, ti waxing and even laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> so you know how many uses this can use.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this product!!</li>
            <li> Would buy again for sure</li>
            <li> would love to see a &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; option on the blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many mysteries in life.  </li>
            <li> It is the real deal and it works great.</li>
            <li> All I can say is THANK YOU. :)</li>
            <li> I am free of her nagging!  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> and I am completely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> As someone who struggles with unwanted hair on my back, this is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy back guy and this thing works great!!</li>
            <li> Bakblade works better than I thought.</li>
            <li> But after trying it, I can truly say it is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> and I was able to mow the lawn in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li> This Bakblade more than exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This experience has been some of the best customer service, company really goes above and beyond to make it customers happy.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> But if I&#x27;m going to have it,  I&#x27;m glad there is bakblade.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to shave in front of a mirror to make sure you get everything.</li>
            <li> If your a wookie like me you will love this.</li>
            <li> Love it. </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li> I have to say this big mouth bakblade is awesome!</li>
            <li> took me more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> The blade quality could be better in the sense of lining up the 3 blades better</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> This is hands-down the best back shaver out there - and I have bought and used them all!  </li>
            <li> Please, if you like spending an hour or more rinsing and doing a inch at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more confident and feel much better about the way I look.  </li>
            <li> Simply the best thing I have ever bought, I want to advertise for this company</li>
            <li> done perfectly with no back hair at all!!</li>
            <li> Much better then the hair trimmer I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic device!</li>
            <li> An outstanding review, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the best back hair remover ever!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li> The product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than the man groomer.</li>
            <li> The blade on this thing is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> It works for sure.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No more than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Infact I have been able to use it immediately after shoulder rotator cuff surgery with my arm in a sling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, the blade in the package was damaged.</li>

            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I feel so much better about myself.  </li>
            <li> Excellent razor back or chest shaving.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Yes I will have to Shave more often than Waxing.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love ordering from bakblade.  </li>
            <li> I stuck to that promise for many years and just dealt with being</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful my experience with baKblade has been.&lt;br /&gt;Believe</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful my experience with baKblade has been.&lt;br /&gt;Believe</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right when I was thinking this would be even better if it was also adapted somehow to use in the shower and walla</li>
            <li> You can take the razor off the handle and just slide it anywhere you want, and like magic the hair is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the seller is top notch.</li>
            <li> I think I could have gotten a couple more, but I was influenced by the guidelines on the packaging.</li>
            <li> Couldnt be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> If you got hair back there, this is the perfect product to remove it without any ones help...</li>
            <li> Excellent if you want to shave your back fur.  </li>
            <li> What a simple, brilliant device!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go to the pool today.  </li>
            <li> Still love the product.</li>
            <li> Great item and works very well.</li>
            <li> Try it you will love it&lt;</li>
            <li> Possibly one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> Comically comes with directions, but if you can&#x27;t figure this out</li>
            <li> But I guess that&#x27;s the magic of it</li>
            <li> it was amazing smooth,</li>
            <li> I love  my bakblade...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Bakblade.  </li>
            <li> This has much more reach</li>
            <li> so you can imagine how much more space you can cover compared to that o</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not yet nicked myself, but the device seems safe in that regard.</li>
            <li> Better system than the Man Groomer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the electric shaver, it takes about 30 minutes and does an OK job with visible but uniform stubble.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is now THE BEST back shaver on the market.</li>
            <li> OK, OK I admit.</li>
            <li> Most might consider it pricey, but I&#x27;ll pay within reason for the time and effort someone has put into a product that does what it claims.</li>
            <li> The customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li> One of my better Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> a satisfied customer!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Much better than the electric shavers that I used to use.</li>
            <li> this is the best back razor they have ever invented I totally love it.</li>
            <li> This worked better and way faster then the Man Groomer - the unit I was using before this one.  </li>
            <li> I am sure I&#x27;ll get better at it as I use it more but AMAZING!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the bakblade to do such an awesome job.</li>
            <li> Keep up the fantastic work!</li>
            <li> I have to say I am very impressed with just how well this back shaver works.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> But if someone enters the market at a much better price point, I will be taking my business there, instead.</li>
            <li> So I have had this shaver for about 3 months and use it and am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> The baKblade is not only painless, it feel absolutely wonderful, like the best back scratch ever.</li>
            <li> I did most of the work without even looking in a mirror, I just had to take a glance toward the end to see what areas needed touch ups.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t email many companies</li>
            <li> Better spending your money on a electric shaver with a body hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve found to get rid of that pesky back hair..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great quality product.</li>
            <li> Need to order more blades.</li>
            <li> I have to say this was way better than using an electric razor.</li>
            <li> but it absolutely works even better than it has been described here!!</li>
            <li> so I was initially very excited about this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so comfortable and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;No shaving cream is required.</li>
            <li> Now about the product itself: It is light weight and very easy to use</li>
            <li> Great product -- Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> works great, easy to use, fast because of the blade size</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this is the best, quickest, and easy back shaving product on the market.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is easy, fast, and, does a great job.  </li>
            <li> It feels like someone is scratching your back and is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases i&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described, saves time, and is fairly priced.</li>
            <li> I loved it after the first use, and I&#x27;m a hairy, hairy man.  </li>
            <li> impressed, they&#x27;ve made a life - long customer.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made in a long time.  </li>
            <li> The mangroomer worked pretty well, but it took forever and caused a good deal of irritation.</li>
            <li> I received a follow up email from the company asking for feedback, and I stated that although I loved the results, I would wait until I had purchased another blade before writing a review, as the first blade had cracked.</li>
            <li> and it still never shaved as good as that first swipe.</li>
            <li> Really quick and effective.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how easy it would be using the Bakblade with both things combined.</li>
            <li> trimmers- pull out more hair than cuts, easily breaks&lt;br /&gt;Extensions</li>
            <li> I have found it best dry without any creams or water.  </li>
            <li> Got it an it amazing and quick..</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE TAKES MINS TO DO LOVE</li>
            <li> show people using the razor on dry skin, I think to use it in the shower is the best way.</li>
            <li> But if you just maintain an angle such that you feel a light scratching it cuts perfectly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with a great company behind it.</li>
            <li> works great and it feel like a nice scratch back</li>
            <li> you guys are awesome, I continue to sing the praises  of this product to all who want a smooth back.</li>
            <li> This was the single best tool I have ever bought!  </li>
            <li> This item is quick, easy and safe to use!</li>
            <li> I am able to get my back shaved quickly and efficiently, and it does an awesome job.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor, I&#x27;ve tried many other products electric and manual</li>

            <li> So handy, quick, and easy.  </li>
            <li> Shockingly easy, quick and effective.  </li>
            <li> This requires no batteries, is light weight, removes more hair and does it easier than the mangroomer ever thought of.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, well made product, and above all the customer service was incredible.  </li>
            <li> I have an incredibly hairy back and this baby did the job like nothing else on the market!!</li>
            <li> nearly 6-months now and am totally happy.  </li>
            <li> For me, their products always arrive early and in great condition.  </li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever been able to do all my own grooming.  </li>
            <li> but I have to say this is the best 50 bucks I&#x27;ve spent on grooming.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the product and new blade and can&#x27;t wait to use it for many more years to come!  </li>
            <li> Best so far that I have come across for removing large areas of hair.  </li>
            <li> no need for shaving cream, takes off most of the hair on the first pass and is very easily to use.  </li>
            <li> And the scratching of this thing on your back feels SO good!  </li>
            <li> Makes a PITA task quick and easy!</li>
            <li> This thing is so cool!</li>
            <li> thing worked great.. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting to see how long the blade lasts but it is the best back shaver ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt better and more confident after the first use.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough GOOD things!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be that easy.  </li>
            <li> Well, it IS that EASY.  </li>
            <li> handle for easy reach</li>

            <li> Well, it IS that EASY.  </li>
            <li> handle for easy reach</li>
            <li> Love this, a product that&#x27;s probably worth a lot more.</li>
            <li> It is easy to nick yourself.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades pop on and off easily.  </li>
            <li> so it comes off easily.</li>

            <li> It is easy to use and takes no time at all.</li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was easy to assemble (insert blade).  </li>
            <li> I would have invented it years ago if it were easy to do that process.  </li>
            <li> It works and its easy...</li>
            <li> I think it would have easily survived shipment.  </li>
            <li> The blade slides on and off easily.</li>

            <li> Works easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> This item is Easy to use and works as described.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just so darn easy.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blades are easy to change.</li>
            <li> So easy, done in minutes.</li>
            <li> I was blown away by how easy it is to use and how well it works.</li>
            <li> the Bakblade.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so easy just to shave it again.</li>
            <li> So easy and works as it should.</li>
            <li> I tried some of the battery operated products out there, but they were not what I hoped they would be, and they broke easily.</li>
            <li> It even feels good to use, like a nice back</li>
            <li> Would be nice to be a bit of a closer shave, but for the time it saves vs. a standard razor and shave gel it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> the blade has a great size but it is not sharp?</li>
            <li> Good product, it works, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Very good, very useful, very practical well-designed item.</li>
            <li> Before a shower it takes just a couple of minutes for me to go from full wookie to Mr. Clean and considering the thickness of my man-pelt, the blades last for an impressive number of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would encourage first time users to use this in the shower as the amount of hair it takes off is amazing.</li>
            <li> First I got to say amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> It is easy, fast, very effective, and it actually feels good to use.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every product on the market, and this is the BEST hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down awesome.  </li>
            <li> This is the best back shaver that I have ever used and is very fast.</li>
            <li> It does a very good job of getting rid of all my back hair and even as a guy that isn&#x27;t very flexible it is still very easy for me to do.  </li>
            <li> - it was light, sturdy, with an easy grip and handle.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a ton of hair and it is really fine, so</li>
            <li> and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> The customer service has been nothing less than impressive.</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; glides smoothly over the skin and easily follows the contours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blade removes hair smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li> It was painless and felt like scraping a fine tooth comb on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so I don&#x27;t get any stubble.  </li>
            <li> All in all it will do just fine.</li>
            <li> It DOES take time to get accustomed to working with back (everything reversed) but no, works pretty good !!!</li>
            <li> , this makes quick work of the task at hand !</li>
            <li> Super smooth!</li>
            <li> The blade is super safe</li>
            <li> will be a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> and I really appreciated his focus on satisfying the customer!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, and also works great as a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> It is fast, effective, and so easy to manage.</li>
            <li> you are special, very very special.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t provide as smooth a surface as waxing or laser removal but for those stray hairs and problem areas it does just fine</li>
            <li> No, doubt the best thing out there if u want to take care of ur hairy back (and for those that have little hair, still great product to buy).</li>
            <li> Just seems like there is a huge markup for injection molded plastic and three safety razor blades.</li>
            <li> Feels great to have a smooth back again.</li>
            <li> so you cannot cut yourself, HUGE razor head</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of work as others have accurately described but it does the job as promised.</li>
            <li> thank you guys for making such a great product....</li>
            <li> Its important to note that I am hairy.  </li>
            <li> Its also quite light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I would raise the price and give free shipping.</li>
            <li> Just a light scratch sensation.</li>
            <li> Its shave is smooth with no pain.</li>
            <li> I went from hairy to smooth and it took 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This one not only works but works great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also great back scratcher to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was easy to clean up after.</li>
            <li> The biggest issue I had was that I&#x27;m fairly fit</li>
            <li> It gets skin smooth just like a razor on your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the results and would recommend it to anyone who needs to do some maintenance on the back.</li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Please see my review for the replacement blades for this product for detailed review.</li>
            <li> I was expecting smooth</li>
            <li> free to use this feedback for review purposes.  </li>
            <li> Though humble in appearance, the tool works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Its a great product that does remove the hair as advertised and I can now groom my back without my wife&#x27;s help.</li>
            <li> but he would send out another razor and free blades.</li>
            <li> Result is not GQ-model smooth, but quite satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> All I can say same great service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am still happy with this simple but great product that others seem to be too picky or too cheap to pay for a simple item.  </li>
            <li> I have been set free from the words &amp;#34;Honey</li>
            <li> It may not be baby-butt smooth</li>
            <li> hair free.</li>
            <li> Close and comfortable</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin looking smooth and hairless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product shaves it so much closer too and no shaving cream needed without any kind of irritation.</li>
            <li> you smooth hairless skin for a while.</li>
            <li> Nice job creating this much needed grooming tool.  </li>
            <li> The concept seems sound......</li>
            <li> My butt is also hair free now.  </li>
            <li> Wish it were available years ago.</li>
            <li> I is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> well and comfortable to use!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> BaKblade is great product for those who have back hair issues.  </li>
            <li> You can use it all the time to just stay smooth.</li>
            <li> Great back shaver.  </li>
            <li> Watch the video that is available today</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap and I can do it myself.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to use; fits my needs.</li>
            <li> to let all know, not only is the product great</li>
            <li> it feels great like scratching your back.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> and it is so smooth.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most useful things I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times with great results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this back shaver about a month ago and I am incredibly happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> My back looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Then the owner contacted me after seeing my complaints and told me the replaceable blades had been improved and offered to send me some free replacements.</li>
            <li> Just smooth skin...</li>
            <li> The blade worked really well and to be honest</li>
            <li> This product is genuinely fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have not been hair free for like 20 ish yrs....</li>
            <li> I had such a great experience with the baKblade &amp;#34;BIGMOUTH&amp;#34; that I had to share.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to bug my wife which makes her happy because after 10 years if maraige she prefers not to have any physical contact with me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light years beyond the Mangroomer in efficiency and ease of use (the handle&#x27;s the perfect length to reach your whole back, shoulders etc.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> However, I still love this shaver and I am learning to be more gentle to reduce scrapes.</li>
            <li> After 3 shaves, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d most like to change right up there with my receding hairline</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wreck right now :-)</li>
            <li> Was debating over mangroomer of baKblade glad I believe made right choice with this 1.</li>
            <li> BakSpa is a simple, but very effective product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product highly recommended</li>
            <li> Smooth, clean shave, quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The razor made clean smooth shave without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> and it looks clean, smooth, and hairless.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy and painless and</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> This was so quick and easy</li>
            <li> I received the blade, and was happy with the result, but the blade developed a crack after the first use.</li>
            <li> you can use Bakblade on your shoulder but a normal one works much better since you have more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy and quick to use, close shave, works from any angle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use and takes almost no time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to use,</li>
            <li> I did lots of research online trying to find the product that would be easy to use, but also worked quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I loved the first shave so much</li>
            <li> This product really works and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Like so many others concerned with good grooming , this little tool does all its supposed to do and more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use making all areas of the back reachable, and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I was completely blown away by how effective and easy this was to do.  </li>
            <li> It is fast, easy and most of all you don&#x27;t have to ask someone to help you.</li>
            <li> This back shaver is amazing!</li>
            <li> 3 times better to be exact.</li>
            <li> just as described, no more help from anyone, works perfectly, buy it, you won&#x27;t forget it</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my husband and it&#x27;s been love at first use.</li>
            <li> Still using the original blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the price of admission!</li>
            <li> I just got home from work at 11pm and checked the mail , and was excited to find my Bakblade.</li>
            <li> Then I got an email from the owner saying the post office can&#x27;t find my original package</li>
            <li> If you can use a back scratcher, you can use the BakBlade successfully.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> just like a fresh shave on the face!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got this.</li>
            <li> Great solution to a long time problem.  </li>
            <li> the blade I am using is still the original one, it has been almost 2 months, I use three times a week</li>
            <li> the blade I am using is still the original one, it has been almost 2 months, I use three times a week</li>
            <li> Buy this thing, It is by far the most useful product of it&#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
            <li> Best thing I bought from Amazon in the past year.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that was because it was my first time.</li>
            <li> Bakblade works fast and easy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new blades work amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Emailed them about it and they quickly remedied the problem by sending out another one, along with a free blade attachment.  </li>
            <li> I get a close, clean shave and have not had any issues.  </li>
            <li> My back is so smooth now, and the product even feels good to use.</li>
            <li> It shears the hair off cleanly and gets your skin feeling just like you used a mens face shaving razor.</li>
            <li> It shaves clean and close, and the guard protects cut cuts.  </li>
            <li> This product is truly one of the most amazing yet simple designs I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best back groomer I have used to date.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best back shaver on the market .</li>
            <li> and I want a clean back/shoulder look.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about wild back hairs peeking out when I wear  t-shirt, it&#x27;s Great!!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy, does a good enough job.  </li>
            <li> works very well, good for almost whole body</li>
            <li> The shoulders were the hardest for me to best angle the blade and get those pesky hairs with several pass throughs, but the learning curve is fast and I imagine it will get even easier and less time consuming over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company before I bought the product and received a prompt reply guaranteeing me that if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product, I&#x27;d get a full refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why so many positive reviews?</li>
            <li> So, originally, I found this product, and thought it sounded like a dream come true, so I started reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> More recently, with concerns about UV exposure and too much time in the sun, it became easier (and, dare I say, trendy!)</li>
            <li> I got 10 uses out of the first generation blades and just ordered the newly redesigned replacements which seem to be just as good, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very comfortable to my skin and it really gets the hair off!&lt;br /&gt;Nuff</li>
            <li> I got this product and used it right away, could not believe how easy it was.</li>
            <li> It takes some work to get some of the angles right, but it does what it promises, and it amazingly easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is especially true when most others did not write any other reviews.</li>
            <li> The President of the company himself made sure that everything was to my satisfaction--he even sent me their new blade to try out--that&#x27;s true customer service!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, will give you a trim but won&#x27;t get certain spots.</li>
            <li> but as ive stated it most certainly gets the job done in record time and removes the hair</li>
            <li> to wear a special &amp;#34;swim shirt&amp;#34; or rash guard at the beach or outdoor pool.</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews here on Amazon and discovered several posts that loved the Bakblade and many others that claimed the positive reviews were skullduggery on the part of the product&#x27;s creator.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a certain kind of man with a specific kind of problem,</li>
            <li> Worked great the first time I used with my back hair grown out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, though watching some guy shave his back is not my idea of a good time, I did familiarize myself with the correct way to use the BakBlade by looking up some videos on Youtube.  </li>
            <li> That way, you&#x27;ll have a good idea as to proper &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, though watching some guy shave his back is not my idea of a good time, I did familiarize myself with the correct way to use the BakBlade by looking up some videos on Youtube.  </li>
            <li> That way, you&#x27;ll have a good idea as to proper &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once it is angled correctly, it works like magic and gets virtually a close shave...not quite but really damn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had imagined a product like this for years, hoping somebody would invent it, and today that dream came true.</li>
            <li> The quality of blades used to be good and one blade would last a while but not anymore.  </li>
            <li> Cool...</li>
            <li> Does a good job reaching every part of my back, I just wish the blades lasted longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, though the bb does not require much pressure to get the job done, the handle needs to be more rigid.</li>
            <li> I think this was a good idea to start with, but now I can use the bakblade regularly with ease.</li>
            <li> and it feels good like a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> It actually feels good to use this product.</li>
            <li> I am going to order more blades ASAP to have at the ready.  </li>
            <li> It actually felt quite good, as the website says.  </li>
            <li> Actually felt good.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I was able to get everywhere without much struggle at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like getting my back scratched, so this thing feels good to use.</li>
            <li> but most times it turns to a jungle and who wants to deal with that?  </li>
            <li> It worked so good on my back shaving all the hair.</li>
            <li> so it just felt REALLY different (in a good way)....</li>
            <li> but it also feels like a good back scratcher.  </li>
            <li> After seeing several demonstration videos, I was immediately sold but did think it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> This requires nothing but replacement blades, at $13 for a pack of two and with a claim of 6-7 uses per blade, it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best product in this category out there hands down!!!</li>
            <li> this thing is fantastic, virtually as close as a razor , easy and fast</li>
            <li> tell all my buddies, and and a few ladies, about the baKblade and how great and easy it is to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s been 100% super professional and courteous.</li>
            <li> If you have unwanted back hair, or even chest hair, this product is incredibly easy to use on your own.  </li>
            <li> Finally an easy way to do it myself that feels like a nice back scratch!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product, it is well designed and works quickly with the wide blade.  </li>
            <li> Result was a smooth shave right to the skin.</li>
            <li> After using the blade on my back, arms, and shoulders, I can honestly say that this product does wonder on removing unwanted body hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty easy to use and swap blades</li>
            <li> Clean cuts, smooth shaves and hot babes.</li>
            <li> Have only used it once so far, but very impressed with just the first use...</li>
            <li> Even if I let it grow back longer than normal in between, it takes like 5-10 minutes on my own, in the shower for absolutely amazing results.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and at first thought, &amp;#34;Oh, no, another cheap plastic gimmick that won&#x27;t deliver any good results.&amp;#34; I continued to unwrap the BakBlade and then immediately gave it a try on my back.</li>
            <li> Customer service was great as there was some hiccups due to an improvement in the model then shipping</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the greatest personal hygiene product ever invented.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks and I&#x27;m going to order the extra blades because this IS the BEST back shaver and my search is over....</li>
            <li> After getting used the scraping sensation caused by the blade on my skin, I watched as the hair quickly came off.  </li>
            <li> quick tips...</li>
            <li> I (or my wife) have been shaving/trimming the damn hair on my back for many, many years now.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does work many times better than a regular razor would.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was pretty sure it was not working, but then I turned and saw a pile of hair on the floor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spoke with the owner, Matt, he responded to my email with 5 minutes (not an exaggeration) and offered to send me two replacement products since deteriorating that quickly appears to have been a manufacturing defect.  </li>
            <li> My adoring partner was so happy, she asked me if I&#x27;d gotten my back</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product for male personal grooming ever!</li>
            <li> I bought replacement blades knowing that I was going to be a life-long, loyal customer.  </li>
            <li> It is simply the best solution without actually getting laser surgery.  </li>
            <li> and my back is nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, before using your product, I would refuse to do anything with my back because I was too embarrassed to get someone to shave it and too cheap to pay someone to do it.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It seems to simple but works great and gets it very close</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly a super product.</li>
            <li> I just use quickly before my shower takes about 2 minutes to go over again and done.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for your quick response.</li>
            <li> I quickly opened the package and examined the product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This really is a super invention.  </li>
            <li> But to my surprise this was by far the easiest and most comfortable system.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that I will recommend to my brothers in my Big, Italian, Hairy Family!</li>
            <li> FINALLY SOMETHING I CAN USE ALL ON MY OWN, it gives a smooth shave like a razor,</li>
            <li> This shaver is not the solution to a perfectly hairless back or the smothest back.</li>
            <li> That said it is easy to use and pretty easy to manuver and clean up most of my back by myslf.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about this shaver when I ordered it, but is very good.  </li>
            <li> baKblade is easy to handle, easy to clean and leaves my back smooth and hairless.  </li>
            <li> The Bakblade feels smooth, like your girlfriend is scratching your back with her nails, very soothing and feels really good.</li>
            <li> I just ordered and used the baKblade last week, and I was very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor, but I have to admit the first time I used it</li>
            <li> There is no pain, it actually feels good like a back scratch and the design is nice</li>
            <li> It actually feels really good, like a nice back scratcher.</li>
            <li> I think my wife loves my new look :)</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know pretty quick what the right angle is for each position from sound feel and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> it works fast, it works easy and it just works.</li>
            <li> Tried to use it again with shorter back hair and could not get it to look as good as the first time.</li>
            <li> of the most satisfying products I have bought in a long time.</li>
            <li> I was able to do the job quick and it&#x27;s easy to use when the back hair starts to return.</li>
            <li> Very ergonomic and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Easy, fast and painless.</li>
            <li> Easy to use , fast , close shave with no pain at all .</li>
            <li> It actually feels pretty good to use.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use and really works.</li>
            <li> There is nothing really fancy about this, but it is very effective at shaving the hair right off your back.  </li>
            <li> but I was very surprised and satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I know this is just a razor, but honestly, works amazingly well, very smart design and incredibly sharp without being dangerous!&lt;br /&gt;Would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> I tested my bakblade out the other day, and I have to say, it is truly amazing!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended seller!!!</li>
            <li> My back has never been this smooth, ever!!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of any product of this sort!</li>
            <li> Only thing keeping me from giving the baKblade another star is that the handle could have more of a curve to it - would make it easier to use if it had another 2-3 degrees of bend!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I also used it on my legs, which are pretty hairy, and the thing just works!</li>
            <li> Make sure you shave in strong short bursts.</li>
            <li> And when it came days later I couldn&#x27;t wait to see if it really worked and was amazed at how easy and effective it was.  </li>
            <li> If you have hair on your back or legs and want to be able to maintain it quickly this is the tool for you!</li>
            <li> It is very good if the hair is Thick.</li>
            <li> I was honestly a little surprised at how perfect it worked.</li>
            <li> The baKblade is easy to use and leaves my back clean with a smooth look and feel.  </li>
            <li> Postal service misplaced shipment GREAT customer service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that the baKblade is not cheap but it works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that the baKblade is not cheap but it works great.</li>
            <li> It saves so much time and is hassel free.</li>
            <li> Product is pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you wont regret it, is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have never written a product review before but this is worth the time.</li>
            <li> It is worth every dollar.  </li>
            <li> If it continues to work like it just did now, the price is worth it</li>
            <li> well worth it...</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Since you are using it without any kind of lubricant on your back it dryes your skin.</li>
            <li> This by far I&#x27;d the most cost effective, quickest and easiest method to remove back hair.</li>
            <li> Shave your own back in minutes while in the shower.</li>
            <li> better than trimmers by far.  </li>
            <li> (maybe the cost went into R&amp;D which was well worth it).</li>
            <li> Further it would be truly nice if the blade angle was user adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This back shaver is worth far more than what it currently sells for!&lt;br /&gt;The genius design, handle, incredible blade, etc.</li>
            <li> your back looks nice.</li>
            <li> Simple but effective shaver</li>
            <li> My partner is thrilled of not having to clip/shave my back.  </li>
            <li> Still worth getting it.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> so well it is worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> Fun.  </li>
            <li> Its worth it.</li>
            <li> Now you can shave your own back carpet by yourself!!!  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only cut myself once using this product, and to be honest</li>
            <li> During methods I had tried before I could feel the blade just gliding over the hair and not actually cutting it.  </li>
            <li> All in all a nice product and kudos to the Chris P., the supplier for following through so diligently.  </li>
            <li> Have to laugh at the results though.....  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He is thrilled to have a method of shaving his back that doesn&#x27;t rely on me or duct tape.</li>
            <li> Sleek simple design, effective and works.  </li>
            <li> Plastic guard is worth it.</li>
            <li> Simple, effective.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> and this really does a much better job and also much faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried regular and electric razors, chemicals, and nothing has been both convenient and effective.</li>
            <li> Best product for getting the back hair and any other unwanted hair out there, dont have to worry about the battery operated ones losing charge, or the blades not cutting anymore.</li>
            <li> I tried the original mangroomer and it pulled more hair out than it actually trimmed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about the other back shavers, but this is the best money I ever spen and the customer service</li>
            <li> Gets the job done easily, seems safe enough and makes for a great back scratcher will you&#x27;re trimming the back 40.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of use and the short time it takes to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> This product is flat out amazing.</li>
            <li> As someone who deals with back hair on a normal basis, this was a shockingly low tech best bet.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t confirm if he is right.</li>
            <li> I received this thing a couple of days before a week-long trip to Cancun and used it right away.</li>
            <li> right out of the picture.</li>
            <li> I opened the package right away, and examined it.  </li>
            <li> Keep adjusting the angle till you get it just right.</li>
            <li> ,  went right into the garage</li>
            <li> Without any hesitation he told me he would ship another one out right away.</li>
            <li> I know right?  </li>
            <li> Added bonus right?  </li>
            <li> Threw my man groomer right in the trash after I got this thing.</li>
            <li> The razor burn is gone now, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it and go right to the beach with your shirt</li>
            <li> The handle is&lt;br /&gt;nice and sturdy and the length is just right.</li>
            <li> Angle it right</li>
            <li> There were some shipping issues, but the company was right there and resolved the problem ASAP.</li>
            <li> Did a great job, the wide blade did the job faster than my wife helping me with the a normal razor or trimmer.</li>
            <li> Unless you are a total super hairy gorilla this still does a great job for people having hair not peach fuzz on the back.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> I hear they are working on some type of way to ensure this can be done, would make the clean up much easier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally post reviews even though I spend 80% of my paycheck on Amazon, but after receiving the bakblade in the mail yesterday I felt compelled to tell everyone how much I now love this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very easy to use and left no marks</li>
            <li> The best back shaver I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> When I tried it I was amazed at how quickly, easily, and painlessly it gave me a perfectly smooth back and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> The thing I love the most is that instead of 30 minutes I can knock out the hair in half the time and be on my way.</li>
            <li> great tool for any man wanting to take care of his own back hair or any hard to reach body hair problem areas.</li>
            <li> It is important to note that you do not get a freshly shaved smooth back from the backSPA.  </li>
            <li> It is important to note that you do not get a freshly shaved smooth back from the backSPA.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing I couldn&#x27;t find any info on the comments here is that the razor is about 1.5 feet long.</li>
            <li> buy pretty much everything on Amazon and rarely write reviews, especially for a product that I really don&#x27;t want everyone in the world to know I&#x27;m using, but I had to write this review for everyone else who is -- as I was -- hesitant because it sounds too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> the large blades make quick work out of this task.  </li>
            <li> I decided to break my promise and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The baKblade shipped quickly and discreetly and within an hour of receiving it I had laid out towels on the floor in front of the large bedroom mirror and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Using exactly as advertised, you scratch your back (or any area you please) in an up and down motion (for best results) and it seems to MELT the hair away!</li>
            <li> the razor blade is simply too small to effectively shave each area because often one has to attack that location from different angles and my arms do not work the right way to come in at these spots from the best vantage point...</li>
            <li> It felt so good to put on a shirt and have it slide down.</li>
            <li> The blade is easy to use with both hands, and switches easily from the &amp;#34;north-south&amp;#34; long grip and choking up on it for &amp;#34;east-west&amp;#34; motion.</li>
            <li> I feel cooler (less hot, not like Fonzie), and I feel cleaner, and even though no one can see, I feel more confident.  </li>
            <li> I feel cooler (less hot, not like Fonzie), and I feel cleaner, and even though no one can see, I feel more confident.  </li>
            <li> to use, a little getting used to arching your body into different positions for best results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely works great and in little time....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uber easy to use, much more so than other alternatives.  </li>
            <li> and they would send me a new one when available.  </li>
            <li> We BOTH noticed that the overall QUALITY of the BakBlade was FAR SUPERIOR to even the &amp;#34;TOP OF THE LINE&amp;#34; shaver(s) offered by competing company(s).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as smooth as waxing or nair obviously but still really smooth.</li>
            <li> It works, its fast, and it feels good--like a nice back scratch.</li>
            <li> I tried the system out in May when I bought them and was really surprised with how easy it works.  </li>
            <li> For me, I have a light amount of hair on my back, but their videos on their website are 100% accurate.</li>
            <li> This is the best back shaver I have ever used and I have tried a few.</li>
            <li> I tried in the shower first, but sound is your best friend here because you can hear the hair being cut, and there is no greater discomfort using it dry as opposed to wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Have used several times with same great results.  </li>
            <li> for closeness, I think you can&#x27;t get any closer even if you use regular razor, I am able to completely remove any signs of stubble with this, and the best part, you can do you entire back, shoulders, arms, etc in minutes (like 2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had ordered extra blades directly form bak blade website(you get three for 12.95, good deal) but the company sent two, I assume in error....</li>
            <li> It really cleans the back nicely.</li>
            <li> I, for one, purchased this shaver awhile back and was extremely happy with the overall results.  </li>
            <li> I experienced no cuts or nicks but the hot water in the shower stung a little bit after I used it (which wasn&#x27;t a problem as it told me the shave was really close).  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive so there was some light scratching and bleeding.</li>
            <li> obsessively read all the reviews, figured there was no way it was as good as it sounded, but plunked down the money for the shaver and extra blades anyway (better to save on shipping costs, right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bakBlade arrived today</li>

            <li> Easy to use, no mess,</li>
            <li> I felt like I was having a very nice back scratch the entire time.</li>
            <li> I have to say that BakBlades Customer Service is VERY fast to respond.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable - no stinging after like using a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> the response time was very fast.</li>
            <li> Matt, I very much like the Bigmouth shaver.</li>
            <li> I have tried other methods (wax, nair, clippers, man groomer) but this is the cleanest, most comfortable, and easiest of all of them.</li>
            <li> For myself though, it was fine, and I was happily surprised that the product, did indeed work.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how quickly this was shipped but even more surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> Its shaped perfectly, works really fast, actually feels pretty good, and you get a crazy close shave.  </li>
            <li> New replacement blades are reasonable, and easy to install.</li>
            <li> If you like a smooth clean back in about 10 minutes with no nicks or cuts, do yourself a favor and buy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, easy, and relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> and you get a pretty close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> You can feel when it is at the proper angle, as you will feel the serrated blade guard just barely touching your skin.  </li>
            <li> though I have some physical inabilities which prevent me from reaching over my shoulders with the handle, my wife was able to use it on me exactly as designed.</li>
            <li> all my years,I&#x27;ve never found a better personal grooming product.  </li>
            <li> Gotta say at first glance</li>
            <li> EXACTLY</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it advertises</li>
            <li> It takes my wife 10 or more minutes to shave my back, I did it in 5 !!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I leave the blade cover on and use it as a back scratchier too! :-)</li>
            <li> They work ok, but leave me with back stubble.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t like hot tubs&amp;#34;, but it was all hogwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is totally different and works better.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says and does it well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the electric one (Mangroomer), but this is easier to use, gets better results and it is quiet.  </li>
            <li> the first time!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel the blades will last more than the prescribed 6-7 shaves.  </li>
            <li> I was definitely hesitate but extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better than having to ask someone to shave your back or nothing at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works exactly as claimed.</li>
            <li> Looked into many diff ways to rid back hair from my kid shaving it{always</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I was amazed.</li>
            <li> The first time it never arrived.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;~ FAST!  </li>
            <li> Tried the baKblade for the first time as soon as I got home from work today.</li>
            <li> Thanks baKblade!</li>
            <li> Very thankful for your service!</li>
            <li> the Bakblade arrived today, I went to the washroom to try out, and it works exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if you notice it looks like a ICE SCRAPER for your car, which is EXACTLY what it is.  </li>
            <li> This might be the first item that i have decided to review .</li>
            <li> This is the first review I am ever leaving.  </li>
            <li> and I used it today for the first time.  </li>
            <li> What you see in the video is representative of the ease of use and stellar results of the BakBlade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about 10-15 minutes on the first go around.</li>
            <li> FUNNY</li>
            <li> The first one fell apart when the blade loosened, and even the replacement blades wouldn&#x27;t stay on well.  </li>
            <li> This thing really works!</li>
            <li> Does your back look more like a sweater?</li>
            <li> this thing plowed through the overgrowth like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> However, no big deal, this thing is magic.</li>
            <li> First-</li>
            <li> If you have hair there it does the job pretty well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> This product does a better job on my back then any electric ever has.</li>
            <li> My direct contact with the company was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This is the first thing I&#x27;ve bought off amazon besides textbooks</li>
            <li> The bb seems to get dulled after only 7 or 8 uses, which is how many times I have used it.</li>
            <li> Actually, I run the blade both ways, but more hair was removed when approached from the side.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually, I run the blade both ways, but more hair was removed when approached from the side.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Bakblade!!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time about a week ago</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain how that bit works exactly...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;d have the proper room to use</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s exactly what I thought</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be as close as your facial razor can do, but it&#x27;s very impressive for a wide fixed blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Thanks again!  </li>
            <li> The bakblade feels like a back scratcher, it is actually enjoyable to use this.</li>
            <li> It really cuts that close!</li>
            <li> believe that this product is a bit over priced and could be more affordable when considering how simple it seems to be</li>
            <li> This thing works exactly as its said to.</li>
            <li> I find just using back and forth motions work better.</li>
            <li> Being it was my first time using it, I&#x27;m sure it will go quicker and easier nex&#x27;t time and will only have stubble maybe to trim.</li>
            <li> GIves you a pretty close shave nex&#x27;t thing to a safety razor shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> okay, I know its gross</li>
            <li> I would love to shoot a commercial for this thing!</li>
            <li> After the first swipe the hair was just smashed to the skin.</li>
            <li> So pretty satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> Order extra blades though because you will eventiall need more.</li>
            <li> I had been embarrassed by my back hair for many years</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for a back shaver product and saw the bakblade, among many others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been recommending it to all of my friends since I first used it.</li>
            <li> Plus no expensive replacement blades to buy.</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday, used it for the first time today...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll gladly spend $30-$60/year to be rid of back hair.</li>
            <li> It just arrived and 5 mins later I was smooth like a hairless cat!  </li>
            <li> I found shaving the lower back was OK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy.  </li>
            <li> It performs exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> First, the instructions say you don&#x27;t need shave cream.</li>
            <li> Overall- love this product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had a couple of skin scrapes.</li>
            <li> my skin may be more sencative from where i havent shaved my back for sevaral years</li>
            <li> Recommend highly!!</li>
            <li> keep maintenance is most likely once or 2x a week.  </li>
            <li> It shipped on the first day and was like I have to wait</li>
            <li> You want to know something funny?  </li>
            <li> I trim my back on a weekly schedule and have yet to use it for more than a month</li>
            <li> When I tried your product for the first time, I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this product works.</li>
            <li> Thanks baKblade!</li>
            <li> works exactly as they said it would.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about having to buy replacement blades all the time, but the blades are well built and my first two lasted 7 months with 1-2 uses per week.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It takes me about 5 - 7 minutes to get the job done; I&#x27;m a pretty hair fellow.</li>
            <li> I got 7 shaves out of my first blade.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a product that got rid of the back hair better than the man groomer.  </li>
            <li> I think it works better than a regular razor</li>
            <li> well sure enough at  2pm it arrives in the mail, and</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time and just didn&#x27;t believe it was working</li>
            <li> Nice and wide</li>
            <li> It feels better than a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> THOSE GIRLY MEN OUT CALIFORNIA WAY, BUT A REAL MAN!</li>
            <li> this thing reaches everywhere on my back and more.</li>
            <li> Although I think it&#x27;s safer than the first two areas</li>
            <li> This first use took me a while</li>
            <li> I tried it first without&lt;br /&gt;shave cream and</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of shavers including the mangroomer</li>
            <li> it arrived yesterday, and I just finished using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was able to shave around my back with ease.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to buy more refill blades.</li>
            <li> I must admit when I first saw the product I was a tad dubious about the claims.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d thrown out the first one after I switched to an electric) and found baKblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d thrown out the first one after I switched to an electric) and found baKblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> which is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I stuck to my only wish.</li>
            <li> After years of many products I think I finally found the solution to my squatchness here.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time ever shaving - wife and kids said get rid of sweatter for Bahamas trip -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy.</li>
            <li> Plus, the company charges you for shipping, which makes the overall purchase even more pricey.</li>
            <li> and I guess I expected that and in my own vanity it truly helps give me confidence now that summer is here.</li>
            <li> I used the item this morning for the first time.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> uses out of the first blade.</li>
            <li> Had more luck using the extra blade by hand.</li>
            <li> Great product with good cutting action.  </li>
            <li> It really works as it says it does!</li>
            <li> I read a few of the good reviews, then I looked at just the negatives.  </li>
            <li> I was a little too scared to try something new but after using it for about six time I believe it has been a great investment.</li>
            <li> It took me more time to vacuum up the hair than it did to remove it.  </li>
            <li> Very useful, takes a little time of getting use to it but overall very nice</li>
            <li> item was: 100% - back hairless, very quick &amp; easy to use, actually felt nice while using (like a back scratcher).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> However, putting baby powder on my back and then shaving with it dry style gives me a great shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;it made for a quick and smooth back shave!</li>
            <li> My BakBlade was a couple days late arriving, so he sent one Fed-Ex for free, to make sure I had one in a timely manner!  </li>
            <li> Finally, this back shaver does not require any shaving cream and you will have a better understand when using at the fact that it actually feels good when shaving is the cherry on the topping.  </li>
            <li> Not only can I keep my back clean but at a fraction of the cost of what it cost to have a relationship partner to shave it!!!  </li>
            <li> I am undecided at this time ive used it once it most certainly does what it says it removed all my back hair.</li>
            <li> This shaver is an amazing find and priced extremely well.</li>
            <li> I do my own full body waxing except for the middle of my back, can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> I can’t thank you enough for sending an extra one just in case the first one was lost for good.</li>
            <li> called me immediately and learning the situation that I did not receive due to USPS delay, he did a priority fedex at his own cost and did not charge me for the additional product as he wanted me to have the product and try it</li>
            <li> Still had some hard to reach places but this is the best thing I&#x27;ve used to shave without using a actual razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other methods, and definitely there is no other best shave like the Bakblade....</li>
            <li> Seriously, it works great.</li>
            <li> and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at how effective the bakblade is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One method I&#x27;ve got with great results was take a shower and dry off and use it then, much like shaving your facial hair.</li>
            <li> sincerely appreciated the extra effort which is lacking from all too many retailers this day and age.  </li>
            <li> This item is designed very well, I was able to reach every area on my back and take care of everything within 5 minutes by myself with a hand mirror.</li>
            <li> To me though, it&#x27;s worth it because my back is so smooth.</li>
            <li> I was first made aware of this product via [...] and being very hairy</li>
            <li> You just need to make sure you do your whole back which is no fault of the product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone that wants to keep a clean back as the blade is incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no, pain, no razor burn, and most importantly no more hair.</li>
            <li> My expectations were neutral when I ordered this, though I was encouraged by the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews and became convinced this product was my answer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it or have anything but positive feedback.</li>
            <li> Not only is it very easy to use, but it takes no time at all to clean up the whole back.</li>
            <li> clothes feel SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE without back hair, (it also does the tops of shoulder blades, lower back, etc..</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I started using the product in September, using it about once every 2 weeks, and now I&#x27;m ready to replace the blade for the first time (over 2.5 to 3 months time).</li>
            <li> and it only takes a minute (two at the most) to keep my back and shoulders hair free.  </li>
            <li> pretty much resigned myself to being one of those people always wearing a t-shirt in the pool or at the beach -- in the water or out.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy, quick, clean and simple straight out the package...</li>
            <li> The blade is very wide which overall is great, but a couple passes are needed to get it all off in certain spots.</li>
            <li> So I am a 42 year old, mildly back-hairy guy, and generally have been contending with back hair getting more and more dense starting around 28 and covering more of my back and thicker as the years tick by.</li>
            <li> Very quick, comfortable and MUCH closer shave than any other electronic razor I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> It cuts extremely close, leaving your back nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> If you have back hair and want an easy way to remove it..</li>
            <li> It was so easy to get all angles of my back.</li>
            <li> Hairs get caught between the teeth and make it less effective until you wipe them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i feltmy back to ind smooth with my first time shaving it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use (probably even easier for someone younger than me!)</li>
            <li> Easy to get all spots on my back.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the back shaving products available and after first use this one is the winner for a bunch of reasons.</li>
            <li> Your product makes it so easy to maintain my back.</li>
            <li> find that dry shaving gets better results too.</li>
            <li> Makes something I always dreaded simple &amp; easy.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER DUPER HYPER sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It took about 10-15 minutes this first time, but my back is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s rear end.</li>
            <li> and I only use in the shower and the blade is still going strong....</li>
            <li> and I only use in the shower and the blade is still going strong....</li>
            <li> All were a &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;, because, I needed assistance to reach certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The large blade and forgiving comb on the blade allow you to give yourself a faster and closer shave than the the alternative.</li>
            <li> If you have an extremly large amount of hair I can see the intial use clogging the blade, however keep up at it and no problems.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit tricky to get to certain areas, like the center-mid-back, or center-low-back, but with some manuvering I always manage to get where I need to go.</li>
            <li> so I cannot speak for large amount of hair growth</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use it in the shower it will help to have a large mirror.</li>
            <li> First time I have been able to completely remove my back hair by myself.</li>
            <li> After receiving the package, he replied that he was very surprised at what was in the package his mom had sent but that it worked really well, worth the money, no complaints - and he is very particular about things.</li>
            <li> Buy this product it really works and its easy to get to areas of your back.</li>
            <li> The product was extremely easy to use, thanks to the owner Matt emailing me some basic tips on how to use the baKBlade.</li>
            <li> I stood in the mirror grinning like a fool at the results, I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy and fast Bakblade took care of my back hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who hates their back hair and wants an easy way to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> This product is easy, painless, fast, chemical-free and reaches all the parts of my back.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest guys, nobody really likes to ask their wife/girlfriend or significant other to shave their back</li>
            <li> Lol wipes that back hair off with a single swipe!!!!</li>
            <li> I just rub lotion on my back and it feels fine in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> If you keep up with shaving your back on a regular basis, this takes less than 2-3 minutes and does a perfect job.  </li>
            <li> Like most of the reviewers here, I am pretty hairy and a lot of other products have not lived up to their expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have fairly fine hair on my back and this took care of it</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as close as a razor but for the back it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and I&#x27;m able to reach my entire back!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Much, much wider than a blade you would use for your face, so makes removing hair in the large area very quick&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great for the little hair I do have on my back.</li>
            <li> We, men, finally have a product that can help with the back hair issue, and being a gay man, it&#x27;s nice to finally have one that works.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I immediately used it, and nicked myself a few times, but it felt good to not have those little hairs bugging me.</li>
            <li> I really only have a couple trouble ares, but could never reach those spots with the electric body groomers I had purchased, this product has great reach/coverage.</li>
            <li> finds back hair attractive guys, so pay the $37 and be free from public shame at a cost that is next to nothing when you think about the savings over waxing (and embarrassment for requesting the back wax!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not a false claim  3.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week before the shower and my back stays looking smooth and sleek for the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He immediately sent me another shaver and included a free second replacement blade.  </li>
            <li> my back was smooth.  </li>
            <li> very appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i can feel my t-shirt against my smooth back.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> no tired arms&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> no tired arms&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> and my back was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> I thought it was too much money for this product.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  </li>
            <li> BUT REALLY</li>
            <li> It is the real deal.</li>
            <li> which is very hairy and with the learning curve.  </li>
            <li> This thing really works.  </li>
            <li> I does not get the back smooth like a razor will.</li>
            <li> and i was stunned how much hair it raked up...</li>
            <li> I have determined it was a shipping issue as the blades look very sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I learned that going too fast caused that.</li>
            <li> My back is now as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Feels like a back scratcher and leaves you smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> I was using the mangroomer and that would not get very close.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too much hair</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> haha  </li>
            <li> The blade seems to be at a very steep arc toward the handle.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I am a fan of the bIGblade and thanks for listening.</li>
            <li> It works really well though.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Also works much quicker than the Mangroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product I do believe my girlfriend</li>
            <li> and I will both be much happier.</li>
            <li> Really close shave</li>
            <li> Smooth back, no helper, no lube...?</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> How much hair does he have to shave?</li>
            <li> The BakBlade works as advertised in the fact that it feels like you are using a back scratcher but the end result is a back that is smooth and hair free.</li>
            <li> Amazon really needs to address this because what this guy is doing is a scam.</li>
            <li> Thanks MATT, if that is your real name, for everything you didn&#x27;t do when you scammed me.</li>
            <li> and if you apply too much pressure you can still cut yourself even with the guard.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to buy this</li>
            <li> Thanks for having this out there.  </li>
            <li> I agreed, and he promptly let me know when it was ready and communicated the shipping/tracking info as well.  </li>
            <li> Very thankful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, painless (actually stimulating, like a nice back rub) and gets the hair off immediately.  </li>
            <li> He showed a demonstration on a friend, since he, himself, did not have much hair to trim.</li>
            <li> works better than expected.</li>
            <li> My back is now smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> but we will see if it really becomes a hassle.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very affordable</li>
            <li> and it really cuts the hair close.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin completely smooth with no stubble at all and it only took me about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> THANKS BAKBLADE</li>
            <li> seemed like a real extravagance</li>
            <li> But this works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The replacement blades are $13 for 2, I really would rather not be spending that kind of money every time I started to turn back into a grizzly, I&#x27;d just as soon have someone use my clippers and take the extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have any doubts lay them aside, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making a product that works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I have tried several other back shaving products and this one is the best by far!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> It takes the hair off much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> Thanks for creating this product.  </li>
            <li> very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> If you shave it and use it like a back scratcher you&#x27;ll get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> My whole life body hair grooming has been a thing.</li>
            <li> The DE blades are not user replaceable as the whole thing is glued shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> The baKBlade is the real deal.</li>
            <li> So much faster and easier than anything electric.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended indeed!</li>
            <li> Still, for what it delivers I&#x27;m very please with the product.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe the results and you won&#x27;t believe how fast this thing will&lt;br</li>
            <li> my back was smooth.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close, no shaving cream needed.  </li>
            <li> Wolf hairs for real.</li>
            <li> cost was much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much baKblade.</li>
            <li> Very prompt.  </li>
            <li> and it felt like I was scraping my skin leaving the area very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;Especially between the shoulder blades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really, think of it as scratching an itch that keeps moving.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s not so comfortable even with shorter back hair.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like being as hairy as I am.  </li>
            <li> Thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this on my back, which is lightly hair as I maintain it often.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I realized just a light touch will do and have had a smooth back shave since then.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> works very well.  </li>
            <li> Great product, somewhat irritating to the skin, but goes away in a day.</li>
            <li> I was ready to go to a pool party in no time.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say, except it really does work.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Guys!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL BUILT</li>
            <li> This is much easier (and cheaper).  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Use a very creamy soap as a lubricant while using this product.</li>
            <li> Not only was the hair gone, but my skin was completely smooth.  </li>
            <li> Not only was the hair gone, but my skin was completely smooth.  </li>
            <li> It works really, really well.  </li>
            <li> The size makes it fast too.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Really does the job as shown and advertised.  </li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> If they come out with a 2.0 a notchable handle (like the mangroomer&#x27;s) would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I really like that I can use this product in the shower.</li>
            <li> your very hairy like me ...</li>
            <li> but every time it leaves my back smooth and hair-free.  </li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> It works fast.</li>
            <li> While I can understand this for the handle, i really wish the blades weren&#x27;t that way.</li>
            <li> Does it really cost 5.95 to ship blades?</li>
            <li> but it is also MUCH faster than Mangroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can have a smooth back in just a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks, Mike</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Incredibly better than expected.</li>
            <li> This is not going to give you a smooth shave like your facial razor.</li>
            <li> Really recomend this for somebody that has nobody to give a hand.</li>
            <li> An absolute must buy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very recommended for hairy people.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I had every doubt in the world spending this freaking much for a flimsy piece of plastic with a blade; and now I am sold.</li>
            <li> My skin was so smooth that I couldn&#x27;t even tell that I have back hair.</li>
            <li> and with no cuts or even really any scratches.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this product is for real.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets the hair off really well, but I am suffering now.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very time consuming process.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice big clean shave in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> My first time using it took only about 4 minutes to remove all of my hair which was in full growth pattern.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product, very much worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I do, however, believe the product works best with people with thin back hair like me.</li>
            <li> I dream of being able to take off my shirt without young children running away screaming or worrying about making the next issue of the Sasquatch newsletter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it has a wide blade to cover more surface area.</li>
            <li> Especially if it&#x27;s the kind that only grows in one or two areas leaving you to look like a dog with mange.</li>
            <li> BakBlade just felt like a good back scratching and the wide blade</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair or fair skin, this product may irritate your skin without shaving cream or another substance to help the blade glide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young man with a few hairs on my shoulders and back and this works great, very easy to use even when using completely dry.</li>
            <li> bit of advice - this thing is like a hair machete and if you are really hairy (even if you&#x27;re NOT really hairy), put a big towel under your feet, do this outside or have a good vacuum handy because this unit will shear you</li>
            <li> In fact, after using the new BakBlade, I quickly threw my old products away without hesitation!  </li>
            <li> In fact I am confident that every claim made for products online or on TV will certainly not do a thing.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product and WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Beats using cream by far!!!  </li>
            <li> This back blade is easy, quick, and left my back looking smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and was amazed at how quickly this took care of back hair.</li>
            <li> After using my original Mangroomer last week, which just wasn&#x27;t doing anything to trim the light hair on my back, I logged on and discovered the baKblade and had to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> Even as the blade dulls it still removed more then most other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I just used my new bakblade yesterday for the first time.</li>
            <li> I should have got it for my husband a long time ago, he thinks it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have recommended your product to numerous friends and associates and wish you much luck and success with it !  </li>
            <li> But once I got the hang of it, after my first time,  baKblade was easy to use and much neater than any other method.</li>
            <li> As far as the mess, most of the hair clings to the blade, and comes off quickly with a swipe of the finger.</li>
            <li> The length of the handle and angle of the blade head make it very easy to cover the entire back.</li>
            <li> This device is razor sharp but does the job safely.  </li>
            <li> It is not a magic bullet and comes with some setbacks, but is probably the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used to shave my back without having another individual do it for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, but the product I received is top notch!  </li>
            <li> I shave my face every other day, mostly because I&#x27;m rushed every morning, not because I don&#x27;t need to shave.</li>
            <li> Surly it was a safe guys if your suffering like the other and myself get it</li>
            <li> hopefully the blade will last as long as they say, but so far so good</li>
            <li> thinking I would again be wasting money on another back hair removing product that does not work (like the original Mangroomer)...</li>
            <li> Works better than expected!</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the construction seems a bit cheap and the price is high for what you get.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be set for 6 months of clean back shaving.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how clean and efficient the baKBlade was in shearing and cleaning my back.</li>
            <li> Now I use it every week or so to keep my back clean.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a body builder who needs to keep his back, arms and chest clean for competitions, this is going to be the product for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> to do the job (dry, and in the tub for easy cleanup)</li>
            <li> I probably should not have attempted it after a few beers, not one of my most stellar moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product it was about time someone came up with a solution for back shaving, simple and quick shave with no mess or no need of other products to get the job done</li>
            <li> The Bigmouth covers a large area and makes quick work of removing hair from the back region.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past, and this was far and away the best solution I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This item is priced high for a piece of plastic, but, it really does work.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any man who wants to be well groomed.</li>
            <li> does a great job, but it is sharp and back was bleeding from moles being sliced open, needed to be much more careful.</li>
            <li> I have used the baKBlade just 3 times over the last couple of weeks and each time I actually get excited to shave my back because of how good it actually feel using it!</li>
            <li> The supplier promptly refunded my money and recently sent me the new version free of charge.  </li>
            <li> Mine is  a special case where the issue of back hair removal is a tricky.</li>
            <li> A complete back shave was really easy to accomplish in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I wish it was available a long time ago.</li>
            <li> And, as if that wasn&#x27;t enough, Chris also gave me a full refund on my shipping costs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d like to buy the person(s) who invented this handy tool a round of beers!</li>
            <li> First off I should mention that I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This may be true if you&#x27;re using it in the shower and have a constant flow of water on you.</li>
            <li> but the baKBlade is just so effective and by far the easiest way to remove back hair that I sucked it up and ordered it for the second time.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how long the blade will last, but this shaver works great!</li>
            <li> This is a great company and since I&#x27;m only 21, they will have my business for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> The feeling is a good one that I don&#x27;t need to spend extensive time using an electric razor with weird angles to hold to make sure all the hair is gone.</li>
            <li> Use very light, short, back and forth stokes.</li>
            <li> the threads were because it left my skin a little bumpy and it didn&#x27;t and was very pleased at how smooth my back was after using it.</li>
            <li> Seriously worth every penny – it gets very close and smooth, I hated waxing and the breaking out – this makes it so easy to groom.. seriously amazing.</li>
            <li> Be sure you either keep the paperwork or write the razor name down somewhere.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do, it&#x27;s as easy as advertised, and it&#x27;s the smoothest my back has ever been outside of after waxing.  </li>
            <li> NEW!</li>
            <li> NEW!</li>
            <li> The BakBlade is an amazingly simple product but VERY well constructed, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; razors, which cut, get clogged, cause ingrown hairs and razor burn, the BakBlade has Two large blades (about 5&amp;#34; wide&amp;#34; with a serrated blade guard which prevents the blades from clogging-up, while acting like a &amp;#34;rake&amp;#34; of sorts, which causes the hair to clump-up into what my wife would call &amp;#34;hair balls&amp;#34; (like a cat&#x27;s fur).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of razorbas&#x27; over the years, i thought they were fine though i never enjoyed having to go over the same area so many times just to get all the hair...</li>
            <li> Thx Amazon , 1 less job I gotta do :) he loves it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will take less time and effort to maintain.</li>
            <li> I would recommend having your significant other help you out the first time that you use it.  </li>
            <li> Also, the blade is wide and I was able to complete my de-furring within about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It was more costly in embarrassment by NOT having this and continuing with hairy shoulders, upper arms and back.  </li>
            <li> However only because I got extra blades I was able to use it because my blade was broke upon delivery.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think of it and whoever did should be rewarded for coming up with such a great item, but for plastic and common every day blades, which I assume is what inside the cover guard shouldn&#x27;t run that much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> plastic and steel, especially with another eight bucks in shipping and handling -that was neither quick not communicative.  </li>
            <li> I was going to wait because a have a bit of limited mobility in my right shoulder and am just getting over carpal tunnel and trigger finger surgery in my right hand.</li>
            <li> The best &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; appliance for shaving your back, but not perfect.</li>
            <li> i have tried all kinds of back shavers before this only to be wishing for somethijg better.</li>
            <li> This is by far the finest tool available for shaving your back.</li>
            <li> And when you have a hairy back, this is something you almost can never get enough of! :)</li>
            <li> I kinda had to be a contortionist to do even a decent job.</li>
            <li> Decent glide to it.  </li>
            <li> It is fast and easy and the blades last pretty long.</li>
            <li> Quickly took care of my back.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a super hairy back to start out with</li>
            <li> I realized I was going to be one of those lucky dudes who had to shave his back.</li>
            <li> every one of my hairs was being individually yanked out by tiny tweezers, I figured there HAD to be a better way.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little scared when I tried it out because it felt like the blade was catching on my back.</li>
            <li> I had a lot more hair back there than I expected, but it worked and did a pretty close job.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent too much money on other back hair solutions and am very happy I finally came across something that does what it says!</li>
            <li> I cannot fault the product itself as I should have taken more care prior to shaving, but be advised this is essentially 3 straight razer blades in plastic holder with a minor level of protection.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and this company.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to rid themselves of body hair.  </li>

            <li> I would highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> When I was in high school</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades are high $$ though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this to any fellow Sasquatch out there.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, guys.</li>
            <li> All other back shavers are just handles that hold your own razor.</li>
            <li> I always have had a hard time shaving it,but with this it is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that delivers exactly what it promises!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this once but can&#x27;t say enough about how excited I am about how well it worked!</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> but you do have to get a little creative</li>
            <li> Once I opened the pack I went right to work, and in a matter of less than 15 minutes I was able to see my back amidst the hair!</li>
            <li> The product works extremely well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Was amazed at how easy it was to use compared to other products I have used</li>
            <li> The back waxing gave me a nice smooth back but left me with \\&quot;backne\\&quot; and grew back to quick to justify the time and money spent on the service.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really that hairy, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older there seems to be more hair on my back, and I really needed something I could use by myself to take care of it.</li>
            <li> The blades are fantastic and I highly recommend  them for anyone that wants to remove back hair as efficiently as possible.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not nearly as thick in the front...</li>
            <li> Wow does this thing really work.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry and rather happy that you took my advice.</li>
            <li> Just get this, don&#x27;t waste any more time reading reviews or debating what to get.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well and no more having to embarrassingly ask my wife to shave my hairy back!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product when I first saw it, but there were plenty of good reviews</li>
            <li> If you bought this last year and did not like it, give it another chance, well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> It is normally 100 plus here in the summer time and a t-shirt is over kill at this point.  </li>
            <li> And maybe most importantly, no irritation.  </li>
            <li> It was about time that someone came up with such a useful tool.  </li>
            <li> It is the first product for your back that doesnt seem to break and is very durable.</li>
            <li> First product that I use which I can do my whole back myself without calling for my wifes help.</li>
            <li> I used the man groomer along with a normal razor for the parts I could reach for about 3 years</li>
            <li> /&gt;After waiting a few months to see some more reviews and watching some of the YouTube videos out there I decided to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this rate even shaving everyday you may got through 2-3 blades a year at most.</li>
            <li> it is about time a product stand up to the test,I love this product its been a long time comming for myself with the back hair battle...</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time about 2 hours ago and it took about 5 minutes to do my whole back</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste anymore time get the bakblade and start enjoying the summer...</li>
            <li> It is not the ultimate solution but this product work enough and is far better</li>
            <li> Bakblade, simple, straight forward and very affordable!  </li>
            <li> I really like this as I have a pretty hairy back.</li>
            <li> Easy and simple to use I will definitely be buying a few more.  </li>
            <li> The other solid feature of this back shaver is the fact that the blades themselves are nice and wide thus covering more areas at once while shaving.  </li>
            <li> The baKblade is nothing short of awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Maybe they&#x27;ll add a conditioning strip to the blades or a shave lotion applicator attachment to it for those that have super sensitive skin in a future version.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, took care of my back hair and I look forward to using it in the future.</li>
            <li> Handle makes it easy to reach the hard-to-reach middle of the back.</li>
            <li> Ordering the spare blades soon, though I think the original one will last at least 10 more times for me.</li>
            <li> The man groomer sucked and would actually draw blood if you didn&#x27;t hold it right.</li>
            <li> recent trimming option have been asking for help, they never do it right by the way, plastic hanger with a cordless trimmer attatched by rubber bands(works but a pain in the @$$, and now this Bakblade.  </li>
            <li> Get this if you have a problem with a hairy back and want to shave it down on your own, you will be quite surprised!</li>
            <li> Its ergonomic design takes the guess work of where to apply pressure as the razor was built in such a way as to provide both safety, yet effectively allow for shaving coverage (dry is more my preference) in less than 5 minutes whilst at the same time getting a nice soothing back scratch with zero to little irritation.</li>
            <li> hair comes off quickly after a few gliding strokes and can easily reach any spot on the back.</li>
            <li> when I let my chest or legs go too long between shaves, the first time I shave again, I will get some irritation in certain spots.</li>
            <li> , I have never felt smooth after using any other product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who has to deal with this and does not want to ask their significant other or get waxed.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try out the brand new baKblades from BIGblade.</li>
            <li> , the company owner (Chris) sent me the new design yesterday, and it works</li>
            <li> I was told there was a new blade design that was coming out this year</li>
            <li> I live FPO, AE.  </li>
            <li> I have used it 5 times and blade is still like new.</li>
            <li> I will order new blades soon.</li>
            <li> I will need to order a new set.  </li>
            <li> With it, I have a new found independence.</li>
            <li> or if I wanted to receive their new blade which was debuting in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Now is time to get new blades though.</li>
            <li> I contacted baKblade &amp; they shipped me a new blade &amp;</li>
            <li> I also seldom review any product, but in the case of my new Bakblade, as soon as I finished using it, I had to let everyone know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we were set to leave at 2:30pm that day, well all day I was hoping my new Bakblade would come before i had to leave,</li>
            <li> Yesterday I received the new BakBlade in the mail.  </li>
            <li> This is my review of the NEW blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just received my new Bakblade razor.</li>
            <li> It also gets to all of the hard to reach places and is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> guys, now you are not just able to get rid of all those hard to reach back hair, but also you will enjoy shaving it as much as a bear enjoys scratching his back to a tree!</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time and realized right away that it&#x27;s not a total solution for my back hair problem.  </li>
            <li> It took a few minutes to suss out the technique, but once I had it sorted, the Backspa worked great and takes just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Your product left my back smooth.</li>
            <li> First things first, the bakblade works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Being born of Indian decent, I am naturally a hairy guy and always dreaded waxing, shaving or getting laser hair removal treatments.  </li>
            <li> It left my back extremely smooth and lasted about 10-14 days before needing attention again.</li>
            <li> Seems a better product than anything else out there, but be careful if you have any bumpy areas on your back, as you may bleed out.</li>
            <li> Somehow the blade is protected so that it doesn&#x27;t cause any cuts but at the same time it gives such a close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> One thing they cannot do is tack on a detailed review history going back several years for each account they make up.</li>
            <li> Going to get a wax was kind of embarrassing, so now I can shave my back in less than 5 minutes whenever I need it done!  </li>
            <li> People who complain that these blades are expensive--and they are--don&#x27;t value their time very much, or have never paid to get their back waxed.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how well and close</li>
            <li> Waxing lets the new hair grow in fine, thus less noticeable.</li>
            <li> the blades last a long time and the &amp;#34;bigmouth&amp;#34; is really easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aside from the blade doing a very good job I found the handle length and shape made it pretty easy to get my entire back even with my bad shoulder and slightly gimpy hand right now.</li>
            <li> I had a slight problem with one of the blades when it arrived and they sent me three new blades and a new handle for free with expedited shipping.  </li>
            <li> I just now used it on my back, and it worked exactly as its promoted.</li>
            <li> Stop having your significant other de-fur you.</li>
            <li> My back was pretty hairy</li>
            <li> I would like to see a lesser angle or maybe the option to purchase blades that are set at an angle more away from the handle, but not a big enough issue to cost a star.</li>
            <li> The blade system is nothing more than three safety razor blades packaged next to each other.  </li>
            <li> If you want a demo go out to your car and try your ICE SCRAPER first before you buy this, same results probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Mangroomer for my back grooming needs (the cheaper version when it first came out), and I was set on buying the updated version of the Mangroomer until I came across the BakBlade on Amazon and saw the customer video.</li>
            <li> First, it feels like a back scratcher as it shaves you</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I finally received the product July 23, 2015 delivered by Fedex after the first shipment was lost with USPS.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> all she said was WOW!  </li>
            <li> This product works better at removing back hair than any other method I have tried, with the exception of waxing, which is excruciating.</li>
            <li> After my first go, my girlfriend freaked out and told me to never use this again because it looked like I had hives on my back.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super hairy, but still have fine hairs that show and are unattractive.</li>
            <li> and it works a million times better than an electric razor I used in the past</li>
            <li> more waxings, hair removal products, or other such things.  </li>
            <li> First off let me start off by saying I don&#x27;t have a lot of back hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple to use.</li>
            <li> So simple and does exactly as you would hope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Backspa now, a total of 6 times, since I bought it and have yet to see my first staph infection from it.</li>
            <li> I feel like my younger self again, the real me!</li>
            <li> I have an extremely hairy back (migrated from my head) and have used many products over the years.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at its solid construction and sleek design,  Having been the first time I have seen the product upclose, I inspected the blade attachment and was amazed at the design.  </li>
            <li> Many times I would often resign to letting my back hair stay rather than use these other products.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone wanting to start removing their back hair and to the seasoned.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair removal products in the past but nothing matches the capability of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy, and hadn&#x27;t shaved my back in over a week.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not excessively hairy, I&#x27;m just being diligent in my concerns about melanoma...</li>
            <li> recently, I&#x27;ve been using one of those electric, two-headed shavers (one side trims, one side &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34;) for a couple years.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I recommend practicing first with the plastic guard on before trying to use it as a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> shave your back and then hop in the shower, clean up floor after your done.&lt;br /&gt;Again, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The hair is removed in seconds and your back is left feeling clean and</li>
            <li> Expect to make multiple passes over your spine and to clean up your shoulders with a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I do have hair all over my back, and I can see my back clean</li>
            <li> Does it shave the hair down to smooth skin?</li>
            <li> I went to the mirror and fine-tuned a few areas, and in literally 10 minutes the baKblade had done what no other product in 20 years had been able to do.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The bakblade is not only easy and painless to use (and doesn&#x27;t leave a single scratch on you, btw)</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to remove unsightly back hair.</li>
            <li> Not only does it get rid of the hair and give you a nice back scratching at the same time, but it also exfoliates your back.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, I have a very hairy back</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite frankly I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive products, but none are anywhere nearly as effective as the &amp;#34;bigmouth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update with the quality of the new blades, but just as far as company response, I&#x27;m truly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> took less then 1 min to shave and its really smooth.</li>
            <li> Now it takes less than 5 minutes to maintain a hair free back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original blade is still going strong, seriously this razor is amazing, as I said I use in shower, or directly after while back is still wet, no issues at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original blade is still going strong, seriously this razor is amazing, as I said I use in shower, or directly after while back is still wet, no issues at all.</li>
            <li> the razor works really good,but there&#x27;s a small learning curve to get comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li> been fighting it for pretty much my entire adult life.</li>
            <li> The blade is so wide on the bakblade that it covers alot of skin quickly</li>
            <li> I went at my back after a full winter of growing my back beard and it took about 20 minutes, but I didn&#x27;t have to bother my fiancee for help.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is relatively simple to use, its lightweight, its quick and easy, and is a no brainer as it does not have any complex</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars but that might be low because maybe my expectations were too high, but then again the 5* reviews leave me a bit curious to how people can use the product and be silky smooth, that does not happeb for men with hairy backs.</li>
            <li> Even though it was a major PITA to use and took forever, the results were decent</li>
            <li> This thing is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> --Nair for Men, Veet for women--and they were gross, smelly, and burned if you didn&#x27;t use them the right way, not to mention the fact that I had to look around to find the right kind of thing to apply it with, turn around to see myself in a mirror (and still get it on haphazardly) and then stand in the shower for an inordinate amount of time to get it off.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I had a rather large skintag on my back until I nearly cut it off with this product!  </li>
            <li> With the new blade on the backSpa I managed the same job in under 2 minutes, and the shave was MUCH closer than with the electric.</li>
            <li> It does a better job dry than wet.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a hairless, smooth back even when shaving dry.</li>
            <li> right out of the package NO assembly required, no batteries,no shave cream needed, use dry.</li>
            <li> I used it on my back and was easy to get the entire back without any help.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes, I wish shaving my face was as easy and fast.</li>
            <li> Took me 5-10 minutes the very first time to get the entire back done.</li>
            <li> so I can easily groom myself, boost my self-esteem, wear clothing I never wore due to embarrassment, and never have to ask another person to &amp;#34;do my back&amp;#34; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial investment for the shaver itself IS a little pricey, as it is just a handle and a blade (although VERY ergonomic and easy to reach all areas of my back).</li>
            <li> You technically can use it anywhere on your body to get a large area at once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a much bigger guy with a large orangutanesque cheek and mandible.</li>
            <li> The shaver has to be at a certain angle to the skin for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> Works better then anything Ive tried and I can actually shave my whole back in less then 5 minutes now.</li>
            <li> After looking for a solution to keeping my back clean (long term girlfriend</li>
            <li> Pull the handle up and down as if raking, and it shaves the hair cleanly and without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will pull the hair from the blade as this thing cleanly mows down</li>
            <li> I can get to all the tough to reach spots on my own.</li>
            <li> the big handle can get in the way, but with a little manipulation you&#x27;ll be able to find an angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaints are the handle could be a little more curved.  </li>
            <li> It allows me to look a little younger, and feel more self confidence.  </li>
            <li> Later last night I started to use the BakBlade and was amazed - the blade cut the hair on my back closely, quickly, and effortlessly!  </li>
            <li> Just to make sure, I have used the baKblade every other day on dry underarms.  </li>
            <li> Works good but hard to reach middle back near spine.</li>
            <li> It really does take the hair completely off and feels a lot like a back scratcher that you&#x27;d get from a souvenir shop.</li>
            <li> Wow, wow, wow.  </li>
            <li> As far as the color goes who really cares, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to carry it in my back pocket but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear as day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t sampled everything there is on the market but without a doubt this is near perfection.</li>
            <li> I bought the old BackSpa and it worked one time.</li>
            <li> It feels strange but no uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It feels strange but no uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> how gently a shave my back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> It took me maybe 5 minutes to do my whole back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried razors on a stick, even electric ones I&#x27;ve taped to a handle and Bakblade works faster and easier by far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fast, I ordered a second one for a gift.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about 25 minutes to do my whole back</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it 3 times wider than your blade (there are 3 straight blades in a row) but</li>
            <li> I have a technical background, and this thing appears to be very well engineered.  </li>
            <li> It shaved much closer than the electric back shaver I have did</li>
            <li> I really recommend this item to shave your back or any part of you</li>
            <li> It feels like a back scratch, but cuts really close to the skin.</li>
            <li> And if you email the company you will hear directly from the owner.</li>
            <li> Wow no shaving cream required..</li>
            <li> Just gently move the safety blade across you back and the hair just falls to the floor.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes to inform me that my back is very hairy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised it made it in tact</li>
            <li> Now I can have complete confidence without a shirt on.</li>
            <li> I am VERY thorough about researching products before I buy them, especially when buying online.</li>
            <li> since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would post a video, but am too modest to be on Youtube</li>
            <li> I was stunned and pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> (it works like one of those old barber&#x27;s scissors with the comb/blade).  </li>
            <li> So maybe someone who has sensitive skin may not like the product.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li> As an adult I waxed, had girlfriends shave me, even had a series of laser treatments done which cost thousands.</li>
            <li> Tried several battery powered/electric body hair shaver solutions and this solution/design is soooo much easier and effective...and it doesn&#x27;t need batteries or electricity.</li>
            <li> I can now go to the beach or a pool party without being self conscious.</li>
            <li> I finally feel like I am in control of my baKhair (haha) without relying on anybody else.  </li>
            <li> but like it so far.</li>
            <li> Interested to see how long the blade lasts.</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest hair removal method I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I will never shave his back again thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li> but I really wanted to lose the back hair</li>
            <li> look and so far, it has worked out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that wants to shave their back.</li>
            <li> I was completely blown away.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who wants a grooming tool for their back.</li>
            <li> I needed some help with shipping and the owner of the company responded in short order and was very helpful</li>
            <li> and I did my whole back about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Electric</li>
            <li> and anywhere it can&#x27;t get directly against the grain.</li>
            <li> not heavy to hold.</li>
            <li> wow -</li>
            <li> This thing is really a god send to me and that is why I took the time to write such a review.</li>
            <li> But wow does this work.</li>
            <li> I finished my whole back in about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives you complete independence.</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> Another problem is that while this works very well to painlessly remove hair from your back, and this is my fault, it irritates the skin a lot.  </li>
            <li> if you try it, wait to order the replacement blades (I tried to be proactive, only to spend the money that I didn&#x27;t need to, as I won&#x27;t be using this much if ever again)  </li>
            <li> Before this I had to get my brother to help me trim my back as I am very hairy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m far from Sasquatch level.  </li>
            <li> I pulled and it made a scratching noise and removed the hair completely to the skin.</li>
            <li> but so far it feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can complete the take in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Really works well to rid my back of hair.</li>
            <li> and it takes 10 minutes tops to shave whole back.  </li>
            <li> but there is still nothing that works nearly as well.</li>
            <li> any guy with back hair that wants it gone</li>
            <li> /&gt;Further, I purchased my bakBlade directly from their website.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin,</li>
            <li> However If you&#x27;ve got some real growth back there forget it.</li>
            <li> With my transaction it took nearly three weeks before I got my order.</li>
            <li> Just know that it works VERY well, and that is coming from a guy with no problem growing back hair.</li>
            <li> you cut yourself with this while you are sober..</li>
            <li> can tell you that this is BY FAR the easiest and fastest way</li>
            <li> It is designed as a back razor but the razor can really be used just about anywhere on your body (not face).</li>
            <li> Trimmed whole back in 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Not too surprised.  </li>
            <li> believe he was actually surprised it works so well.  </li>
            <li> funnier is that she showed up 10 minutes early, but I still had time to finish before she arrived.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as the handle goes, it&#x27;s long enough to reach pretty much anywhere</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but so far no issues and did not pull any hairs.  </li>
            <li> It gets dam near as close as waxing without any of the pain...  </li>
            <li> You have a choise to keep everything untrimmed and old school</li>
            <li> As I listed under another person&#x27;s review saying the same thing, the company should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> I have a very hairy back.</li>
            <li> I shaved my whole back</li>
            <li> I came back to Amazon ready to buy that plastic apparatus again</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> So far I would definitley recommend the product to anyone that asked about it.</li>
            <li> The BakBlade is by far the quickest and easiest product I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I was young</li>
            <li> I got at least 5-6, maybe more (cant remember)</li>
            <li> only problem with the bakblade is that when i look at it i don&#x27;t see thirty-five dollars worth of (chinese?)</li>
            <li> Also, be sure to moisturize your back heavily after usage.</li>
            <li> I sent e-mail to company to ask them to fulfill the order, they promptly respond and sent an extra blade on top of the missing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I sent e-mail to company to ask them to fulfill the order, they promptly respond and sent an extra blade on top of the missing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I took a gamble, even with good reviews I was still skeptical.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I support guys like these for their good product.</li>
            <li> The hair is more dense and thick in those areas.</li>
            <li> It is a decent back shaver, you will nick yourself if you apply any kid of pressure and if you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Firstly, the blade gets dull too quickly.</li>
            <li> The long sturdy handle made it easy to reach my entire back.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that not only do I have hair all over my back, but most other places on my body as well.  </li>
            <li> i got a clean close shave with little to no trouble or difficulty.  </li>
            <li> None of that occurred, even using this razor totally dry (I did NOT believe the &amp;#34;dry use&amp;#34; claim&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Blades only last so long, and are expensive to replace (not the best for frequent shavers)  </li>
            <li> i loved the idea of such a wide blade getting an area 3 times larger than a conventional blade...</li>
            <li> /&gt;i managed to get my back and the back of my arms pretty smooth in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Especially when you take in to consideration the fact that no matter how well the competing brands &amp;#34;Handles&amp;#34; are designed, they still only house regular size disposable men&#x27;s razors as compared to the specially designed Wide-Mouth Razor of the BakBlade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can be used without lotion, so no mess.  </li>
            <li> The large blade covers shaves large areas at a time making it a less timely process.</li>
            <li> When I first received I used on dry skin, it worked fine, but I did notice a slight irritation on the areas I had shaved, nothing big</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Bakblade, the product works and the people behind it are fantastic!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: If you have crazy body hair, and are willing to spend the money to get it taken care of, this doesn&#x27;t take too long and is very effective, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s much less than laser removal and the other clinical BS.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this item is so much better that the electric Mangroomer</li>
            <li> I noticed the product seems to leave pretty deep scratches in my back that stung a bit when getting in to the shower</li>
            <li> So your first thought would be that your back would be left feeling</li>
            <li> Doing it by myself was the main objective</li>
            <li> Takes off back hair, even small skin tags.&lt;br /&gt;Also, get some sun and you will feel better about how you look.</li>
            <li> This is the first back shaver I&#x27;ve used that actually works.</li>
            <li> if a comparable item comes into the market at a lower price point I will defiantly switch I am typically a brand loyal person</li>
            <li> It is simple easy to use with just a little practice.</li>
            <li> and ultimately I will use it much more often than the other methods since it is less time consuming and much easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to get your back down to the skin smooth</li>
            <li> If you have a hairy back, I highly recommend buying this</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend to anyone with back hair issues.</li>
            <li> My only concern is the cost of replacement blades (and the high shipping cost).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend guys who have a back hair issue to get this product.  </li>
            <li> I can tell you that I am not overly flexible, but the handle of the baKblade is long and strong and made reaching the difficult areas quite easy.  </li>
            <li> My back was so smooth after using that it felt slightly odd wearing a shirt as I could feel the fabric.  </li>
            <li> arrived yesterday, and I had my back smooth in way less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Takes me less than 5 minutes for my back to go from Magilla Gorilla to stubble-free, smooth.</li>
            <li> , I put on a clean shirt and freaked out a little bit by the feeling of the cotton against my bare skin.  </li>
            <li> , I put on a clean shirt and freaked out a little bit by the feeling of the cotton against my bare skin.  </li>
            <li> I have finally been able to tame the beast!</li>
            <li> - you will get minor scratches if you go too fast.  </li>
            <li> It sometimes takes a few swipes, but it looks like I shaved with a cream and razor, which is FAR more than what I expected from this product.</li>
            <li> I have a very muscular contoured back, so where I usually had to apply pressure to a razor on a wire hanger I used to use, this you only need to GLIDE LIGHTLY to get the hair completely off.  </li>
            <li> I have normally been getting my back waxed every 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I have tried many ways of (unsuccessfully) shaving my back, including buying other, more expensive products.</li>
            <li> In only a few minutes my back was completely free of hair!</li>
            <li> This is what I expected the first time.  </li>
            <li> I had to put lotion on to calm it down.</li>
            <li> Actually it looked a little cheap out of the package -</li>
            <li> actually prefer the No No type device, which my girlfriend uses with great success, but it is expensive and I&#x27;m not sure I want my hair permanently removed.</li>

            <li> : Quicker due to larger blade width&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Areas of improvement: Addition of a smaller &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; attachment for detail areas, Articulating handle for precise angle work.</li>
            <li> Chris has already mentioned they are working to release a new model with a second blade to help provide a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After they overnighter me a entire new handle and 2 blades</li>
            <li> Definitely my new back trimmer!!</li>
            <li> The blades are obviously brand new and work trumendously!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I received an e-mail from the President of the company saying they were about to release the new model in the next couple weeks and</li>
            <li> /&gt;The baKblade is going to be my new tool for clearing my back hair</li>
            <li> Actually, there is new technology allowing one&#x27;s body hair to be transplanted to one&#x27;s head - if I ever go bald, you never know...</li>
            <li> Actually, there is new technology allowing one&#x27;s body hair to be transplanted to one&#x27;s head - if I ever go bald, you never know...</li>
            <li> I am new to doing something about my back hair problem</li>
            <li> I have used the same blade 4 or 5 times and it performs as if it were new.  </li>
            <li> What other product has nearly every positive review indicated as being helpful by \\&quot;X out of X people\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> It takes me less than five minutes to clean up my hairy back.</li>
            <li> Where it used to take me 15-20 minutes to clean up my back with the mangroomer I was done in less than 5 with this product.</li>
            <li> Because the first i one i used for such a long time..</li>
            <li> I will say there is just a tiny bit of stubble you can feel, much like when you use a electric vs. traditional razor.  </li>
            <li> A few days later I received a blade in the mail free of charge.</li>
            <li> It only took me about 10min maybe to do my whole back.</li>
            <li> The jells and lotions can&#x27;t be done alone and the razor-based products take a long time and your back winds up looking like a teenager&#x27;s face the first time he shaves -- ripped to shreds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly hairy guy, and it&#x27;s so creepy to ask a girl friend or family member to shave my back.</li>
            <li> Shaving cuts the hair thick since it doesnt pull the root, so it is more noticeable when it grows back</li>
            <li> I am not new to shaving, but the blade is very abrasive.</li>
            <li> The blade stays a lot more flat when hitting the mid and lower back from the side than it does by attempting to reach all the way down.</li>
            <li> The blade stays a lot more flat when hitting the mid and lower back from the side than it does by attempting to reach all the way down.</li>
            <li> Like it because of ease of use, least expensive and electric, large blade size for greater coverage, and leaves a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Got the Bakblade the first part of this week and gave it a try the other day.</li>
            <li> With Bakblade, I can get a smooth shave and spend only five mins in the shower because the blade is long and not small like your typical razor.</li>
            <li> a little tricky to get along the spine but easy to get the hang of especially if you&#x27;ve been dealing with back hair removal forever like i have.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it works pretty darn well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled in the past trying to reach all of the back with various razors but could never either reach the very middle along the spine, nor could I remove as much hair as the bakblade to get a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> I have used Nair for Men in the past which works pretty good, but it&#x27;s expensive, messy, and hard to apply to certain areas of one&#x27;s own back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky if I get half of my back done before having to change blades.  </li>
            <li> With how quick this works I feel the blade will last about half a year.  </li>
            <li> The baKblade shaves and cuts better than any other back shaving tool on the market hands down.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend purchasing the baKblade AND the extra 2 blades with your initial purchase.</li>
            <li> takes a little practice to get the entire back smooth.</li>
            <li> It only took about 10 minutes to completely clean up my back and arms down to just about my elbows.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was a little overanxious (not to mention my back hair was pretty long)</li>
            <li> With a personal note no less!</li>
            <li> I was shocked because of the great job this shaver did.</li>
            <li> have been using the Mangroomer Pro to clear my back hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have to have my partner shave my back, and it always felt so awkward; now I can do it completely on my own!</li>
            <li> my back is hairless free no more embarrassment for me</li>
            <li> and there were no cuts, just a clear back.  </li>
            <li> It allows you to reach all the parts of your back without a struggle and it&#x27;s a completely close shave.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this thing actually works.</li>
            <li> but if you are not careful, it can cut you</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t experience any averse reactions, although I do fear in grown hairs may be inevitable.</li>
            <li> The blade is big enough where you can do your whole back in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> There is no similar product out there as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> So I was back to my old clippers.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to apply to much</li>
            <li> Within minutes of sending a message to them about the damaged product I received a voice mail about an expedited replacement product, returned shipping expenses and a direct call back number!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive back this</li>
            <li> So it got me to thinking:  if this gets the hair on your back without skinning you alive, would it work on your underarms??  </li>
            <li> Only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I barely have to do it once a week.</li>
            <li> This made it easier to find a variety of different solutions for those of us who prefer not to spend their adult lives looking like Sasquatch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nearly all of the postive reviews are written by people who have only written one review...</li>
            <li> no razor bumps or ingrown hairs like when I would use a regular razor, and it is really fast to do my entire (quite hairy) back in the shower.</li>
            <li> I used it to get to the stubborn areas (shoulder blades, mid back) that were normally unreachable.</li>
            <li> It shaves as close as a normal razor and reaches every last spot on your back.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need crazy flexible shoulders or lots of mirrors to do a good job--I have even done it without any mirror</li>
            <li> So the people behind this product are truly top notch with customer service.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that this company has decided to use fake accounts to purchase their own products in order to achieve the \\&quot;Amazon verified purchase\\&quot; tag.</li>
            <li> With just a little bit of force, the blade went right to the skin surface and cut the hair off like I was shearing a sheep.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave with very little effort!  </li>
            <li> And when I say smooth, I actually mean SMOOTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope the company stays around for a long time to come because I can&#x27;t live without this thing..</li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be to include a brush for cleaning the shaver while your shaving, I used a hard bristle brush which worked fine.</li>
            <li> Actually it is kinda funny, because i was going out of town with my girlfriend the other day</li>
            <li> I have tried about 12 other solutions, including electric clippers in a special holder, standard razors with extended handles, holders for regular razors, single flat blade extra wide razors with telescoping handles, creams, and many other types of solutions.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended as a basic and simple shaver that actually works!</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to get your technique and know the curves or your back, but then it only takes about 10 mins and you have a beach clean ready to go back.  </li>
            <li> due to the teeth on the blades and angle of the blades, so you really can&#x27;t hurt yourself&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth it as I can&#x27;t reach my back with a razor.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work a little better for me dry than wet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know I (used) to have a skin tag on my back until I got out of the shower after shaving my back and covering my new white towel in a river of blood.</li>
            <li> Shaving my entire 48 year old, heavily forested back was a very simple, and even fun, experience.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a ton of back hair but enough that I&#x27;m self conscious of it.</li>
            <li> I always struggled with shaving my legs seeing I cannot lean forward far enough to shave my entire leg.</li>
            <li> You can complete shaving your back with this product in relatively no time.  </li>
            <li> Also if you are going to shave dry make sure to put after shave on as if you have fairly thick back hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something I might need as an old man, sitting in my cold, barren room, to keep me warm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something I might need as an old man, sitting in my cold, barren room, to keep me warm.</li>
            <li> Though I appreciate the extension the blade is not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> They are long and very detailed, which I find very hard to believe.  </li>
            <li> and I mean NOTHING has been easier, time-saving or comfortable for eliminating back hair.</li>
            <li> It takes only a few minutes and does the job right</li>
            <li> I did a few swipes and knew right away that this was different.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a razorba in the past (difficult to use) and also developed an extremely good range of motion in my arms from occasionally trying to shave my back with a trimmer or normal</li>
            <li> I said previously this is my first purchase of such a product</li>
            <li> I was happy to see it was working, but sad and shocked I was a lot more hairy than I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a bad purchase, but it&#x27;s kinda flimsy for the money, a few dollars more one of the electric man groomer products might be a better value.</li>
            <li> I have a very hairy back &amp; have tried other shavers,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this anywhere other than your back and shoulders just because the contour of the handle and the blade itself are really just built for reaching those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only does it clear my gross back in minutes</li>
            <li> i could barely feel it glide on my back</li>
            <li> Not long ago, I dropped it on the bathroom tile and it broke.</li>
            <li> Been in a few hairy chest contests, never took first, but always placed well.</li>
            <li> Same with the second one, in addition to the fact that the blades are so small that you have to keep guessing where you&#x27;re hitting and how it will turn out--and you need to use it in the shower where there&#x27;s no mirror, unless you want to clean hair out of the entire bathroom for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waxing is painful and a huge process, a long armed buzzer tore my back to shreds, and one time I tried to nair my whole body and almost burnt my nipple right off.</li>
            <li> The BakBlade has continued to work really well, and my shaving time has come down to 5-8 minutes on each go around.</li>
            <li> I promised myself I wouldn&#x27;t waste anymore money on products that claim to be able to clear the hard to reach hair on my back and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> First use caused a little irritation, second use none as the skin got conditioned.</li>
            <li> The bb is the first I have used that actually removes the hair as one would expect, and does so with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase the \\&quot;Mantrimmer\\&quot;, that battery operated unit because i&#x27;d read some decent reviews, when i noticed this other product called the baKBlade...</li>
            <li> First of all, I must say, I made quick assumptions by reading wrong reports earlier.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the time it took to get the product, other than that I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend commented on my back hair, which is not dark and thick, but a light blonde color and when dry, it&#x27;s noticeable.</li>
            <li> Blades are soft metal, they don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I remember when I bought this that I read a couple reviews that stated that it is a poor product because you can cut yourself easily while using</li>
            <li> The video seemed pretty legitimate however, and the guy was just laying waste to the hair on his back.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ll take the blame for it as i tend to be a little over aggressive with new toys to see just how far they&#x27;ll go before breaking themselves or me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He was a little unsure at first, but after using it a few times, really likes it.</li>
            <li> When you shave your upper back, train yourself to use the opposite arm to shave each half of your back, the right arm for the left side of your back and vice versa.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a quick way to rid myself of back hair and hair in hard to reach places and this product did just that.</li>
            <li> Still irritating my back in certain areas but seems to be exactly what the market needed for cleaning up ones back hair.</li>
            <li> With about 30 seconds of &amp;#34;coaching&amp;#34; about the correct amount of pressure and &amp;#34;angle of attack&#x27;, my back is now clean-shaven, and the whole process took less than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i did my whole back in less than 2 or 3 minutes...</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as using the product I definitely recommend doing it dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried trimmers, and regular razors, which are very time consuming and about half the time leave me getting yet another staph</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important that those looking into buying this product know that ALL the 5 star reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> I hope your company is around for a long, long time, because you have a new, regular customer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting a back scratch, where at the end, you suddenly have not a single hair on your back..</li>
            <li> Black or red or blue or something would have been much appreciated.</li>
            <li> and you end up missing large areas</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get used to, but not that much time.  </li>
            <li> however even a little was too much for me, but before I even knew your product existed</li>
            <li> The only negative I have for this product is the price but the alternatives are more expensive or less reliable or a lot more dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, when I first bought the Backspa, there was a slight delay in delivery due to an apparent misstep by the Post Office.  </li>
            <li> But the recent verified purchase reviews were positive and I was unhappy with the original mangroomer that I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> One note, however, I misplaced the paperwork on this item and found it extremely difficult to find on the net without the name of the shaver to buy replacement blades (which aren&#x27;t cheap but worth it) because the razor has no name written on it.  </li>
            <li> However, it is a little harder to clean after a wet shave.</li>
            <li> As for the product review, not much more that I can say that hasn&#x27;t already been said by the numerous positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> it on dry skin and barely a nick..</li>
            <li> If you do opposite sides, you can keep your back flat and assist the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The arm of the shaver also seems to be long enough to reach the different areas of my back.</li>
            <li> Shipping is a little high</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s faster, the new version even shaves just as close as the razor blade, and I can reach my entire back, just takes a few minutes</li>
            <li> First of all, it came earlier than expected in a plain brown padded envelope by USPS.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t believe there are fake reviews attached to the product, it really speaks for itself and so does the customer first attitude of the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The long handle makes it possible to reach all of my back without straining.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely use this product for as long as I have back hair growing.  </li>
            <li> The handle is long enough as well to get every inch of your back shaved.</li>
            <li> Holding an electric razor to my back just took so long and the vibrations and noise together, for extended periods of time, are enough to annoy any one.</li>
            <li> My back is like a gorilla and this thing took it down to the skin with no issues or wild contortions.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend if you do this in front of the mirror you will have to vacuum up the hair that falls on the floor which is a minor draw back.  </li>
            <li> With all my long, thick back hairs, the first time took only about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> There were very few, but they stated that all the good reviews were fake.  </li>
            <li> I just ran it under hot water and did not press the razor too hard</li>
            <li> It took less than ten minutes to clear the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> and you can literally clear you back of hair in less than one minute.  </li>
            <li> Never use this product on dry skin such as your back.</li>
            <li> Its not bad, it gets the big hairs but hard to get it down to the skin...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked when I saw the Youtube video (search Youtube for: Amazon Seller bakBlade) of the company owner doing multiple reviews and video reviews of his own product claiming he was a customer, posing as different people and that he purchased it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well this product really makes that a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> The device takes almost no time, feels good, is stupid simple, and actually works.</li>
            <li> The most valuable part of this back shaver is the fact that the razors have a teeth barrier that protect the user from cutting oneself while at the same time the hairs fall between the teeth and then get cut.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I was leaving for vacation 5 business days afterthought order</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gauged how long the  blades last..</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my husbands&#x27; back for 25 long years.  </li>
            <li> hair long or short that is growing where I don&#x27;t want</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suggestion - long strokes don&#x27;t work as well as short back-and-forth ones.  </li>
            <li> He was home for Xmas and for some reason we were discussing his long back hairs.</li>
            <li> The baldes and handle are well-made, sturdy, and seem like they will last long.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to know the blade longevity</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5 but have not had it long enough to determine blade longevity....</li>
            <li> Well in middle age I found myself being called monkey boy by my sister while sitting by the pool.</li>
            <li> The long wand made it easier to position the blade in such a way that I saw and felt every hair was gone.</li>
            <li> so when I purchased this product I expected to have minor skin irritation or a breakout during the first few uses-</li>
            <li> The blade holder however is pretty thick</li>
            <li> I went slow at first.</li>
            <li> I have always been a little self conscious of this to the point I didn&#x27;t wear white dress shirts to work unless I had a t-shirt on under.  </li>
            <li> Also got some minor scrapes, that bled worse than they actually were and healed up quickly.</li>
            <li> There can be a slight stubble left in certain areas if you go against the grain, that happens with any razor shave, and it&#x27;s a very small tradeoff for the sheer ease of use and end result that Bakblade offers.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair over my entire back, so the wide blade is a godsend.</li>
            <li> second tip is to shave your lower back, from the mid back and down, from the side.</li>
            <li> few tips for new users:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt the shirt on my back in a very long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My only two criticisms, and they are very minor are 1)</li>
            <li> I prefer to lather up my back to do a lathered shave over a dry shave.</li>
            <li> Makes a job that is time consuming and a hassle to a job that takes less than 1 minute to complete.</li>
            <li> The handle is a soft and slightly flexible plastic.</li>
            <li> I decided to use the dry method only because the video I had seen was made that way.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use shaving cream or anything, just dry, and it felt like my back was being scratched.  </li>
            <li> No worries about a mirror, because the blade&#x27;s wide enough to get a sense of where it&#x27;s covering your back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly I have a minor concern with this product, specifically around the blades and how long they will last with regards to shaving and at rest.  </li>
            <li> The extra wide blade takes off big amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> , she&#x27;s a straight shooter type, she will either love it or hate</li>
            <li> I saw a youtube video demonstrating the BakBlade and after some time of hesitating, I suddenly became single and needed to manscape.</li>
            <li> Instead of single passes going up your back and side to side.</li>
            <li> As long as the blade is kept flat against skin, shouldn&#x27;t experience any cuts.</li>
            <li> once skin is wet, you barely even notice the \\&quot;back scratch\\&quot; sensation that is described in the advertisements, it just slides over skin and removes hair with absolutely no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re wondering about the maintenance costs involved in buying the BakBlade replacement shaver sets (2 for $9.99)-We purchased the BakBlade on July 17th (Received less than a week later) and my husband has used it AT LEAST 7 times and has YET to change the FIRST BLADE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried it wet before (some customers apparently use it in the shower) but considering how well it works dry</li>
            <li> Left no razor burn, I went up and down back and forth like using a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Take it slow and try it dry with no foam or any thing at first.</li>
            <li> What typically would take up to an hour with hair removal creams, razors and an electric razor was completed in about 5 minutes with no mess or smell.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about buying this after not hearing anything about it, but I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> I can go outside without a shirt, wear tank tops, or other low back cut shirt without being feeling like a bear is on the loose.  </li>
            <li> I dealt directly with the owner/CEO regarding a blade that was broken in shipping, and he immediately sent me a new one, and one extra for the inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Once you remove 95% it is difficult to use the baKblade for fine detail areas but two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I have tried other back hair “trimmers” which not only just “trims” the hair</li>
            <li> You can shave wet or dry, and as long as you take care of the baKblade, the blades last several uses.</li>
            <li> its like a very rough back scratcher, I&#x27;ve used it about a dozen times, it only cut me once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other back hair removal products as well as just a normal razor and this blows them away.</li>
            <li> I use it dry &amp; it does a super job, like a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed and you won&#x27;t ever have to suffer the pain, irritation and absolute inconvenience of chemical hair removers again.eeds to keep his back, arms and chest clean for competitions, this is going to be the product for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty self-conscious about back hair and was a little skeptical, but this product really works.</li>
            <li> make sure you arent cold when using it, so</li>
            <li> I have tried several different types with no success until I tried</li>
            <li> I did not wait long and the communication was on</li>
            <li> The angle of the handle and the extra wide blades worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known about this a long time ago;  I would literally stand in shower with cream and plastic rzr and groom.  </li>
            <li> It takes only a few minutes to get my entire back with this.</li>
            <li> Any man that doesn&#x27;t want to let nature take its course and walk around looking like a monkey should get one of these.</li>
            <li> long as they don&#x27;t raise the price beyond reason on the blades, I will be a return customer.</li>
            <li> Been waiting for a product like this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Wish it wouldn&#x27;t have taken me so long to stumble on</li>
            <li> And after using this product, those days are long gone.</li>
            <li> I did not pre shave the area as suggested,and my hair was quite long three plus inches .</li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t let hair get too long.)</li>
            <li> Not only did this tool make short work of the excessive body hair, but left my back smoother than a newborns</li>
            <li> I luckily only have one mole that I can go over with minimal</li>
            <li> The bigmouth simply cuts through hair like butter and the wide blade can de-forest sections in seconds.</li>
            <li> Plus the long handle lets you reach areas you couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought the BakBlade Big Mouth, thinking it was a sham, but somehow in the back of my mind, I was hoping that it would work the same way as in its videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it wasnt too long.</li>
            <li> -&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gonna make you wonder why you waited so long....</li>
            <li> Why did this take so long to be invented?</li>
            <li> i may have to go with a wet or lubricated back shave</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why this took so long to be invented...</li>
            <li> But I did say this BIG &amp; WIDE blade take 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> LETS SEE HOW LONG</li>
            <li> Ive looked for a tool like this for long time.  </li>
            <li> There were red marks on my back a few hours later.  </li>
            <li> minor caveats -</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe someone didn&#x27;t come up with this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> and all took a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> strange?</li>
            <li> My husband is not a really hairy guy, he just has that patch on his lower back.</li>
            <li> It removes unwanted hair with absolutely zero discomfort, no matter how thick the hair may be.</li>
            <li> ack, from the mid back and down, from the side.</li>
            <li> Where the mangroomer was painful, difficult to use, and left short stubble, red marks, and steaks of ungroomed hair, the BaKblade is ACTUALLY painless, easy to use, and gets rid of all hair quickly.</li>
            <li> The other thing is if you have a moderate to heavily muscled back you will need to hit the same spot from different angles to get the hair off.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to cut yourself with these blades and they seem pretty durable.</li>
            <li> It took me less than 5 minutes for entire back.</li>
            <li> It took less than 3 minutes to totally shave all the hair off my back with no water.</li>
            <li> I tried it both dry and wet with same results.</li>
            <li> I mean VERY hairy.</li>
            <li> have tried many products of similar claims, but, have failed short, this at least has worked for me.</li>
            <li> it turns out I can shave my chest, stomach, shoulders, arms, and other places as well with the same speed and efficiency AND without any cuts.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this over any other device is your comparing something similar.</li>
            <li> I ordered the BakBlade for my hubby after researching TONS of other similar products, including one that was the &amp;#34;Best Selling&amp;#34; at the time.</li>
            <li> Can use on back, arms and other areas with efficacy.</li>
            <li> With the other products I used them only once a month or when I was going to the pool.  </li>
            <li> Also, as other viewers already remarked, using the bakblade feels similar to a back-scratching device.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything - chemical removers (ouch), taping a razor to a stick, using the other handle tool from another company (the blue one), and waxing (ouch from pain and cost).  </li>
            <li> The blade is extremely sharp but protected with a guard so there is no possible way i can think of that you could get cut by it.</li>
            <li> Although you can&#x27;t throw away your other razor because you will still need it for your shoulder area as bakblade is too big.</li>
            <li> Unless you like depending on other people to trim/shave your back.</li>
            <li> Other stick items that use a regular razor??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other back shavers and none work as well as this.  </li>
            <li> I often became discouraged at the amount of time it took these other products to cover my back.  </li>
            <li> I shaved my back in 5 minutes with absolutely no shaving cream--it didn&#x27;t hurt at all!</li>
            <li> My personal use shall be limited, and the replacement blades are pretty expensive, so if you&#x27;re shaving your back or unreachables often, this will start to cost you.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this wasn&#x27;t around 10 years ago when I was in college, because I&#x27;d have a few days worth of time and a small fortune back from all of the chemical hair removers I purchased and used over the years, both at local stores and off of internet specialty sites, and I could have avoided a heap of pain and suffering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a couple other back hair removal products that are heavily advertised that left my back cut up or razor burned,  </li>
            <li> At its low retail price, I expected shoddy construction, and I was just planning on using it until it breaks and then get a new one.  </li>
            <li> Dot recommend dry shave with it</li>
            <li> be used dry</li>
            <li> be used dry</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it with water, must be used dry.</li>
            <li> I did it dry, no soap, no cream, not water.</li>
            <li> The baKBlade leaves no scratch marks and works dry</li>
            <li> It shaves closely and does so without causing irritation - and that was with doing a dry shave.  </li>
            <li> I used it dry, and it was a breeze to use.</li>
            <li> It gave a close, dry shave.</li>
            <li> The instructions state that you don&#x27;t need to use cream and can run the razor dry.</li>
            <li> I was using it dry, but there was no pain.  </li>
            <li> I used it dry and</li>
            <li> I did it dry.</li>
            <li> I use it dry</li>
            <li> Every razor I&#x27;ve ever used dry gave me razor burn and even the barber would give me razor burn when they trimmed my neck.</li>
            <li> I chose dry.</li>
            <li> I used it dry</li>
            <li> I shaved it dry</li>
            <li> just ensure you dry it off after use.  </li>
            <li> cant believe how well this works dry with no water</li>
            <li> I tried the Bakblade dry and no irritation or issues.  </li>
            <li> I recommend shaving dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like shaving a topographical map and no matter how much you try to relax, you&#x27;re still sending your arms behind your head which in turn will fire all your back muscles.  </li>
            <li> One key is to shave every few weeks just to remove short hairs.</li>
            <li> Given I don&#x27;t even need to shave my back but every few months, and the fact that the blades are always exposed, I hope they won&#x27;t rust before I get a chance to use them, especially in the humid bathroom</li>
            <li> heavy hair on my back, but enough that I want it gone and</li>
            <li> Far less time than having my wife do it with a conventional sized razor.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get a single scratch.</li>
            <li> I was like you once, wandering the internet in my dark  room, hairy back pressed against the seat cushion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me like 5 minutes to do the entire back, where as before it was at least 30 minutes, and several stops to check the area that I was working on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bb can be used wet or dry, though I prefer dry.</li>
            <li> they either need to come down or it should last loner than the stated 6 uses.</li>
            <li> The blades glide on my back and get the job down without any fuss.</li>
            <li> I probably cut down my back shaving timeframe by 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> given i havent shaved my back for along time but in the past i have with just a regular razor and had no iritation and shaved it dry as well.</li>
            <li> I used mine in the mirror and that took some getting used to, even so it took very little time to shave my entire back.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, but surprising to see a small bit of blood on my t-shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let skin dry,  take your bakblade and go to work!  </li>
            <li> The only reason it is not 5 stars is because it can leave a slight stubble.  </li>
            <li> You simply drag it along your dry skin and the hair shaves off.  </li>
            <li> You simply drag it along your dry skin and the hair shaves off.  </li>
            <li> Previously I had been using the Mangroomer, but that&#x27;s a different review.</li>
            <li> Less time than an electric back shaver that shall not be mentioned</li>
            <li> I have used it both dry and wet</li>
            <li> Even if I have to use this twice per week, it still takes 90% less time than a back wax...plus it already paid for itself and</li>
            <li> and I thought &#x27;hey let me try it out on a small patch of my back and do the rest later at night&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Removes all hair painlessly, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> but it does work on wet or dry surfaces.</li>
            <li> They say you can use it dry or wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way easier than going to the saloon to have a back waxing, costs less, no pain and cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I got a slight irritation because I literally used it as a back scratcher and continued to scratch after the hair was gone.</li>
            <li> The man groomer took me a half an hour to shave my back</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I saw a youtube video making the same claims about the baKblade, and at first I dismissed it as being as useless as any of the others.  </li>
            <li> He has &amp;#34;engineered&amp;#34; several gadgets over the years, duct tape and a back scratcher were usually involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I still do prefer the dry shave compared to the wet skin I tested.</li>
            <li> My back was not even slightly irritated.</li>
            <li> The back seems less prone to irritation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who this person is that says it doesn&#x27;t work, but he is wrong... unless his back hair like super super thick.... I mean, my back hair was dark and all over the place -- the shoulders all the way down...  </li>
            <li> The minor curve that it does have made it difficult to shave certain contours of my back, though I eventually managed.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it much easier to shave my ENTIRE back, but I also did it in less than half the time I usually do (and without pulling my shoulder muscles getting the REALLy hard to reach places).  </li>
            <li> The design even catches some of the hair if you are shaving from above which helps to minimize the mess.  </li>
            <li> The design even catches some of the hair if you are shaving from above which helps to minimize the mess.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long it will stay sharp but for the price</li>
            <li> : dead, dry skin will come off while you shave your back.</li>
            <li> Considering how much money I&#x27;ve spent on useless products in the past I don&#x27;t really have any ground to complain.</li>
            <li> If you got a little peach fuzz on your back this will might work for you.</li>
            <li> Works well takes a little practice to see which direction to pull across your back but doesn&#x27;t cut your skin just the hair!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about not using any shaving cream and the possible skin irritation.</li>
            <li> the unit is so easy to use is silly!</li>
            <li> Electric shavers that are impossible to use at the right angle ( and only partially work on already short hair).</li>
            <li> But i take inot consideration the fact of getting use to using it not pressing to hard andand getting it in the proper position after all shaving your back yourself</li>
            <li> I made sure I read all the bad reviews, including the 1 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;YOU</li>
            <li> yes it does use 3 safety blades, but I have used it at least 10 times so far without replacement blades until now.</li>
            <li> (Use was for a few errant hairs on my back - hairs</li>
            <li> , it would be to carefully stand in your bath tub or shower, COVER THE DRAIN, and that way, you&#x27;ll have all the shaved-off hair contained in one place for vacuuming or sweeping-</li>

            <li> It only takes Judy a few minutes &amp; ur done.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making this product, I&#x27;ll certainly be a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> One blade lasts me before it dulls about 4-5 weeks of shaving 1-2 times a week.  </li>
            <li> a few passes along my back</li>
            <li> wasted my money on two, yes two battery with extended handle back shavers that did not work.</li>
            <li> Electric &amp; battery back shavers were waste of money &amp; time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have tried foams (messy, time-consuming, and takes another person to get all the stuff off), an electric razor (didn&#x27;t get close at all), a hinged bladed thing (wouldn&#x27;t stay bent in one position), and even duct-taping an actual razor to a stick!  </li>
            <li> I was wary of paying $35 bucks plus shipping, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> not really</li>
            <li> Bakblade worked as advertised,I dried shaved,and then took a shower lathered up and continued,in ten minutes hair was gone.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I always had trouble with the hair on my back</li>
            <li> It might seem expensive but it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works wet or dry&lt;</li>
            <li> I use it wet while I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
            <li> draw back not happy paying extra for customs charge should be pre warned of extra costs to United Kingdom. .</li>
            <li> Not really fancy</li>
            <li> I read the reviews carefully, and decided to take a chance on the baKblade.  </li>
            <li> This is not much.</li>
            <li> and I never felt like it would even remotely break skin.  </li>
            <li> Not really,</li>
            <li> whole thing is overpriced and the blades are a rip-off</li>
            <li> : this product took only a few minutes to use.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and can even get the product wet</li>
            <li> Paying 8 dollars for shipping I expected a shorter wait and</li>
            <li> next assumption was that the hair was being cut, but it would be stubbly and not a particularly smooth result.  </li>
            <li> next assumption was that the hair was being cut, but it would be stubbly and not a particularly smooth result.  </li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> wish I knew about this before I spent 1500 bucks on Laser hair removal treatments that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I would actually try reaching around my back the best I could like a contortionist and obviously failed miserably every time.  </li>
            <li> The blade is roughly the length of an iphone (not the plus version)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but don&#x27;t have the fear of slicing my skin off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just buy another one when it dulls.</li>
            <li> Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.</li>
            <li> I feel absolutely no stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had alot of thick back and shoulder hair since I was a teen</li>
            <li> Before the BakBlade, he had THICK, COURSE HAIR that covered his ENTIRE BACK, SHOULDERS &amp; SIDES!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, my wife was kind enough to assist even though I hated asking her.</li>
            <li> no cuts,no razor burn,nothing ,my back was shaved in 5 minutes and was as smoothed as a baby&#x27;s #### so needless to say I actually look normal when I take my shirt off and do not have to ask my wife to shave me down like a poodle</li>
            <li> Disappointed difficult to do whole back due to angle being fixed also cut top of small spot  </li>
            <li> you have unwanted back hair, don&#x27;t waste your time with any other product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not easy to find someone who will shave your back for you.</li>
            <li> It is sharp so be careful...</li>
            <li> NO burn or raw skin like an electric back shaver that shall not be mentioned&lt;</li>
            <li> It was a bit awkward at first, but when I got the hang of this thing, it was just like using a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> So long icky back hair.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, after using this product I have no more back hair, I feel slimmer in t-shirts, and I can actually see the muscular definition of my back that I couldn&#x27;t before with all the hair.</li>
            <li> One blade has lasted a long time too, and I have some thick back hair.</li>
            <li> I had back hair that was as thick, long and lustrous as Tom Selleck&#x27;s mustache.</li>
            <li> I lathered my back with a little liquid soap in the shower and in less than 5-minutes</li>
            <li> My main concern was the potential of cutting myself, but the design of the guard is ingenious and it&#x27;s impossible to cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is it doesnt work well on short hair you have to let it grow out a little bit.</li>
            <li> I use it dry and it takes my thick back hair off with one pull.</li>
            <li> I can shave my back in less than a few minutes with this thing.  </li>
            <li> You do have to move your back around to get some spots but no more than you move your face to compensate for the angles of your face.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the irritation or burning sensation like the topical counterparts which I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I opted to try the Bakblade instead since I&#x27;ve unsuccessfully tried two other electric shavers already.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I have ever used in the past is clippers to basically shear my back</li>
            <li> I have used other back-hair products.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first after seeing this product.</li>
            <li> I got mine in the other day and imediately gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products, electric and manual and the Bakblade blows them away.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> had missed my delivery due to address conflict</li>
            <li> It gets those spots you can&#x27;t get with other raizers.</li>
            <li> Click the user to see all their other reviews...</li>
            <li> No more gorilla back could not be happier.</li>
            <li> I know its probably due to the razor guard</li>
            <li> am in no way a shill for the company nor am I affilIated with them or any other reseller  </li>
            <li> I can say, I was a bit skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> have tried other methods and none have come close to compare.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as sharp as face razor.  </li>
            <li> No more using my body Norelco Bodygroom for back duty.</li>
            <li> As for other body shavers and trimmers - they don&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> I also am looking forward to the other products that are planned for 2015.</li>
            <li> No more asking the wife to shave my back.  </li>
            <li> This works extremely well.</li>
            <li> The return address read &amp;#34;baKblade&amp;#34;, but other than that</li>
            <li> And outside of a tiny patch or two that I missed because of the insane amount of hair on my back, it&#x27;s totally clean.</li>
            <li> Now all I need is a little maintenance every few days, it&#x27;s nothing... to tell you the truth I look forward to it because this thing is like a back</li>
            <li> I little on the expensive side but decided it was worth it and</li>
            <li> Please take into consideration the fact that, while the reviewers now have the \\&quot;Amazon verified purchase\\&quot; tag, their review history is very limited and typically all occurs within a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> honestly though....get rid of that nasty back hair....</li>
            <li> Matt, the CEO, wrote back personally that day, 2 hours before the game, with my tracking info.</li>
            <li> I used it both wet and dry and found it easier to use while dry, just go slow.  </li>
            <li> I use it dry, I use it in the shower, took a few times to get used to.</li>
            <li> I tried it without any lotion or gel and -- HOLY COW -- it worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> I tried it without any lotion or gel and -- HOLY COW -- it worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> tried to use my baKblade again this past weekend, which would only be the second time since I&#x27;ve owned the product, and the blades had gotten so dull</li>
            <li> SCAMMERS: All of the positive reviews I checked into were fake.  </li>
            <li> then I saw some guy claiming that this product was a scam and that the positive review were fake...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty flexible guy, but some areas are impossible to shave with just a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Cleared my back in 7 minutes and trust me my back is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I bought this after previously purchasing two of the electric mangroomers; both of which broke (the plastic is flimsy - the handle broke on one, the case around the cutters / circuit board on the other).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does it work for hard to reach places, it trims chest hair, arm hair, &amp;#34;where ever hair&amp;#34; in stages.  </li>
            <li> used it twice and that damm hair on my back that pisses me off and is hard to get at</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of back hair just a couple of hard to reach areas I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> and I spend a lot of time at the gym lifting and initially it was hard to navigate the baKblade.</li>
            <li> This because if you try to shave the same side, which is what you will want to do by instinct, those flexing muscles will be hard to navigate.</li>
            <li> using it, you hardly notice it on your back.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but after my first use I was sold on the product.  </li>
            <li> The unit shipped in a lightly padded bubble envelope fully assembled with the removable blade badly cracked.  </li>
            <li> it reaches long behind your back</li>
            <li> A simple solution to a common problem.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is price.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked when I saw the video, but then at the same time, suddenly what was happening made complete</li>
            <li> only complaint, if there is one, is the cost of this item and the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I can see people having excessive back hair may have issues after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> A back wax costs about $50 without tip, but lasts at least 10 days before the hair comes through...</li>
            <li> Dark, course hair.</li>
            <li> but while it is dark and there was tons of it, it wasn&#x27;t like &amp;#34;brillo pad&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a review from an amazon customer stating it doesn&#x27;t work well with his thick back hair</li>
            <li> but I could see someone with a thick back carpet clogging this thing with every pass...</li>
            <li> My back hair is so thick I can braid it.</li>
            <li> so i have to be real careful there.</li>
            <li> Hopefully in time the price will come down.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even take the time to trim the hair down...</li>
            <li> For the recess running up and down the spine in between the lat muscles, shave horizontally in both directions.  </li>
            <li> But now, after seven uses, I&#x27;ve got it down pat and haven&#x27;t cut myself since, and the irritation is basically nonexistent.  </li>
            <li> But combined with the ManGroomer or ManGroomer Pro to knock it down to a shorter length for the razor to do its job, I believe you&#x27;ll get the closest shave you&#x27;ve ever achieved.</li>
            <li> Painless (They mean it when they say it feels like a back scratcher</li>
            <li> long used chemical hair removers that made my skin burn and at one time actually burned my left tricep badly, actually scabbing over and making it painful to move my arm for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades go dull very fast and the replacements are very expensive compared to other back shavers.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is my butt got a little razor burn.</li>
            <li> the only critique is that the handle seem a little delicate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and the blade is still sharp.  </li>
            <li> I just got it yesterday and in less than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> and I shaved it in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Took less than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I expect the touch-ups every week or two to take even less time.  </li>
            <li> If so, then you should seriously consider the Bakblade product, as I too, have been blessed with the gift of back hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Other products out there is easier and a lot less money!</li>
            <li> I use it once a week and have had it for about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super hairy</li>
            <li> I pulled the blade 15 different ways across my back at all sorts of weird angles</li>
            <li> I pulled the blade 15 different ways across my back at all sorts of weird angles</li>
            <li> Was done in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> And, in a lot less time.  </li>
            <li> I have what I would consider a medium amount of sickening fur on my back, within 5 mins it was gone, and smoothly shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m done in less than 5-minutes -WITH</li>
            <li> I previously relied on a battery operated Just-A-Trim and it took forever.  </li>
            <li> I had become the hairy guy on the beach with black socks shoes and Bermuda shorts.</li>
            <li> My back hair is very tough, so I use it as a wet shaver, though it does work dry for my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> No more waxing salons, no more standing in front of the mirror with a tiny little razor while doing an impromptu yoga session, sheesh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not full on berber carport,</li>
            <li> In terms of performance, the first use is awkward but you get used to it and the angles that you have to hold it</li>
            <li> SO NOT TRUE.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;d have to really mess up in order to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried sprays - what a mess.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised - real game changer.</li>
            <li> The bakblade took a lot less time with little irritation.</li>
            <li> I think using it dry will dull the blade quicker, but have no fear, these blades hold up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think using it dry will dull the blade quicker, but have no fear, these blades hold up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only bad is that this product is somewhat pricey and shipping seems a bit high just to send replacement blades.</li>
            <li> The blade is as sharp as a regular blade razor plus extremely short plastic teeth to protect you from cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> more painful episodes with smelly, stinging, foams that take too long, leave your skin sore and are extremely difficult to use without help.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Feels a little strange&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Feels a little strange&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> $50 is a little pricey</li>
            <li> I was a little (has since passed)</li>
            <li> a little flimsy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes a little time getting used to</li>
            <li> The prices seems a little steep for what it is.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice, and you need to avoid moles and skin tags, etc.  </li>
            <li> Yes it leaves a little stubble, but you will have stubble in a day or two anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly a little stunned at how close the thing can get.</li>
            <li> After seeing that it was DE blades I was a little hesitant about getting cut.</li>
            <li> After a little I went to town.</li>
            <li> Not even a little.  </li>
            <li> I have used other back shaving products in the past (mangroomer and razorba) and have been disappointed in the outcome and the length of time that it took to cover the entire back.  </li>
            <li> This little guy is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must admit it took me a little time to get the hang of using baKblade.  </li>
            <li> I was actually a little terse with the owner when I didn&#x27;t get a tracking number because of those comments, but</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of dry shaving my back or even shaving it at all</li>
            <li> and it is a solid razor for trimming your neck line but near impossible for the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I started, I figured the guard and the single blade would mean no chance of nicking myself.</li>
            <li> That being said, in what usually took me 10-15 frustrating minutes with these other products, took me only 2-3 mins using the BakBlade.  </li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to the reaching, but in a few minutes I had it down!</li>
            <li> I have learned to not scrape too hard because I have put scratches on my back from pushing to hard.</li>
            <li> Its strange because this product seems so simplistic while the only other comparable product, the man groomer, seemed overly complex.</li>
            <li> We have been using various tools including a regular barbers electric clipper on a crazy homemade extension.</li>
            <li> I had tried waxing (once - too expensive), creative home made alternatives (too dangerous) and asking my wife to assist and the reply to that was &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li> even cut all those ugly hairs in back of my neck completely in two passes.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble and order now.</li>
            <li> he basically said he&#x27;d send me the newer version that was about to come out in a few weeks after i made my purchase.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get heavy as you are working on banishing the hair.  </li>
            <li> stubble left behind (although i don&#x27;t mind this at all)&lt;br /&gt;Not eligible for Amazon Prime (not a deal breaker, so don&#x27;t let this dissuade you)a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> stubble left behind (although i don&#x27;t mind this at all)&lt;br /&gt;Not eligible for Amazon Prime (not a deal breaker, so don&#x27;t let this dissuade you)a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me tell you folks, looking at just my back from behind</li>
            <li> Received my bakBlade today, after some trouble with the delivery via USPS.  </li>
            <li> I was careful, common</li>
            <li> The burn went away after a few days and then I noticed a lot of ingrown hairs that were causing me to breakout in a rash as well.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times.</li>
            <li> He is faking all the 5 star reviews and using multiple identities to mask his operation to suck you into buying this poorly manufactured piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> waste your money or time on any battery fold out razers.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I ordered it and it came priority mail in a few days.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, go look at cheaper options.</li>
            <li> the everyday hassles&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Note that I took the advice in the instructions and used the mangroomer a few weeks ago to get rid of the bulk of the unmanaged hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on waxing or the man groomer.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these a few years ago and it served me well until I lost it on a trip -</li>
            <li> But it was never smooth afterward.</li>
            <li> Some weird glitch happened where my product did not show up in time and the CEO of the company emailed me directly and sent me another shaver at no cost, who the heck does that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At this rate even shaving everyday you may got through 2-3 blades a year at most.y</li>
            <li> this thing even existed a few weeks ago until I saw it on youtube.</li>
            <li> even existed a few weeks ago until I saw it on youtube.</li>
            <li> Before seeing this product on a shaving-products website I used Nair for men, which is messy and smelly and time-consuming.</li>
            <li> First I want to say: Thank you for delivering me from that battery operated trimmer with the narrow blade, and the nearly impossible process of a gel cream hair</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical coming from other battery operated back shavers out there, but with the glowing reviews I couldn&#x27;t help but try it out myself.  </li>
            <li> This is hard to due with the handle installed.</li>
            <li> Use this thing after you shower,  so the hairs are stiff and upright.</li>
            <li> You do feel a very slight tingle, but that&#x27;s after you&#x27;ve finished.  </li>
            <li> having had a number of electric body shavers and having grown tired of batteries that become uncharge-able with little heads that pop off as i tried and contort my body to get that hard to reach place on my back</li>
            <li> BakBlade handle presents at just the correct angle to prevent having to press down hard with the blades.  </li>
            <li> If you are one of the unfortunate guys with an embarrassing back full of hair, then BUY THIS, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a small blade guard that sits a few millimeters off the blade-</li>
            <li> I always ended up bleeding or missing small patches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the mangroomer(sucked) and some other razor with a long handle that was useless.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve tried other products and were disappointed, as I was, this may very well be your answer.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve tried other products and were disappointed, as I was, this may very well be your answer.  </li>
            <li> but at it&#x27;s current price, they is a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I have yet to get a chance to actually try the product as it arrived broken due to poor packaging/planning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few devices for removing my back hair and they were all difficult to use by myself.</li>
            <li> Not just a patch of hair near my shoulder blades or at the base of my back.  </li>
            <li> and it will feel a little tender for about an hour, and if you have moles that stick out, they will bleed!</li>
            <li> I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on various creams, waxes, and other painful devices in the past, and nothing compares to baKblade.</li>
            <li> the bakblade product itself is decent in quality although I wish there was a way to sharpen the blades because I can see it getting very expensive,</li>
            <li> so order one now and mow em&#x27; down!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is obviously a little common sense needed aside from what&#x27;s in the instructions,&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li> but this product has inspired very little loyalty in me.</li>
            <li> The hairs must have grown in a bad direction, and the way this just plucks them out must have really irritated the skin.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to leave a small amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> No more begging wife to do this or sitting still cringing waiting for her to cut me.</li>
            <li> I would dare not ask anyone to shave my back as I am too self-conscious, so at times I would just skip shaving, until a couple of weeks ago when I randomly came across a YouTube video where the host praises the BakBlade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was intentional or not</li>
            <li> no more being embarrassed at the pool.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would shave close enough that it would not leave you feeling stubbly.</li>
            <li> I bought this item last fall and was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything in the past....</li>
            <li> Do you have back hair that makes you feel uncomfortable to take your shirt off?</li>
            <li> Do small children run away in fear when you take your shirt off at the pool?</li>
            <li> It usually takes a lot of time with the electric shaver I was using with an extended handle that is built in.</li>

            <li> Not many company owners do that here in America.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a man groomer and the battery rusts out in the shower...</li>

            <li> For context, I&#x27;m black and have thick curly hair - no problem for this blade!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a tool like this for a long time, and I was skeptical when I ordered it that I would either experience stubble or a scratchy feeling while shaving.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed and you won&#x27;t ever have to suffer the pain, irritation and absolute inconvenience of chemical hair removers again.</li>
            <li> The design makes it near impossible to inadvertently nick yourself.  </li>
            <li> it is hard to reach for yourself.</li>

            <li> It sucks working out</li>
            <li> A few days after using the Bakblade I noticed a painful razor burn that burned every time my shirt brushed it.</li>
            <li> That kinda sucks</li>
            <li> The Razorba SUCKS compared to this.....</li>
            <li> SUCKS</li>
            <li> Overall somehow it cuts close without cutting you.</li>
            <li> but in reality.....it was clumsy and painfull.</li>
            <li> Amazon is making me type at least 20 words...</li>

            <li> but if you do shave really slow...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick badk hair</li>
            <li> Thick hair was my problem and it took care of it like a lawn mower.  </li>
            <li> This thing does work on both long, disgusting back hair and slightly grown out hair.  </li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical when I made the purchase, but went ahead anyway because other products I have tried just haven&#x27;t worked for me.  </li>
            <li> This thing is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> This afternoon I threw my shirt off and went at it, and it worked unbelievably!  </li>
            <li> I wish that I had this product for the  past 30 years!  </li>
            <li> Other products have failed to produce the results of the Bakblade.  </li>
            <li> No more embarrassment in having to ask someone else to do this for you again!</li>
            <li> To anyone looking for a such a product you can go wrong with this!</li>
            <li> I mean nothing compares to your product.  </li>
            <li> I mean NONE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE!</li>
            <li> I tend to get a bad staph infection when I usually try to shave my back.</li>
            <li> Does give a scraping sensation, not altogether unpleasant, a bit rougher than a back scratch.  </li>
            <li> Replacement blades are a bit expensive but hopefully will come down in time.</li>
            <li> I am seriously stunned at how well this works.</li>
            <li> C&#x27;mon seriously?  </li>
            <li> Nothing serious or anything that would stop me from using this product over and over.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I tried the ridiculous battery powered wand, which did nothing and broke within 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it took 5 minutes, and I could have been done sooner</li>
            <li> Wish the replacement blades were less expensive.</li>
            <li> just a little expensive</li>
            <li> and I think it is a little expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;It felt a little weird having a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shave, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using an electric back shaver for a year the head went bad.</li>

            <li> I almost went crazy to other parts</li>
            <li> I hate asking my girlfriend to shave my creepy back and in the past I have even paid my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Its a tough world out there these days.  </li>
            <li> My blade had arrived broken though it was unclear as to whether it was a shipping issue or poor design.</li>
            <li> I hate my back hair.</li>
            <li> The handle had broken during shipping and baKBlade replaced the handle within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can a product that does everything it claims be considered a rip-off?  </li>
            <li> Was broken upon arrival</li>
            <li> Shaving behind you in a mirror can be disorienting.  </li>

            <li> It broke after a few uses and didn&#x27;t work well and was a bit painful.</li>
            <li> The hair was gone and it felt as though it had never been there.&lt;br /&gt;After a shower, during which it felt insane to feel the water on my bare skin</li>
            <li> The hair was gone and it felt as though it had never been there.&lt;br /&gt;After a shower, during which it felt insane to feel the water on my bare skin</li>
            <li> I wrote a very scathing review of this product&#x27;s predecessor a few months.  </li>
            <li> Let the razor do the work you do not need to press hard as that will result in a bad razor burn.</li>
            <li> It looked weird.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong -</li>
            <li> Works well but for what it&#x27;s made of too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> The product is terrible and doesn&#x27;t actually work.  </li>
            <li> Just get it, try it, and never beg your wife-girlfriend-boyfriend-whatever to help you with the rather nasty job of back hair removal.</li>
            <li> If you read the reviews for this product, they do seem like they might be fake.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical when i saw this and read some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> You will not be sorry with this product.  </li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical of this product.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still expensive....</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but I hope my review helps anyone who is skeptical like I was to make the purchase.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but the price is absurd for the product.  </li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this</li>
            <li> lots of men have this disgusting problem and this needs to be put out to the public.</li>
            <li> No need for shaving cream, no cuts of nicks - unless you use it like an insane person - just a close shave unlike the electric back shavers.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 57), and always felt uncomfortable taking my shirt off in places like the beach, the lake, or the gym.  </li>
            <li> wary if you have any moles or skintags.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but  I have to say this works.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive considering it is made of plastic</li>
            <li> so you can reach difficult spots.  </li>
            <li> I was completely wrong about that as well.  </li>
            <li> I was completely wrong about that as well.  </li>
            <li> This thing lets me shave in peace without disturbing anyone.</li>
            <li> I agree that these reviews must be fake.  </li>
            <li> and/or do some yoga to reach some difficult areas.</li>
            <li> but that failed also.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sorry that I didn&#x27;t know about it sooner than I did.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to contort my arm in weird angles to get places.</li>
            <li> I figured, hey, it&#x27;s not that expensive.</li>
            <li> I was soooo wrong...</li>
            <li> Then it all went wrong.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised cant go wrong with the baKblade</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this purchase...</li>
            <li> Still skeptical but liking the simplicity and price</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin anyway</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nair- takes a long time, horrible for</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, even with the video review, but I hoped that if nothing else it would thin things out.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical biut was also desperate to ditch the gorilla suit at all costs.</li>
            <li> Can use wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to all the guys out there who hate the buzzing of electric and time being saved!</li>
            <li> I hate my back hair and have always hated the thought of asking someone else to shave it for me.</li>
            <li> The looks at the beach or pool, it sucks!!!</li>
            <li> it cuts to the skin while protecting from cutting your skin.</li>
            <li> Dont have to worry about cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> The price they are asking is crazy but it does work.</li>
            <li> so then I wondered about it even cutting close.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can hear the blade cutting the hair on every pass</li>
            <li> Every one I have found to be either ineffective (sasquatch with mange), painful, or just way too difficult to be practical.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it can scratch my skin or ever cut</li>
            <li> would because there seems to be no threat of cutting yourself.  </li>
            <li> Works well, no risk of cutting myself and it cuts close with no shaving cream or even water.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I stand corrected!</li>
            <li> mad about:&lt;br</li>
            <li> My poor wife!!</li>
            <li> I stopped because I was afraid it would end badly.</li>
            <li> So, I became very skeptical, and just let it slip my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was very very skeptical of the BaKblade.  </li>
            <li> Because I have never, and I do mean NEVER, found a razor, shave cream or wax that I can use on my underarms and not get horrible razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Its annoying, expensive, and painful.</li>
            <li> Nearly impossible to cut yourself with it.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have looked at all the reviews when I purchased the product because once I realized this piece of garbage was bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s his business, so endorsing a product that is faulty or doesn&#x27;t work well would be bad for his business.  </li>
            <li> I took the plunge and order this bad boy.</li>
            <li> i did manage to cut myself but it wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d caution guys on, neither of which are so bad that I&#x27;d rate the BakBlade lower than a 5.</li>
            <li> everyone has that, and that gentlemen, is the source of any bad review given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel bad for you.  </li>
            <li> ungodly painful and embarrassing</li>
            <li> I am actually shocked at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> Do you know how painful it is to have razor burn in a place where you sweat??</li>
            <li> Not batteries or awkward reaching!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I feel stupid for calling it a baKblade, even though that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called</li>
            <li> and i hate it.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> and I HATE getting waxes.  </li>
            <li> Also needing batteries was annoying.  </li>
            <li> I hated using the mangroomer, but I used it because well it had to be done.</li>
            <li> Very painful.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> INSANE PRICE</li>
            <li> Absolutely a terrible product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so horrible.</li>
            <li> **terribly</li>
            <li> Solved a rather nasty problem.  </li>
            <li> this thing works shockingly well.  </li>
            <li> I have the worst case of razor burn</li>
            <li> which was a pain to get spread even and smelled awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the 1 to give a review but I must say this thing is GREAT !</li>
            <li> I love this product. Works great. Shipping is a little high but I order 4 at a time of the refill blades and the shipping cost is the same.</li>
            <li> This worked well.  Smooth, clean shave, quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The best back shaver I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> This Do-It-Yourself shave set is brilliant. Thought this might be one of those gadgets I&#x27;d probably throw away after one use.  (Use was for a few errant hairs on my back - hairs I can&#x27;t get to when living &amp;#34;single&amp;#34;.) This Do-It-Yourself shave set turns out to be brilliantly good at its job.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it work for hard to reach places, it trims chest hair, arm hair, &amp;#34;where ever hair&amp;#34; in stages.  Pass it along your chest and you can control the length and thickness of the hair - you can stop at any point. I prefer to leave a small amount of hair.  Don&#x27;t like the look or the feel of stubble and this product is perfect for that a very natural result.  This shaver is an amazing find and priced extremely well.</li>
            <li> So handy, quick, and easy.  I keep it in the shower and use it about twice a week.  Takes only a minute.  Not batteries or awkward reaching!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this purchase.  Easy to use and you get a pretty close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> Works great.. Dot recommend dry shave with it but if you do shave really slow...</li>
            <li> I have tried shavers, foams, creams ... all of it ... nothing else has even come close to the ease and convenience of this product.  It took a few minutes to suss out the technique, but once I had it sorted, the Backspa worked great and takes just a few minutes.  I use it twice a week before the shower and my back stays looking smooth and sleek for the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more painful episodes with smelly, stinging, foams that take too long, leave your skin sore and are extremely difficult to use without help.  The Backspa requires no assistance and allows you to use it discreetly and privately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, when I first bought the Backspa, there was a slight delay in delivery due to an apparent misstep by the Post Office.  Without even being asked, the company president, Chris, contacted me by email and explained the problem.  He immediately sent me another shaver and included a free second replacement blade.  And, as if that wasn&#x27;t enough, Chris also gave me a full refund on my shipping costs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and this company.  Both are guaranteed to satisfy!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try out the brand new baKblades from BIGblade. I just got it yesterday and in less than 10 minutes my back was smooth.  This is an outstanding product!  I haven&#x27;t sampled everything there is on the market but without a doubt this is near perfection. This is the closest shave you can get and the large blades make quick work out of this task.  Save yourself the trouble and order now.</li>
            <li> i have a hairy back and i hate it. been fighting it for pretty much my entire adult life. i&#x27;ve done the \\&quot;attempt to shave it with a razor in and out of the shower\\&quot; thing, but it&#x27;s a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve also done the mangroomer thing. it&#x27;s okay, but i&#x27;d go over and over a patch of hair and still it wouldnt cut it. and mangroomer would leave me back covered in red marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just used the backspa shaver and it is amazing! love that i can do it without shaving cream and i don&#x27;t have to be in the shower. it cuts the hair after a stroke or two. the big handle can get in the way, but with a little manipulation you&#x27;ll be able to find an angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i managed to get my back and the back of my arms pretty smooth in just a few minutes. so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bonus: dead, dry skin will come off while you shave your back. that&#x27;s a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;added bonus: ive been emailing back and forth with peter, the president of the company. he basically said he&#x27;d send me the newer version that was about to come out in a few weeks after i made my purchase. i agreed, and waited about 2 weeks and to get it. he&#x27;s been 100% super professional and courteous. very appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can feel my t-shirt against my smooth back. it&#x27;s a great feeling!</li>
            <li> Great product, best thing since sliced bread , for a hair guy</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time today. Did a great job, the wide blade did the job faster than my wife helping me with the a normal razor or trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I got this product. I;m going to tell all my friends about this. thank you guys for making such a great product....</li>
            <li> I bought the old BackSpa and it worked one time. it came with a 2nd blade, and that one didn&#x27;t work at all..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the company owner (Chris) sent me the new design yesterday, and it works awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart move to put the exposed edge of the razor on the face towards the back. It works great!</li>
            <li> Long story short, I was leaving for vacation 5 business days afterthought order and I knew it would be a close call on the shipping.  When I saw that it was looking like it may not make it before we left, I contacted Chris who is the president and seller and he went above and beyond by shipping overnight to my vacation destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor works as described.  The only reason it is not 5 stars is because it can leave a slight stubble.  Chris has already mentioned they are working to release a new model with a second blade to help provide a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely appreciated the extra effort which is lacking from all too many retailers this day and age.  A hearty recommendation for the excellent service.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Its important to note that I am hairy.  Not just a patch of hair near my shoulder blades or at the base of my back.  I am hairy, all over my back from shoulder to shoulder from neck to buttocks...  I have tried almost every product on the market to get rid of my back hair including getting my back waxed on a semi-regular basis.  The back waxing gave me a nice smooth back but left me with \\&quot;backne\\&quot; and grew back to quick to justify the time and money spent on the service.  I&#x27;ve tried using a regular razor both with and without the Razorba.  I&#x27;ve even attached an electric trimmer to the Razorba with rubber bands and duct tape to try to speed up the hair removal process.  All of these techniques have worked but have come at some type of cost like expense, time or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doing my regular research and ran across the backSPA.  It looked weird.  But it also looked like it may work (remember the duct tape and Razorba, i will obviously try anything).  So i hit the buy now button and bought it through Amazon.  I do have one ding and that is that the backSPA is not eligible for Prime members.  I love my Prime membership so sometimes when I don&#x27;t see a product qualifies it will give me pause.  I decided to buy anyway and I am forever glad i did.  The seller, Chris, reached out to me letting me know that an updated model was about to ship and offered me the option of getting an existing unit or wait a short time for the update.  I decided to wait and get the update.  I did not wait long and the communication was on point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The backSPA is EASY to use!  The long handle makes it possible to reach all of my back without straining.  You do have to move your back around to get some spots but no more than you move your face to compensate for the angles of your face.  Its also quite light so it doesn&#x27;t get heavy as you are working on banishing the hair.  My first time using it took only about 4 minutes to remove all of my hair which was in full growth pattern.  In fact, it worked so well that I thought it wasn&#x27;t even working at one point.  It can&#x27;t be that easy.  Well, it IS that EASY.  You simply drag it along your dry skin and the hair shaves off.  The design even catches some of the hair if you are shaving from above which helps to minimize the mess.  It feels strange but no uncomfortable.  It is important to note that you do not get a freshly shaved smooth back from the backSPA.  It feels more like you have used an electric razor.  I prefer leaving a little growth behind to avoid any ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Reaonably priced&lt;br /&gt;FAST&lt;br /&gt;Light, so no tired arms&lt;br /&gt;Long handle for easy reach&lt;br /&gt;No instructions necessary, just unwrap and start shaving&lt;br /&gt;Can be used dry (i haven&#x27;t even tried it wet)&lt;br /&gt;Did i mention FAST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Another razor to buy and replace&lt;br /&gt;Feels a little strange&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t remove the hair forever!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD TO KNOW:&lt;br /&gt;Some stubble left behind (although i don&#x27;t mind this at all)&lt;br /&gt;Not eligible for Amazon Prime (not a deal breaker, so don&#x27;t let this dissuade you)a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product from a fantastic seller.

            <li> Quite possibly the greatest personal hygiene product ever invented. Thank you!</li>
            <li> best back shaver I have used and I have used several. Does exactly as advertised. Great you tube videos about it as well. That&#x27;s what sold me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had alot of thick back and shoulder hair since I was a teen and it was too embarrassing to take of my shirt. Great blades that do the job amazingly but I still sometimes get razor burn no matter how gently a shave my back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> it was for my son and he likes it a lot, it is a very good blade. thank you so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, a nice light movement like your trying to scratch an itch and the hair is gone. Only issue is the price of the blades... they either need to come down or it should last loner than the stated 6 uses.</li>
            <li> Simply put... If you have back hair and want an easy way to remove it.. Just get this, don&#x27;t waste any more time reading reviews or debating what to get. This product is great... Don&#x27;t use it with water, must be used dry.</li>
            <li> After using my original Mangroomer last week, which just wasn&#x27;t doing anything to trim the light hair on my back, I logged on and discovered the baKblade and had to give it a chance. I&#x27;ve tried just about every hair removal cream, waxing, and shaving device over the years and this is the only one that truly got the job done. I lathered my back with a little liquid soap in the shower and in less than 5-minutes and my back was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s a**!  The angle of the handle and the extra wide blades worked like a charm. Highly recommended as a basic and simple shaver that actually works!</li>
            <li> I just got the &amp;#34;Back Blade&amp;#34; in the mail...and it does work. I&#x27;m not really that hairy, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older there seems to be more hair on my back, and I really needed something I could use by myself to take care of it. It took me maybe 5 minutes to do my whole back. I would diffidently recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of their back hair.</li>
            <li> The BakBlade is an amazingly simple product but VERY well constructed, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; razors, which cut, get clogged, cause ingrown hairs and razor burn, the BakBlade has Two large blades (about 5&amp;#34; wide&amp;#34; with a serrated blade guard which prevents the blades from clogging-up, while acting like a &amp;#34;rake&amp;#34; of sorts, which causes the hair to clump-up into what my wife would call &amp;#34;hair balls&amp;#34; (like a cat&#x27;s fur).  That makes things a LOT easier when it comes to clean-up time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BakBlade handle presents at just the correct angle to prevent having to press down hard with the blades.  You can feel when it is at the proper angle, as you will feel the serrated blade guard just barely touching your skin.  Pull the handle up and down as if raking, and it shaves the hair cleanly and without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have some physical inabilities which prevent me from reaching over my shoulders with the handle, my wife was able to use it on me exactly as designed. With about 30 seconds of &amp;#34;coaching&amp;#34; about the correct amount of pressure and &amp;#34;angle of attack&#x27;, my back is now clean-shaven, and the whole process took less than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No stubble, no chemicals, no waxing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My clothes feel SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE without back hair, (it also does the tops of shoulder blades, lower back, etc.. just depends on the angle of the blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Bigmouth&amp;#34; vendor was great to work with .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is the inventor of the product.  My BakBlade was a couple days late arriving, so he sent one Fed-Ex for free, to make sure I had one in a timely manner!  I offered to return the Amazon-ordered product to him, but he told me to keep it as a gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all my years,I&#x27;ve never found a better personal grooming product.  No water necessary, no shaving cream required (really...it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin!)..just make short strokes with the blades and the BakBlade will do it&#x27;s thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  product arrived in a discreet package, so your nosy neighbors won&#x27;t know you have a &amp;#34;back mat&amp;#34; that needs tending-to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one recommendation to any potential purchaser or user of the product, it would be to carefully stand in your bath tub or shower, COVER THE DRAIN, and that way, you&#x27;ll have all the shaved-off hair contained in one place for vacuuming or sweeping-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, though watching some guy shave his back is not my idea of a good time, I did familiarize myself with the correct way to use the BakBlade by looking up some videos on Youtube.  That way, you&#x27;ll have a good idea as to proper &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this should be nominated as &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s Grooming Product of the Year&amp;#34; if there were such an award. It&#x27;s that impressive!akBlade will do it&#x27;s thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  product arrived in a discreet package, so your nosy neighbors won&#x27;t know you have a &amp;#34;back mat&amp;#34; that needs tending-to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one recommendation to any potential purchaser or user of the product, it would be to carefully stand in your bath tub or shower, COVER THE DRAIN, and that way, you&#x27;ll have all the shaved-off hair contained in one place for vacuuming or sweeping-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, though watching some guy shave his back is not my idea of a good time, I did familiarize myself with the correct way to use the BakBlade by looking up some videos on Youtube.

It&#x27;s that impressive!</li>
            <li> Bakblade works fast and easy! I&#x27;ve tried razors on a stick, even electric ones I&#x27;ve taped to a handle and Bakblade works faster and easier by far.  The angle of the blade was well thought out.  You simply pull the blade across an area and once may be enough.  It&#x27;s so fast, I ordered a second one for a gift.  Now I can keep the hair off and look much younger and cleaner.</li>
            <li> Lol wipes that back hair off with a single swipe!!!! Geah baby this is my life!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing. No area u cannot reach and able to use it without anyone else assisting. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Gotta say at first glance I thought it was too much money for this product. I do my own full body waxing except for the middle of my back, can&#x27;t reach. I took a gamble, even with good reviews I was still skeptical. I just now used it on my back, and it worked exactly as its promoted. Very easy to do. The only area I shave is my head and face, which takes longer than using this on my back. Fantastic product, very much worth the money I spent on it. I realistically spent under two minutes to complete my back. Love this, a product that&#x27;s probably worth a lot more.</li>
            <li> This product really works and is very easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t leave the irritation or burning sensation like the topical counterparts which I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and as ad stated,used one time and worked great.</li>
            <li> Very useful, takes a little time of getting use to it but overall very nice</li>
            <li> While visiting my brother I saw this hanging in the shower. I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. BOOM, I fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately jumped on Amazon and bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, easy to use and very effective. EXACTLY WHAT GOOD PRODUCTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy, I don&#x27;t like back hair (neither do the ladies) and I love a good backscratch. Problem solved. The BaKblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop worrying about looking like an ape. Stop having your significant other de-fur you. Stop using stuff that doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s even a great YouTube Channel with a review of this product. I have zero affiliation with BaKblade or this channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/6oofNzMAaWQ</li>
            <li> BakSpa is a simple, but very effective product. It gives a nice, close shave with no irritation. My wife loves that I don&#x27;t need help from her anymore. I can get to all the tough to reach spots on my own. It does exactly what it advertises and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I received the backspa and let me tell you...You got something there! I LOVE it. I was worried it might not cut close but it does! It takes my wife 10 or more minutes to shave my back, I did it in 5 !!! Really, great product! My only suggestion would be to include a brush for cleaning the shaver while your shaving, I used a hard bristle brush which worked fine. Congratulations on a great product! I would raise the price and give free shipping. I buy a lot online, especially Amazon and that is a sellling point..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and I&#x27;m going to order the extra blades because this IS the BEST back shaver and my search is over....</li>
            <li> I am seriously stunned at how well this works. It literally works just like a back scratcher and hair is gone. No more begging wife to do this or sitting still cringing waiting for her to cut me. This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  This thing is awesome!  Sometimes I leave the blade cover on and use it as a back scratchier too! :-)</li>
            <li> I love it. It only takes Judy a few minutes &amp; ur done. Just like the add says. I prefer to lather up my back to do a lathered shave over a dry shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a great product! I had been using one of the battery powered trimmers. They work ok, but leave me with back stubble. Your product left my back smooth. No pain at all. Just a light scratch sensation.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well and no more having to embarrassingly ask my wife to shave my hairy back!</li>
            <li> Was great did everything it advertised that it would do very happy</li>
            <li> INSANE PRICE BUT REALLY WORKES</li>
            <li> First things first, the bakblade works as expected.  I would recommend having your significant other help you out the first time that you use it.  It really does take the hair completely off and feels a lot like a back scratcher that you&#x27;d get from a souvenir shop. Received the product on the very last day of the shipping range quoted.  Seems like they could deliver in under a week.  However, I recommend waiting for this product.  It is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Product is pricey but well worth it. Makes a job that is time consuming and a hassle to a job that takes less than 1 minute to complete. Product feels solid and doesn&#x27;t when in use.  Amazing! Will repurchase blades as needed.</li>
            <li> $50 is a little pricey but the results are superb.  I keep it at five stars because it is an awesome product.  Should have better instructions.  You have to angle the blade head at 45 degrees until it makes a scraping noise.  If you simply use it as a regular shaver you will think the product doesn&#x27;t work as it will just get a nominal amount of hair.  Once it is angled correctly, it works like magic and gets virtually a close shave...not quite but really damn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 25 minutes to do my whole back which is very hairy and with the learning curve.  I promise that if you use it correctly the results will blow you away.  Does a better job than my girlfriend does with the peanut.</li>
            <li> Disappointed difficult to do whole back due to angle being fixed also cut top of small spot  so if you have more bumps spots then this is not for you. Pluss custom charges were more than cost of blade</li>
            <li> Great product. Very easy to use</li>
            <li> It does the job, but you will need a mirror and care. It is easy to nick yourself.</li>
            <li> This product is flat out amazing. My back was pretty hairy and I shaved it in less than 5 minutes. I did it dry, no soap, no cream, not water. Left no razor burn, I went up and down back and forth like using a back scratcher. It felt good, and looked great. This thing is worth every single penny. I was skeptical, but I stand corrected!</li>
            <li> No, doubt the best thing out there if u want to take care of ur hairy back (and for those that have little hair, still great product to buy). Buy it, you wont regret it, is worth every penny. Its shave is smooth with no pain. Buy it, buy it, buy it! I&#x27;ve used other methods, and definitely there is no other best shave like the Bakblade....</li>
            <li> I was like you once, wandering the internet in my dark  room, hairy back pressed against the seat cushion. I was like you, terrified of the beach, scared of someone pulling on my shirt. I used to lie about hating swimming, disliking the sun and conveniently planned my way out of taking my shirt off. The entire time I was lying. I loved the beach, sheesh I&#x27;m like a dolphin. I would say &amp;#34;Nah, I don&#x27;t like hot tubs&amp;#34;, but it was all hogwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, please buy this. I went from hairy to smooth and it took 15 minutes. Now all I need is a little maintenance every few days, it&#x27;s nothing... to tell you the truth I look forward to it because this thing is like a back massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop researching wax places, stop asking your mother to Nair you, stop Googling laser hair removal and stop ruining your life because of back hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d known about this sooner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, will give you a trim but won&#x27;t get certain spots.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.  De-furred my husband&#x27;s back.  Looked like an animal emerged from the ground.</li>
            <li> Have only used it once so far, but very impressed with just the first use...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy, quick, clean and simple straight out the package...I would suggest this to any fella out there.</li>
            <li> I have used multiple back trimmers, shavers and waxing over the years, I&#x27;m not as hairy as some guys but enough that it&#x27;s embarrassing. Some of the trimmers scratch your back and leave stubble. The baKBlade leaves no scratch marks and works dry so you aren&#x27;t dripping all over the place. This is the best back shaver that I have ever used and is very fast. Great product!</li>
            <li> Where has this device been all my life!  Works fantastic.  Took less than 10 minutes and I&#x27;m practically a sasquatch.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the construction seems a bit cheap and the price is high for what you get.  Hopefully in time the price will come down.  Also I hope they make a smaller version for additional body grooming besides just the back!</li>
            <li> Being born of Indian decent, I am naturally a hairy guy and always dreaded waxing, shaving or getting laser hair removal treatments.  I would dare not ask anyone to shave my back as I am too self-conscious, so at times I would just skip shaving, until a couple of weeks ago when I randomly came across a YouTube video where the host praises the BakBlade.  After seeing several demonstration videos, I was immediately sold but did think it was too good to be true. Boy was I wrong - it more than met my expectations - it was light, sturdy, with an easy grip and handle.  Its ergonomic design takes the guess work of where to apply pressure as the razor was built in such a way as to provide both safety, yet effectively allow for shaving coverage (dry is more my preference) in less than 5 minutes whilst at the same time getting a nice soothing back scratch with zero to little irritation.</li>
            <li> I have never written a product review before but this is worth the time. This product is way ahead of the competition. All other back shavers are just handles that hold your own razor. This product is totally different and works better. 3 times better to be exact. Not only is it 3 times wider than your blade (there are 3 straight blades in a row) but it is designed for your back. The safety guards make it dummy proof so you can&#x27;t cut yourself and since it&#x27;s only one blade there is no getting clogged up with one pass of the blade. I tried before with my face razor and with 4 stacked blades a face razor doesn&#x27;t work for the back. This product just works. It does exactly what it says and does it well. I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li> So I tried the BaKblade yesterday and I must say I was blown away at how efficient it was.  Not only was it much easier to shave my ENTIRE back, but I also did it in less than half the time I usually do (and without pulling my shoulder muscles getting the REALLy hard to reach places).  Keep in mind that not only do I have hair all over my back, but most other places on my body as well.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was intentional or not but I was experimenting with the BaKblade and it turns out I can shave my chest, stomach, shoulders, arms, and other places as well with the same speed and efficiency AND without any cuts.  I just want to say that I got way more than my money was worth and it&#x27;s one of the best purchases ever.  Thank you for making this product, I&#x27;ll certainly be a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> Only back shaving system that works!</li>
            <li> works perfectly. no need for shaving cream, takes off most of the hair on the first pass and is very easily to use.  Replacement blades pop on and off easily.  It even feels good to use, like a nice back scratch.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is each blade has noticeable wear and tear after only 3 or 4 uses.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! ... I know this is just a razor, but honestly, works amazingly well, very smart design and incredibly sharp without being dangerous!&lt;br /&gt;Would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is so good that I was compelled to write a review.  Like another reviewer said, if you can use a back scratcher, you can use bakblade.  This thing really works.  I was somewhat skeptical when I made the purchase, but went ahead anyway because other products I have tried just haven&#x27;t worked for me.  This one not only works but works great.  The product has protective teeth on both sides of the blade that protect your skin from being cut by the blade.  It shaves closely and does so without causing irritation - and that was with doing a dry shave.  It felt like scratching my back with a back scratcher.  Also, the blade is wide and I was able to complete my de-furring within about 10 minutes.  I expect the touch-ups every week or two to take even less time.  I have a technical background, and this thing appears to be very well engineered.  My compliments to the person(s) who invented/developed this.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Works just great - takes just a bit of &#x27;practice&#x27; to get used using, mirror helped in some ways but one can do a lot just by &#x27;feel&#x27;.  This device is razor sharp but does the job safely.  2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> just as described, no more help from anyone, works perfectly, buy it, you won&#x27;t forget it</li>
            <li> Works well but for what it&#x27;s made of too expensive.</li>
            <li> If you have hairy shoulders and back,  you need one of these! I came across this product looking for something else and I was amazed by the Bakblade!  I was sold on it after viewing  videos on YouTube.  The cost of it was no concern to me; had to have it!  It was more costly in embarrassment by NOT having this and continuing with hairy shoulders, upper arms and back.  I wish I would have known about this a long time ago;  I would literally stand in shower with cream and plastic rzr and groom.  Use this thing after you shower,  so the hairs are stiff and upright. Let skin dry,  take your bakblade and go to work!  You will build a pattern in your movements and taking the hair off is SO easy!  I use it once a week when I know my arms and back will be exposed on weekend.  You can use this on yourself as many times as you want and it will not damage/bleed/cut your skin!  Started stockpiling replacement blades. One blade lasts me before it dulls about 4-5 weeks of shaving 1-2 times a week.  It is worth every dollar.  And the scratching of this thing on your back feels SO good!  I groom while watching TV...it reaches long behind your back so no need for wife to babysit you laughing at ya...I hope the company stays around for a long time to come because I can&#x27;t live without this thing.. It sucks working out 5 days/wk and looking like a werewolf! Get one and stop agonizing!!! Bob Ayala Tampa Florida</li>
            <li> This thing does work on both long, disgusting back hair and slightly grown out hair.  I&#x27;ve used the electric one (Mangroomer), but this is easier to use, gets better results and it is quiet.  The trick is to find the correct blade angle where it cuts.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Works great!</li>
            <li> This does get the hair off my back. It is very good if the hair is Thick. I don&#x27;t have thick badk hair but I had never attempted to shave it off before this. I does not get the back smooth like a razor will. A problem I had, it might just be me, is that for it to work you scrape you back with it. That casued irritation on my back. I had to put lotion on to calm it down. I&#x27;m going to look for a different back hair shaver to compair to this one.</li>
            <li> Never have I ordered a product with some hesitation to find it exceed even my wildest imagination. This thing is unbelievable! It takes only a few minutes and does the job right the first time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great back scratcher to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it works pretty darn well and easy to use. Give it a shot, make your wife or s/o happy they dont have to do it for you anymore....</li>
            <li> Wish I had heard about this years ago. Perfect is the only thing to say about this. It allows you to reach all the parts of your back without a struggle and it&#x27;s a completely close shave. No ingrowns or irritation. You technically can use it anywhere on your body to get a large area at once. I am yet to even consider getting a replacement blade. My hair is very thin anyway so it comes off easily. Would recommend this over any other device is your comparing something similar.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I was a little too scared to try something new but after using it for about six time I believe it has been a great investment. It shaves the back hairs without having to use shaving cream or water. It does not require batteries and it works great. I do, however, believe the product works best with people with thin back hair like me. I&#x27;ve read a review from an amazon customer stating it doesn&#x27;t work well with his thick back hair but I can&#x27;t confirm if he is right. My only complaint is the time it took to get the product, other than that I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of razorbas&#x27; over the years, i thought they were fine though i never enjoyed having to go over the same area so many times just to get all the hair...the razor blade is simply too small to effectively shave each area because often one has to attack that location from different angles and my arms do not work the right way to come in at these spots from the best vantage point...ENOUGH ABOUT IT!!! I was about to purchase the \\&quot;Mantrimmer\\&quot;, that battery operated unit because i&#x27;d read some decent reviews, when i noticed this other product called the baKBlade...the reviews seemed convincing, and something about it told me i needed to give it a shot...i loved the idea of such a wide blade getting an area 3 times larger than a conventional blade...so i ordered it...Let me tell you folks, looking at just my back from behind you could not tell if i was a gorilla or a man, that&#x27;s how hairy my back gets...i&#x27;m not nearly as thick in the front...regardless, THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT TO COME ALONG SINCE SLICED BREAD!!!!! a few passes along my back and i was stunned how much hair it raked up...i did my whole back in less than 2 or 3 minutes...my sink did not appreciate the sudden attention...its a 5-star-product folks, i fib you not...</li>
            <li> I was not sure about this shaver when I ordered it, but is very good.  After a couple of uses, I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It is easy to use and it will save me a fortune on waxing.  If you are on the fence like I was, I suggest that you try it.</li>
            <li> Update: My initial review of 1 star revolved around a shipping issue which to their credit Bakblade handled fantastically. My blade had arrived broken though it was unclear as to whether it was a shipping issue or poor design. After they overnighter me a entire new handle and 2 blades I have determined it was a shipping issue as the blades look very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having gotten the replacement I was finally able to use it and it worked just as advertised. It shaved much closer than the electric back shaver I have did and it was easy to clean up after. It nicked me a couple of time but I learned that going too fast caused that. I highly recommend the Bakblade, the product works and the people behind it are fantastic!</li>
            <li> My baKblade just arrived. Finally a product that delivers exactly what it promises! My back is now as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I used it dry, and it was a breeze to use. No contorting, no pain, no nicks. Every man needs one of these. I shall recommend the baKblade to everyone I know!!!&lt;br /&gt;Steven R. -- Woodhaven, MI</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. Feels like a back scratcher and leaves you smooth as silk. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received the baKblade in the mail yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try.  It gave a close, dry shave. It is not a magic bullet and comes with some setbacks, but is probably the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used to shave my back without having another individual do it for me. The setbacks will be on an individual basis.  I don&#x27;t have a ton of hair and it is really fine, so I feel the blades will last more than the prescribed 6-7 shaves.  The biggest issue I had was that I&#x27;m fairly fit and if you have any muscular definition in your back.....expect roadblocks.  It&#x27;s like shaving a topographical map and no matter how much you try to relax, you&#x27;re still sending your arms behind your head which in turn will fire all your back muscles.  I tried the original mangroomer and it pulled more hair out than it actually trimmed.  I have not tried any of their newer versions.  Hopefully, they have improved.  My last issue was the $$$.  $40+ for an item that probably costs $5 to manufacturer and no replacement blades sent is bit zealous.  However, I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for a solution.  Just realize there is no replacement for the &amp;#34;buddy system&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This thing is a godsend! At first I was a little scared when I tried it out because it felt like the blade was catching on my back. But if you just maintain an angle such that you feel a light scratching it cuts perfectly. It gets skin smooth just like a razor on your face. I was using the mangroomer and that would not get very close. It was also a lot slower. It takes only a few minutes to get my entire back with this. If you have any back hair at all, get this thing without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Received my bakBlade today, after some trouble with the delivery via USPS.  Emailed them about it and they quickly remedied the problem by sending out another one, along with a free blade attachment.  After using the blade on my back, arms, and shoulders, I can honestly say that this product does wonder on removing unwanted body hair quickly and easily.  I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past, and this was far and away the best solution I&#x27;ve tried.  After getting used the scraping sensation caused by the blade on my skin, I watched as the hair quickly came off.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to rid themselves of body hair.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Has worked well. Still irritating my back in certain areas but seems to be exactly what the market needed for cleaning up ones back hair. I don&#x27;t have too much hair but I could see someone with a thick back carpet clogging this thing with every pass... but, I am already on my 2nd blade and happier than I ever was with the leprosy-like breakouts id get on my shoulders from Waxing...</li>
            <li> Finally got to use this last weekend and worked like a charm.  I was definitely hesitate but extremely pleased with the results.  I used it on my back and was easy to get the entire back without any help.  Definitely my new back trimmer!!</li>
            <li> It does the job, but with a zillion scratches on my back. I was careful, common I am not new to shaving, but the blade is very abrasive.</li>
            <li> Your product is awesome! I got one for my brother as well and he loves it. Hope you never stop making them</li>
            <li> I love the Product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many products, and this is the best. You can shave wet or dry, and as long as you take care of the baKblade, the blades last several uses. New replacement blades are reasonable, and easy to install. I use it on a fairly regular basis. I feel it is a perfect alternative to laser treatments, or waxing.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Works very well. Top Notch Seller</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this thing actually works. I had read that some people had razor burn and it did not provide a close shave. The instructions state that you don&#x27;t need to use cream and can run the razor dry. I don&#x27;t recommend that. I just ran it under hot water and did not press the razor too hard and it worked just fine. Let the razor do the work you do not need to press hard as that will result in a bad razor burn. It won&#x27;t provide as smooth a surface as waxing or laser removal but for those stray hairs and problem areas it does just fine and it&#x27;s better than having to ask someone to shave your back or nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the results and would recommend it to anyone who needs to do some maintenance on the back.</li>
            <li> This thing is great.  No chemicals, no ingrown hairs, and best of all no more being embarrassed at the pool.  Any man that doesn&#x27;t want to let nature take its course and walk around looking like a monkey should get one of these.</li>
            <li> Excellent item I really recommend this item to shave your back or any part of you body it is hard to reach for yourself.</li>
            <li> Really impressed. As someone who deals with back hair on a normal basis, this was a shockingly low tech best bet. I have tried other methods (wax, nair, clippers, man groomer) but this is the cleanest, most comfortable, and easiest of all of them. It feels like a back scratch, but cuts really close to the skin. It&#x27;s basically a giant handle with a comb and a razor glued together, but it works well.</li>
            <li> I got this for christmas. After one use I threw my mangroomer away. This requires no batteries, is light weight, removes more hair and does it easier than the mangroomer ever thought of. One of the best purchases i&#x27;ve made in a long time. And if you email the company you will hear directly from the owner. Enough said.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as claimed.I am very happy.Looked into many diff ways to rid back hair from my kid shaving it{always hating to do it} haha  to looking into painful back waxing...Wow no shaving cream required..It is sharp so be careful...treat just as you would your face....</li>
            <li> The baKblade is easy to use and leaves my back clean with a smooth look and feel.  No concerns about razor burns or cuts.  The guard works perfectly.  The order would have been processed on time however the owner reached out to me asking if I wanted to wait for the updated version.  I decided to wait.  I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, but the product I received is top notch!  It works so well that I bought a second one for a friend of mine.  No complaints about the product or the seller.  A simple solution to a common problem.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I received my BIGblade order last week. First I want to say: Thank you for delivering me from that battery operated trimmer with the narrow blade, and the nearly impossible process of a gel cream hair remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The BIGblade works great and ultimately I will use it much more often than the other methods since it is less time consuming and much easier. It&#x27;s marketed as not needing shaving cream but I use it in the shower while soaped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will say: The one thing I would like to be different is the angle of the blade. The blade seems to be at a very steep arc toward the handle. I would like to see a lesser angle or maybe the option to purchase blades that are set at an angle more away from the handle, but not a big enough issue to cost a star. Maybe an business option for the future? Regardless, I am a fan of the bIGblade and thanks for listening.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would shave close enough that it would not leave you feeling stubbly. It works really well though. Makes a PITA task quick and easy!</li>
            <li> I just used my new bakblade yesterday for the first time. It took me only 5 minutes to shave my entire back, neck and upper arms!  Very close shave. Smooth. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I got this product and used it right away, could not believe how easy it was. Previously I had been using the Mangroomer, but that&#x27;s a different review. A few days after using the Bakblade I noticed a painful razor burn that burned every time my shirt brushed it. The burn went away after a few days and then I noticed a lot of ingrown hairs that were causing me to breakout in a rash as well. Loved the ease of use of the product but not the rash.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Does not leave razor burn, scrapes, cuts, or scratches on my back (unlike the Mangroomer).  Also works much quicker than the Mangroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have unwanted back hair, don&#x27;t waste your time with any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well enough that even my husband uses it.</li>
            <li> I hate my back hair. It&#x27;s probably the thing about me I&#x27;d most like to change right up there with my receding hairline (ha - maybe I should transfer it from my back to my forehead!!!). I had an electric version from a competitor and while it worked well, it has nothing on the baKBlade BIGMOUTH. The first time I used this I was amazed. Just gently move the safety blade across you back and the hair just falls to the floor. It left my back extremely smooth and lasted about 10-14 days before needing attention again. The second time was even easier. I will be purchasing blade refills so I can enjoy using this for years to come!</li>
            <li> I have used Nair for Men in the past which works pretty good, but it&#x27;s expensive, messy, and hard to apply to certain areas of one&#x27;s own back. I was skeptical of this product when I first saw it, but there were plenty of good reviews so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. This will be another good review as I have been extremely pleased with this shaver. It&#x27;s easy to use making all areas of the back reachable, and it does a good job. I actually jumped on here today to order replacement blades and I plan to continue using this shaver.</li>
            <li> fantastic product.  If you have a hairy back, I highly recommend buying this</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes to inform me that my back is very hairy and I look like Sasquatch. lol. Once I went in for a 30 minute waxing which was an experience I don&#x27;t think I would ever want to go through again. So I looked around for another solution as just not worrying about it was not an option. This item is designed very well, I was able to reach every area on my back and take care of everything within 5 minutes by myself with a hand mirror. It feels like someone is scratching your back and is very pleasant. Thanks to this product I do believe my girlfriend and I will both be much happier. Thank you to whomever designed this!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this item last fall and was not impressed.  I was given a refund and they allowed me to keep the product.  I was told there was a new blade design that was coming out this year and they would send me a new one when available.  I just got the new blade yesterday, it is awesome.  If you bought this last year and did not like it, give it another chance, well worth the wait.  The customer service has been nothing less than impressive.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this.  The first time it never arrived.  Great response time from the company but still, it never got to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose to give them another chance.  So glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I am geeking out about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Really close shave&lt;br /&gt;~ FAST!  Less time than an electric back shaver that shall not be mentioned&lt;br /&gt;~ NO burn or raw skin like an electric back shaver that shall not be mentioned&lt;br /&gt;~ Came with THREE blades!  WHAT?  THREE!&lt;br /&gt;~ Sturdy material.  Should survive travel (since it survived shipping, see below)&lt;br /&gt;~ Very (very) easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was a little (has since passed) mad about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Was shipped in a bubble envelope.  I live FPO, AE.  I&#x27;m really surprised it made it in tact but really happy it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to high light:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order this thing.  You will not be disappointed.  Packaging needs to improve.  Put it in a box folks!  Great engineering, build and quality.  Keep that part up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as they don&#x27;t raise the price beyond reason on the blades, I will be a return customer.</li>
            <li> If you have moles, skin tags on your back, this may not work for you.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!  After trying several different products this one stands above all the rest and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> great tool for any man wanting to take care of his own back hair or any hard to reach body hair problem areas.</li>
            <li> Tried the baKblade for the first time as soon as I got home from work today. This is possibly the best purchase I have ever made. I&#x27;m a fairly hairy guy, and it&#x27;s so creepy to ask a girl friend or family member to shave my back. It took me less than 5 minutes for entire back. Now I can have complete confidence without a shirt on. I will definitely be ordering replacement blades. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. Smooth back, no helper, no lube...? C&#x27;mon seriously?  I received this thing a couple of days before a week-long trip to Cancun and used it right away. This thing was awesome! No irritation, easy to use. My back was the envy of the beach. Thanks baKblade!</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times. Works better than I expected. I wish I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> Okay, I immediately used it, and nicked myself a few times, but it felt good to not have those little hairs bugging me.</li>
            <li> It really works great! However only because I got extra blades I was able to use it because my blade was broke upon delivery.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  The blade system is nothing more than three safety razor blades packaged next to each other.  The tricky bit are the blade guards.  The teeth in front of the blades do a great job of protecting skin.  Don&#x27;t be too aggressive - you will get minor scratches if you go too fast.  The only negative I can think of is price.  Just seems like there is a huge markup for injection molded plastic and three safety razor blades.</li>
            <li> I ordered the BakBlade for my hubby after researching TONS of other similar products, including one that was the &amp;#34;Best Selling&amp;#34; at the time. I am VERY thorough about researching products before I buy them, especially when buying online. After a lot of researching by both my husband &amp; myself, we decided to try the BakBlade. And after ONE USE, according to my husband, it was the right decision and &amp;#34;The best invention since sliced bread&amp;#34;. LOL!  We BOTH noticed that the overall QUALITY of the BakBlade was FAR SUPERIOR to even the &amp;#34;TOP OF THE LINE&amp;#34; shaver(s) offered by competing company(s). Especially when you take in to consideration the fact that no matter how well the competing brands &amp;#34;Handles&amp;#34; are designed, they still only house regular size disposable men&#x27;s razors as compared to the specially designed Wide-Mouth Razor of the BakBlade. And if you&#x27;re wondering about the maintenance costs involved in buying the BakBlade replacement shaver sets (2 for $9.99)-We purchased the BakBlade on July 17th (Received less than a week later) and my husband has used it AT LEAST 7 times and has YET to change the FIRST BLADE! How much hair does he have to shave? Before the BakBlade, he had THICK, COURSE HAIR that covered his ENTIRE BACK, SHOULDERS &amp; SIDES!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU BAKBLADE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ran across something like this when looking at solutions to the &amp;#34;hairy back&amp;#34; syndrome. After researching the thousands of dollars I&#x27;d pay for laser hair removal or the couple hundred on waxing, I decided to give this thing a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it today and tried it instantly. I also purchased the replacement set along with it, just in case it turned out to be good. But it wasn&#x27;t good, it was AMAZING. Using exactly as advertised, you scratch your back (or any area you please) in an up and down motion (for best results) and it seems to MELT the hair away! It sometimes takes a few swipes, but it looks like I shaved with a cream and razor, which is FAR more than what I expected from this product. I might actually have to use this thing all over myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I have something so I can easily groom myself, boost my self-esteem, wear clothing I never wore due to embarrassment, and never have to ask another person to &amp;#34;do my back&amp;#34; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial investment for the shaver itself IS a little pricey, as it is just a handle and a blade (although VERY ergonomic and easy to reach all areas of my back). If it continues to work like it just did now, the price is worth it and I&#x27;ll be bulking up on the replacement shavers soon.</li>
            <li> The baKblade is nothing short of awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It is simple and easy to use. I was skeptical of dry shaving my back or even shaving it at all since I have sensitive skin. The BakBlade works as advertised in the fact that it feels like you are using a back scratcher but the end result is a back that is smooth and hair free. It even cleans up the 5 day back shadow with ease. You can use it in the shower with or without shaving cream. If you want to use it with shaving cream or gel, you might still need some one to put that on your back for you, which takes the Do-It-Yourself-ness right out of the picture. Maybe they&#x27;ll add a conditioning strip to the blades or a shave lotion applicator attachment to it for those that have super sensitive skin in a future version.</li>
            <li> Very thankful for your service! The blades are obviously brand new and work trumendously!&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend the product to anyone with no hesitation.</li>
            <li> I would like to congratulate you on finally coming up with a product that allows me to get rid of the hair on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything in the past.... waxing, electric razors, having my wife shave it for me. All were a &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;, because, I needed assistance to reach certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon your product when considering the purchase of the Mangroomer Ultimate Back Shaver.  I opted to try the Bakblade instead since I&#x27;ve unsuccessfully tried two other electric shavers already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Bakblade arrived today, I went to the washroom to try out, and it works exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would post a video, but am too modest to be on Youtube shirtless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Easy to reach and manscape</li>
            <li> A must have for guy with HOB!</li>
            <li> Works great, better than a powered shaver. As long as the blade is kept flat against skin, shouldn&#x27;t experience any cuts.</li>
            <li> well worth it... but if you are not careful, it can cut you</li>
            <li> A million stars! Thank u bakblades for this awesome product.</li>
            <li> Please see my review for the replacement blades for this product for detailed review. The short story is that this thing is awesome and is the best product of it type I&#x27;ve ran across.</li>
            <li> Though I appreciate the extension the blade is not sharp enough. Why so many positive reviews? Its sitting on a shelf and i dont know what to do with it. I was expecting smooth the blade has a great size but it is not sharp? What a shame thought I found what i was looking for</li>
            <li> After using an electric back shaver for a year the head went bad. Decided on this because you can get a closer Shave and replace the blades. Postal service misplaced shipment GREAT customer service. I recommend !</li>
            <li> I received my baKBlade in a timely fashion.  The product works extremely well and is easy to use.  The handle had broken during shipping and baKBlade replaced the handle within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works and the company is honorable.</li>
            <li> Easy review. This works. You need a mirror and this shaver and you are good to go. Take it slow and try it dry with no foam or any thing at first. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Hello Amazon Customers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I look like a gorilla I bought this product.  The product is terrible and doesn&#x27;t actually work.  Absolutely a terrible product and if you notice it looks like a ICE SCRAPER for your car, which is EXACTLY what it is.  I wish I would have looked at all the reviews when I purchased the product because once I realized this piece of garbage was bad I saw this youtube video: Copy and paste to your browser: I was shocked when I saw the video, but then at the same time, suddenly what was happening made complete sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked when I saw the Youtube video (search Youtube for: Amazon Seller bakBlade) of the company owner doing multiple reviews and video reviews of his own product claiming he was a customer, posing as different people and that he purchased it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they scam you to get you to buy it they aren&#x27;t going to give you your money back.  Amazon really needs to address this because what this guy is doing is a scam. He is faking all the 5 star reviews and using multiple identities to mask his operation to suck you into buying this poorly manufactured piece of equipment. If you want a demo go out to your car and try your ICE SCRAPER first before you buy this, same results probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the negatives and notice a similar pattern. Scammers. Thanks MATT, if that is your real name, for everything you didn&#x27;t do when you scammed me.</li>
            <li> it works fast, it works easy and it just works. Was using an electric Mangroomer but wanted a non-electric option I could use in the shower. Works great!</li>
            <li> Changed my life. I am able to get my back shaved quickly and efficiently, and it does an awesome job. Water and shaving cream are a must. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I used it to get to the stubborn areas (shoulder blades, mid back) that were normally unreachable. I&#x27;m a pretty flexible guy, but some areas are impossible to shave with just a regular razor. Do note that it is a razor blade and if you apply too much pressure you can still cut yourself even with the guard. Also if you are going to shave dry make sure to put after shave on as if you have fairly thick back hair it will get razor burn. I have used it both dry and wet and it works great with both applications. However, it is a little harder to clean after a wet shave. The large blade covers shaves large areas at a time making it a less timely process. All around awesome investment and still cheaper than laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> Shaves my man&#x27;s back like a charm Thx Amazon , 1 less job I gotta do :) he loves it</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever bought Ever 😀</li>
            <li> Works awesome!  BTW I am not Hillery, her hubby.  I can shave just fine with no help!</li>
            <li> My sincere thanks and appreciation for your wonderful product.  It exceeded even my greatest expectations.  I have recommended your product to numerous friends and associates and wish you much luck and success with it !  You deserve to be a millionaire !!!!!</li>
            <li> Was hesitant because of the reported initial bogus reviews. But the recent verified purchase reviews were positive and I was unhappy with the original mangroomer that I&#x27;d been using. This works great and it&#x27;s fast. First use caused a little irritation, second use none as the skin got conditioned. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, 10 minutes once a month saves me loads of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> there is nothing i dislike about this product..  The support is great.  The thing works very quickly...  I haven&#x27;t gauged how long the  blades last.. Because the first i one i used for such a long time..</li>
            <li> Love the bak-blade. Simple. Easy. Really quick and effective. Wish I found it earlier. Can use on back, arms and other areas with efficacy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting a back scratch, where at the end, you suddenly have not a single hair on your back.. in a word, delightful!</li>
            <li> Just buy this item. This might be the first item that i have decided to review . I was shocked because of the great job this shaver did. I have a very hairy back &amp; have tried other shavers,&lt;br /&gt;I wasted my money on two, yes two battery with extended handle back shavers that did not work. THEY HURT (pulled hair), took forever (had to shave same spot over &amp; over). Electric &amp; battery back shavers were waste of money &amp; time.&lt;br /&gt;This item was: 100% - back hairless, very quick &amp; easy to use, actually felt nice while using (like a back scratcher).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on any battery fold out razers.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy this Item. Wished I had one of these for the last 20 years !!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing rocks...easy to use...doesn&#x27;t chafe my skin....I use this on my back...and just shave my chest and belly with a razor...honestly though....get rid of that nasty back hair....</li>
            <li> Does what it says, well made product, and above all the customer service was incredible.  I had a slight problem with one of the blades when it arrived and they sent me three new blades and a new handle for free with expedited shipping.  I was stunned and pleasantly surprised.  Product works great!</li>
            <li> Product works great but I ended up with a monster of a razor burn that lasted for a week. Will not be using this again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I buy Amazon stuff regularly.  This is the first review I am ever leaving.  I am a furry guy...  embarrassingly furry.  I hate asking my girlfriend to shave my creepy back and in the past I have even paid my daughter.  I was very hesitant to buy this but I did and I used it today for the first time.  This thing is awesome.  It took me a while to get er done maybe 15 minutes but it is closer than I have gotten it ever and I was able to get every area!  I am not the most limber guy so I was concerned about that.  All I have ever used in the past is clippers to basically shear my back and it wasn&#x27;t as close as the blade here.  I have always been a little self conscious of this to the point I didn&#x27;t wear white dress shirts to work unless I had a t-shirt on under.  It is normally 100 plus here in the summer time and a t-shirt is over kill at this point.  If you are on the fence, just do it.  Thanks for having this out there.  I hope you do well so when I need more blades I will be able to buy them.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I received an e-mail from the President of the company saying they were about to release the new model in the next couple weeks and would I like to wait for it?  I agreed, and he promptly let me know when it was ready and communicated the shipping/tracking info as well.  Great client experience from this company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product, awesome!  Especially for something that is so inexpensive.  It does a very good job of getting rid of all my back hair and even as a guy that isn&#x27;t very flexible it is still very easy for me to do.  I will say there is just a tiny bit of stubble you can feel, much like when you use a electric vs. traditional razor.  I believe if I took the time to use shaving cream it would work even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li> Simply Awesome. It was a bit awkward at first, but when I got the hang of this thing, it was just like using a back scratcher. There&#x27;s no worries at all -- I never felt like I was going to cut myself or that it wasn&#x27;t doing a good job. I&#x27;ve used chemicals and tried wax as well, but this is the best by far. If you&#x27;re hesitating about buying this, stop it. Just get it, try it, and never beg your wife-girlfriend-boyfriend-whatever to help you with the rather nasty job of back hair removal.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my husband and it&#x27;s been love at first use. He is very happy with how well it works and how easy it is for him to use. Considering how picky he can be about everything, I found that to be a home run! If you&#x27;re looking for a back shaver, take it from me via my husband and shop no further, this is the razor for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Mangroomer for my back grooming needs (the cheaper version when it first came out), and I was set on buying the updated version of the Mangroomer until I came across the BakBlade on Amazon and saw the customer video. What you see in the video is representative of the ease of use and stellar results of the BakBlade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 10-15 minutes on the first go around. I had no problems reaching all areas of my back. The shoulders were the hardest for me to best angle the blade and get those pesky hairs with several pass throughs, but the learning curve is fast and I imagine it will get even easier and less time consuming over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company before I bought the product and received a prompt reply guaranteeing me that if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product, I&#x27;d get a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never thought I&#x27;d be looking forward to shaving my back now. Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only bad is that this product is somewhat pricey and shipping seems a bit high just to send replacement blades. I&#x27;d recommend purchasing the extra replacement blades when you buy the BakBlade to save on future shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish they would market this product better and be at the top of Google searches so that others would know this product exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I had to for this product because of the appreciation I feel towards this company and their stellar product. They&#x27;ve helped make my life a bit easier. Very thankful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I started using the product in September, using it about once every 2 weeks, and now I&#x27;m ready to replace the blade for the first time (over 2.5 to 3 months time). The BakBlade has continued to work really well, and my shaving time has come down to 5-8 minutes on each go around. Still very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> FUNNY BUT IT WORKS DAMN GOOD</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like my back hair so I decided to invest in this one.  I little on the expensive side but decided it was worth it and to my surprise was the best one I have ever had.  When you pull it along, it doesn&#x27;t hurt what so ever.  Got all the hair off.  Blades come off easily.  Still using the original blade.  Hasn&#x27;t dulled yet.</li>
            <li> If you read the reviews for this product, they do seem like they might be fake. This is especially true when most others did not write any other reviews. Hell, I&#x27;ve never written a review. BUT, I have to tell you, this thing exceeded all my expectations. It was easy to use, took care of my back hair and I look forward to using it in the future. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Been waiting for a product like this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, a little getting used to arching your body into different positions for best results.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, I can use it by myself, I don&#x27;t need any help reaching all areas of the back.&lt;br /&gt;Just shave your back and then hop in the shower, clean up floor after your done.&lt;br /&gt;Again, would definitely recommend. Highly recommended seller!!! Thanks Chris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.C.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical when i saw this and read some of the reviews.  Actually it looked a little cheap out of the package - a little flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say - this product rocks.  Easy to use.  I didn&#x27;t even have to use it in shower.  Didn&#x27;t even need water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used it twice and that damm hair on my back that pisses me off and is hard to get at - it&#x27;s all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a steal.  Works great.  I am hooked.  Wish it wouldn&#x27;t have taken me so long to stumble on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jungle on my back is gone!</li>
            <li> Purchased and received yesterday.  I immediately had to give it a try.  Have to say its awesome!  I&#x27;m glad someone thought of this.  I used it without water before a shower.  Easy to use and no pain.  I was worried about irritation the day after as I work in the sun and sweat a lot...happy to report that I had zero irritation or bumps.  Really happy with product as I get a full coat :-) and this did what was promised.  Don&#x27;t hesitate as I did for weeks contemplating the purchase.  Buy Now!</li>
            <li> I must say that I am equally impressed by this product and by bakblades customer service.  I have been searching for a tool like this for a long time, and I was skeptical when I ordered it that I would either experience stubble or a scratchy feeling while shaving.  Neither of those were the case.  I get a close, clean shave and have not had any issues.  The blades glide on my back and get the job down without any fuss.</li>
            <li> I should caveat this review with the fact that i&#x27;ve only used the bakblade once now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I feel stupid for calling it a baKblade, even though that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called and I didn&#x27;t make it up, it&#x27;s a genius product that works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;As a man who is hairier on my back than I am on my head, I&#x27;ve employed a lot of methods of hair removal. Waxing is painful and a huge process, a long armed buzzer tore my back to shreds, and one time I tried to nair my whole body and almost burnt my nipple right off. This back blade is easy, quick, and left my back looking smooth and hairless. So far I haven&#x27;t experience any averse reactions, although I do fear in grown hairs may be inevitable.</li>
            <li> It worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had imagined a product like this for years, hoping somebody would invent it, and today that dream came true. I had been using depilatories for awhile--Nair for Men, Veet for women--and they were gross, smelly, and burned if you didn&#x27;t use them the right way, not to mention the fact that I had to look around to find the right kind of thing to apply it with, turn around to see myself in a mirror (and still get it on haphazardly) and then stand in the shower for an inordinate amount of time to get it off.  Before that I went through two Mangroomers.  The first one fell apart when the blade loosened, and even the replacement blades wouldn&#x27;t stay on well.  Same with the second one, in addition to the fact that the blades are so small that you have to keep guessing where you&#x27;re hitting and how it will turn out--and you need to use it in the shower where there&#x27;s no mirror, unless you want to clean hair out of the entire bathroom for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now comes baKblade&#x27;s &amp;#34;BIGMOUTH.&amp;#34;  I happened to search Amazon for a back hair shaver, thinking maybe somebody out there invented something, and whoa, there it was.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it existed, because it was just the thing I pictured somebody should invent for this headache.  I ordered it and it came priority mail in a few days.  This afternoon I threw my shirt off and went at it, and it worked unbelievably!  First, it feels like a back scratcher as it shaves you (it works like one of those old barber&#x27;s scissors with the comb/blade).  It&#x27;s fast, painless (actually stimulating, like a nice back rub) and gets the hair off immediately.  No worries about a mirror, because the blade&#x27;s wide enough to get a sense of where it&#x27;s covering your back. My only recommendation is to stand in the shower when you use it, since the hair falls everywhere.  It&#x27;s light years beyond the Mangroomer in efficiency and ease of use (the handle&#x27;s the perfect length to reach your whole back, shoulders etc. without having to see what you&#x27;re doing), and it works phenomenally.  Get this thing into stores--FAST!), and it works phenomenally.  Get this thing into stores--FAST!</li>
            <li> Listen men! You a want a tool for your grooming needs! Do you have back hair that makes you feel uncomfortable to take your shirt off? I did. No joke this baKblade works with ease.  Thick hair was my problem and it took care of it like a lawn mower.  I will definitely use this product for as long as I have back hair growing.  Plus it&#x27;s way cheaper than laser hair removal!</li>
            <li> Hi Matt,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive the baKblade in a timely manner and I am pleased to say that it works great!  Takes a little time getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s fairly easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to use this feedback for review purposes.  I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Simply put. The best product I&#x27;ve tried!  Quick and easy and painless and the shave lasts for a good amount of time! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best way to get rid of the hairy ape back!!  I have used everything else and  bakblade  blows them away. It is so easy I use it a couple times a week. With the other products I used them only once a month or when I was going to the pool.  It only takes a few minutes, I wish shaving my face was as easy and fast. I already ordered extra blades because I know I will using this forever.  I am going to buy another one just for travel. Now there is no reason to have a hairy back.</li>
            <li> Matt,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The bakblade is perfect! As another reviewer posted...I fired my wife much to her happiness! I highly recommend it for anyone that wants to keep a clean back as the blade is incredibly easy to use. I&#x27;ll be purchasing a replacement blade soon. Thank you again for creating the product!</li>
            <li> This thing really works! I was really happy with it right off the bat. Shaving my entire 48 year old, heavily forested back was a very simple, and even fun, experience. I would encourage first time users to use this in the shower as the amount of hair it takes off is amazing. I felt like I was having a very nice back scratch the entire time.</li>
            <li> I used to give this product 5 stars but not anymore.  The blades go dull very fast and the replacements are very expensive compared to other back shavers.  The quality of blades used to be good and one blade would last a while but not anymore.  I&#x27;m lucky if I get half of my back done before having to change blades.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, go look at cheaper options.</li>
            <li> I have tried foams (messy, time-consuming, and takes another person to get all the stuff off), an electric razor (didn&#x27;t get close at all), a hinged bladed thing (wouldn&#x27;t stay bent in one position), and even duct-taping an actual razor to a stick!  I have used one that you stick an actual razor blade into the end, but those are costly.  BUT...this Bigmouth blade is the BEST hands down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wide blade so it&#x27;s faster, the new version even shaves just as close as the razor blade, and I can reach my entire back, just takes a few minutes and I&#x27;m done.  I use it once a week to keep things trimmed up.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Every hairy man should get one, What an invention!! I have used it 5 times and blade is still like new.</li>
            <li> Does your back look more like a sweater? Do small children run away in fear when you take your shirt off at the pool? If so, then you should seriously consider the Bakblade product, as I too, have been blessed with the gift of back hair. And after using this product, those days are long gone. Wow does this thing really work. Once I opened the pack I went right to work, and in a matter of less than 15 minutes I was able to see my back amidst the hair! I didn&#x27;t even take the time to trim the hair down...just went to work as is and this thing plowed through the overgrowth like a hot knife through butter. I was completely blown away by how effective and easy this was to do.  I will say that you have to contort your arms in weird ways to be able to reach all the parts of the back. However, no big deal, this thing is magic. If you&#x27;ve got back hair, you need a Bakblade ASAP!!!</li>
            <li> First- the packaging. product arrived in a simple padded mailer. THANK YOU for not encasing it in a nail-busting, finger-slicing blisterpak! Though humble in appearance, the tool works perfectly. I have used other back-hair products. This is by far the best.</li>
            <li> So, originally, I found this product, and thought it sounded like a dream come true, so I started reading the reviews.  I read a few of the good reviews, then I looked at just the negatives.  There were very few, but they stated that all the good reviews were fake.  So, I became very skeptical, and just let it slip my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month or so later, I came across a video by AlphaM on youtube showing the product.  He showed a demonstration on a friend, since he, himself, did not have much hair to trim. Now, AlphaM is an image consultant and does what he can to help guys look their best.  It&#x27;s his business, so endorsing a product that is faulty or doesn&#x27;t work well would be bad for his business.  With this thought in mind, I went ahead and risked buying the baKblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the item today, and the curiosity overcame.  I opened the package right away, and examined it.  It seemed like an interesting product.  I gave it a shot.  In using it, it simply felt like someone was scratching my back.  I was using it dry, but there was no pain.  No, I wouldn&#x27;t say the product holds the blade away from your skin, because the way you pull it, pulls the blade onto your skin.  So maybe someone who has sensitive skin may not like the product.  For myself though, it was fine, and I was happily surprised that the product, did indeed work.  It takes some work to get some of the angles right, but it does what it promises, and it amazingly easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am highly satisfied with the product, and will continue to use it.  We, men, finally have a product that can help with the back hair issue, and being a gay man, it&#x27;s nice to finally have one that works.  Buy it, give it a shot.  You WON&#x27;T regret it. :-)</li>
            <li> Super happy with this product. I was surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li> What a great item!!! I used this for the first time today and was amazed at how quickly this took care of back hair. It usually takes a lot of time with the electric shaver I was using with an extended handle that is built in. The blade is so wide on the bakblade that it covers alot of skin quickly and I was done within a minute. I don&#x27;t have a ton of back hair but enough that I&#x27;m self conscious of it. This was the easiest and fastest method I&#x27;ve ever tried. Also worked for the buttocks. If you have hair there it does the job pretty well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, if there is one, is the cost of this item and the replacement blades. The prices seems a little steep for what it is. Granted I didn&#x27;t think of it and whoever did should be rewarded for coming up with such a great item, but for plastic and common every day blades, which I assume is what inside the cover guard shouldn&#x27;t run that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s a great item regardless and I would highly recommend to anyone with back hair issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a mangroomer for years, but decided to give this a try. The large blade and forgiving comb on the blade allow you to give yourself a faster and closer shave than the the alternative. I hated using the mangroomer, but I used it because well it had to be done. With the bakblade it&#x27;s much less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> works better than expected.</li>
            <li> Back hair was something I was always concerned with. In my teens I was ashamed to take off my shirt when at the beach or a pool party. It wasn&#x27;t pretty. As an adult I waxed, had girlfriends shave me, even had a series of laser treatments done which cost thousands. While the laser treatment was wonderful, I still had hair that needed to disappear and a much lighter pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy a lot of things on Amazon and decided I&#x27;ll give it one last try and turn to Amazon for my embarrassing back hair. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Shaver has a safety blade and appears well made. It took off my remaining back hair with ease. It felt so good to put on a shirt and have it slide down. My back is now smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. It&#x27;s been almost two weeks and I&#x27;m coming close to another grooming, but now can take care of this in the privacy of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price of admission!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how quickly this was shipped but even more surprised at how well it works.  There is nothing really fancy about this, but it is very effective at shaving the hair right off your back.  Granted, I have not used any similar product, but I don&#x27;t think I ever would.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy the bakblade is to use. The blade is big enough where you can do your whole back in under 5 minutes. The handle is long enough as well to get every inch of your back shaved. The best part is you dont need shaving cream so there is no mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m recommending the bakblade to all my friends and family. Do yourself a favor and pick this up. It&#x27;ll be the best investment you&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap. $42.90 for a item that worked twice, and hardly worked twice. Other products out there is easier and a lot less money!</li>
            <li> Ive been very happy with it. I have tried others but, this has been the best by far! Buy it now!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first after seeing this product. I decided to purchase it, and must say that it is as advertised. I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> Take it from an Italian dude.  This thing works like a boss.</li>
            <li> wow! i&#x27;m speechless. I&#x27;ve had an issue with back hair for some time and it&#x27;s not easy to find someone who will shave your back for you. I saw a youtube video demonstrating the BakBlade and after some time of hesitating, I suddenly became single and needed to manscape. I took the plunge and order this bad boy. I used it dry and WOW! It was so easy to get all angles of my back. The only issue I think I have is that it says the blades will need to be switched out after 5 - 7 uses. That kinda sucks but we will see if it really becomes a hassle. To me though, it&#x27;s worth it because my back is so smooth.</li>
            <li> Loving the baKblade!! I got mine in the other day and imediately gave it a try. It worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I received a 2nd shipment with an extra blade after the USPS lost the 1st one.  It works great!  I wish I&#x27;d bought it sooner.  I was wary of paying $35 bucks plus shipping, but it&#x27;s worth it.  It is quick and easy.  I&#x27;ve tried electric trimmers but it was a pain.  This is simple.</li>
            <li> having had a number of electric body shavers and having grown tired of batteries that become uncharge-able with little heads that pop off as i tried and contort my body to get that hard to reach place on my back i thought i would give the analog option a try.  and the short review is as follows,  it delivered as promised.  i got a clean close shave with little to no trouble or difficulty.  i did manage to cut myself but it wasn&#x27;t bad and i&#x27;ll take the blame for it as i tend to be a little over aggressive with new toys to see just how far they&#x27;ll go before breaking themselves or me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only problem with the bakblade is that when i look at it i don&#x27;t see thirty-five dollars worth of (chinese?) plastic and steel, especially with another eight bucks in shipping and handling -that was neither quick not communicative.  can a product that does everything it claims be considered a rip-off?  not really but i&#x27;m still not overly pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just received the bakblade along with 2 replacement blades about 35 minutes ago. In that time I opened the package, inspected everything, walked to the spare bath, disrobed, shaved my back, upper arms and butt. I did it dry. Then cleaned up and got dressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS THING ROCKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy. Not full on berber carport, but I took off 3 solid hand fulls of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some quick tips... Use very light, short, back and forth stokes. Keep adjusting the angle till you get it just right. You&#x27;ll know pretty quick what the right angle is for each position from sound feel and effectiveness. Keep a damp cloth or paper towel handy to wipe the blade off. Hairs get caught between the teeth and make it less effective until you wipe them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Nair, hair clippers, razors and wax. This is by far my favorite. This is easy doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is my butt got a little razor burn. I&#x27;ve never done my butt before. I figured no one was gonna see that at the beach. This was so quick and easy I figured why the hell not.</li>
            <li> Tried several battery powered/electric body hair shaver solutions and this solution/design is soooo much easier and effective...and it doesn&#x27;t need batteries or electricity. Seriously, it works great. I really only have a couple trouble ares, but could never reach those spots with the electric body groomers I had purchased, this product has great reach/coverage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of back hair just a couple of hard to reach areas I don&#x27;t like.  Bakblade works perfect.</li>
            <li> Was broken upon arrival but I took the blade and held it with my hand and it did not work at all. Would like my money back.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I finally received the product July 23, 2015 delivered by Fedex after the first shipment was lost with USPS. Seller included extra blades for delay. I am excited to try the product, but it looks like a great product for what I was looking for. Rating upgrade from 1 start to a 4 star.</li>
            <li> Got the Bakblade the first part of this week and gave it a try the other day. It works great! I was going to wait because a have a bit of limited mobility in my right shoulder and am just getting over carpal tunnel and trigger finger surgery in my right hand. I&#x27;m a wreck right now :-) I wasn&#x27;t sure how easy it would be using the Bakblade with both things combined. I ended up trying anyway and am pleased to report that it worked great. Aside from the blade doing a very good job I found the handle length and shape made it pretty easy to get my entire back even with my bad shoulder and slightly gimpy hand right now. No issues and my wife was happy she didn&#x27;t have to do it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I would recommend this to anyone! I wish there was a smaller hand-held version for the neck and chest areas.</li>
            <li> Great...!  I don&#x27;t have to worry for ask friend or wife do for me. I do myself that is big help. Suggest u to order that...  No pain or cut at all. Cool...</li>
            <li> I am a hairy dude and my back and chest get like a rug, literally.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Mangroomer Pro to clear my back hair.&lt;br /&gt;Until now... I tried the baKblade and it works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;First, it is just like using a back scratcher.&lt;br /&gt;It is so comfortable and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;No shaving cream is required. It feels fine.&lt;br /&gt;The baKblade is going to be my new tool for clearing my back hair now.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very affordable solution.&lt;br /&gt;It is very simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;It is very comfortable to my skin and it really gets the hair off!&lt;br /&gt;Nuff said…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin C. Potter&lt;br /&gt;Orlando, Florida</li>
            <li> I love using the bakblade. There is no pain, it actually feels good like a back scratch and the design is nice so you can get every hair. I have a lot of scars on my back and was worried if the razor would open them or just cut the skin were the threads were because it left my skin a little bumpy and it didn&#x27;t and was very pleased at how smooth my back was after using it. I can now go to the beach or a pool party without being self conscious. This is truly a great product.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the baKBlade, and I&#x27;m thrilled with it.  It arrived promptly and in good packaging.  It works amazingly well.  My back hair is very tough, so I use it as a wet shaver, though it does work dry for my shoulders.  At its low retail price, I expected shoddy construction, and I was just planning on using it until it breaks and then get a new one.  To my surprise, the manufacturing quality is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips for new users:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Try to do it without a mirror, but rather by feel.  Shaving behind you in a mirror can be disorienting.  Doing it by feel makes it easier to cover all of the &amp;#34;real estate.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. For the recess running up and down the spine in between the lat muscles, shave horizontally in both directions.  This way the blade can get in there and cover the recessed area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. A good companion product is a Loofa.  This helps spread the shaving cream, and it will prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The best &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; appliance for shaving your back, but not perfect. Since you are using it without any kind of lubricant on your back it dryes your skin. Otherwise it&#x27;s perfect for the job, well done.</li>
            <li> I just got home from work at 11pm and checked the mail , and was excited to find my Bakblade. I have used razors, Norelco Body Groomer,and my wife&#x27;s favorite waxing,she still says I screamed like a girl . I unwrapped it read the brief instructions and stood in front of mirror and started shaving. I used a hand mirror to see what I was doing. I did not pre shave the area as suggested,and my hair was quite long three plus inches . Bakblade worked as advertised,I dried shaved,and then took a shower lathered up and continued,in ten minutes hair was gone.Thanks for a great product, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was first made aware of this product via [...] and being very hairy I started doing my homework on it. I read tons of reviews here on Amazon and discovered several posts that loved the Bakblade and many others that claimed the positive reviews were skullduggery on the part of the product&#x27;s creator. I don&#x27;t know what all that is about but I&#x27;ve bought the Bakblade, I&#x27;ve used it, and I love it! Its a great product that does remove the hair as advertised and I can now groom my back without my wife&#x27;s help.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, inexpensive, effective, no hassle, done!</li>
            <li> I (or my wife) have been shaving/trimming the damn hair on my back for many, many years now. We have been using various tools including a regular barbers electric clipper on a crazy homemade extension. Recently I found a add for baKblade&#x27;s bigmouth, and bought one. This was the single best tool I have ever bought!  It is one device that is inexpensive and actually works as advertised. I wish it was available a long time ago. Now I don&#x27;t have to bother my wife as I can easily do it myself. No scratching and easy/quick to use. If you are one of the unfortunate guys with an embarrassing back full of hair, then BUY THIS, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product! Amazed at how efficient the blade is. I did forget about a mole on my back and nicked it, but otherwise it made short work of the hair. Feels great to have a smooth back again. Would def buy again, and glad I went ahead and got the refill blades.</li>
            <li> works good. just a little expensive</li>
            <li> Works better then anything Ive tried and I can actually shave my whole back in less then 5 minutes now.</li>
            <li> Got my baKblade today and am very impressed with your product!  I finally feel like I am in control of my baKhair (haha) without relying on anybody else.  Easy and effective.  I wish that I had this product for the  past 30 years!  I hope your company is around for a long, long time, because you have a new, regular customer here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> im going to say the same as everyone else. i have tried all kinds of back shavers before this only to be wishing for somethijg better. this is that something better. it is great!! i am blown away by how simpleyet effective this is. i could barely feel it glide on my back then i ecpected itvto leave stubble. i feltmy back to ind smooth with my first time shaving it. thank you for making a great product.</li>
            <li> This product does a better job on my back then any electric ever has. it cuts to the skin while protecting from cutting your skin. I use it once a week and have had it for about a month and a half. I use it dry and when i am in the shower. I will order new blades soon. Buy this product it really works and its easy to get to areas of your back.</li>
            <li> My direct contact with the company was fantastic.  I initially ordered a shaver and a replacement set.  I sent the company an e-mail when the replacement set was left out of my initial order.  I think the replacement heads were then sent out within 24 hours of my initial e-mal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for as your product, I think it&#x27;s great.  I haven&#x27;t yet perfected it on my shoulders, but for my back, I&#x27;m a convert.  It&#x27;s quick, easy, and relatively inexpensive.  No chemicals and no unwanted smell.  And maybe most importantly, no irritation.  My biggest difficulty is remembering how to put the cover back on when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. Only used it once but like it so far. Interested to see how long the blade lasts.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I bought this using my wife&#x27;s Amazon account. I&#x27;m pretty self-conscious about back hair and was a little skeptical, but this product really works. I&#x27;ve done the nair, the waxing, etc. and like the results but the cost and the pain makes it hard. I used it and it took literally 10 seconds to get the hang of it. I decided to use it with shaving cream, because I figured I wouldn&#x27;t ever dry-shave my face, so I&#x27;m not going to do it to my back. It&#x27;s not as smooth as waxing or nair obviously but still really smooth. Not at all itchy under a t-shirt either. Really, really pleased with this product and plan to recommend it to my hairy brethren.</li>
            <li> Great product it works well and it really cuts the hair close. You should definitely buy it and give it a try.</li>
            <li> Does a good job reaching every part of my back, I just wish the blades lasted longer. Says they last for 6 uses.</li>
            <li> I got mine in the mail after only 3 days. I have to say I am thoroughly impressed. It makes your skin completely smooth with no stubble at all and it only took me about 5 minutes. This is the first thing I&#x27;ve bought off amazon besides textbooks and now I&#x27;ll be a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I want to compliment you on a great product!  It was about time that someone came up with such a useful tool.  As a triathlete, this helps to remove unwanted hair that I could never have reached.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!! For the longest time I always had trouble with the hair on my back so I just delt with it until this. No hassle does 100% as it said it would!!</li>
            <li> I just wanted to let you know my thoughts on your company and product. First I got to say amazing customer service. I ordered my razor and about a week went by I didnt think anything of it. Then I got an email from the owner saying the post office can&#x27;t find my original package but he would send out another razor and free blades. Got the replacement 3 days later. For a company to take the initiative when I didn&#x27;t even know there was an issue is truly amazing. Now using the razor..def the easiest fastest shave of my back I&#x27;ve ever experienced I&#x27;ll never use another method in my life. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott</li>
            <li> Make sure you shave in strong short bursts. I&#x27;m a much bigger guy with a large orangutanesque cheek and mandible. Cuts my shaving time from an hour to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Takes a little practice, and you need to avoid moles and skin tags, etc.  (They will be bleed.)  I used to use the Mangroomer, which also works well, but has a habit of dying -- at some point it simply stops working (yes, I recharged battery as directed).  After going through 3 of those, I tried this product, which I actually prefer now.  Replaceable blade covers a wider area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be used without lotion, so no mess.  Does give a scraping sensation, not altogether unpleasant, a bit rougher than a back scratch.  (Don&#x27;t let hair get too long.) Result is not GQ-model smooth, but quite satisfactory.  Except for moles and the like, it feels safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the handle were about 2 inches longer, but otherwise I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> All I can say same great service from Amazon. Now the shaver is another thing.. Woohoo, I finally found something to remove my back hair. I hate back hair and this product does a great job. Yes it leaves a little stubble, but you will have stubble in a day or two anyway. It is so easy to use and does a great job. I am very pleased I found this product.  I would like to add after 1 1/2 years of using this product, yes it does use 3 safety blades, but I have used it at least 10 times so far without replacement blades until now. I will need to order a new set.  I am still happy with this simple but great product that others seem to be too picky or too cheap to pay for a simple item.  I got one for my brother-in-law for a birthday present and he loves it too.  Unless you are a total super hairy gorilla this still does a great job for people having hair not peach fuzz on the back.  I can see people having excessive back hair may have issues after a few uses.  One key is to shave every few weeks just to remove short hairs.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Very good, very useful, very practical well-designed item. Yes, it does work many times better than a regular razor would. It might seem expensive but it&#x27;s well worth the money. There is no similar product out there as far as I can tell. Regular razors for some reason don&#x27;t pick up/grab back hairs. Also, as other viewers already remarked, using the bakblade feels similar to a back-scratching device.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wow!  I just received it today and it worked better than anything I have tried.  I love it!  Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> My expectations were neutral when I ordered this, though I was encouraged by the positive reviews.  It works exactly as described, saves time, and is fairly priced.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! This is by far the easiest hair removal method I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I tested my bakblade out the other day, and I have to say, it is truly amazing! It is the best grooming tool I have ever used. I have tried trimmers, electric clippers, electric body groomers, and nothing has given me as close of a shave as the bakblade. I also can’t believe how quick it was for me to do on my own! I used to have to have my partner shave my back, and it always felt so awkward; now I can do it completely on my own! I truly love this product and hope that they continue to manufacture it! I will definitely be ordering from this company again, and will be recommending this product to others I know!</li>
            <li> Matt,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the speedy reply. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and I think it works well. With it, I have a new found independence. It will be perfect for when I travel to Maui without my personal shaver (wifey)! Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin</li>
            <li> Attention all women that have boyfriends or husbands with hairy backs.....this product will set you free!!!!!!  I have been shaving my husbands&#x27; back for 25 long years.  I will never shave his back again thanks to this product.  I have been set free from the words &amp;#34;Honey, can you shave my back?????&amp;#34;  Come on ladies, you know what I&#x27;m talking about....you are trying to get ready to go out on a Saturday night, your hair is done, makeup is done, just waiting for hubby to finish up, when you hear those dreaded words!!!!!!!!!  Believe me when I tell you that you will NEVER hear them again.  This product is amazing.  My husband has been self sufficient for over 8 months.  He even purchased baKblades for all of his friends.  Their wives couldn&#x27;t thank him enough!!!!!  You will not be sorry with this product.  BEST INVENTION EVER.....THANKS BAKBLADE</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does!  Amazing product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eliminates the everyday hassles&lt;br /&gt;I would give it more stars if I could</li>
            <li> This is by far the finest tool available for shaving your back. I&#x27;ve tried the design that holds a traditional razor as well as the electronic style and there is no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I am 65% Kodiak Bear and 35% Wookie. Not only did this tool make short work of the excessive body hair, but left my back smoother than a newborns ass.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this tool with confidence. Today.</li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical of this product. I had tried waxing (once - too expensive), creative home made alternatives (too dangerous) and asking my wife to assist and the reply to that was &amp;#34;are you kidding me&amp;#34;? So I took a risk on the baKblade system. I bought the starter package (handle and one blade) and two extra blades. The shipping costs on this product appear to be confiscatory but if you order the items togther, it&#x27;s one shipping price, not two shipping costs added together. But it&#x27;s still expensive....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit arrived last week and I gave it a test ride. I&#x27;m a bigger guy - 6&#x27;1&amp;#34; and 225 pounds and I spend a lot of time at the gym lifting and initially it was hard to navigate the baKblade. With some practice (guided by the fear of a massive razor cut), I finally got it to work and shed no blood. No matter what angle I used or how I pulled the blade, it simply worked. I&#x27;m not super hairy but I am a gym guy and I&#x27;m not fond of excess back hair and I needed a solution and I found it in the baKblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about getting cut, razor burn and stubble. None of that occurred, even using this razor totally dry (I did NOT believe the &amp;#34;dry use&amp;#34; claim&amp;#34;). Every razor I&#x27;ve ever used dry gave me razor burn and even the barber would give me razor burn when they trimmed my neck. It did not occur with the baKblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a thrifty guy and blowing $55 on a back razor system seemed like a real extravagance but I really wanted to lose the back hair look and so far, it has worked out. The only negative I have for this product is the price but the alternatives are more expensive or less reliable or a lot more dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bit of advice - this thing is like a hair machete and if you are really hairy (even if you&#x27;re NOT really hairy), put a big towel under your feet, do this outside or have a good vacuum handy because this unit will shear you quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping time was not Prime speed but it was OK and while the unit lacks any substantial feel of quality, the art of the deal is in the design of the blades. I pulled the blade 15 different ways across my back at all sorts of weird angles and I coulf not cut myself and the hair fell like a sheep being sheared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that the baKblade is not cheap but it works great. I wish shipping costs were lower....while the unit lacks any substantial feel of quality, the art of the deal is in the design of the blades.

            <li> The bakBlade (bb) is well made and functional. It provides the best solution for back hair that I have ever found. I have tried about 12 other solutions, including electric clippers in a special holder, standard razors with extended handles, holders for regular razors, single flat blade extra wide razors with telescoping handles, creams, and many other types of solutions. The bb is the first I have used that actually removes the hair as one would expect, and does so with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not give it five stars for two reasons. Firstly, the blade gets dull too quickly. I shave my face every other day, mostly because I&#x27;m rushed every morning, not because I don&#x27;t need to shave. But my razors last weeks and weeks if properly cleaned (I use the five blade model on my face). The bb seems to get dulled after only 7 or 8 uses, which is how many times I have used it. Considering the cost of the blades, they need to last longer or cost less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, though the bb does not require much pressure to get the job done, the handle needs to be more rigid. Yes, many others will tell you to let the blade do the work, and it does do the work. But with a more rigid handle the bb would be easier to control and more accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bb can be used wet or dry, though I prefer dry. The first time I used it I was pretty sure it was not working, but then I turned and saw a pile of hair on the floor. I was happy to see it was working, but sad and shocked I was a lot more hairy than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip. Make that two tips. When you shave your upper back, train yourself to use the opposite arm to shave each half of your back, the right arm for the left side of your back and vice versa. This because if you try to shave the same side, which is what you will want to do by instinct, those flexing muscles will be hard to navigate. If you do opposite sides, you can keep your back flat and assist the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second tip is to shave your lower back, from the mid back and down, from the side. The blade stays a lot more flat when hitting the mid and lower back from the side than it does by attempting to reach all the way down. Actually, I run the blade both ways, but more hair was removed when approached from the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s my body type, but that is what works for me. I recommend the razor and buying a handful of extra blades at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually prefer the No No type device, which my girlfriend uses with great success, but it is expensive and I&#x27;m not sure I want my hair permanently removed. It&#x27;s something I might need as an old man, sitting in my cold, barren room, to keep me warm. Actually, there is new technology allowing one&#x27;s body hair to be transplanted to one&#x27;s head - if I ever go bald, you never know...ack, from the mid back and down, from the side.

            <li> I have finally been able to tame the beast! Great product for manscaping!</li>
            <li> Awesome item, best back shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many methods from face razor to electric, ti waxing and even laser hair removal. This by far I&#x27;d the most cost effective, quickest and easiest method to remove back hair.</li>
            <li> I have normally been getting my back waxed every 3 weeks since I was about 16 (I&#x27;m 25 now) and have tried all the fancy \\&quot;back hair removal\\&quot; scams since. Its annoying, expensive, and painful. I got this today in the mail with high hopes, and was blown away. It took less than 3 minutes to totally shave all the hair off my back with no water. Plus, the hair seems to be magnetized to the back of the razor, so it can be wiped off without getting all over the place. Even if I have to use this twice per week, it still takes 90% less time than a back wax...plus it already paid for itself and then some with ONE use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback it that it scratches your back and it will feel a little tender for about an hour, and if you have moles that stick out, they will bleed! I just rub lotion on my back and it feels fine in about 30 minutes. I luckily only have one mole that I can go over with minimal pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOBODY finds back hair attractive guys, so pay the $37 and be free from public shame at a cost that is next to nothing when you think about the savings over waxing (and embarrassment for requesting the back wax!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *A back wax costs about $50 without tip, but lasts at least 10 days before the hair comes through...shaving will show hair in 3-4 days&lt;br /&gt;  *Waxing lets the new hair grow in fine, thus less noticeable. Shaving cuts the hair thick since it doesnt pull the root, so it is more noticeable when it grows back&lt;br /&gt;  *If you have lots of moles that stick out, a waxing will not harm them--this product might slice them off&lt;br /&gt;  *The Razorba SUCKS compared to this.....SUCKS (I have it and went back to waxing after two uses, plus you have to shave with shaving cream, and it didn&#x27;t hold my Gillette Fusion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review when the blade wears out so you know how many uses this can use.</li>
            <li> Works just like they say it will.  So long icky back hair.  I did cut myself the first time I used it- not sure how, but I managed to do it.  It wasn&#x27;t bad, but surprising to see a small bit of blood on my t-shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times since, and haven&#x27;t had a problem though.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first. But this works very well. It is the first product for your back that doesnt seem to break and is very durable. I&#x27;ve never cut myself or had razer bumps from it. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that wants to shave their back.</li>
            <li> Works very well!  I recommend to anyone needing a solid solution to back hair.</li>
            <li> I loved it after the first use, and I&#x27;m a hairy, hairy man.  I went at my back after a full winter of growing my back beard and it took about 20 minutes, but I didn&#x27;t have to bother my fiancee for help.  I noticed the product seems to leave pretty deep scratches in my back that stung a bit when getting in to the shower afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPLAINT:&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use my baKblade again this past weekend, which would only be the second time since I&#x27;ve owned the product, and the blades had gotten so dull it would only pull the hair and do nothing to cut it.  So I was back to my old clippers.  I was extremely disappointed by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement blades are $13 for 2, I really would rather not be spending that kind of money every time I started to turn back into a grizzly, I&#x27;d just as soon have someone use my clippers and take the extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Spoke with the owner, Matt, he responded to my email with 5 minutes (not an exaggeration) and offered to send me two replacement products since deteriorating that quickly appears to have been a manufacturing defect.  I&#x27;ll update with the quality of the new blades, but just as far as company response, I&#x27;m truly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I received the replacement blades today that Matt had sent. I was completely blown away. I must have had a faulty unit the first time because the replacements did an excellent job. I&#x27;m really impressed by the personal, incredibly prompt and helpful response by Matt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe there are fake reviews attached to the product, it really speaks for itself and so does the customer first attitude of the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed, they&#x27;ve made a life - long customer.</li>
            <li> Item came with the razor attachment broke</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is easy to use (probably even easier for someone younger than me!) and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at how effective the bakblade is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great product for a fair price and I recommend it to anyone who wants a grooming tool for their back.</li>
            <li> Worked great the first time I used with my back hair grown out. Tried to use it again with shorter back hair and could not get it to look as good as the first time. Maybe a design improvement could remedy this.</li>
            <li> This is the best product in this category out there hands down!!! I can not say enough good things about this product!! I have an incredibly hairy back and this baby did the job like nothing else on the market!! It is easy to use and takes no time at all. My back has never been this smooth, ever!! I highly recommend the Bakblade!! If you have any doubts lay them aside, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made in a long time.  Other products have failed to produce the results of the Bakblade.  If you have unwanted back hair, or even chest hair, this product is incredibly easy to use on your own.  No more embarrassment in having to ask someone else to do this for you again!</li>
            <li> This did not keep an edge and began to irritate my skin after about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Totally works as advertised. Cream or not. Easy to get all spots on my back. Would buy again for sure</li>
            <li> The bade works great.... wish I would have had this years ago!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to use on your own due to the teeth on the blades and angle of the blades, so you really can&#x27;t hurt yourself&lt;br /&gt;- Much, much wider than a blade you would use for your face, so makes removing hair in the large area very quick&lt;br /&gt;- Awesome customer service... I needed some help with shipping and the owner of the company responded in short order and was very helpful&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Bit pricey.... would love to see a &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; option on the blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, don&#x27;t hesitate..... get this if you are a dude with hair on your back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many mysteries in life.  Bigfoot, Loch Ness, what ever happened to Amelia Earhart, and how the hell do I get this sweater off my back?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d never find a practical and dignified way to get rid of this damned back hair, but bakBlade has finally solved that mystery!!! It does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do.  No more waxing salons, no more standing in front of the mirror with a tiny little razor while doing an impromptu yoga session, sheesh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a chimpanzee stepping though a time warp, I took this handy tool out of the package and went to work on my &amp;#34;back-forrest&amp;#34;.  It was like watching the Marines storm the beach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How close a shave did I get? My adoring partner was so happy, she asked me if I&#x27;d gotten my back waxed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to buy the person(s) who invented this handy tool a round of beers!</li>
            <li> Works great!  I used it for the first time about a week ago and I did my whole back about 10 minutes. With practice it will be under 5 minutes.  I showed my wife the results and all she said was WOW!  Best grooming product I ever bought.</li>
            <li> Clean cuts, smooth shaves and hot babes. Seriously, this item is so much better that the electric Mangroomer I purchased years ago.</li>
            <li> You should ignore the reviews claiming this product is a scam. It is the real deal and it works great. I have pretty thick hair over my entire back, so the wide blade is a godsend. The mangroomer worked pretty well, but it took forever and caused a good deal of irritation. The bakblade took a lot less time with little irritation. Note that I took the advice in the instructions and used the mangroomer a few weeks ago to get rid of the bulk of the unmanaged hair. I think this was a good idea to start with, but now I can use the bakblade regularly with ease.</li>
            <li> This product works better at removing back hair than any other method I have tried, with the exception of waxing, which is excruciating. Using this product is a pleasure...feels like you&#x27;re getting your back scratched. And when you have a hairy back, this is something you almost can never get enough of! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair comes off quickly after a few gliding strokes and can easily reach any spot on the back. There is no &amp;#34;snagging&amp;#34; or pinching...the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; glides smoothly over the skin and easily follows the contours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this once but can&#x27;t say enough about how excited I am about how well it worked! I&#x27;ve struggled in the past trying to reach all of the back with various razors but could never either reach the very middle along the spine, nor could I remove as much hair as the bakblade to get a smooth surface. It may not be baby-butt smooth but it&#x27;s sure close! I would suggest this product to anyone who wishes to have a hair-free back. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Works great. Was done in less than 2 minutes. Very effective. No irritation. I definitely recommend this product. Before spending money on electric shavers that do not get close do yourself a favor and get this product.</li>
            <li> Bakblade is by far the best product on the market. I have tried other products, electric and manual and the Bakblade blows them away.  You have a customer for life.  Thank you so much for making a product that works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a gorilla like me then odds are you have tried almost every product on the market:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waxing- ungodly painful and embarrassing&lt;br /&gt;Nair- takes a long time, horrible for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Electric back hair trimmers- pull out more hair than cuts, easily breaks&lt;br /&gt;Extensions for Mach3- takes forever and you end up missing large areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the baKblade! First off I should mention that I have extremely sensitive skin so when I purchased this product I expected to have minor skin irritation or a breakout during the first few uses- but that never happened! The bigmouth simply cuts through hair like butter and the wide blade can de-forest sections in seconds. It truly is that great a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is the blade actually never touches your skin. There&#x27;s a small blade guard that sits a few millimeters off the blade- the guard touches your skin, the blade never does. So your first thought would be that your back would be left feeling prickly- but it doesn&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t explain how that bit works exactly... it simply does. The hair is removed in seconds and your back is left feeling clean and hair free. There&#x27;s no stubble or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as using the product I definitely recommend doing it dry. I&#x27;ve never tried it wet before (some customers apparently use it in the shower) but considering how well it works dry I see no reason to try the baKblade in the shower. Plus I have a regular stand up shower so I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;d have the proper room to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &#x27;downside&#x27; some people may have with this product is it&#x27;s initial cost and shipping cost ($8.95). Considering how much money I&#x27;ve spent on useless products in the past I don&#x27;t really have any ground to complain. I would highly recommend purchasing the baKblade AND the extra 2 blades with your initial purchase. That way you save on shipping costs and you&#x27;ll be set for 6 months of clean back shaving.</li>
            <li> I was told by my Dr. that I am the hariest guy he knows. This product worked great!!! Very easy to use and it feels good like a back scratcher. I haven&#x27;t felt the shirt on my back in a very long time. Now I can go to the beach and take my shirt off.I think my wife loves my new look :)</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Fast&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- Painless (They mean it when they say it feels like a back scratcher, that&#x27;s exactly what I thought of)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy. Just follow the instructions they send with the blade.&lt;br /&gt;- Works wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;- Shaves to 5 o&#x27;clock shadow closeness. I&#x27;m honestly a little stunned at how close the thing can get. It won&#x27;t be as close as your facial razor can do, but it&#x27;s very impressive for a wide fixed blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Wide fixed blade has issues with angles and anywhere it can&#x27;t get directly against the grain. Expect to make multiple passes over your spine and to clean up your shoulders with a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;- Works almost too well. When I started, I figured the guard and the single blade would mean no chance of nicking myself. I was wrong. Be careful not to apply to much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Would buy it again in a heartbeat. I was very skeptical, even with the video review, but I hoped that if nothing else it would thin things out. It has exceeded my expectations. Just wish I&#x27;d bought it at the beginning of the summer instead of at the end.</li>
            <li> Great product. Shave your own back in minutes while in the shower. No pain, no scratching, no shaving cream. Highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Like so many others concerned with good grooming , this little tool does all its supposed to do and more.  Close and comfortable , this makes quick work of the task at hand !</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have to give full 10 shiny stars to this product! All I can say is THANK YOU. :)&lt;br /&gt;Hairy guys, now you are not just able to get rid of all those hard to reach back hair, but also you will enjoy shaving it as much as a bear enjoys scratching his back to a tree! ;)</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say thank you for your awesome product.  After years of my wife nagging to use Nair or Veet on my back or trying to shave it,  I am free of her nagging!  I just received my Bakblade today,  went right into the garage and I now have a hairless back.  I am going to order one for my dad now.   Thanks again!  You don&#x27;t know how this helps my confidence.  I am sending you a before and after pic.   I will let all my friends know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;Oklahoma City, Ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android</li>
            <li> blade came with a blade cover for proper storage. Dont have to worry about cutting yourself. In terms of performance, the first use is awkward but you get used to it and the angles that you have to hold it but it works! very light weight too- not heavy to hold. my hairs are cut short. great product.</li>
            <li> The bakblade feels like a back scratcher, it is actually enjoyable to use this. It leaves your skin looking smooth and hairless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company&#x27;s customer service is amazing too. The day I placed my order I received an email from the company asking me if I wanted the product immediately or if I wanted to receive their new blade which was debuting in a couple of weeks. I opted to wait. I received the blade, and was happy with the result, but the blade developed a crack after the first use. I received a follow up email from the company asking for feedback, and I stated that although I loved the results, I would wait until I had purchased another blade before writing a review, as the first blade had cracked. A few days later I received a blade in the mail free of charge. This is a product that works, and a company that stands by their product. I suspect I will be vying their replacement blades for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy, does a good enough job.  Would be nice to be a bit of a closer shave, but for the time it saves vs. a standard razor and shave gel it is a good product.  Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs or hurt in any way.  Definately give it a try!</li>
            <li> Got this a couple of days ago and I love it.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything else on the market and I&#x27;ve never been completely satisfied.  Finally, something that works.  Easy to use, no mess, no fuss.  Thank you!  If you&#x27;ve been searching for something like this...don&#x27;t think, just buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything - chemical removers (ouch), taping a razor to a stick, using the other handle tool from another company (the blue one), and waxing (ouch from pain and cost).  I decided to give the bakblade a try and wow - what an amazing tool for getting the job done.  When it arrived it was easy to assemble (insert blade).  When I tried it I was amazed at how quickly, easily, and painlessly it gave me a perfectly smooth back and shoulders.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and it only takes a minute (two at the most) to keep my back and shoulders hair free.  Amazing tool -- you have a customer for life!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of any product of this sort! I always used clippers and as anyone who has ever tried using clippers on their back knows what a pain that can be. I always ended up bleeding or missing small patches. Well this product really makes that a thing of the past. It is fast, easy and most of all you don&#x27;t have to ask someone to help you. The blade is extremely sharp but protected with a guard so there is no possible way i can think of that you could get cut by it.I have used it for about a month now and I am completely satisfied with the purchase. The thing i like most is it is honestly like shaving with a razor and you can&#x27;t even tell you have a back hair issue at all once your use it! It really cuts that close! I said previously this is my first purchase of such a product but honestly there is no need to look any farther for me because this is everything it claims to be and more. To anyone looking for a such a product you can go wrong with this! This thing is really a god send to me and that is why I took the time to write such a review. If it was junk I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to inform of that you but I hope my review helps anyone who is skeptical like I was to make the purchase.</li>
            <li> Truly maks it a do-it-yourself job.  No more dis-locating my shoulder to get the job done or asking the wife to do it.</li>
            <li> Great! I&#x27;m a young man with a few hairs on my shoulders and back and this works great, very easy to use even when using completely dry.</li>
            <li> Wish I had this years ago!!</li>
            <li> Works great for the little hair I do have on my back.</li>
            <li> Best invention ever! It works so well. As someone who struggles with unwanted hair on my back, this is great! 5 minutes and i&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> better than trimmers by far.  very effective, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> From reading the reviews, decided to take a shot with this. Its strange because this product seems so simplistic while the only other comparable product, the man groomer, seemed overly complex. But wow does this work. When it arrived, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time and I thought &#x27;hey let me try it out on a small patch of my back and do the rest later at night&#x27;. I finished my whole back in about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that this product is a bit over priced and could be more affordable when considering how simple it seems to be (maybe the cost went into R&amp;D which was well worth it). But buying something that works so efficiently and effectively makes you forget about the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most satisfying products I have bought in a long time. Kudos to the baKblade team.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said this product is garbage. SO NOT TRUE. I&#x27;m a hairy back guy and this thing works great!! I had some issues with the local post office here so I contacted bakblade and the owner responded. He was awesome. He stayed in contact with me until I received my purchase. Not many company owners do that here in America. That should say a lot about a guy. He didn&#x27;t have to do anything because it wasn&#x27;t his fault but he when out of his way to help me. For that I am thankful. Bakblade works better than I thought. Easy to use, and also works great as a back scratcher. Removes all hair painlessly, wet or dry. I use it wet while I&#x27;m in the shower. My skin is very sensitive so there was some light scratching and bleeding. Nothing serious or anything that would stop me from using this product over and over. I LOVE IT!!! Great product and an even better owner.</li>
            <li> Best razor I ever used!  I would have invented it years ago if it were easy to do that process.  Yes, a 4 inch blade that cuts and does not cut you.  It works and its easy... I usually buy a man groomer and the battery rusts out in the shower... this is way faster and cost effective!!!  Just start with your back hair already someone short, then keep up weekly.  Its literally 2 min in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have tried many ways of (unsuccessfully) shaving my back, including buying other, more expensive products. Don&#x27;t waste your time on anything else but bakblade! It works, its fast, and it feels good--like a nice back scratch. You don&#x27;t even need crazy flexible shoulders or lots of mirrors to do a good job--I have even done it without any mirror and it turned out great!</li>
            <li> Top product,  easy to use and makes shaving a lot more comfortable , end result excellent no marks or cuts. RESULT.!!&lt;br /&gt;Only draw back not happy paying extra for customs charge should be pre warned of extra costs to United Kingdom. .</li>
            <li> If you can use a back scratcher, you can use the BakBlade successfully. No pain!  And it feels like you&#x27;re using a back scratcher.  Added plus:  No more reported Sasquatch sightings in your neighborhood just because you took a dip in your swimming pool.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Very quick, comfortable and MUCH closer shave than any other electronic razor I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I write very few reviews but I felt compelled to write this one.  I had my doubts about this product.  But after trying it, I can truly say it is fantastic!  Smooth shave with very little effort!  I am actually shocked at how well it works.  I highly recommend it.  I would have given it 5 stars but the price is absurd for the product.  I manufacture plastic products and this one costs about $1, maybe $1.50 to make all in.  The price they are asking is crazy but it does work.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Works as advertised.  No more relying on anyone else to help you shave.  It gives you complete independence.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Bakblade shaver and after about ten days I contacted them because it did not show up in the mail.  Matt went and checked on it, and could not get an answer from the Post Office. Without any hesitation he told me he would ship another one out right away. A couple of days later I received the shaver and the extra blades I ordered. Matt was a man of his word and I really appreciated his focus on satisfying the customer!  Now about the product itself: It is light weight and very easy to use and I was able to mow the lawn in a matter of seconds. This Bakblade more than exceeded my expectations. I have tried several other back shaving products and this one is the best by far!  Worth every penny! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have yet to get a chance to actually try the product as it arrived broken due to poor packaging/planning.  The unit shipped in a lightly padded bubble envelope fully assembled with the removable blade badly cracked.  If they had shipped the product with the blade removed from the handle I think it would have easily survived shipment.  I have contacted the seller via Amazon and will update this review if I ever get to try the device and how their customer service handles the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Update:  Wow...I have to say that BakBlades Customer Service is VERY fast to respond.  Within minutes of sending a message to them about the damaged product I received a voice mail about an expedited replacement product, returned shipping expenses and a direct call back number!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Update:  Received my replacement unit in perfect condition and it even included an extra set of blades.  This experience has been some of the best customer service, company really goes above and beyond to make it customers happy.  As for the product review, not much more that I can say that hasn&#x27;t already been said by the numerous positive reviews.  My back was so smooth after using that it felt slightly odd wearing a shirt as I could feel the fabric.  Excellent product with a great company behind it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  The length of the handle and angle of the blade head make it very easy to cover the entire back. I will be ordering refills.</li>
            <li> I am a hairy man that loves to run without his shirt off. I have tried everything except for laser treatment. This is by far the best product I have encountered. the only critique is that the handle seem a little delicate. The thing I love the most is that instead of 30 minutes I can knock out the hair in half the time and be on my way. Thank you to the makers of this product.</li>
            <li> Hello! My name is Megan and I am in a power wheelchair. I always struggled with shaving my legs seeing I cannot lean forward far enough to shave my entire leg. It also was unsafe for me to try and reach my lower leg with my balance and coordination not being great. I decided to try this shaver and I&#x27;m so impressed! It is fast, effective, and so easy to manage. I know the intent of the baKBlake is for shaving your back but this works for legs just as well! Also, for those who are mobility impaired, it&#x27;s a godsend!  I recommend this entirely and with no reservations!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!  My personal use shall be limited, and the replacement blades are pretty expensive, so if you&#x27;re shaving your back or unreachables often, this will start to cost you.  Another problem is that while this works very well to painlessly remove hair from your back, and this is my fault, it irritates the skin a lot.  After my first go, my girlfriend freaked out and told me to never use this again because it looked like I had hives on my back.  The hairs must have grown in a bad direction, and the way this just plucks them out must have really irritated the skin.  It was basically my entire lower left back covered in razor burn/acne after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: 1. It works!  2. feels like a back scratcher, that&#x27;s not a false claim  3. it&#x27;s pretty easy to use and swap blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1.  Blades only last so long, and are expensive to replace (not the best for frequent shavers)  2. May irritate skin, especially because suggested directions don&#x27;t take into account hair direction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If you have crazy body hair, and are willing to spend the money to get it taken care of, this doesn&#x27;t take too long and is very effective, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s much less than laser removal and the other clinical BS.  Suggestion:  if you try it, wait to order the replacement blades (I tried to be proactive, only to spend the money that I didn&#x27;t need to, as I won&#x27;t be using this much if ever again)  Suggestion 2: be careful and mindful of the direction your hair grows, and how sensitive your skin is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to deal with my moderate back hair problem and came across the baKBlade on Amazon. I was extremely impressed with the design of the product. I read all the positive reviews and became convinced this product was my answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews were spot-on! The product was extremely easy to use, thanks to the owner Matt emailing me some basic tips on how to use the baKBlade. I was amazed at how clean and efficient the baKBlade was in shearing and cleaning my back. Now I use it every week or so to keep my back clean. Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a quick way to rid myself of back hair and hair in hard to reach places and this product did just that. I was able to do the job quick and it&#x27;s easy to use when the back hair starts to return. Hard to argue with the results. Plus it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to cut yourself with these blades and they seem pretty durable. Good product!</li>
            <li> works very well, good for almost whole body</li>
            <li> I have to say, your product is the best thing I’ve used to tackle this problem! I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on various creams, waxes, and other painful devices in the past, and nothing compares to baKblade. My back is so smooth now, and the product even feels good to use. Thank you so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, both packages arrived. I can’t thank you enough for sending an extra one just in case the first one was lost for good. To pay it forward, I will gift the extra one to a friend. I’m sure they’ll be converted into a customer for life, too!</li>
            <li> I hate having back hair.  But if I&#x27;m going to have it,  I&#x27;m glad there is bakblade.  It works great.</li>
            <li> You know there are some people complaining that the company is making it&#x27;s own reviews (1-2 star ratings people).While I don&#x27;t know if they are but I will tell you that this product works great and as advertised. Before this I had to get my brother to help me trim my back as I am very hairy. I have also tried it with a razor but could never get to my shoulder/scapula area and it took forever to shave. With Bakblade, I can get a smooth shave and spend only five mins in the shower because the blade is long and not small like your typical razor. Plus the long handle lets you reach areas you couldn&#x27;t. Although you can&#x27;t throw away your other razor because you will still need it for your shoulder area as bakblade is too big. you can use Bakblade on your shoulder but a normal one works much better since you have more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use it when I take a shower but it does work on wet or dry surfaces. For us hairy men out there, this tool is a must. Unless you like depending on other people to trim/shave your back.</li>
            <li> Just got my baKblade yesterday! I was eager to test it out. So I took it out of plastic snapped blade cover off and began shaving. This thing works exactly as its said to. You can use it in any way or direction you like. I find just using back and forth motions work better. Instead of single passes going up your back and side to side. It takes the hair off much easier and faster. It only took me about 10min maybe to do my whole back. Being it was my first time using it, I&#x27;m sure it will go quicker and easier nex&#x27;t time and will only have stubble maybe to trim. So might only take a couple a min next time. Make sure to shave in front of a mirror to make sure you get everything. Other than that it baKblade works really good. GIves you a pretty close shave nex&#x27;t thing to a safety razor shave. Was debating over mangroomer of baKblade glad I believe made right choice with this 1. Also, buy an extra set of blades too that way your set for a while.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I support guys like these for their good product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with your product.  In fact, I used it this morning.  I have recommended it to a number of friends and family and will continue to do so.  Thanks for creating this product.  It&#x27;s nice to know that I can be more confident now.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product... the blades last a long time and the &amp;#34;bigmouth&amp;#34; is really easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Quite frankly I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive products, but none are anywhere nearly as effective as the &amp;#34;bigmouth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was not sure about this, but it works very well! If your a wookie like me you will love this. It takes some time to get the hang of it though.</li>
            <li> Best product for getting the back hair and any other unwanted hair out there, dont have to worry about the battery operated ones losing charge, or the blades not cutting anymore. This product shaves it so much closer too and no shaving cream needed without any kind of irritation. Love it. </li>
            <li> Unbelievable... No matter what you are told by spouse or girlfriend back hair is as gross as it gets! This item is quick, easy and safe to use! Ordered extra blades but I can tell it will be awhile before they are needed... You cant go wrong with this item!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few devices for removing my back hair and they were all difficult to use by myself. I kinda had to be a contortionist to do even a decent job. I bought the BakBlade Big Mouth, thinking it was a sham, but somehow in the back of my mind, I was hoping that it would work the same way as in its videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine arrived yesterday, and I had my back smooth in way less than 5 minutes. The &amp;#34;scratchy back&amp;#34; feeling after its used is not a big deal. My only concern is the cost of replacement blades (and the high shipping cost). Hopefully this will be reduced as the product gains wider distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I stumbled upon this product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> okay, I know its gross but I have a bit of back hair. I tried the mann groomer and it sucked! I have to say this big mouth bakblade is awesome! took less then 1 min to shave and its really smooth. just like a fresh shave on the face! I would love to shoot a commercial for this thing! its that good. lots of men have this disgusting problem and this needs to be put out to the public. thank you bakblade makers!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> First of all, I must say, I made quick assumptions by reading wrong reports earlier. .&lt;br /&gt;USPS had missed my delivery due to address conflict and I ended up putting some earlier feedback that product didn&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt called me immediately and learning the situation that I did not receive due to USPS delay, he did a priority fedex at his own cost and did not charge me for the additional product as he wanted me to have the product and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here is my verdict - The product works! As promised!! I did not have any scratches and the shave is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It took me more than 5 minutes but it wasnt too long. I do have hair all over my back, and I can see my back clean 95%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some hard spots to reach which I have to practice and get it in one go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is relatively simple to use, its lightweight, its quick and easy, and is a no brainer as it does not have any complex parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently joined a gym and want to get into regular swimming. After I used the shaver, now I am looking forward to go to the pool or even hit the beach without feeling embarassed. I also have hair on my chest and stomach and sides and I cleaned it all very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate the customer service and the product is great!</li>
            <li> Works very well. Still had some hard to reach places but this is the best thing I&#x27;ve used to shave without using a actual razor.</li>
            <li> Finally an easy way to do it myself that feels like a nice back scratch! Simple, easy, and effective!! Five stars.</li>
            <li> It gets those spots you can&#x27;t get with other raizers. If you shave it and use it like a back scratcher you&#x27;ll get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> After the first swipe the hair was just smashed to the skin. Had to rinse the razor thoroughly after each swipe which was time consuming and it still never shaved as good as that first swipe. Ended up switching back to electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every method of hair removal waxing, creams, and electronic backshavers. Not happy with results or the procces(waxing ouch). First product that I use which I can do my whole back myself without calling for my wifes help. No pain no irratation just a great product very happy satisfied customer. Highly recommend this product you will not be disappionted.</li>
            <li> Just received this shipment and broke it in immediately.  No complaints here.  I&#x27;m far from Sasquatch level.  But what there is needs to be kept under control.  So this does it.  Looks sturdy.  Decent glide to it.  So pretty satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> The blade removes hair smoothly and easily. Only thing keeping me from giving the baKblade another star is that the handle could have more of a curve to it - would make it easier to use if it had another 2-3 degrees of bend!</li>
            <li> Short back story. No pun intended. I am Italian and hairy. Dark, course hair. My whole life body hair grooming has been a thing. Some people are just hairy on there arms or legs or chest. I have it all, including my back. I have tried all the back shaving products available and after first use this one is the winner for a bunch of reasons. So here is a mini review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening it is a plastic stick with a blade. Not really fancy but that&#x27;s ok. The handle is a soft and slightly flexible plastic. The blade slides on and off easily. The blade itself is just 3 DE blades side by side in a patented holder. The DE blades are not user replaceable as the whole thing is glued shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First use. They say you can use it dry or wet. I chose dry. The idea is just use it like a back scratcher and it will remove the hair. After seeing that it was DE blades I was a little hesitant about getting cut. The blade holder however is pretty thick so then I wondered about it even cutting close. I went to use it and felt some good resistance of the blade on my skin. I pulled and it made a scratching noise and removed the hair completely to the skin. I went slow at first. After a little I went to town. You just need to make sure you do your whole back which is no fault of the product. Just your own flexibility. Result was a smooth shave right to the skin. No nicks, weepers or blood.  I was also worried about irritation and razor burn from the blade but so far it feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the BakBlade which includes the handle and one blade. I also added a pack of 2 blades. Overall somehow it cuts close without cutting you. It&#x27;s easy to use. No batteries. No moving parts. No rust. No additional people necessary. The blade quality could be better in the sense of lining up the 3 blades better and I think it is a little expensive but that&#x27;s a personal call neither will stop me from continuing to buy blades.</li>
            <li> works great and it feel like a nice scratch back</li>
            <li> works great, better than any back shaver I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Got all hair but did leave cut marks .</li>
            <li> Great!!!  Really works.  Perfect.  It takes a few tries to get your technique and know the curves or your back, but then it only takes about 10 mins and you have a beach clean ready to go back.  It&#x27;s way easier than going to the saloon to have a back waxing, costs less, no pain and cheaper.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> works great, easy to use, fast because of the blade size</li>
            <li> I tried the system out in May when I bought them and was really surprised with how easy it works.  Doing it by myself was the main objective and I was pleased with the results.  Even as the blade dulls it still removed more then most other products I&#x27;ve tried.  I will let my co-workers and friends know about your product and the customer service you have shown.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The Bak Blade works I had a apprehension that I bought an item for fun.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George&lt;br /&gt;Florida</li>
            <li> The baKBlade is the real deal. Easy to use, no, pain, no razor burn, and most importantly no more hair.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is an amazing product. So much faster and easier than anything electric.</li>
            <li> If you think you need this, GET IT.  It is awesome.</li>
            <li> Its not bad, it gets the big hairs but hard to get it down to the skin...Its def easy to use</li>
            <li> This thing works great. It is fast and easy and the blades last pretty long. Order extra blades though because you will eventiall need more.</li>
            <li> Great product it was about time someone came up with a solution for back shaving, simple and quick shave with no mess or no need of other products to get the job done</li>
            <li> Came as described. Works great, better than everything else I have tried. I&#x27;m a hairy guy and this got the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. You cannot reach back there and it can. Takes off back hair, even small skin tags.&lt;br /&gt;Also, get some sun and you will feel better about how you look.</li>
            <li> The Bakblade is absolutely amazing! I received the Bakblade within about 5 days of placing my order, including a weekend. It arrived in a nondescript yellow shipping envelope with packing bubblerwap lining the inside. You could have this shipped to your office or workplace, and unless someone closely reads the &amp;#34;Bakblade Inc.&amp;#34; label on the envelope and Googles the product, there&#x27;s no way they could know what was in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I long used chemical hair removers that made my skin burn and at one time actually burned my left tricep badly, actually scabbing over and making it painful to move my arm for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Bakblade within about 10 minutes of opening it. This is the greatest product for male personal grooming ever! The Bakblade feels smooth, like your girlfriend is scratching your back with her nails, very soothing and feels really good. It shears the hair off cleanly and gets your skin feeling just like you used a mens face shaving razor. There can be a slight stubble left in certain areas if you go against the grain, that happens with any razor shave, and it&#x27;s a very small tradeoff for the sheer ease of use and end result that Bakblade offers. There&#x27;s no irritation, cuts or sensitivity after using the Bakblade. It&#x27;s a remarkable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It only took about 10 minutes to completely clean up my back and arms down to just about my elbows. I stood in the mirror grinning like a fool at the results, I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy and fast Bakblade took care of my back hair. My only complaint is that this wasn&#x27;t around 10 years ago when I was in college, because I&#x27;d have a few days worth of time and a small fortune back from all of the chemical hair removers I purchased and used over the years, both at local stores and off of internet specialty sites, and I could have avoided a heap of pain and suffering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you too suffer from back hair this is the best solution for that condition. If you&#x27;re a body builder who needs to keep his back, arms and chest clean for competitions, this is going to be the product for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Bakblade. You won&#x27;t be disappointed and you won&#x27;t ever have to suffer the pain, irritation and absolute inconvenience of chemical hair removers again.eeds to keep his back, arms and chest clean for competitions, this is going to be the product for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Bakblade. You won&#x27;t be disappointed and you won&#x27;t ever have to suffer the pain, irritation and absolute inconvenience of chemical hair removers again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got this. After using this I got razor burns on my body. It&#x27;s so horrible. Please think twice before buying this.</li>
            <li> This is hands-down the best back shaver out there - and I have bought and used them all!  No need for shaving cream, no cuts of nicks - unless you use it like an insane person - just a close shave unlike the electric back shavers.  I have used this product nearly 6-months now and am totally happy.  One note, however, I misplaced the paperwork on this item and found it extremely difficult to find on the net without the name of the shaver to buy replacement blades (which aren&#x27;t cheap but worth it) because the razor has no name written on it.  Be sure you either keep the paperwork or write the razor name down somewhere.  Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> I have dealt with being &amp;#34;Hairy&amp;#34; for years. The looks at the beach or pool, it sucks!!! I have been looking for a product like this for YEARS!! I have tried every product on the market, and this is the BEST hands down. Nothing even comes close. I have burned my skin trying to use creams and spray. Wax?? Are you sadistic? Very painful. Electric shavers that are impossible to use at the right angle ( and only partially work on already short hair). Other stick items that use a regular razor?? Please, if you like spending an hour or more rinsing and doing a inch at a time. I was so embarrassed that I was paying my kids to help me shave ( my all time low). Bought this product and WOW!!! Even if I let it grow back longer than normal in between, it takes like 5-10 minutes on my own, in the shower for absolutely amazing results. I am a customer for life!! I haven&#x27;t been this happy with a purchase ever. It does what it says at a good price. Buy this, you will not regret your purchase one bit. Great company and even better customer service.</li>
            <li> I use this for my back. Works as described. Instructions recommend to switch the blades every 6 to 8 uses, but I&#x27;ve gone 4 months without switching the blades with no issues. Now is time to get new blades though.</li>
            <li> I had been embarrassed by my back hair for many years (I&#x27;m 57), and always felt uncomfortable taking my shirt off in places like the beach, the lake, or the gym.  I had considered waxing and electrolosis to get rid of it, but decided I didn&#x27;t want to go through the pain or the expense of those methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I searched Amazon for a back shaver product and saw the bakblade, among many others.  I read the reviews carefully, and decided to take a chance on the baKblade.  It has made a big difference in my life.  I&#x27;m more confident and feel much better about the way I look.  The first time I used it I was a little overanxious (not to mention my back hair was pretty long) and I got a couple of razor cuts on my back and some irritation. But now, after seven uses, I&#x27;ve got it down pat and haven&#x27;t cut myself since, and the irritation is basically nonexistent.  I bought replacement blades knowing that I was going to be a life-long, loyal customer.  Please don&#x27;t stop making the bakblade and replacement blades for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, by the way, the owner of the company, Matt, sent me a personal email and wanted to know my thoughts on the product.  That&#x27;s what I call customer service and support!</li>
            <li> Simply the best thing I have ever bought, I want to advertise for this company it&#x27;s the in emotion of the decade for sure!</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical coming from other battery operated back shavers out there, but with the glowing reviews I couldn&#x27;t help but try it out myself.  Holy cow does this thing work great!  The hair just fell off my back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt a little weird having a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shave, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are the handle could be a little more curved.  The minor curve that it does have made it difficult to shave certain contours of my back, though I eventually managed.  Further it would be truly nice if the blade angle was user adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be wary if you have any moles or skintags.  While the blade has comb-like tooth guards to protect your skin from everyday shaving, they don&#x27;t do much to protect any growths on your skin.  I didn&#x27;t realize I had a rather large skintag on my back until I nearly cut it off with this product!  I cannot fault the product itself as I should have taken more care prior to shaving, but be advised this is essentially 3 straight razer blades in plastic holder with a minor level of protection.  Just be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I have a minor concern with this product, specifically around the blades and how long they will last with regards to shaving and at rest.  The literature states each blade should have a 6-7 shave lifetime.  Given I don&#x27;t even need to shave my back but every few months, and the fact that the blades are always exposed, I hope they won&#x27;t rust before I get a chance to use them, especially in the humid bathroom air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall.. great product and I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!... Easy to use and gets the job done perfectly with no back hair at all!! Highly recommended indeed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Bigmouth a couple of times but can&#x27;t see it&#x27;s use changing. I was very pleased to see that it worked so well. Much better then the hair trimmer I&#x27;ve been using. The Bigmouth covers a large area and makes quick work of removing hair from the back region. I can complete the take in under 5 minutes. It also gets to all of the hard to reach places and is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars only as it&#x27;s a bit pricey. The instructions state the blade will last around 6 uses. This is not much. I&#x27;m guessing it will usually last a bit longer but at it&#x27;s current price, they is a little on the expensive side. Still, for what it delivers I&#x27;m very please with the product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how amazing the baKblade is. Thank you for this amazing invention. I&#x27;ve been recommending it to all of my friends since I first used it. I was honestly a little surprised at how perfect it worked. This is one of the best products I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> does a great job, but it is sharp and back was bleeding from moles being sliced open, needed to be much more careful.</li>
            <li> Yes this removes hair. Yes it&#x27;s easy to use. Yes you can cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad purchase, but it&#x27;s kinda flimsy for the money, a few dollars more one of the electric man groomer products might be a better value. Plus no expensive replacement blades to buy.</li>
            <li> This back shaver is worth far more than what it currently sells for!&lt;br /&gt;The genius design, handle, incredible blade, etc. shaves my entire back in&lt;br /&gt;less than five minutes - literally, I am not exaggerating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through battery operated model which lasted for three years until&lt;br /&gt;the motor burned out. This Bakblade doesn&#x27;t use batteries!! It doesn&#x27;t need em&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;The thought that went into something that could appear so basic....you just have to&lt;br /&gt;give the Bakblade a try, especially if nothing else has worked for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can hear the blade cutting the hair on every pass and there is NO discomfort whatsoever!!&lt;br /&gt;On every three or four passes I will pull the hair from the blade as this thing cleanly mows down&lt;br /&gt;every hair long or short that is growing where I don&#x27;t want - also gets in back of legs another&lt;br /&gt;hard to reach area!!  I don&#x27;t believe anybody who has a problem with body hair growing where&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t prefer who honestly gives this incredible invention known as the Bakblade a try will&lt;br /&gt;return it or have anything but positive feedback. I know of people who spend $50+ for waxing,&lt;br /&gt;etc. The Bakblade allows me to do it all myself in under five minutes without leaving my house!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five stars rating can&#x27;t do this thing justice - you must purchase the Bakblade if you have any&lt;br /&gt;unwanted bodyhair. You won&#x27;t believe the results and you won&#x27;t believe how fast this thing will&lt;br /&gt;give you smooth hairless skin for a while. Simple to use - you don&#x27;t need assistance or two mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;I even cut all those ugly hairs in back of my neck completely in two passes. The barber would&lt;br /&gt;use his shaver taking about three minutes just in that one area. It&#x27;s gonna save you money -&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gonna make you wonder why you waited so long....so order one now and mow em&#x27; down!!</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday, used it for the first time today... Works GREAT! Super smooth! Handle makes it easy to reach the hard-to-reach middle of the back. Feels like a back scratcher while using it. Very comfortable - no stinging after like using a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I took this out of the packaging, proceeded to use it like a back scratcher, and was 90% done in about 5 minutes. I walked over to my wall mirror and within another 5 minutes was perfectly groomed. I&#x27;m a substantially hairy dude--like George the Animal Steele level of hairy. This was cartoonishly effective and I am in shock. I got a slight irritation because I literally used it as a back scratcher and continued to scratch after the hair was gone. It actually feels good to use this product. People who complain that these blades are expensive--and they are--don&#x27;t value their time very much, or have never paid to get their back waxed. Oh wahh wahh wahh about a buck a shave that lasts for a week or two. I&#x27;ll gladly spend $30-$60/year to be rid of back hair. Shut up and take my money! I want to meet the genius who invented this and shake his hand. If he partnered with Elon Musk, we&#x27;d have time travel by now.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic device! I received it on Wednesday, November 26th. I opened the package and at first thought, &amp;#34;Oh, no, another cheap plastic gimmick that won&#x27;t deliver any good results.&amp;#34; I continued to unwrap the BakBlade and then immediately gave it a try on my back. I did not read any instructions what so ever. I just began using the ergonomically designed tool and within minutes my back was smooth. This item is priced high for a piece of plastic, but, it really does work. I would definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J. Thompson</li>
            <li> If I could give this 100 stars, I would.  I hardly ever write product reviews, even though I buy a ton of things from Amazon, but this warrants a review.  An outstanding review, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does everything it promises to.  I&#x27;ve tried other back shavers and none work as well as this.  And, in a lot less time.  If you keep up with shaving your back on a regular basis, this takes less than 2-3 minutes and does a perfect job.  It shaves very close, no shaving cream needed.  It&#x27;s uber easy to use, much more so than other alternatives.  Plus, you don&#x27;t have to be a contortionist or look like a Cirque du Soleil performer to get to every spot on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using it, you hardly notice it on your back.  While some say it&#x27;s similar to a back scratcher, it&#x27;s not even that abrasive.  You do feel a very slight tingle, but that&#x27;s after you&#x27;ve finished.  The blade is super safe and I never felt like it would even remotely break skin.  This is the best back hair remover ever!</li>
            <li> Works GREAT. First time I have been able to completely remove my back hair by myself. Also worked on chest and arms as well!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be better. Works as all the vids on you tube show.</li>
            <li> Really works well to rid my back of hair. I can literally get my entire back. Does it shave the hair down to smooth skin? Not really, but I honestly don&#x27;t even care. It removes all the hair on the back. Period. That&#x27;s what I was looking for. One blade has lasted a long time too, and I have some thick back hair. Wolf hairs for real.</li>
            <li> Great customer Service - The product is phenomenal. Works exactly as advertised - real game changer.</li>
            <li> took awhile to arrive, however the product works awesome!!</li>
            <li> cost was much an u still have to buy blads for it it was a big helping aid to shave yr back work s wonderful would buy it over if was damage or lost</li>
            <li> Seriously worth every penny – it gets very close and smooth, I hated waxing and the breaking out – this makes it so easy to groom.. seriously amazing.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have had this 15 years ago....Works great. Good price . Easy to use. iF YOU NEED IT...buy it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely easy to use and it takes 10 minutes tops to shave whole back.  I used it dry and it does not hurt at all.  It is simply the best solution without actually getting laser surgery.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Now I don&#x27;t look like an animal.  Great solution to a long time problem.  It&#x27;s like scratching an itch, only when you&#x27;re done,  your back looks nice.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! If you are a guy and you have a lot of ugly, itchy, and unwanted back hair BUY THIS PRODUCT. Just tried it out and this thing is a god send for guys like me. It&#x27;s way better than the man groomer. The man groomer took me a half an hour to shave my back and I had to keep recharging it over and over again until it finally broke (after one month!). This thing clears your entire back and shoulders of hair in 5-10 mins. The blade on this thing is phenomenal. It peels away the hair like nothing and it feels good while you do it too. Seriously, after using this product I have no more back hair, I feel slimmer in t-shirts, and I can actually see the muscular definition of my back that I couldn&#x27;t before with all the hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money on waxing or the man groomer. This is the way to go! Thank you so much baKblade. You have a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and tried this.  It just arrived and 5 mins later I was smooth like a hairless cat!  Back, chest, and torso area all done in 5 mins. I&#x27;m not super hairy, but still have fine hairs that show and are unattractive. It was painless and felt like scraping a fine tooth comb on your skin.  I am going to order more blades ASAP to have at the ready.  Nice job creating this much needed grooming tool.  I wish I had invented it myself. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> It works for sure. Simple dimple, just the way guys like it. No moving parts, nothing fancy, just gets the job done. I love it. Easy.</li>
            <li> Brilliant service.  Very prompt.  Amazing product too.</li>
            <li> Simple but effective shaver</li>
            <li> The concept seems sound......but in reality.....it was clumsy and painfull. I am new to doing something about my back hair problem so I was initially very excited about this product.  I found shaving the lower back was OK but when I tried doing the upper back I couldn&#x27;t seem to get a good angle and it felt like I was scraping my skin leaving the area very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;Especially between the shoulder blades.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because I figure maybe there is some user error involved.</li>
            <li> Um...wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received it yesterday and just tried it.  I am actually postponing my shower to write this review.  I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy.  I&#x27;m in normal/decent shape but have always avoided being seen with my shirt off.  I&#x27;ve used a razorba in the past (difficult to use) and also developed an extremely good range of motion in my arms from occasionally trying to shave my back with a trimmer or normal razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am dumbfounded by how amazingly well this thing just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more than 10 minutes to do the job (dry, and in the tub for easy cleanup) and I probably took longer than necessary because I was so amused.  My butt is also hair free now.  Good backscratcher too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion - long strokes don&#x27;t work as well as short back-and-forth ones.  Really, think of it as scratching an itch that keeps moving.</li>
            <li> Seems a better product than anything else out there, but be careful if you have any bumpy areas on your back, as you may bleed out. Seriously. I didn&#x27;t even know I (used) to have a skin tag on my back until I got out of the shower after shaving my back and covering my new white towel in a river of blood.</li>
            <li> Wish it were available years ago. I use it dry &amp; it does a super job, like a baby&#x27;s behind. Very safe, never a cut. Quick &amp; easy to use. Replacement blades (with shipping) are a bit pricey but if it works, and it does,  you need to have em&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I just received the bakblade today. This product is amazing!  I shaved my entire back in minutes and it works a million times better than an electric razor I used in the past (Mangroomer)  It worked so well I already ordered replacement razors.  Great product!  .</li>
            <li> BaKblade hit the ball out of the park on this shaver and I highly recommend it. For me, I have a light amount of hair on my back, but their videos on their website are 100% accurate. I&#x27;ve purchased a couple other back hair removal products that are heavily advertised that left my back cut up or razor burned,  so I was very very skeptical of the BaKblade.  Honestly,  what a great product!</li>
            <li> bakBlade is a god sent.  I am 67 and have been shaving my back, by myself, for over 45 years.  The bakBlade I is fantastic.  Infact I have been able to use it immediately after shoulder rotator cuff surgery with my arm in a sling.  That&#x27;s how easy it is.  It has exceeded my expectations.  It performs exactly as advertised.  I have found it best dry without any creams or water.  I have used the same blade 4 or 5 times and it performs as if it were new.  In fact I intend to order enough blades for a years supply so I don&#x27;t run out.  I don&#x27;t know anything about the other back shavers, but this is the best money I ever spen and the customer service is the best.. If you shave your back get ride of your razor and get this.  I give it 10 stars.</li>
            <li> This is the first back shaver I&#x27;ve used that actually works. Only a couple things I&#x27;d caution guys on, neither of which are so bad that I&#x27;d rate the BakBlade lower than a 5. First, the instructions say you don&#x27;t need shave cream. This may be true if you&#x27;re using it in the shower and have a constant flow of water on you. Outside the shower in the mirror, use shave cream of some sort. Otherwise it&#x27;s not so comfortable even with shorter back hair. The other thing is if you have a moderate to heavily muscled back you will need to hit the same spot from different angles to get the hair off. The blade is very wide which overall is great, but a couple passes are needed to get it all off in certain spots. Overall- love this product. The blades work and provide a close shave on your back. I used mine in the mirror and that took some getting used to, even so it took very little time to shave my entire back. Far less time than having my wife do it with a conventional sized razor.</li>
            <li> Finally..a product that works for my back. I&#x27;ve tried the mangroomer(sucked) and some other razor with a long handle that was useless.I was skeptical biut was also desperate to ditch the gorilla suit at all costs. The BakBlade did the trick. For anyone on the fence I&#x27;d recommend a mirror in the shower to ensure ditching the back hair completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally women will give me phone numbers instead of taking pictures thinking i&#x27;m an animal at the zoo.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Works well and comfortable to use!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Got it an it amazing and quick.. Wish I had this years earlier..</li>
            <li> Only product out there. I have searched and there is nothing. I recommend to anyone who has a hairy situation.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. Quickly took care of my back. And that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li> BaKblade is great product for those who have back hair issues.  It is just like getting a back scratching as you remove the hair.  It cuts extremely close, leaving your back nice and smooth.  It does a better job dry than wet.  Highly recommend guys who have a back hair issue to get this product.  It does everything it is promoted to do.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can go outside without a shirt, wear tank tops, or other low back cut shirt without being feeling like a bear is on the loose.  My partner is thrilled of not having to clip/shave my back.  The BaKblade is a great product for helping increase one&#x27;s self esteem.&lt;br /&gt;No more waxings, hair removal products, or other such things.  Five minutes and my back is nice and smooth.  Keep up the great work!!</li>
            <li> First off let me start off by saying I don&#x27;t have a lot of back hair. Just enough to bug me. Started with the hair on my triceps. GONE! Went to work on my upper back followed by each side of my back. GONE! No more asking the GF, Wife, or even Mom...depending on your situation to help.I shaved it dry and it did not hurt or leave any marks at all! Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t work for the company....happy shaving</li>
            <li> These well made products are just what I was looking for. This is well made and arrived in short order. Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but  I have to say this works. Pretty simple to use. I ordered the extra blades. I&#x27;m glad I did, the blade in the package was damaged. I contacted baKblade &amp; they shipped me a new blade &amp; the response time was very fast.</li>
            <li> I am a hairy man.  The hair on my back would make a wookie double-take.  I really don&#x27;t like being as hairy as I am.  When I go to the beach or the swimming pool I dream of being able to take off my shirt without young children running away screaming or worrying about making the next issue of the Sasquatch newsletter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried various &amp;#34;razors on a stick&amp;#34; (both regular and electric) and smelly creams.  Every one I have found to be either ineffective (sasquatch with mange), painful, or just way too difficult to be practical.  That is, until I found the bakblade.  Whoever invented this thing should be hoisted onto the shoulders of hairy men everywhere and praised for their accomplishments.  It is easy, fast, very effective, and it actually feels good to use.  Before a shower it takes just a couple of minutes for me to go from full wookie to Mr. Clean and considering the thickness of my man-pelt, the blades last for an impressive number of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the need for a tool like this, look no further.  This is the best one that you will find.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Arrived here in Canada nice and quick, no brokerage charges! Gets the job done easily, seems safe enough and makes for a great back scratcher will you&#x27;re trimming the back 40.</li>
            <li> What an amazing product! Like most of the reviewers here, I am pretty hairy and a lot of other products have not lived up to their expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BakBlade works great! In only a few minutes my back was completely free of hair! It did not hurt at all, was totally easy, and I was able to do it in the privacy of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are like me and have to get rid of their back hair, look no further. This is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters better, their customer service is phenomenal. I am a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> This is the best back shaver I have ever used and I have tried a few.</li>
            <li> Hi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where do I begin.  I have had laser and used regular razors.....nothing, and I mean nothing compares to your product.  It is amazing how truly smooth I get and how much more confident I feel.  I&#x27;m a believer.  Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James</li>
            <li> Hurt like a mofo - will NOT be using this to manscape the back</li>
            <li> I really only have one thing to say about this.  If you&#x27;re a certain kind of man with a specific kind of problem, *look no further* than this.  Customer for life.</li>
            <li> SCAMMERS: All of the positive reviews I checked into were fake.  Click the user to see all their other reviews... they are either non existent or were made the same day just to seem legit.  This is not ok.  Amazon do something!!</li>
            <li> This product worked great, however it gave me razor burns. Next time I&#x27;ll use it in the shower or maybe try and apply some shaving cream on my back. Still worth getting it. If you are planing on using this before your vacation, make sure you use it atleast 2-3 days before you leave. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these a few years ago and it served me well until I lost it on a trip - I thought about not getting another one but the baKBlade is just so effective and by far the easiest way to remove back hair that I sucked it up and ordered it for the second time.  I have a moderately hairy back and I get a couple of months (shaving around once a week) out of each blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing is overpriced and the blades are a rip-off but there is still nothing that works nearly as well.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the baKblade! I finally got a chance to try it out last night. It seemed to work a little better for me dry than wet. But I have to say, I have never felt smooth after using any other product. I had been using a different product (a clipper/trimmer) for some time. It took longer, and would sometimes grab a hair and pull. But it was never smooth afterward. There was always stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great product, and really well done! Thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To any guy with back hair that wants it gone: this product took only a few minutes to use. Worked equally well on shoulders and arms. No fuss. No pain. It actually feels really good, like a nice back scratcher. You can use it all the time to just stay smooth. No need for hair to regrow so you can trim it again. And when I say smooth, I actually mean SMOOTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, I purchased my bakBlade directly from their website. For some reason, I didn&#x27;t have the tracking info for the shipment. So I sent them an email on Superbowl Sunday, asking when I might expect it to arrive. Matt, the CEO, wrote back personally that day, 2 hours before the game, with my tracking info. So the people behind this product are truly top notch with customer service.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!!!! Somehow the blade is protected so that it doesn&#x27;t cause any cuts but at the same time it gives such a close and smooth shave. I have used this on my back, which is lightly hair as I maintain it often. I also used it on my legs, which are pretty hairy, and the thing just works! After just 2 or 3 passes the hair, even in the thickest parts, is gone! If you have hair on your back or legs and want to be able to maintain it quickly this is the tool for you!</li>
            <li> Great back shaver.  I tried it for the first time and realized right away that it&#x27;s not a total solution for my back hair problem.  If you&#x27;ve let your back go to long or never shaved it before you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  But combined with the ManGroomer or ManGroomer Pro to knock it down to a shorter length for the razor to do its job, I believe you&#x27;ll get the closest shave you&#x27;ve ever achieved. I know I did.</li>
            <li> Why did this take so long to be invented? Simple and effective. Works as advertised. Leaves a hairless, smooth back even when shaving dry. Short learning curve. The first time I used it I had a couple of skin scrapes. The second time I used it, I realized just a light touch will do and have had a smooth back shave since then. I won&#x27;t complain about the price. The product works so well it is worth every dollar. I recommend this product to anyone who hates their back hair and wants an easy way to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and it works great!</li>
            <li> One word. BAKTASTIC!!!!!</li>

            <li> Easy to use and does a great job. Amazing how efficient it is. Watch the video that is available today</li>
            <li> I am undecided at this time ive used it once it most certainly does what it says it removed all my back hair. but it felt simular to running a garden rake across my back now given i havent shaved my back for along time but in the past i have with just a regular razor and had no iritation and shaved it dry as well. But i take inot consideration the fact of getting use to using it not pressing to hard andand getting it in the proper position after all shaving your back yourself if your not use to it can take some getting use to allso  my skin may be more sencative from where i havent shaved my back for sevaral years i may have to go with a wet or lubricated back shave but as ive stated it most certainly gets the job done in record time and removes the hair i would recomend this product over many ive tried on a product level i give it 5 stars like anything in time you get the hang of the best way to use the product for the best comfort for you[[ASIN:B00BPBLMCS NEW! baKblade&#x27;s \\&quot;BIGMOUTH\\&quot; Do-It-Yourself Back Hair Shaver - No Shaving Cream Required! (Watch Our Customer Review Video Demonstration!)]]</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. It removes unwanted hair with absolutely zero discomfort, no matter how thick the hair may be. Recommend highly!!</li>
            <li> Where were you when I was younger...highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Best back shaver to date.</li>
            <li> I made sure I read all the bad reviews, including the 1 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;YOU GUYS ARE NOT USING THIS CORRECTLY IF IT IS NOT WORKING FOR YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is obviously a little common sense needed aside from what&#x27;s in the instructions,&lt;br /&gt;NOT everyone has that, and that gentlemen, is the source of any bad review given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing works, and works PERFECTLY. I have what I would consider a medium amount of sickening fur on my back, within 5 mins it was gone, and smoothly shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZERO razor burn, and I mean NONE.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, when I let my chest or legs go too long between shaves, the first time I shave again, I will get some irritation in certain spots. With this, nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a perfect and genius product. Inventor should get the noble prize for bringing this thing to market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other back hair removal products as well as just a normal razor and this blows them away. So simple and does exactly as you would hope. The price point makes it even more attractive. I got 10 uses out of the first generation blades and just ordered the newly redesigned replacements which seem to be just as good, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this anywhere other than your back and shoulders just because the contour of the handle and the blade itself are really just built for reaching those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I used the man groomer along with a normal razor for the parts I could reach for about 3 years and it was such a hassle. The man groomer sucked and would actually draw blood if you didn&#x27;t hold it right. I went through about 6 of them and countless razors. This thing is so cool! I use it dry and it takes my thick back hair off with one pull. The blade lasts for quite a while as we&#x27;ll. I have used this razor for about 15 shaves and it shows no signs of dulling.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It works just as well as advertised and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to remove unsightly back hair.</li>
            <li> It is very similar to scratching your back with a back scratcher.  If you have a sensitive back this may no be the product for you.  You can complete shaving your back with this product in relatively no time.  Up keep maintenance is most likely once or 2x a week.  Recommend buy the replacement blades to have 1 shipping cost.  Would recommend if you do this in front of the mirror you will have to vacuum up the hair that falls on the floor which is a minor draw back.  I use it in the shower and can even get the product wet just ensure you dry it off after use.  If you have an extremly large amount of hair I can see the intial use clogging the blade, however keep up at it and no problems.</li>
            <li> Works Great!! - A bit expensive considering it is made of plastic</li>
            <li> If you got a little peach fuzz on your back this will might work for you. However If you&#x27;ve got some real growth back there forget it. It&#x27;s not going to get your back down to the skin smooth this thing trims the hair at best. The search for something to rid us of this cruise continues fellas. This is NOT it. It&#x27;s very important that those looking into buying this product know that ALL the 5 star reviews are fake. Don&#x27;t allow yourself to be swindled.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Shaved back in minutes. Awesome!</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best working product I have ever bought.  I wish I had one years ago!  I let my back hair grow out because it was such a pain to shave.  Shaving with this product was so easy and it felt like I was getting a back scratch.  I would highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> works very well.  takes a little practice to get the entire back smooth.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how good this product is. I was afraid it can scratch my skin or ever cut is if used in hard to reach angels but not even close. It&#x27;s hard to describe the feel when you pass it on your skin but it is doing the job flawlessly and safely. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why this took so long to be invented... Great product, somewhat irritating to the skin, but goes away in a day. Blades are soft metal, they don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> As a former big and tall model, I can attest that this can get you cleaned up in no time- I was ready to go to a pool party in no time. Some weird glitch happened where my product did not show up in time and the CEO of the company emailed me directly and sent me another shaver at no cost, who the heck does that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products of similar claims, but, have failed short, this at least has worked for me.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!! For years I have begged people to help me with this, now 1,2,3 done!! No more gorilla back could not be happier.</li>
            <li> I heard this item from a YouTuber alphamale and he was saying how to take care of those issues guys go through and I searched but was so hesitant to buy and took a risk. Surly it was a safe guys if your suffering like the other and myself get it and it really works. It shipped on the first day and was like I have to wait but It came on that day it was supposed to be shipped. All in all its a great product guys</li>
            <li> The blade is amazing! So easy to use, like a backscratcher, and what a close shave. No more contortions with electric shavers or wishing my wife would volunteer to help out. I&#x27;m so relieved that I finally found my ultimate solution. I&#x27;m done looking for a better way--this is the best!</li>
            <li> It is a decent back shaver, you will nick yourself if you apply any kid of pressure and if you have very sensitive skin like I do you will have some discomfort after shaving. I have used it 4 times and it will get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now some drawbacks. With my transaction it took nearly three weeks before I got my order. Paying 8 dollars for shipping I expected a shorter wait and the bakblade product itself is decent in quality although I wish there was a way to sharpen the blades because I can see it getting very expensive, if a comparable item comes into the market at a lower price point I will defiantly switch I am typically a brand loyal person but this product has inspired very little loyalty in me.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to let you know that we used the Bak Blade today and it was AWESOME! I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. What typically would take up to an hour with hair removal creams, razors and an electric razor was completed in about 5 minutes with no mess or smell. Thank you for a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Caryn</li>
            <li> You want to know something funny?  I bought this for the sole reason of an embarrasing issue:  I have some back hair.  I know right?  Im a woman.  But you know what?  This thing is AWESOME!  Not only does it get rid of the hair and give you a nice back scratching at the same time, but it also exfoliates your back.  Added bonus right?  Yup.  So it got me to thinking:  if this gets the hair on your back without skinning you alive, would it work on your underarms??  You might be asking, Why?  Why would you want to know that??  Because I have never, and I do mean NEVER, found a razor, shave cream or wax that I can use on my underarms and not get horrible razor burn.  Do you know how painful it is to have razor burn in a place where you sweat?? Not. Fun.  So anyways, I tried this out and after some inventive contortions, I was able to take care of underarm hair and NOT have razor burn!!  Multitasking.  Its the American Dream.  Just to make sure, I have used the baKblade every other day on dry underarms.  And no razor burn.  Not even a little.  I know its probably due to the razor guard but this shiznit is the bomb.  So not only do I get to take care of the embarassing back hair, but I also get the added benefit of rashless underarms.  (Cheering in the background).  Two thumbs up.  5 stars.  I dont even mind buying the replacement blades.  Its worth it.</li>
            <li> The Bakblade Bigmouth worked great, and as advertised.  I used it both wet and dry and found it easier to use while dry, just go slow.  I trim my back on a weekly schedule and have yet to use it for more than a month so I&#x27;m not sure how long the blade will last, but this shaver works great!</li>
            <li> Easy and quick to use, close shave, works from any angle and I don&#x27;t get chewed up the way I did using the battery powered back trimmers that I tried and returned. What is not to like about this product? Takes me less than 5 minutes for my back to go from Magilla Gorilla to stubble-free, smooth. So impressed I bought the replacement blade pack. Self sufficiency is a good thing!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say, except it really does work.  I have fine hair, so I don&#x27;t get any stubble.  I feel so much better about myself.  I wish it was a permanet solution, but all I care is it works, it&#x27;s cheap and I can do it myself.  It takes a little time to get used to, but not that much time.  Just need to use a mirror, and you are good to go.  This is by far one of the best products I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> It works really great i would suggest this to any man that has some nasty back hair it really does work</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described. Excellent razor back or chest shaving.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I bought this product as a UK customer, it came 13 days before the estimated delivery date and I can honestly say this product is the best on the Market. I can&#x27;t understand why this product is not all 5* reviews. Cleared my back in 7 minutes and trust me my back is ridiculous! It shaves as close as a normal razor and reaches every last spot on your back. It really is an amazing product. Thanks Guys!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought dozens of products from Amazon over the years, but I&#x27;ve never felt strongly enough about anything to write a review.  That&#x27;s how much I love this product.  I&#x27;m a competitive bodybuilder and I HATE getting waxes.  Not only are they expensive, I also tend to break out with acne afterwards.  I was looking for an alternative and this product is it!  Its shaped perfectly, works really fast, actually feels pretty good, and you get a crazy close shave.  You won&#x27;t believe how good this thing works.  I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
            <li> cant believe how well this works dry with no water</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Now you can shave your own back carpet by yourself!!!  Works really well.</li>
            <li> Your product is excellent!  To be honest, before using your product, I would refuse to do anything with my back because I was too embarrassed to get someone to shave it and too cheap to pay someone to do it. I saw your product on a video posted by the alpha m youtube channel and I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. When I tried your product for the first time, I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this product works. My main concern was the potential of cutting myself, but the design of the guard is ingenious and it&#x27;s impossible to cut yourself.  Your product makes it so easy to maintain my back. I have recommended your product to family members &amp; friends!</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE TAKES MINS TO DO LOVE IT WILL TELL EVERYONE I KNOW ABOUT THIS PRODUCT  VERY WELL BUILT</li>
            <li> This thing is easy to use. A little pricey, but worth it as I can&#x27;t reach my back with a razor. Very ergonomic and easy to maintain. It takes me less than five minutes to clean up my hairy back. It gives a very close, clean shave. Thanks baKblade!</li>
            <li> Amazon is making me type at least 20 words... Just know that it works VERY well, and that is coming from a guy with no problem growing back hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> works exactly as they said it would.  I am not flexible either, and it reaches all the spots.  hopefully the blade will last as long as they say, but so far so good</li>
            <li> Works well takes a little practice to see which direction to pull across your back but doesn&#x27;t cut your skin just the hair!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review often but when I do you should read it.  My wife bought me the ManGroomer. It broke after a few uses and didn&#x27;t work well and was a bit painful. Also needing batteries was annoying.  After reading reviews on Nair, I would not dare.  I also tried Remington body and back groomer and it is a solid razor for trimming your neck line but near impossible for the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So about 8 months ago I purchased the bakblade &amp;#34;BIGMOUTH&amp;#34;.  I was a little skeptical, but after my first use I was sold on the product.  It took less than ten minutes to clear the unwanted hair. Now it takes less than 5 minutes to maintain a hair free back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about having to buy replacement blades all the time, but the blades are well built and my first two lasted 7 months with 1-2 uses per week.  You can make the blades last, but if you like a close shave I would recommend replacing after 1-2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my advice to you if you are on the fence about the product is to buy it.  You will not be sorry and rather happy that you took my advice.</li>
            <li> I remember when I bought this that I read a couple reviews that stated that it is a poor product because you can cut yourself easily while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only cut myself once using this product, and to be honest I probably should not have attempted it after a few beers, not one of my most stellar moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cut yourself with this while you are sober..you are special, very very special. ;)</li>
            <li> I just ordered and used the baKblade last week, and I was very pleased with the product.  It was easy to use, and I did not experience any irritation at all.  It actually felt quite good, as the website says.  It&#x27;s a great product.  Hopefully I will never have to ask my brother or girlfriend to help me trim my back hair again!</li>
            <li> So I am a 42 year old, mildly back-hairy guy, and generally have been contending with back hair getting more and more dense starting around 28 and covering more of my back and thicker as the years tick by. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of options: waxing, Nair, laser hair removal, shaving, Mangroomer, BodyGroom from Phillips, and even buff pads, but nothing, and I mean NOTHING has been easier, time-saving or comfortable for eliminating back hair. The best part is that if you have spots that grow faster than others, you can do quick touch-ups whenever needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that dry shaving gets better results too. I tried in the shower first, but sound is your best friend here because you can hear the hair being cut, and there is no greater discomfort using it dry as opposed to wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in no way a shill for the company nor am I affilIated with them or any other reseller  I also seldom review any product, but in the case of my new Bakblade, as soon as I finished using it, I had to let everyone know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice work BAKBLADE</li>
            <li> Works easily.  I have used Electric, Creams and Wax.  This is much easier (and cheaper).  An extra 10 minutes in the shower once a week and I am good.  Does not irritate my skin.  It shaves clean and close, and the guard protects cut cuts.  It feels as close as a Waxing without the Pain, Time or Price.  Yes I will have to Shave more often than Waxing.  But I did say this BIG &amp; WIDE blade take 10 minutes.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love ordering from bakblade.  For me, their products always arrive early and in great condition.  This is a great company and since I&#x27;m only 21, they will have my business for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift.. he says it works great..</li>
            <li> Excellent top quality body shaver.</li>
            <li> the product seems like it’s been improved in the last order- quality of the blade and performance seem like they jumped a level.  Very happy with the product. Thank you.  Very satisfied and will be ordering more soon…</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to invest in laser therapy. Comfortable to use; fits my needs. Thanks</li>
            <li> Never use this product on dry skin such as your back. It will leave your skin chaffed **terribly** for a week. Use a very creamy soap as a lubricant while using this product. Also, be sure to moisturize your back heavily after usage. Great shave, even in the hardest to reach places.</li>
            <li> I no longer believe that any gadget or miracle cure I see advertised will work.  In fact I am confident that every claim made for products online or on TV will certainly not do a thing.  Hair removal has followed this trend.  I tried the ridiculous battery powered wand, which did nothing and broke within 10 minutes.  I also tried the silly handle that just holds your regular razor so you can reach difficult spots.  Also a disaster.  I promised myself I wouldn&#x27;t waste anymore money on products that claim to be able to clear the hard to reach hair on my back and shoulders.  I stuck to that promise for many years and just dealt with being hairy.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I saw a youtube video making the same claims about the baKblade, and at first I dismissed it as being as useless as any of the others.  The video seemed pretty legitimate however, and the guy was just laying waste to the hair on his back. I decided to break my promise and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The baKblade shipped quickly and discreetly and within an hour of receiving it I had laid out towels on the floor in front of the large bedroom mirror and gave it a try.  I decided to use the dry method only because the video I had seen was made that way.  I can tell you that I am not overly flexible, but the handle of the baKblade is long and strong and made reaching the difficult areas quite easy.  I did a few swipes and knew right away that this was different.  During methods I had tried before I could feel the blade just gliding over the hair and not actually cutting it.  This was just the opposite.  With just a little bit of force, the blade went right to the skin surface and cut the hair off like I was shearing a sheep.  I can&#x27;t express how wonderful it was to feel the blade effortlessly and painlessly erasing the hair.  I saw it falling to the floor and was thrilled.  I went to the mirror and fine-tuned a few areas, and in literally 10 minutes the baKblade had done what no other product in 20 years had been able to do.&lt;br /&gt;My next assumption was that the hair was being cut, but it would be stubbly and not a particularly smooth result.  I was completely wrong about that as well.  Not only was the hair gone, but my skin was completely smooth.  The hair was gone and it felt as though it had never been there.&lt;br /&gt;After a shower, during which it felt insane to feel the water on my bare skin, I put on a clean shirt and freaked out a little bit by the feeling of the cotton against my bare skin.  It felt so different.  It was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Some have reported irritation after a day, but I have not experienced that at all.  I feel cooler (less hot, not like Fonzie), and I feel cleaner, and even though no one can see, I feel more confident.  I don&#x27;t feel like a side-show freak anymore.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried other products and were disappointed, as I was, this may very well be your answer.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful my experience with baKblade has been.&lt;br /&gt;Believe me when I tell you that the baKblade WORKS!

            <li> Your product is amazing. It works really, really well.  Not only is it very easy to use, but it takes no time at all to clean up the whole back.</li>
            <li> I saw the baKblade on youtube about 6 months ago and instantly bought one. I&#x27;ve tried several hair removal methods and this is the only one I will ever use now.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and works great.  I use it twice a week and it literally takes me 30 seconds to take care of my upper back hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also baKblade has amazing customer service.  I had issues with my last order of replacement blades and they got back to me and resolved the issue with in hours.</li>
            <li> The razor made clean smooth shave without any irritation.  Have used several times with same great results.  Would definitely recommend product!!</li>
            <li> this thing is fantastic, virtually as close as a razor , easy and fast&lt;br /&gt;used it on dry skin and barely a nick..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this works so great! I love it. Not much else to say. Easy, fast and painless. A+</li>
            <li> Great idea that gets the job done without the intervention of others. Customer service was great as there was some hiccups due to an improvement in the model then shipping but it was all worked out and I was kept updated on every stage of the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right when I was thinking this would be even better if it was also adapted somehow to use in the shower and walla I hear they are working on some type of way to ensure this can be done, would make the clean up much easier.</li>
            <li> held off writing a review for Backspa back shaving system until I had thoroughly tried it out. Mine is  a special case where the issue of back hair removal is a tricky. I have CAMSRA which is Community Associated MRSA. I got it working in a correctional environment and it gives me fits when my skin is broken. I tend to get a bad staph infection when I usually try to shave my back. I&#x27;ve tried trimmers, and regular razors, which are very time consuming and about half the time leave me getting yet another staph infection.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve used Backspa now, a total of 6 times, since I bought it and have yet to see my first staph infection from it. This means that the razor does not break my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;  Using this product is a snap too. I have very fine hair so I found that using it in the shower was ineffectual. However, putting baby powder on my back and then shaving with it dry style gives me a great shave and I can do it in under 10 minutes. The teeth over the blade keeps you from making the mistake of nicking yourself. I can&#x27;t rave about this product enough. Thank you Backspa for giving me my back grooming back.</li>
            <li> This product is truly one of the most amazing yet simple designs I have ever seen. I have no idea why there are some people out there saying the reviews on this product are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just a consumer who stumbled across this product while searching for hair removal products. At first i was a bit put off by the comments about reviews being fake, and also the company&#x27;s website seems a bit cheesy so I was really not sure if I should buy the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting a few months to see some more reviews and watching some of the YouTube videos out there I decided to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that this is BY FAR the easiest and fastest way you can shave anywhere on your body. It is designed as a back razor but the razor can really be used just about anywhere on your body (not face). You can take the razor off the handle and just slide it anywhere you want, and like magic the hair is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the videos out there show people using the razor on dry skin, I think to use it in the shower is the best way. When I first received I used on dry skin, it worked fine, but I did notice a slight irritation on the areas I had shaved, nothing big just slight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shower, totally different story....once skin is wet, you barely even notice the \\&quot;back scratch\\&quot; sensation that is described in the advertisements, it just slides over skin and removes hair with absolutely no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for closeness, I think you can&#x27;t get any closer even if you use regular razor, I am able to completely remove any signs of stubble with this, and the best part, you can do you entire back, shoulders, arms, etc in minutes (like 2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping on my manscaping has never been easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you BakBlade!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***update***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to let all know, not only is the product great but the seller is top notch. I had ordered extra blades directly form bak blade website(you get three for 12.95, good deal) but the company sent two, I assume in error....I sent e-mail to company to ask them to fulfill the order, they promptly respond and sent an extra blade on top of the missing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the blade I am using is still the original one, it has been almost 2 months, I use three times a week and I only use in the shower and the blade is still going strong....I think using it dry will dull the blade quicker, but have no fear, these blades hold up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***update 3/7/14***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original blade is still going strong, seriously this razor is amazing, as I said I use in shower, or directly after while back is still wet, no issues at all. At this rate even shaving everyday you may got through 2-3 blades a year at most.y sent two, I assume in error....I sent e-mail to company to ask them to fulfill the order, they promptly respond and sent an extra blade on top of the missing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the blade I am using is still the original one, it has been almost 2 months, I use three times a week and I only use in the shower and the blade is still going strong....I think using it dry will dull the blade quicker, but have no fear, these blades hold up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***update 3/7/14***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original blade is still going strong, seriously this razor is amazing, as I said I use in shower, or directly after while back is still wet, no issues at all.

            <li> I wrote a very scathing review of this product&#x27;s predecessor a few months.  The supplier promptly refunded my money and recently sent me the new version free of charge.  This is what I expected the first time.  It shaves as close as can be expected with a blade that has a guard on it and was not much off a straight blade would shave yet not risk of cuts.  The size makes it fast too.  All in all a nice product and kudos to the Chris P., the supplier for following through so diligently.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEM KIND OF PRICEY BUT IT GETS THE JOB DONE LETS SEE HOW LONG THE BLADES LAST BUT FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  (Purchased it to remove back hair for bow hunting/scent control.)  Have to laugh at the results though.....  Makes my &amp;#34;ageing body&amp;#34; look &amp;#34;pre-pubescent.&amp;#34;  ~  LOL</li>
            <li> I happened across this online. I ordered one and had it sent to my son unbeknown to him. He lives in California, I in Michigan and I often send him care packages with things that I think he could use or needs. He was home for Xmas and for some reason we were discussing his long back hairs. After receiving the package, he replied that he was very surprised at what was in the package his mom had sent but that it worked really well, worth the money, no complaints - and he is very particular about things.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and  removes the hair  however  it did leave some cuts  and scratch marks.&lt;br /&gt; when I use it again i&#x27;ll  know not to press so hard and go slower and we will see if it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using BakBlade for about 3 months now. I usually shave once a week or once every two weeks. It takes me about 5 - 7 minutes to get the job done; I&#x27;m a pretty hair fellow. The baldes and handle are well-made, sturdy, and seem like they will last long. It can be a bit tricky to get to certain areas, like the center-mid-back, or center-low-back, but with some manuvering I always manage to get where I need to go. I got 7 shaves out of my first blade. I think I could have gotten a couple more, but I was influenced by the guidelines on the packaging. Oh, and the customer service is excellent! I dealt directly with the owner/CEO regarding a blade that was broken in shipping, and he immediately sent me a new one, and one extra for the inconvenience. Top notch!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  If you have thick hair or fair skin, this product may irritate your skin without shaving cream or another substance to help the blade glide.</li>
            <li> Back shaving used to be such a chore. Holding an electric razor to my back just took so long and the vibrations and noise together, for extended periods of time, are enough to annoy any one. Everyone in my house knew when I was shaving my back because of the drone of the electric razor. This thing lets me shave in peace without disturbing anyone. It&#x27;s faster too.</li>
            <li> I use it dry, I use it in the shower, took a few times to get used to. Also got some minor scrapes, that bled worse than they actually were and healed up quickly.</li>
            <li> Not only does it shave closely it feels great like scratching your back. Awesome product. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I can say, I was a bit skeptical at first. I was hoping for a product that got rid of the back hair better than the man groomer.  This product is absolutely amazing.  Trimmed whole back in 3 minutes.  Rake back and forth in different directions. It took me more time to vacuum up the hair than it did to remove it.  If you want a close trim, without wearing your arms out with a man groomer trying to not miss a spot.  This is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew about this before I spent 1500 bucks on Laser hair removal treatments that didn&#x27;t work. Three minutes guys, my entire back... It was ALL gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate like I did.  You will NOT regret it.</li>
            <li> Ive looked for a tool like this for long time.  Really does the job as shown and advertised.  Couldnt be more pleased.  If you got hair back there, this is the perfect product to remove it without any ones help...Seller shipped promptly.[[ASIN:B00BPBLMCS NEW! baKBlade&#x27;s \\&quot;BIGMOUTH\\&quot; Do-It-Yourself Back Shaver - (See Our Customer Review Video for Results!)]]</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I agree that these reviews must be fake.  Just think about it.  A razor that is held off the skin?  Your hair will just lay over and pass between your skin and the blade through the gap where it is held up.  Furthermore, with no force pushing the hair into the blade it just grabs like 1 out of every 100 hairs just by chance.</li>
            <li> Works great but do not leave in shower blades will rust.</li>
            <li> Excellent if you want to shave your back fur.  I can shave my back in less than a few minutes with this thing.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a friend and in an online forum.</li>
            <li> Matt, thank you for sending the additional product after the initial mystery. With a personal note no less! That is the correct way to do business. The bakblade.......WOW!! What a simple, brilliant device!  My friend you deserve a nobel prize for this. I feel like my younger self again, the real me! THANKS BRO.......from a future lifetime customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Show message history</li>
            <li> Great item, seller, shipping, smooth transaction!! AAA+++ Great design... don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!</li>
            <li> This this is truly amazing.  Wow, wow, wow.  It works so well.  I didn&#x27;t use shaving cream or anything, just dry, and it felt like my back was being scratched.  Actually felt good.  And the amount of hair it takes off in one swipe is boggling.  I even used it on my shoulders and back of my neck with no problem.  I think it works better than a regular razor would because there seems to be no threat of cutting yourself.  So easy, so amazing.  This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made, probably because my expectations were so low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  There were red marks on my back a few hours later.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go to the pool today.  I&#x27;ll put some conditioner on the blade next time.  Not too surprised.  Still love the product.</li>
            <li> My Ex LOVES the BakBlade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe he was actually surprised it works so well.  He has &amp;#34;engineered&amp;#34; several gadgets over the years, duct tape and a back scratcher were usually involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is thrilled to have a method of shaving his back that doesn&#x27;t rely on me or duct tape.</li>
            <li> Actually it is kinda funny, because i was going out of town with my girlfriend the other day and we were set to leave at 2:30pm that day, well all day I was hoping my new Bakblade would come before i had to leave, well sure enough at  2pm it arrives in the mail, and I am thinking do I have time, I thought yep I will give it a shot, well I used it and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Even funnier is that she showed up 10 minutes early, but I still had time to finish before she arrived.&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to use and left no marks and I had no stubble.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other methods and none have come close to compare.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best back groomer I have used to date. I have tried the razorback and the mangroomer with mixed results. Where the mangroomer was painful, difficult to use, and left short stubble, red marks, and steaks of ungroomed hair, the BaKblade is ACTUALLY painless, easy to use, and gets rid of all hair quickly. Where it used to take me 15-20 minutes to clean up my back with the mangroomer I was done in less than 5 with this product. I also have fairly fine hair on my back and this took care of it no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two criticisms, and they are very minor are 1) The color and 2) no adjustable handle. As far as the color goes who really cares, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to carry it in my back pocket but yellow?! Seriously?! Black or red or blue or something would have been much appreciated. As far as the handle goes, it&#x27;s long enough to reach pretty much anywhere but you do have to get a little creative and/or do some yoga to reach some difficult areas. If they come out with a 2.0 a notchable handle (like the mangroomer&#x27;s) would be much appreciated. That being said, I was able to get everywhere without much struggle at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short. If you have back hair that you would like to get rid of yourself. Buy this thing, It is by far the most useful product of it&#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
            <li> Great item and works very well.</li>
            <li> It works. I had a lot more hair back there than I expected, but it worked and did a pretty close job. I can see that there is some learning curve for looking in the mirror and getting to all of the spots. I shaved after a shower, no lotion and it did not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> I really like that I can use this product in the shower. Electric back shavers don&#x27;t work in the shower but this shaver does. I really like it has a wide blade to cover more surface area. It does it great job. The arm of the shaver also seems to be long enough to reach the different areas of my back. I have learned to not scrape too hard because I have put scratches on my back from pushing to hard. However, I still love this shaver and I am learning to be more gentle to reduce scrapes.</li>
            <li> I have bought several types of back hair removal products&lt;br /&gt;But this one has been the best and easiest to use&lt;br /&gt;If your very hairy like me ... Try it you will love it&lt;br /&gt;It seems to simple but works great and gets it very close</li>
            <li> Hi Matt,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a fabulous product.  Possibly one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I didn&#x27;t have a super hairy back to start out with however even a little was too much for me, but before I even knew your product existed I would actually try reaching around my back the best I could like a contortionist and obviously failed miserably every time.  I even tried taping a disposable razor to a stick once to make my own Bakblade but that failed also.  Let&#x27;s be honest guys, nobody really likes to ask their wife/girlfriend or significant other to shave their back and I doubt that many women enjoy doing it, so when I stumbled across this product and read all of the great reviews I was truly excited and ordered immediately.  And when it came days later I couldn&#x27;t wait to see if it really worked and was amazed at how easy and effective it was.  I only have to use it once every couple of weeks or so but every time it leaves my back smooth and hair-free.  I&#x27;m just sorry that I didn&#x27;t know about it sooner than I did.  I would recommend this product to any man or woman for that matter if they wanted to remove hair from their back.  Thank you for this excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug Phillips</li>
            <li> Dose what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This item is Easy to use and works as described. Only used it once so far but it worked well and I could do it by myself.</li>
            <li> I would rate this product a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; if I could. It works great and is extremely easy to use. I have an extremely hairy back (migrated from my head) and have used many products over the years. The jells and lotions can&#x27;t be done alone and the razor-based products take a long time and your back winds up looking like a teenager&#x27;s face the first time he shaves -- ripped to shreds. With this product, I run it across my back every 4-6 days and I&#x27;m done in less than 5-minutes -WITH NO NICKS OR CUTS. In fact, it feels like a back scratch. Great product -- Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it is about time a product stand up to the test,I love this product its been a long time comming for myself with the back hair battle... ITS ABOUT TIME POOL SIDE SHIRTLESS AND BLENDING IN OH YEA.....</li>
            <li> This is by far the best back shaver on the market . I have tried several others &amp; this one takes the cake. Easy to use , fast , close shave with no pain at all . I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought tons of stuff on the internet, especially here on Amazon. I&#x27;ve never taken the time to write a review until now. This thing is unbelievable. Stop searching. Add it to your cart and buy it.</li>
            <li> Threw my man groomer right in the trash after I got this thing. Gets the job done effectively with no batteries and a fraction of the pain and irritation. I&#x27;ve gone through 2 man groomers; this product is all you need. a little tricky to get along the spine but easy to get the hang of especially if you&#x27;ve been dealing with back hair removal forever like i have.</li>
            <li> This is every bit as good as described.  It&#x27;s truly a super product. A complete back shave was really easy to accomplish in no time at all. I previously relied on a battery operated Just-A-Trim and it took forever.  That product was so hard to get everywhere you had to go. This was a breeze. I experienced no cuts or nicks but the hot water in the shower stung a little bit after I used it (which wasn&#x27;t a problem as it told me the shave was really close).  I can&#x27;t figure out how it shaves so close looking at the blade and the safety guides but it does a great job. I expected it to leave more behind.</li>
            <li> this item work really well my back is hairless free no more embarrassment for me i recommend you buying one of these</li>
            <li> No nonsense back shaver, does exactly what it says it does, no knicks, no cuts, no more back hair.  You could probably use it to shave your legs and arms if you were into that I guess. But, over all, this thing is great, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Sleek simple design, effective and works.  I have sensitive skin and I have to shave my face during my shower.  I tried the Bakblade dry and no irritation or issues.  Since getting the product I use it every morning to keep and maintain.  Getting over the initial itch was the only issue but has since stopped and I think by keeping up daily that helps.  I just use quickly before my shower takes about 2 minutes to go over again and done.  I am not overly hairy so I cannot speak for large amount of hair growth I just have the small enough amount where it is annoying and I want a clean back/shoulder look.  I have not had it long enough to know the blade longevity but so far no issues and did not pull any hairs.  I would give it a 5 but have not had it long enough to determine blade longevity....</li>
            <li> Thank you for your quick response. I recieved it yesterday and literally 5 minutes after I recieved it, I shaved the sweater off my back lol my entire back!!! AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am not an ape but on a scale from 1 to 10 I consider myself a 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing worked great.. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting to see how long the blade lasts but it is the best back shaver ever.</li>
            <li> Shockingly easy, quick and effective.  Comically comes with directions, but if you can&#x27;t figure this out I feel bad for you.  Tried it for the first time and just didn&#x27;t believe it was working b/c it&#x27;s just so darn easy.  I then tested it on my leg hair, and yup, it works.  Nice and wide and you can literally clear you back of hair in less than one minute.  I checked my back in the mirror and there were no cuts, just a clear back.  With how quick this works I feel the blade will last about half a year.  When you touch the blade, you wouldn&#x27;t think it would work b/c it&#x27;s not as sharp as face razor.  But I guess that&#x27;s the magic of it b/c there were no scrape marks on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a $70 rechargeable body razor for my front torso, but I&#x27;m gonna try this Bigmouth on my front next time.  Best thing I bought from Amazon in the past year.</li>
            <li> My back hair is so thick I can braid it. Now I don&#x27;t have to pay a neighbor kid t o shave my back.</li>
            <li> it works so well. The extra wide blade takes off big amounts of hair. I just used it for the first time about 2 hours ago and it took about 5 minutes to do my whole back and it is so smooth. Seriously, it took 5 minutes, and I could have been done sooner but I found myself dumbfounded by how well it works. I also own a man groomer but I will never use that again. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - it does an awesome job. It feels better than a back scratcher. It works fast. It is easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some minor caveats - I did experience some razor burn but I still do prefer the dry shave compared to the wet skin I tested. The razor burn is gone now, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it and go right to the beach with your shirt off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t ship prime so the price is without shipping. While I can understand this for the handle, i really wish the blades weren&#x27;t that way. Does it really cost 5.95 to ship blades?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M A MAN! MEN HAVE HAIR EVERYWHERE! NOT LIKE THOSE GIRLY MEN OUT CALIFORNIA WAY, BUT A REAL MAN! I EAT NOTHING BUT BALD EAGLE MEAT AND BACON, BOTH OF WHICH I HUNT FOR MYSELF!  THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT WORKS FOR MY BACK HAIR! I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT HAS A MANS BODY, AND A MANS BACK HAIR! I WORKS!</li>
            <li> Yesterday I received the new BakBlade in the mail.  I quickly opened the package and examined the product.  I was amazed at its solid construction and sleek design,  Having been the first time I have seen the product upclose, I inspected the blade attachment and was amazed at the design.  I admit, I didn&#x27;t know how something that looked so simple could do what it was supposed to do.  Later last night I started to use the BakBlade and was amazed - the blade cut the hair on my back closely, quickly, and effortlessly!  I have used other back shaving products in the past (mangroomer and razorba) and have been disappointed in the outcome and the length of time that it took to cover the entire back.  I often became discouraged at the amount of time it took these other products to cover my back.  Many times I would often resign to letting my back hair stay rather than use these other products.  That being said, in what usually took me 10-15 frustrating minutes with these other products, took me only 2-3 mins using the BakBlade.  I LOVE the product and new blade and can&#x27;t wait to use it for many more years to come!  In fact, after using the new BakBlade, I quickly threw my old products away without hesitation!  Without a doubt, this is the best, quickest, and easy back shaving product on the market.  If you were like me and wanted to take care of your back hair, do yourself a favor and purchase this product...you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing. I shaved my back in 5 minutes with absolutely no shaving cream--it didn&#x27;t hurt at all! My back was not even slightly irritated. The President of the company himself made sure that everything was to my satisfaction--he even sent me their new blade to try out--that&#x27;s true customer service!</li>
            <li> Well Chris I received the blade and this is one hell of a blade after laughing a bit when I opened up the package looking at this monster saying to myself will this thing cause me to bleed to death when I use I went home that night and tried it well to my surprise it was amazing smooth,no cuts,no razor burn,nothing ,my back was shaved in 5 minutes and was as smoothed as a baby&#x27;s #### so needless to say I actually look normal when I take my shirt off and do not have to ask my wife to shave me down like a poodle lol lol I thank you for inventing this wonderful blade and please let me know how I reorder new blades</li>
            <li> After suffering the torture of battery powered shavers I purchased the baKblade.  This shaver is easy, fast, and, does a great job.  Do yourself a favor and use the baKblade and save yourself from the misery of battery powered back shavers!</li>
            <li> It arrived today, and I put it to the test.  It beats Mangroomer (which I also own and have used for YEARS) by a mile.  The bakblade is not only easy and painless to use (and doesn&#x27;t leave a single scratch on you, btw) but it is also MUCH faster than Mangroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a super invention.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, do yourself a favor and pick one up.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most useful things I have ever bought. It saves so much time and is hassel free. I have also used this on my chest and abs and it works flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you arent cold when using it, so no goosebumps should be present or it will get uncomfortable, so using it during a shower will be necessary if you&#x27;re cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest people use an alcohol spray after they are done to clense everything and apply aloe vera moisturiser after shaving back.</li>
            <li> I love  my bakblade... I wish I would have purchased it sooner.. It gets dam near as close as waxing without any of the pain...  It feels like you&#x27;re using a back scratcher..Don&#x27;t waste anymore time get the bakblade and start enjoying the summer... Shirtless!!!</li>
            <li> this thing reaches everywhere on my back and more. I also like getting my back scratched, so this thing feels good to use.</li>
            <li> Thank you for changing my life. I&#x27;ve never felt better and more confident after the first use. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Bakblade.  I have used it several times with great results. I love the ease of use and the short time it takes to get a clean shave.  I wish I would have found this sooner!  No more waxing or bugging my wife to help me.  If you like a smooth clean back in about 10 minutes with no nicks or cuts, do yourself a favor and buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making a great and very much needed product.</li>
            <li> WOW! I purchased this back shaver about a month ago and I am incredibly happy with the results.  The baKblade shaves and cuts better than any other back shaving tool on the market hands down. My Wife loves using it on me too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent too much money on other back hair solutions and am very happy I finally came across something that does what it says!</li>
            <li> I only used it once so far but it worked great. It took a while but I&#x27;m sure that was because it was my first time. I have some moles on my back so i have to be real careful there. I hit one and bled for a while. All in all it will do just fine.</li>
            <li> Its a tough world out there these days.  You have a choise to keep everything untrimmed and old school but most times it turns to a jungle and who wants to deal with that?  Some women say they like it blah blah blah, they are lying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recent trimming option have been asking for help, they never do it right by the way, plastic hanger with a cordless trimmer attatched by rubber bands(works but a pain in the @$$, and now this Bakblade.  Worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it guys!</li>
            <li> This little guy is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s super easy to use and takes almost no time. I don&#x27;t have a hairy back but hate those random hairs that pop up here and there. I literally remove the plastic cover, take off my shirt, run the thing over my back and shoulder for a minute or two, and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No more using my body Norelco Bodygroom for back duty. This has much more reach and I don&#x27;t have to contort my arm in weird angles to get places. Plus the area that the blade covers is much bigger. The blade is roughly the length of an iphone (not the plus version) so you can imagine how much more space you can cover compared to that o a Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It actually feels pretty good to use. It&#x27;s like one of those back scratchers you get every year in your stocking at christmas. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but don&#x27;t have the fear of slicing my skin off. No need to use any shaving cream as I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation. I&#x27;ve not yet nicked myself, but the device seems safe in that regard. I think you&#x27;d have to really mess up in order to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The blades are replaceable so it&#x27;s not a throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;d stick to using it solely on your back. This could possibly irritate your chest and pubic area. The hair is more dense and thick in those areas. The back seems less prone to irritation. I tried it on my chest and it&#x27;s a bit iffy. I stopped because I was afraid it would end badly. I have the Bodygroom for that anyway. I saw some videos where people used it on their butt as well. I tried that and if it&#x27;s area that gets irritated from shaving for you I&#x27;d advise against it. Although I think it&#x27;s safer than the first two areas I mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back hair is unsightly. Especially if it&#x27;s the kind that only grows in one or two areas leaving you to look like a dog with mange. The device takes almost no time, feels good, is stupid simple, and actually works. I had no idea this thing even existed a few weeks ago until I saw it on youtube. It&#x27;s one of those things that&#x27;s so simple you think &amp;#34;why didn&#x27;t I think of that&#x27;.this thing even existed a few weeks ago until I saw it on youtube. It&#x27;s one of those things that&#x27;s so simple you think &amp;#34;why didn&#x27;t I think of that&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product highly recommended</li>
            <li> I tried out my baKblade the same day I received it.  BaKblade is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It is the very best product I have ever tried for shaving my own back and I have tried several. I&#x27;m moderately hairy. This first use took me a while but after a couple more uses I should be a pro!  The long sturdy handle made it easy to reach my entire back. The blade is as sharp as a regular blade razor plus extremely short plastic teeth to protect you from cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Use right out of the package NO assembly required, no batteries,no shave cream needed, use dry. Blades are easy to change. My back looks and feels great. I recommend to anyone wanting to start removing their back hair and to the seasoned. You need to try the baKblade. You will love it !</li>
            <li> Piece of cake to use. Works awesome!  Just what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> Hey this thing just works.  Don&#x27;t know how long it will stay sharp but for the price I&#x27;ll just buy another one when it dulls.</li>
            <li> Works great, and you&#x27;re done in no time!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair removal products in the past but nothing matches the capability of this product. I can have a smooth back in just a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I will be a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> Matt, I very much like the Bigmouth shaver. It gets the job done in&lt;br /&gt;half the time of the small width shaver that I was using. The handle is&lt;br /&gt;nice and sturdy and the length is just right. I tried it first without&lt;br /&gt;shave cream and this next time I am going to use shave cream to compare&lt;br /&gt;it for comfort. It really cleans the back nicely. I personally don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;have heavy hair on my back, but enough that I want it gone and your&lt;br /&gt;shaver did the job. I would recommend it to anyone thinking of getting&lt;br /&gt;a back shaver. Thanks, Mike</li>
            <li> It works great Matt . Has anyone ever tried using shaving cream with it ? . I know it says not to . Better system than the Man Groomer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and faster.</li>
            <li> No joke, this thing is amazing!  My back is like a gorilla and this thing took it down to the skin with no issues or wild contortions.  I had 6 months of back hair at the time as well.  I bought several extra heads just in case they stop making it!  Get this if you have a problem with a hairy back and want to shave it down on your own, you will be quite surprised!</li>
            <li> I must admit it took me a little time to get the hang of using baKblade.  But once I got the hang of it, after my first time,  baKblade was easy to use and much neater than any other method. I tried sprays - what a mess. Razor - ouch! baKblade is easy to handle, easy to clean and leaves my back smooth and hairless.  It works!</li>
            <li> What other product has nearly every positive review indicated as being helpful by \\&quot;X out of X people\\&quot;? Look at the purchase history of each reviewer - they&#x27;ve either only bought this item, or this item is the only one with an \\&quot;Amazon verified purchase\\&quot; tag in their history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is trying to screw people over. It&#x27;s clear as day. As I listed under another person&#x27;s review saying the same thing, the company should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. This is truly despicable behavior. It&#x27;s infuriating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should pull this product immediately and delete the seller&#x27;s account. No question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (4/7/14):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have posted this, I have been bombarded by negative comments from fake accounts. I have also noticed that this company has decided to use fake accounts to purchase their own products in order to achieve the \\&quot;Amazon verified purchase\\&quot; tag. One thing they cannot do is tack on a detailed review history going back several years for each account they make up. Please take into consideration the fact that, while the reviewers now have the \\&quot;Amazon verified purchase\\&quot; tag, their review history is very limited and typically all occurs within a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company&#x27;s pattern of dishonest actions is truly shameful.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these in March, 2013. I couldn&#x27;t get it to cut anything, not even arm hair. I wrote a bad review, went back to my electric shaver and forgot all about it. Then the owner contacted me after seeing my complaints and told me the replaceable blades had been improved and offered to send me some free replacements. This is my review of the NEW blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new blades work amazingly well. I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy, and hadn&#x27;t shaved my back in over a week. With the electric shaver, it takes about 30 minutes and does an OK job with visible but uniform stubble. With the new blade on the backSpa I managed the same job in under 2 minutes, and the shave was MUCH closer than with the electric. It left no visible stubble at all. I have to say this is now THE BEST back shaver on the market.</li>
            <li> Absolutely works great and in little time....Beats using cream by far!!!  I&#x27;ll have this for years with the extra blade.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have tried many different types of shavers including the mangroomer and this is by far the fastest and best method. The blades are fantastic and I highly recommend  them for anyone that wants to remove back hair as efficiently as possible. I barely have to do it once a week.</li>
            <li> OK, OK I admit. I got back hair - quite a lot actually. I&#x27;m the guy who wore a tee-shirt swimming out of consideration for others. Before seeing this product on a shaving-products website I used Nair for men, which is messy and smelly and time-consuming. As for other body shavers and trimmers - they don&#x27;t reach. This product is easy, painless, fast, chemical-free and reaches all the parts of my back. I am totally grateful and immediately bought 6 replacement blades so I can stay stocked up. This is a terrific product for all of us guys who would rather not need it, but do.</li>
            <li> I have a very hairy back. I mean VERY hairy. It&#x27;s like a bear crawled on my back and made a nest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started looking into ways to address it that wouldn&#x27;t cost me a small fortune, and came across this product. I figured, hey, it&#x27;s not that expensive. Why not give it a shot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it arrived yesterday, and I just finished using it for the first time. All I can say is....WOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing works GREAT. With all my long, thick back hairs, the first time took only about 30 minutes. And outside of a tiny patch or two that I missed because of the insane amount of hair on my back, it&#x27;s totally clean. And now that I&#x27;ve done the initial shave, all my future sessions to maintain it should only take a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to use, and I didn&#x27;t get a single scratch. I just placed an order for a couple of replacement heads, because I definitely plan on using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Incredibly better than expected. I used it with no water and it felt gratifying, like scratching your back. Easy to use and did a perfect job. I was concerned that I would miss spots or need to see in the mirror what i was doing but I was very surprised and satisfied with the results. Never again will I get my back waxed. Like everyone else who&#x27;s used it...I wish I had invented it!</li>
            <li> the razor works really good,but there&#x27;s a small learning curve to get comfortable with it.  so far,a very good product</li>
            <li> I tried it both dry and wet with same results. If you&#x27;re going to use it in the shower it will help to have a large mirror. One method I&#x27;ve got with great results was take a shower and dry off and use it then, much like shaving your facial hair. This is not going to give you a smooth shave like your facial razor. This is a great for when you&#x27;re going to the pool or having your shirt off. My girlfriend commented on my back hair, which is not dark and thick, but a light blonde color and when dry, it&#x27;s noticeable. I have not told her I&#x27;ve bought anything, so I&#x27;ll get her reaction, she&#x27;s a straight shooter type, she will either love it or hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the recharging types and they are just as effective, but the downfall is that when the battery stops charging you&#x27;ll have to toss it. This requires nothing but replacement blades, at $13 for a pack of two and with a claim of 6-7 uses per blade, it&#x27;s not a bad deal. Most might consider it pricey, but I&#x27;ll pay within reason for the time and effort someone has put into a product that does what it claims.</li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE! Love love love it! So easy, done in minutes. Now I don&#x27;t have the hairiest back around, but its an eye sore when I look in the mirror. Not anymore!! Ordering the spare blades soon, though I think the original one will last at least 10 more times for me.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use and really works. The customer service is top notch. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Genius! Love the product!  Makes something I always dreaded simple &amp; easy. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Really recomend this for somebody that has nobody to give a hand. With no shaving cream is perfect and with it is even better. Buy it. Personnally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Solved a rather nasty problem.  I&#x27;ll leave it at that.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I never thought I would tell the world I am using this product but it absolutely works even better than it has been described here!! No more taping razors to sticks or asking your girlfriend to do it. The nice thing I couldn&#x27;t find any info on the comments here is that the razor is about 1.5 feet long. It has plenty of room to get to any spot you may need to reach. An absolute must buy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail today. I took it out of the packaging, read the instructions, and tried it. This back shaver is amazing! It worked so good on my back shaving all the hair. I was really impressed. It felt like I was getting a back scratch and you know how good that feels!  I shaved my whole back and it looks clean, smooth, and hairless. It also shaved off some skin tags that I had back there so I was happy about that. I don&#x27;t give reviews often and I am not paid for this. I just have to tell you honestly that this bakBlade works as described. If you have hair on your back that you want shaved off, this tool will do it. You get what you pay for and I am happy with this purchase. Going to get a wax was kind of embarrassing, so now I can shave my back in less than 5 minutes whenever I need it done!  Finally a solution getting the hair off my back. One of my better Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> this thing works shockingly well.  It DOES take time to get accustomed to working with back (everything reversed) but no, works pretty good !!!</li>
            <li> Thank you Matt, I just received the package today.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a satisfied customer!&lt;br /&gt;I tell all my buddies, and and a few ladies, about the baKblade and how great and easy it is to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again&lt;br /&gt;Lance Haws</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally post reviews even though I spend 80% of my paycheck on Amazon, but after receiving the bakblade in the mail yesterday I felt compelled to tell everyone how much I now love this product.  It does exactly what it says it will do, it&#x27;s as easy as advertised, and it&#x27;s the smoothest my back has ever been outside of after waxing.  Which by the way I now never have to do again.  Thankfully.</li>
            <li> This product works.  Hands down awesome.  Very quick, easy to use, and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I am a very big and hairy guy. I was able to shave around my back with ease. The best shaving blade that I ever brought .  Definitely going to buy more refill blades. Works just as Seller described. I also used the bakblade on my chest, shoulders and arms. Much better than the electric shavers that I used to use. Just want to  thank the bakblade team for a great product..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fought with razors for years to keep the back hair at bay.  I must admit when I first saw the product I was a tad dubious about the claims. But I ordered it anyway!  Well I can&#x27;t sing enough praises about this device. I was blown away by how easy it is to use and how well it works. This is a must buy if you want to get rid of that hair on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers guys</li>
            <li> Works well for the price. Plastic guard is worth it. Adds additional reach for shaving the back.  Very recommended for hairy people.</li>
            <li> Beats an overpriced, inconvenient, and often hurtful back wax. I used my bath faucet to rinse this off and&lt;br /&gt;it made for a quick and smooth back shave! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!!!  When I clicked the order button, I immediately had this sinking feeling in my stomach thinking I would again be wasting money on another back hair removing product that does not work (like the original Mangroomer)... then I saw some guy claiming that this product was a scam and that the positive review were fake... I was actually a little terse with the owner when I didn&#x27;t get a tracking number because of those comments, but WOW!  I was soooo wrong... this is the most amazing product ever... I don&#x27;t know who this person is that says it doesn&#x27;t work, but he is wrong... unless his back hair like super super thick.... I mean, my back hair was dark and all over the place -- the shoulders all the way down...  but while it is dark and there was tons of it, it wasn&#x27;t like &amp;#34;brillo pad&amp;#34; coarse...  so maybe that was that guys problem.  The BakBlade removed it all with zero pain and zero razor burn... I just can not believe it!  I&#x27;ve been embarrassed by my back hair for years and with this it was gone in like 10 minutes. There is no visible stubble!  Just smooth skin... It also did my shoulders!!!!</li>
            <li> Simple, effective.  Can&#x27;t believe someone didn&#x27;t come up with this a long time ago. Well worth the price. Really works.</li>
            <li> Dude. Buy this. I had every doubt in the world spending this freaking much for a flimsy piece of plastic with a blade; and now I am sold. And yes, it feels amazing. Screw waxing.</li>
            <li> When I was in high school I realized I was going to be one of those lucky dudes who had to shave his back. Just what you want to discover when you lived in Florida, spent a lot of time at the beach, and were already an insecure teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much resigned myself to being one of those people always wearing a t-shirt in the pool or at the beach -- in the water or out. More recently, with concerns about UV exposure and too much time in the sun, it became easier (and, dare I say, trendy!) to wear a special &amp;#34;swim shirt&amp;#34; or rash guard at the beach or outdoor pool. &amp;#34;Nope! I&#x27;m not excessively hairy, I&#x27;m just being diligent in my concerns about melanoma...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-forward a couple decades and now &amp;#34;man grooming&amp;#34; is all the rage. This made it easier to find a variety of different solutions for those of us who prefer not to spend their adult lives looking like Sasquatch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, my wife was kind enough to assist even though I hated asking her. I&#x27;ve tried Nair (Stay away. Stay far away.), regular shaving, and, when I got tired of asking my wife, I tried that insanely overpriced plastic apparatus into which you insert a standard shaver. Each had its pros and cons (Except Nair. Stay away.) and all took a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More recently, I&#x27;ve been using one of those electric, two-headed shavers (one side trims, one side &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34;) for a couple years. Not long ago, I dropped it on the bathroom tile and it broke. Even though it was a major PITA to use and took forever, the results were decent so I immediately ordered another one. Apparently in the time it took me to break the first one, they figured out a way to actually LOWER the already shoddy quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I started my biweekly trim/clean-up with the electric shaver and, feeling like each and every one of my hairs was being individually yanked out by tiny tweezers, I figured there HAD to be a better way. I came back to Amazon ready to buy that plastic apparatus again (I&#x27;d thrown out the first one after I switched to an electric) and found baKblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I obsessively read all the reviews, figured there was no way it was as good as it sounded, but plunked down the money for the shaver and extra blades anyway (better to save on shipping costs, right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bakBlade arrived today and I immediately ran into the bathroom to try it out. I tried it without any lotion or gel and -- HOLY COW -- it worked as advertised. No pain, and the hair is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy pretty much everything on Amazon and rarely write reviews, especially for a product that I really don&#x27;t want everyone in the world to know I&#x27;m using, but I had to write this review for everyone else who is -- as I was -- hesitant because it sounds too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion: read the reviews by VERIFIED PURCHASERS to convince yourself that the reviews aren&#x27;t written by shills that are paid by baKblade. And then immediately add this product to your cart and BUY IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come back and thank us all later.lastic apparatus again (I&#x27;d thrown out the first one after I switched to an electric) and found baKblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I obsessively read all the reviews, figured there was no way it was as good as it sounded, but plunked down the money for the shaver and extra blades anyway (better to save on shipping costs, right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bakBlade arrived today and I immediately ran into the bathroom to try it out.

            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for over a year, and it&#x27;s amazing. Will never buy another one!</li>
            <li> What can I say, but WOW. A must have for any man what body hair in undesirable placed. Quick and easy! Also, the merchant baKblade has AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Would definitely recommend to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2UUDPVJZEPM2A]]Love it.  First time I&#x27;ve ever been able to do all my own grooming.  Definitely worth it.  Very glad I got it, plus great customer service.</li>
            <li> I just received my new Bakblade razor. I have tried several different types with no success until I tried the Bakblade.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use. The design of the handle even makes it easier. I was a little nervous about not using any shaving cream and the possible skin irritation. But to my surprise this was by far the easiest and most comfortable system. What I liked most was how close it shaves the hair on your back. My skin was so smooth that I couldn&#x27;t even tell that I have back hair. Because of that I feel the hair will take longer to grow back which is exactly what I want. I recommend this product to anyone who likes to man scape. I also am looking forward to the other products that are planned for 2015.</li>
            <li> The blade worked really well and to be honest I was very surprised how well and close it got...and with no cuts or even really any scratches.  So far I would definitley recommend the product to anyone that asked about it.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this product is for real. I hate my back hair and have always hated the thought of asking someone else to shave it for me. My poor wife!! This is the only thing I wanted for Father&#x27;s Day and I&#x27;m so glad I stuck to my only wish. The baKblade rocks! Took a little getting used to the reaching, but in a few minutes I had it down! Works great!!!! Does not hurt at all!!! Wonderful product that I will recommend to my brothers in my Big, Italian, Hairy Family!</li>
            <li> this is the best back razor they have ever invented I totally love it.</li>
            <li> This worked better and way faster then the Man Groomer - the unit I was using before this one.  Plastic guards so you cannot cut yourself, HUGE razor head so one swipe covers 20% of your back</li>
            <li> This is a must have for hairy backed people.  It has been nothing short of life changing for me.  I was self concious about taking my shirt off in public for fear I&#x27;d be mistaken for a Yeti.  I finally have confidence to go to the beach or pool and not have to explain why I&#x27;m wearing a shirt.  Can&#x27;t give this product enough praise.</li>
            <li> After years of many products I think I finally found the solution to my squatchness here.  Easy and simple to use I will definitely be buying a few more.  Great product, does what it says which many of the products in this field do not.</li>
            <li> Everything seemed great, I thought it was a godsend... Then it all went wrong. I have the worst case of razor burn I could ever imagine. All over my back. I am going to try to post a picture so you guys don&#x27;t think I am being a jerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets the hair off really well, but I am suffering now.</li>
            <li> The Bakblade has changed my life. I don&#x27;t have to worry about wild back hairs peeking out when I wear  t-shirt, it&#x27;s Great!! I&#x27;ll be saving a ton of money and time.</li>
            <li> This product is genuinely fantastic. I used to use veet/nair on my back which was a pain to get spread even and smelled awful. Bakblade is great cause it takes mins and I never miss a spot. The only downside is the smoothness only lasts a couple of days but it&#x27;s so easy just to shave it again. Very impressed and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Just finished using it....WOW! I have not been hair free for like 20 ish yrs....it feels....good..interesting..strange? I have SUPER DUPER HYPER sensitive skin so it just felt REALLY different (in a good way).... but The bakblade itself worked like a charm....I am sure I&#x27;ll get better at it as I use it more but AMAZING!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> this is great it replaced my wife</li>
            <li> A+! I did lots of research online trying to find the product that would be easy to use, but also worked quickly and efficiently. The baKBlade does that with ease.  I&#x27;ve already recomended this to a bunch friends, one of which already bought one and loves it.</li>
            <li> Let’s just say I am the hairiest guy in the world and we’ll leave it at that.  I, for one, purchased this shaver awhile back and was extremely happy with the overall results.  The most valuable part of this back shaver is the fact that the razors have a teeth barrier that protect the user from cutting oneself while at the same time the hairs fall between the teeth and then get cut.  The other solid feature of this back shaver is the fact that the blades themselves are nice and wide thus covering more areas at once while shaving.  I probably cut down my back shaving timeframe by 30 minutes.  Finally, this back shaver does not require any shaving cream and you will have a better understand when using at the fact that it actually feels good when shaving is the cherry on the topping.  I have tried other back hair “trimmers” which not only just “trims” the hair but I have had 2 mangroomers break on me with no return!  All-in-all the hairy back community has been needing a product like this for some time now and I for one and very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor, I&#x27;ve tried many other products electric and manual but this is the best one that I have ever used. I highly recommend it, I have a very hairy back and this did a great job on it.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and even better experience with the Product !  This is my first time ever shaving - wife and kids said get rid of sweatter for Bahamas trip - the unit is so easy to use is silly! No water no foam needed ! It works fantastic!!  Very pleased with purchase I Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after previously purchasing two of the electric mangroomers; both of which broke (the plastic is flimsy - the handle broke on one, the case around the cutters / circuit board on the other). I didn&#x27;t expect the bakblade to do such an awesome job. For context, I&#x27;m black and have thick curly hair - no problem for this blade! It&#x27;s quick and I&#x27;m able to reach my entire back!</li>
            <li> Good product, it works, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> No more asking the wife to shave my back.  Easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised cant go wrong with the baKblade it awesome</li>
            <li> I never leave reveiws... but I have to say this is the best 50 bucks I&#x27;ve spent on grooming. I&#x27;ve tried everything to manage the not so glorious mane that covers my back. The creams, razors on a stick, bribing a sibling all are a thing of the past. Five mins in front of the mirror and boom... hairless as a baboons red ass. bakblade... you guys are awesome, I continue to sing the praises  of this product to all who want a smooth back. Keep up the fantastic work!</li>
            <li> My husband is not a really hairy guy, he just has that patch on his lower back. He asked me to shave it once for him, and it’s something we will not do again. So when I saw this, I knew it would be perfect. He was a little unsure at first, but after using it a few times, really likes it. I like that he is not self-conscious about it anymore which makes us both very happy. I highly recommend this to anyone who has to deal with this and does not want to ask their significant other or get waxed. It is painless and effective!</li>
            <li> Works good but hard to reach middle back near spine.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am very impressed with just how well this back shaver works. I have used the baKBlade just 3 times over the last couple of weeks and each time I actually get excited to shave my back because of how good it actually feel using it! I not thought I would actually look forward to shaving my back. Hats off to these guys!</li>
            <li> Read the negative reviews... They are spot on.  Nearly all of the postive reviews are written by people who have only written one review... this one.  They are long and very detailed, which I find very hard to believe.  Three of them have two reviews... one for this and one for a Bruno Mars CD.  So, either people with hairy backs all like Bruno Mars, or something is amiss.  Buyer beware....</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say Thank You!  The BakBlade is by far the quickest and easiest product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me like 5 minutes to do the entire back, where as before it was at least 30 minutes, and several stops to check the area that I was working on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BakBlade just felt like a good back scratching and the wide blade just made the hair melt away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Again,&lt;br /&gt;New Lifetime Customer</li>
            <li> FINALLY SOMETHING I CAN USE ALL ON MY OWN, it gives a smooth shave like a razor, its like a very rough back scratcher, I&#x27;ve used it about a dozen times, it only cut me once ( i think i pulled to hard.)  My only complaint is it doesnt work well on short hair you have to let it grow out a little bit.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time and it worked perfectly. So easy and effective. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After 3 shaves, so far so good. Nearly impossible to cut yourself with it. But if you have some angry zits on your back, this will cut them. I recommend shaving dry.  I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy. Been in a few hairy chest contests, never took first, but always placed well.</li>
            <li> Best so far that I have come across for removing large areas of hair.  I would though say that it will remove lots of hair in a short time frame but does it in a courser fashion.  Once you remove 95% it is difficult to use the baKblade for fine detail areas but two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Quicker due to larger blade width&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Areas of improvement: Addition of a smaller &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; attachment for detail areas, Articulating handle for precise angle work.</li>
            <li> Was amazed at how easy it was to use compared to other products I have used</li>
            <li> Did what it said it could do. Love this!!</li>
            <li> This works extremely well. Angle it right and it will not scratch, but it will remove all your back and shoulder hair. Also feels great. Replacement blades are high $$ though. Blades plus shipping can get out of hand. No competitor so they can get away with it I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I own the mangroomer and this really does a much better job and also much faster.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. So easy and works as it should.</li>
            <li> Works great. No issues. Replacement blades are a bit expensive but hopefully will come down in time.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised... It is somewhat pricey for the materials used and the replacement blades are definitely on the expensive side. Plus, the company charges you for shipping, which makes the overall purchase even more pricey. I like the product and it works well. But if someone enters the market at a much better price point, I will be taking my business there, instead.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this purchase...this being a manual shaver and I wondered how effective could it be. Tried it. Loved it. Impressed by it. An excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> So I have had this shaver for about 3 months and use it and am glad I bought it. This shaver is not the solution to a perfectly hairless back or the smothest back. That said it is easy to use and pretty easy to manuver and clean up most of my back by myslf. It is great for the quick going to the beach or just to be comfortable taking my shirt off. After using this I can say I is not in the same catagory as a back wax or even close to having someone who can shave your back for you with a razor. It leaves stuble and I guess I expected that and in my own vanity it truly helps give me confidence now that summer is here. It is not the ultimate solution but this product work enough and is far better that taping my razor to a back scratcher. I gave it 3 stars but that might be low because maybe my expectations were too high, but then again the 5* reviews leave me a bit curious to how people can use the product and be silky smooth, that does not happeb for men with hairy backs. Hope this helps you in your decision.</li>
            <li> Works well, no risk of cutting myself and it cuts close with no shaving cream or even water.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it. When I was young I wanted a beard and hairy chest to be manly looking. Well in middle age I found myself being called monkey boy by my sister while sitting by the pool. I had become the hairy guy on the beach with black socks shoes and Bermuda shorts. I tried some of the battery operated products out there, but they were not what I hoped they would be, and they broke easily. By chance I saw the Bigmouth on the internet and gave it a try. It did everything they said. It is simple easy to use with just a little practice. It isn&#x27;t as close as a razor but for the back it&#x27;s fine. There were some shipping issues, but the company was right there and resolved the problem ASAP. If you would like to go shirtless and not look like a cave man, I recommend the Bigmouth shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written an Amazon review before, despite making purchases just about every month. I had such a great experience with the baKblade &amp;#34;BIGMOUTH&amp;#34; that I had to share. First of all, it came earlier than expected in a plain brown padded envelope by USPS. The return address read &amp;#34;baKblade&amp;#34;, but other than that, there was no indication of what it was. I used the item this morning for the first time. I had back hair that was as thick, long and lustrous as Tom Selleck&#x27;s mustache. I&#x27;ve tried regular and electric razors, chemicals, and nothing has been both convenient and effective. We are approaching beach season, so it was time to deal with the winter coat. The baKblade is not only painless, it feel absolutely wonderful, like the best back scratch ever. It took about 10-15 minutes this first time, but my back is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s rear end. I feel absolutely no stubble. I&#x27;m sure it will take less time and effort to maintain. The blade is easy to use with both hands, and switches easily from the &amp;#34;north-south&amp;#34; long grip and choking up on it for &amp;#34;east-west&amp;#34; motion. I did most of the work without even looking in a mirror, I just had to take a glance toward the end to see what areas needed touch ups. As far as the mess, most of the hair clings to the blade, and comes off quickly with a swipe of the finger. I&#x27;d highly recommend this to any fellow Sasquatch out there.</li>
            <li> It works and there are no batteries to change which is a plus!</li>
            <li> If you want massive razor burn bumps this one&#x27;s for you</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Just used my new Bakblade and I was absolutely impressed!  After looking for a solution to keeping my back clean (long term girlfriend and I are no more) I reviewed several different back shavers, all double the price of the Bakblade and eventually watched a video on YouTube. Still skeptical but liking the simplicity and price I order the Bakblade from Amazon.  Got home tonight and after itching all day from an overdue back cleaning gave the blade a try and WOW, I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy, effective and good the Bakblade worked and felt!  The video was spot on!&lt;br /&gt;I only email a company if I like their product so I don&#x27;t email many companies but you guys (or gals) have a great product here and I want you to know.  Not only can I keep my back clean but at a fraction of the cost of what it cost to have a relationship partner to shave it!!!  Ha Ha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bakblade, simple, straight forward and very affordable!  Now if I can just find a woman like that!</li>
            <li> Just got mine today. This thing is amazing. Works better than expected!</li>
            <li> I really like this as I have a pretty hairy back.I always have had a hard time shaving it,but with this it is quick and easy.I would highly recommend this to any man who wants to be well groomed.</li>
            <li> amazing! no razor bumps or ingrown hairs like when I would use a regular razor, and it is really fast to do my entire (quite hairy) back in the shower. I got at least 5-6, maybe more (cant remember) uses out of the first blade. time for refills!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy. Works like a charm</li>
            <li> The product does what is says but the handle does not have enough bend to it. Had more luck using the extra blade by hand. Very time consuming process. The shaver has to be at a certain angle to the skin for it to work properly. This is hard to due with the handle installed. Better spending your money on a electric shaver with a body hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of work as others have accurately described but it does the job as promised. Wish the replacement blades were less expensive.</li>
            <li> Not only does it clear my gross back in minutes but it also feels like a good back scratcher.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times and the blade is still sharp.  Now I don&#x27;t have to bug my wife which makes her happy because after 10 years if maraige she prefers not to have any physical contact with me.</li>
            <li> I should have got it for my husband a long time ago, he thinks it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome, easy to use. Best thing I&#x27;ve found to get rid of that pesky back hair..</li>
            <li> After my Mangroomer broke for the second time I decided to try the traditional shaving method. At first I was skeptical about buying this after not hearing anything about it, but I was very surprised. It gives a nice big clean shave in less than 3 minutes. It would take me almost 20 minutes on the Mangroomer (when it stayed charged) and even then It didnt give a close shave. I would reccomend to anyone with back hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product, it is well designed and works quickly with the wide blade.  I would recommend it to anyone who asked.</li>
            <li> Great product with good cutting action.  Removes hair in a matter of minutes</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor, but I have to admit the first time I used it I cut myself to ribbons.  I have a very muscular contoured back, so where I usually had to apply pressure to a razor on a wire hanger I used to use, this you only need to GLIDE LIGHTLY to get the hair completely off.  I recommend practicing first with the plastic guard on before trying to use it as a regular razor.  It&#x27;s ten times faster than a regular razor and is FINALLY a back razor that is angled correctly!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, would be nice if extra blades came with it.</li>
            <li> This product works just as advertised.  The design makes it near impossible to inadvertently nick yourself.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great quality product. It really works as it says it does! Need to order more blades. Highly recommended, guys. This is the best cost-efficient solution to the problem.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product!  I can&#x27;t say enough GOOD things!  Made shaving my back actually SIMPLE and FUN.&lt;br /&gt;No cuts. No irritation. I&#x27;ll never be ashamed of my back again.</li>
            <li> I have to say this was way better than using an electric razor. Took me 5-10 minutes the very first time to get the entire back done. Not bad at all. Like it because of ease of use, least expensive and electric, large blade size for greater coverage, and leaves a smooth finish. I loved the first shave so much I almost went crazy to other parts, I needed to control myself. Almost got carried away.&lt;br /&gt;When the hair was removed, it feels different that there is nothing touch your back but air. The feeling is a good one that I don&#x27;t need to spend extensive time using an electric razor with weird angles to hold to make sure all the hair is gone. The long wand made it easier to position the blade in such a way that I saw and felt every hair was gone. Can use wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to all the guys out there who hate the buzzing of electric and time being saved! I should have gotten this sooner.</li>
