            <li>Thanks Mountain Ocean!</li>
            <li>A bit expensive, but one of the hands-down best soaps I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>But then I love it so much I use it constantly, so it may be me rather than the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and most soaps don&#x27;t help with that.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy.  </li>
            <li>Not too much moisturizer,</li>
            <li>or they&#x27;re really drying.</li>

            <li> Has cleared up some of my dry skin issues.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> What I do is order a bunch at a time, take them all out of the plastic, and let them air cure for at least 4 weeks before use.  </li>
            <li> and I was not thrilled by the smell of the soap.  </li>
            <li> If this soap wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I would use it exclusively, as both hand and body soap.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing which is why I gave it 2 stars but the smell is horrible.  </li>

            <li> I love this soap.  I have very dry skin, and most soaps don&#x27;t help with that.  Even non-drying soap, while not adding to the dryness, also don&#x27;t help.  This one does.  And the skin benefits of coconut oil are well documented.  So I lather it up and use it on my hair, too.  The only problem I have with the bar is that it doesn&#x27;t last long.  But then I love it so much I use it constantly, so it may be me rather than the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I think I figured out why the bars don&#x27;t last long - they are under-cured. What I do is order a bunch at a time, take them all out of the plastic, and let them air cure for at least 4 weeks before use.  They last much longer.</li>
            <li> my favorite soap....the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause skin issues especially in the winter.....just way more expensive than at my healthfood store when you add shipping and handling</li>
            <li> Great soap, just don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s worth quite as much as it is sold for.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. After showering with this soap, I don&#x27;t even need to use body lotion. My skin feels baby soft and the coconut smell is absolutely fantastic. Love that it comes in the multipack. The soaps became community property after the rest of the house found out about them. I need to stock up on more because the majority have spoken and nothing else will do at the moment.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used, and that goes back a long time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP. I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for almost a year now. The smell is so refreshing and it&#x27;s nice to have an alternative to all the floral scents. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily leave my skin any softer or smoother than any other soap, but the smell is intoxicating.</li>
            <li> As a redhead, I have really sensitive skin.  And I live in a dry climate.  So glad to find this soap.  It&#x27;s gentle and lathers quickly.  Plus, it smells good. I have started buying it in bulk!</li>
            <li> And you will too. Trust me. Smells so good, doesnt dry out your skin or anything. Kind of pricey though. but isnt your heappiness and health worth it?</li>
            <li> If this soap wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I would use it exclusively, as both hand and body soap. As it is, I splurge on it sometimes. If you like coconut, you will like the smell. It&#x27;s very &amp;#34;real.&amp;#34; The shape of the bar is somehow different and attractive, and very white. And the lather gives a wonderful creamy consistency. I enjoy the sensory experience of lathering up my hands with this soap because the lather is so creamy, it&#x27;s almost like shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This is pricey but worth it as the ingredients are simple and high quality. The smell is heavenly and lingers in the bath. Gentle enough for use on face and effective. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap!  Very creamy.  Rinses off easily.  Smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, I love it!</li>
            <li> After we tried the Skin Trip moisturizer and loved it, we tried the soap. I have very dry skin so I tend to avoid soap. I have not used the soap in the shower yet - just for washing hands. But I will use it in the shower as it has not dried out my hands.</li>
            <li> best ever!! I have sensitive skin, and it cleanses and moisturizes to the greatest ability!</li>
            <li> I have been using Skin Trip products since the mid 1980&#x27;s.  The quality has never waivered. This soap has a lovely feel and smell.  It has become the only soap I use.</li>
            <li> Discovered Skin Trip while on vacation in Colorado.  Now it&#x27;s our favorite soap and lotion.  Skin feels great and the fragrance of coconut is gentle and yummy.</li>
            <li> Mountain Ocean products remind me of when I was 18 and worked in a health food store in California. So nostalgia is a great appeal in my purchase...however. My husband and 3 children and all of their friends cannot get enough of this lotion. I leave it in the kitchen and someone is always grabbing the bottle and reapplying. I often get, what are you wearing, it smells so good!!! Classic 70&#x27;s natural product making generations happy! Thanks Mountain Ocean!</li>
            <li> This soap is so awesome!  Not too much moisturizer, just right.  Has cleared up some of my dry skin issues.  Great all natural.</li>
            <li> I purchased the lotion and the soap at the same time and I was not thrilled by the smell of the soap.  It is moisturizing which is why I gave it 2 stars but the smell is horrible.  I will continue to use it up but I will not purchase again.  I had much better luck with the lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s very rich and lathers quickly and makes my skin feel good.  It smells good too.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and does a great job of cleaning and moisturizing. It feels luxurious and I really enjoy using it in the sower and also to shave. A bit expensive, but one of the hands-down best soaps I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural bar soaps and they either don&#x27;t lather well or they&#x27;re really drying. Skin trip is super moisturizing and smells amazing! It&#x27;s the only bar soap I buy!</li>
            <li> I love coconut, and this soap makes me love it even more.  The scent is incredible, and puts a smile on my face every time I enter the washroom.  It&#x27;s definitely my favorite soap ever.  Makes a nice gift too!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It smells great, seems mild and does not irritate my dry itchy skin. A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This soap has a wonderful fresh smell.  It lathers well and yet one bar lasts a really long time which makes it worth the extra cost.</li>
