            <li>I heard great things about Latisse, but what I had heard about the cost had kept me from seeking a prescription.  </li>

            <li>WELL WORTH IT!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a very strong antibiotic now and</li>
            <li>Very easy to use too.</li>
            <li>ITS ALSO VERY EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>So far it has been working great!</li>
            <li>This product worked somewhat on eyelashes, and better on eyebrows</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so satisfied and recommend this.</li>
            <li>Just be patient with the product and you&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li>Really love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve enjoyed the results and plan of continuing to use.  </li>
            <li>I used Skin Research Neulash and it worked like magic.  </li>
            <li>I think it makes my eyes look better.  </li>
            <li>Okay, now for an update on the re-use of Rapidlash.</li>
            <li>I was recommended to this product and I am so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied and will continue using this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love the results I get from this product.  </li>
            <li>Worked better than</li>
            <li>They seem to be more brittle and I haven&#x27;t notice any growth at all.  </li>
            <li>I wink to apply &amp; perhaps apply more than I need.</li>
            <li>More seems better</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and my lashes have more then doubled in length.  </li>
            <li>Many people&#x27;s reviews say they&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in length and not thickness</li>
            <li>It really works!!!!</li>
            <li>I love my long lashes! :D</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and quite good consequence.</li>
            <li>I found this product easy to use and it did not irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 3 months to see the full results and if still pleased I will continue to buy and use Rapidlash.  </li>
            <li>I think it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how fine my brows were from the arch to the corner of my eye until I used this product.  </li>
            <li>I apply it before bed every day, and it´s important not to be stingy with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>EYES LOOK FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>I used only on my eyebrows and they look amazing!</li>
            <li>I proudly responded with a yes to which he responded &amp;#34; cause that&#x27;s about as long as you would want lashes to be.</li>
            <li>Significant results after about 4 weeks use, and it works on my thinning eyebrows too.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any significant difference in my lower lashes though.</li>
            <li>When I look up my lashes touch my eyebrows, with a very healthy, natural appearance.</li>
            <li>Still, everyone always wants &amp; hopes for better</li>
            <li>but now that I have the results, I apply a more reasonable amount to maintain.</li>
            <li>I hope Rapid Lash will only continue making this product better and better.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I came back to this product.</li>
            <li>As I said before, this was the very first eyelash enhancer product I ever used and that was in 2009.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that I am enjoying my 4th or maybe even 5th week of long, full, even lashes.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste another day that you could spend working on the beautiful lashes you&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li>There is nothing short of amazing of this product!!!They</li>
            <li>I had some mild irritation when I first started using it</li>
            <li>Glad I did, because by the end of the 4th week, change was apparent.</li>
            <li>I usually put 4 to 5 coats of mascara on but after only 8 days of RL 2 coats  of mascara &amp; my eyelashes are looking great !</li>
            <li>The only serum that works better than RapidLash is Latisse</li>
            <li>so no weird side effects or reactions to report.</li>
            <li>This does cause irritation to contacts, so be aware.</li>
            <li>i actually got it because of my friend her eyelashes are beautiful and long thanks for rapidlash</li>
            <li>This product REALLY works!</li>
            <li>and I can tell a notable difference in my lashes and brows- especially my brows.</li>
            <li>I have consistently used the serum on my eyebrows and lashes and I no longer feel the need to fill in my brows unless I just want to dress up my look.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>Eyelashes worked pretty rapidly, took longer for eyebrows but that works too.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone I know that is interested.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well on my eyebrows, too.</li>
            <li>it did the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first tube</li>
            <li>/&gt;After four weeks (since I didn&#x27;t use consistently for the first two)</li>
            <li>And in case you are wondering, I am still on my first tube.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the same product.</li>
            <li>The picture at the top was taken before I started using it and the two picture in the middle were taken in between February and April.</li>
            <li>For the first 3 weeks, I didn&#x27;t notice any change, but was hopeful and stuck with it.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave Rapidlash 4 stars is because when I first purchased it my lashes did grow but at some point they stopped growing.</li>
            <li>The product does work if you are consistent in applying it as directed.  </li>
            <li>My first bottle lasted 3 months, and I just received another one.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t see a positive result, the contrary my lashes seem to have lost their thickness.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference on my bottom lashes, but I&#x27;ll give it 90 days first.</li>
            <li>I had plucked my eyebrows too much and bought this product almost a year ago from a doctors office for much higher price.  </li>
            <li>No significant changes to eyelashes yet but will continue for 12 more weeks for full effect.</li>
            <li>This made my eyes look very bloodshot for days and itchy.</li>
            <li>Very disapppointed.</li>
            <li>I have the longest lashes and the a much fuller eyebrows  </li>
            <li>This serum really does work.  </li>
            <li>so I went ahead and purchased to regrow the hair fast.</li>
            <li>Get both if you can - they&#x27;re cheap enough.</li>
            <li>Eh, in a week I didn´t see much.</li>
            <li>when I apply mascara is when you can really see the difference.  </li>
            <li>Use regularly and enjoy the results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I was never a believer in this type of product, but this one REALLY does work.</li>
            <li>, I have fantastic eyelashes again, upper and lower.  </li>
            <li>This one really works.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It really worked.</li>
            <li>The picture at the very bottom was taken today.</li>
            <li>It absolutely did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I STILL HAVE NOT SEE ANY RESULTS BUT IM VERY HOPEFUL</li>
            <li>The serum doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for my lower lashes anyway.</li>
            <li>I restrained myself from doing so as much as I can.</li>
            <li>and you really see the difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It will take a few weeks to see if it is an effective product.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows grew back super fast!</li>
            <li>This will definitely be a staple in my beauty routine and it is worth a try!</li>
            <li>I love this product, unfortunatelly for some unknown reason Amazon cannot send it me anymore!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried other lash enhancing products to compare, but I&#x27;ll stick with Rapidlash since I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Of course I have loved makeup and how it makes me feel for 30 years, so I go for the full exaggerated look of more than one coat, but this is the first time in my life that my lashes have ever needed so little mascara to touch my brows.  </li>
            <li>I still wear mascara, because my lashes have not become darker (only thicker and longer), but I only need to use 1 quick, light coat.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, my eyes are not sensitive to the serum</li>
            <li>Also,  the box that it came in was kind of damage – not sure if that had anything to do with it or if this will affect the product at all.</li>
            <li>I had to leave the bottle upside down all day just to be able to use it for just  10 days while the Skin Research lasted me 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I like this better than any other one I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the product and plan to order again in the future.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the sort of shopper that is highly sceptical when it comes to &amp;#34;visible results&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>do go away though there is still minimal light lines remaining.</li>
            <li>Pretty much unnoticeable to others when bare faced and is completely covered when eyeshadow and eyeliner</li>
            <li>What caught my attention was that my left eye which had always had noticeably shorter lashes than my right now looked as though I had mascara remaining on them even after my makeup was removed.  </li>
            <li>my once very long and full eyelashes were disappearing.</li>
            <li>The lashes weren&#x27;t longer, but they were much darker, and so thick that it almost looked as though more than one lash was growing out of some of the follicles.  </li>
            <li>This really works and much of my eyebrows have come back.  </li>
            <li>my lashes are long and beautiful without looking ridiculous!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get fooled into getting Rapidlash and other more &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; brands since they do the same job.</li>
            <li>I have used RapidLash in the past and was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I am still on my first tube, although I notice it is almost out, so you&#x27;ll probably get 2 months of daily use from 1 tube.</li>
            <li>I just rub a little Egyptian Magic around my eye area up to my eyebrows for moisture and shine and it&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li>This is clear, has no tint, and you put it on before bed.  </li>
            <li>I wear lash extensions and am nervous about it ruining my natural lashes.</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t done anything.  </li>
            <li>the eye infections are much more common than they are telling you.  </li>
            <li>It says it is for sensitive eyes and doesn&#x27;t burn if you accidentally slip.  </li>
            <li>Too early to tell if it works.  </li>
            <li>Recently one of the guys at work interrupted our conversation to ask me if my lashes were real.</li>
            <li>Will recommend this to anyone who wants bigger and longer lashes.</li>
            <li>BTW: So far I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon &amp; my orders come in within days.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants longer &amp; thicker eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Not really amazing to look at without mascara still, but better.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work like the expensive prescription Latisse, but is a good conditioner for lashes and brows.</li>
            <li>Maybe all of this is because I used to have thick lashes, but either way, I&#x27;m 100% pleased.</li>
            <li>I originally didn&#x27;t care for this product as for a few days</li>
            <li>But in a month I saw my eyelashes getting longer, but the ends were not very dark, so only visible really with mascara.</li>
            <li>I am 44 years old and began noticing last year that the long lashes that I had always been fortunate enough to have had become short and sparse.  </li>
            <li>so this gives me long, defined, natural lashes.</li>
            <li>and they look lush and long.  </li>
            <li>I felt so depressed and helpless but this Rapid Lash gave me back my full thick lashes that I had in my youth.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 months to see the full results and if still pleased I will continue to buy and use Rapidlash.  </li>
            <li> I think it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how fine my brows were from the arch to the corner of my eye until I used this product.  </li>
            <li> I apply it before bed every day, and it´s important not to be stingy with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> EYES LOOK FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> I used only on my eyebrows and they look amazing!</li>
            <li> I proudly responded with a yes to which he responded &amp;#34; cause that&#x27;s about as long as you would want lashes to be.</li>
            <li> Significant results after about 4 weeks use, and it works on my thinning eyebrows too.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any significant difference in my lower lashes though.</li>
            <li> When I look up my lashes touch my eyebrows, with a very healthy, natural appearance.</li>
            <li> Still, everyone always wants &amp; hopes for better</li>
            <li> but now that I have the results, I apply a more reasonable amount to maintain.</li>
            <li> I hope Rapid Lash will only continue making this product better and better.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I came back to this product.</li>
            <li> As I said before, this was the very first eyelash enhancer product I ever used and that was in 2009.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that I am enjoying my 4th or maybe even 5th week of long, full, even lashes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste another day that you could spend working on the beautiful lashes you&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li> There is nothing short of amazing of this product!!!They</li>
            <li> I had some mild irritation when I first started using it</li>
            <li> Glad I did, because by the end of the 4th week, change was apparent.</li>
            <li> I usually put 4 to 5 coats of mascara on but after only 8 days of RL 2 coats  of mascara &amp; my eyelashes are looking great !</li>
            <li> The only serum that works better than RapidLash is Latisse</li>
            <li> so no weird side effects or reactions to report.</li>
            <li> This does cause irritation to contacts, so be aware.</li>
            <li> i actually got it because of my friend her eyelashes are beautiful and long thanks for rapidlash</li>
            <li> This product REALLY works!</li>
            <li> and I can tell a notable difference in my lashes and brows- especially my brows.</li>
            <li> I have consistently used the serum on my eyebrows and lashes and I no longer feel the need to fill in my brows unless I just want to dress up my look.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> Eyelashes worked pretty rapidly, took longer for eyebrows but that works too.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone I know that is interested.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well on my eyebrows, too.</li>
            <li> it did the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first tube</li>
            <li> /&gt;After four weeks (since I didn&#x27;t use consistently for the first two)</li>
            <li> And in case you are wondering, I am still on my first tube.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the same product.</li>
            <li> The picture at the top was taken before I started using it and the two picture in the middle were taken in between February and April.</li>
            <li> For the first 3 weeks, I didn&#x27;t notice any change, but was hopeful and stuck with it.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave Rapidlash 4 stars is because when I first purchased it my lashes did grow but at some point they stopped growing.</li>
            <li> The product does work if you are consistent in applying it as directed.  </li>
            <li> My first bottle lasted 3 months, and I just received another one.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t see a positive result, the contrary my lashes seem to have lost their thickness.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference on my bottom lashes, but I&#x27;ll give it 90 days first.</li>
            <li> I had plucked my eyebrows too much and bought this product almost a year ago from a doctors office for much higher price.  </li>
            <li> No significant changes to eyelashes yet but will continue for 12 more weeks for full effect.</li>
            <li> This made my eyes look very bloodshot for days and itchy.</li>
            <li> Very disapppointed.</li>
            <li> I have the longest lashes and the a much fuller eyebrows  </li>
            <li> This serum really does work.  </li>
            <li> so I went ahead and purchased to regrow the hair fast.</li>
            <li> Get both if you can - they&#x27;re cheap enough.</li>
            <li> Eh, in a week I didn´t see much.</li>
            <li> when I apply mascara is when you can really see the difference.  </li>
            <li> Use regularly and enjoy the results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I was never a believer in this type of product, but this one REALLY does work.</li>
            <li> , I have fantastic eyelashes again, upper and lower.  </li>
            <li> This one really works.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It really worked.</li>
            <li> The picture at the very bottom was taken today.</li>
            <li> It absolutely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I STILL HAVE NOT SEE ANY RESULTS BUT IM VERY HOPEFUL</li>
            <li> The serum doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for my lower lashes anyway.</li>
            <li> I restrained myself from doing so as much as I can.</li>
            <li> and you really see the difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It will take a few weeks to see if it is an effective product.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows grew back super fast!</li>
            <li> This will definitely be a staple in my beauty routine and it is worth a try!</li>
            <li> I love this product, unfortunatelly for some unknown reason Amazon cannot send it me anymore!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other lash enhancing products to compare, but I&#x27;ll stick with Rapidlash since I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Of course I have loved makeup and how it makes me feel for 30 years, so I go for the full exaggerated look of more than one coat, but this is the first time in my life that my lashes have ever needed so little mascara to touch my brows.  </li>
            <li> I still wear mascara, because my lashes have not become darker (only thicker and longer), but I only need to use 1 quick, light coat.</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, my eyes are not sensitive to the serum</li>
            <li> Also,  the box that it came in was kind of damage – not sure if that had anything to do with it or if this will affect the product at all.</li>
            <li> I had to leave the bottle upside down all day just to be able to use it for just  10 days while the Skin Research lasted me 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I like this better than any other one I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with the product and plan to order again in the future.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the sort of shopper that is highly sceptical when it comes to &amp;#34;visible results&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> do go away though there is still minimal light lines remaining.</li>
            <li> Pretty much unnoticeable to others when bare faced and is completely covered when eyeshadow and eyeliner</li>
            <li> What caught my attention was that my left eye which had always had noticeably shorter lashes than my right now looked as though I had mascara remaining on them even after my makeup was removed.  </li>
            <li> my once very long and full eyelashes were disappearing.</li>
            <li> The lashes weren&#x27;t longer, but they were much darker, and so thick that it almost looked as though more than one lash was growing out of some of the follicles.  </li>
            <li> This really works and much of my eyebrows have come back.  </li>
            <li> my lashes are long and beautiful without looking ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get fooled into getting Rapidlash and other more &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; brands since they do the same job.</li>
            <li> I have used RapidLash in the past and was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I am still on my first tube, although I notice it is almost out, so you&#x27;ll probably get 2 months of daily use from 1 tube.</li>
            <li> I just rub a little Egyptian Magic around my eye area up to my eyebrows for moisture and shine and it&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> This is clear, has no tint, and you put it on before bed.  </li>
            <li> I wear lash extensions and am nervous about it ruining my natural lashes.</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t done anything.  </li>
            <li> the eye infections are much more common than they are telling you.  </li>
            <li> It says it is for sensitive eyes and doesn&#x27;t burn if you accidentally slip.  </li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it works.  </li>
            <li> Recently one of the guys at work interrupted our conversation to ask me if my lashes were real.</li>
            <li> Will recommend this to anyone who wants bigger and longer lashes.</li>
            <li> BTW: So far I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon &amp; my orders come in within days.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants longer &amp; thicker eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not really amazing to look at without mascara still, but better.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like the expensive prescription Latisse, but is a good conditioner for lashes and brows.</li>
            <li> Maybe all of this is because I used to have thick lashes, but either way, I&#x27;m 100% pleased.</li>
            <li> I originally didn&#x27;t care for this product as for a few days</li>
            <li> But in a month I saw my eyelashes getting longer, but the ends were not very dark, so only visible really with mascara.</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old and began noticing last year that the long lashes that I had always been fortunate enough to have had become short and sparse.  </li>
            <li> so this gives me long, defined, natural lashes.</li>
            <li> and they look lush and long.  </li>
            <li> I felt so depressed and helpless but this Rapid Lash gave me back my full thick lashes that I had in my youth.</li>
            <li> , I was not able to get much out.  </li>
            <li> I still have to wear mascara daily, but have had comments on how long my lashes look.</li>
            <li> I put on my usual eye lotion afterwards &amp; work my way more carefully than usual to not interfere with this serum.</li>
            <li> I do notice it can sometimes be hard to get much product on the applicator.....</li>
            <li> I used it carefully and now feel foolish for not doing the proper research before I used it --</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are almost twice as long now.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working, few weeks in and lashes are longer.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, about 6 months per tube.</li>
            <li> Not much in the way of results here that I could see after using the entire container.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are amazingly long!</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll try the other.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very encouraged, and continued to apply every night in spite of the fact that i saw no other significant difference over the next month other than a few extremely long lashes that were ridiculous in length compared to the remainder of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I was very careful applying mascara to my upper lashes because I didn&#x27;t want the sparse lashes to clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, this serum does make my eyes feel crusty &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> My lashes were somewhere between puny and average in thickness and length before starting.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working as expected, though I haven&#x27;t had it long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to see any progress through the extensions, but I did notice new baby lashes sprouting out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had long lashes but recently burnt one eye grilling this summer and was desperate for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> It comes out very dry.</li>
            <li> 6 months later the entire length was dark, and a year later, I can´t even imagine how sad my lashes used to look, judging by old pictures.</li>
            <li> Mine were never really curled so they&#x27;re not growing curled</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and definitely notice a difference if I stop for an extended period of time</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I began to do double takes of myself in the mirror after taking my makeup off at night.  </li>
            <li> not really any improvement seen yet</li>
            <li> so I still try products out while expecting minimal or no results.</li>
            <li> so soon, I&#x27;ve already slacked to 1 every other day usage.</li>
            <li> other side effects for me.</li>
            <li> I have NOT tried any other products like this, neither over-the-counter nor prescription, and therefore have no basis for comparison at this time.</li>
            <li> Lost my eyebrows due to thyroid issue.  </li>
            <li> The results with this one were not as pronounced as with previous tries.  </li>
            <li> I don´t ever want to go back to tiny thin lashes.</li>
            <li> It also caused dark circles forming under both eyes.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My upper lashes are extremely thick and longer.  </li>
            <li> Works extremely well!</li>
            <li> and apply it to my brows as well--they&#x27;re less sparse.  </li>
            <li> Today (three and a half months in)</li>
            <li> I am amazed how long and thick</li>
            <li> At age 55, my lashes had become thin and barely there.</li>
            <li> The first few days my eyes itched like crazy, but I hung in there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been recommending this to friends and they&#x27;ve been using this too and are seeing results little by little.</li>
            <li> and I notice that my lashes are longer, and it feels like my lashes are a little thicker...</li>
            <li> Having longer lashes was not worth this pain!</li>
            <li> 30$,one nightly application, a little patience</li>
            <li> It does cause a little darkening along your lash line</li>
            <li> after trying this product for 4 wks I can see little improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month</li>
            <li> so my results are not compromised by too little</li>
            <li> have noticed very slight skin coloration changes on my eyelids along my lash line, just slight</li>
            <li> I noticed a little improvement with the length of my lashes, but not a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Waste.</li>
            <li> I like how I don&#x27;t have to use fake natural looking eyelashes anymore.</li>
            <li> Took a few months off.  </li>
            <li> but I did not see any difference after few weeks</li>
            <li> I had naturally sparse eyebrows and even a bald spot that randomly</li>
            <li> Visible result in just a few days of application.  </li>
            <li> I did get a few comments.</li>
            <li> I used indivual false eyelashes prior to using this product that ripped out all my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in about 2 and a half weeks!</li>
            <li> Now It there seems very little product in the tube.  </li>
            <li> This was paid for then delivered with a 9 month past expiration date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product once or twice in the past</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are after a few weeks of using rapid lash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I wash my face &amp; do my usual routine &amp; the creases</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;m guessing it also depends how your eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li> I mean some girls look like they are trying to put trees on their eyes&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> 8 weeks into applying an average of 5 nights a week, they are longer, thicker, and the base of each lash is slightly darker.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because either it dried out or has a bad design of the container</li>
            <li> Bad packaging and dried up.</li>
            <li> Now I have a HORRIBLE eye infection in my left eye that required an ER visit and ophthalmologist visit.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve been asked if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I had a bad eyebrow threading job (made too thin)</li>
            <li> It is very disappointing and frustrating.  </li>
            <li> It was painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, of course.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> After a month I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The product caused a horrible infection on both lids.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I found this product easy to use and it did not irritate my eyes at all. I wear lash extensions and am nervous about it ruining my natural lashes. It&#x27;s hard for me to see any progress through the extensions, but I did notice new baby lashes sprouting out. Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference on my bottom lashes, but I&#x27;ll give it 90 days first. I&#x27;ll continue to use this. and see what happens.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I used indivual false eyelashes prior to using this product that ripped out all my eyelashes. I was bald literally bald on my eyelashes.I had NO Lashes a month ago. I felt so depressed and helpless but this Rapid Lash gave me back my full thick lashes that I had in my youth.There is nothing short of amazing of this product!!!They gave me my confidence and life back along with the lord!! If you have any doubts in what I say go to  U-Tube and listen to what the woman have to say!! Amazing keep up the good work!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I love my long lashes! :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash for about 8 days &amp; already my lashes are longer &amp; thicker. I love this product ! Finally a beauty product that actually works ! I usually put 4 to 5 coats of mascara on but after only 8 days of RL 2 coats  of mascara &amp; my eyelashes are looking great !</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to help fill in over plucked brows. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This made my eyes look very bloodshot for days and itchy. I had to discontinue use. I don&#x27;t advise unless you want to look like you&#x27;ve been on a three day bender. Waste.</li>
            <li> This was paid for then delivered with a 9 month past expiration date. Very disapppointed.</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me. It was in my night stand so that I could use every night. After a month I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got cyst on my eyelid on day three??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had long lashes but recently burnt one eye grilling this summer and was desperate for a quick fix. This product did not disappoint. It really works!!!! Lashes are fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> When applying, best is evening application, it coats the lashes and can be seen.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and quite good consequence.</li>
            <li> This product worked somewhat on eyelashes, and better on eyebrows</li>
            <li> It works. I mean I&#x27;m guessing it also depends how your eyelashes grow. Mine were never really curled so they&#x27;re not growing curled but they are longer and fuller. I like how I don&#x27;t have to use fake natural looking eyelashes anymore. Curling and putting mascara on my eyelashes does the job! I have also use this on a part of my eyebrow where I have a scare and hair doesn&#x27;t grow there but now it is growing on that part. I&#x27;m so satisfied and recommend this. I&#x27;ve been recommending this to friends and they&#x27;ve been using this too and are seeing results little by little. Just be patient with the product and you&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year now, makes the lashes I have longer but doesn&#x27;t make them thicker but still very happy with it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> HAve been using for several months and the result AMAZING I have the longest lashes and the a much fuller eyebrows  a must have  for all women. IT DOES WORK&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Truly works! My eyelashes are amazingly long! I use this serum every day, applied like an eyeliner, you will see results</li>
            <li> This serum really does work.  I can&#x27;t wear mascara so this gives me long, defined, natural lashes.</li>
            <li> i have been using products like this for 6 months and have noticed eyelash growth.</li>
            <li> Item received ( on time) says for lashes- item ordered supposed to be for lashes AND brows.  Perhaps is one and the same but the advertised product had both listed on it.&lt;br /&gt;It will take a few weeks to see if it is an effective product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I had a bad eyebrow threading job (made too thin) so I went ahead and purchased to regrow the hair fast. I also used it on my eyelashes and they are not longer and thicker than before. My eyebrows grew back super fast! I&#x27;ve used this product once or twice in the past and I swear by this stuff. Also, great price for the quality. Don&#x27;t get fooled into getting Rapidlash and other more &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; brands since they do the same job. The only serum that works better than RapidLash is Latisse but you also pay triple what you would pay here. Fortunately for me, my eyes are not sensitive to the serum so no weird side effects or reactions to report.</li>
            <li> I have used RapidLash in the past and was pleased with the results.  Now It there seems very little product in the tube.  It comes out very dry. It is very disappointing and frustrating.  Makes one feel cheated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used rapid lash for a while.  Took a few months off.  This does cause irritation to contacts, so be aware.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with another Cruelty-free serum - MyChelle Dermaceuticals Ultimate Lash and Brow Serum ... and in 3 wks., I have longer and thicker lashes.  I was going for longer - and I&#x27;m really happy with the results.  Since it looks really good so soon, I&#x27;ve already slacked to 1 every other day usage. I highly recommend. Get both if you can - they&#x27;re cheap enough.</li>
            <li> This works great. I noticed a difference in about 2 and a half weeks!</li>
            <li> So far it has been working great! I have only used it a couple times and I see growth in the eyelashes!</li>
            <li> its my second week using it and i cant wait to see the resoults everyone is talking about.. i actually got it because of my friend her eyelashes are beautiful and long thanks for rapidlash</li>
            <li> This product REALLY works! I am amazed how long and thick my eyelashes are after a few weeks of using rapid lash! At age 55, my lashes had become thin and barely there. Now I&#x27;ve been asked if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> The results with this one were not as pronounced as with previous tries.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this product for six months and I haven&#x27;t see a positive result, the contrary my lashes seem to have lost their thickness. This a wrist of money and time. Don&#x27;t buy it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this religiously for a month now and I notice that my lashes are longer, and it feels like my lashes are a little thicker...I do notice it can sometimes be hard to get much product on the applicator.....</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t done anything.  A friend used another product and had wonderful results, but it didn&#x27;t get as many stars as this one did, so I bought this one instead.  Next time I&#x27;ll try the other.  I&#x27;m disappointed, of course.</li>
            <li> I tried using this product because do Dr. Ozz but I did not see any difference after few weeks so I would not recommend it</li>
            <li> I recommend it. It works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash for three months.  My lashes did grow longer and thicker.  I had intermittent eye itching and reddening of the lid?  It also caused dark circles forming under both eyes.  Now I have a HORRIBLE eye infection in my left eye that required an ER visit and ophthalmologist visit.  I&#x27;m on a very strong antibiotic now and the photo I&#x27;m attaching is after 3 days of treatment.  I used it carefully and now feel foolish for not doing the proper research before I used it -- the eye infections are much more common than they are telling you.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!  Having longer lashes was not worth this pain!</li>
            <li> I am on my third tube of this serum and I can tell a notable difference in my lashes and brows- especially my brows. I had naturally sparse eyebrows and even a bald spot that randomly would show up. I have consistently used the serum on my eyebrows and lashes and I no longer feel the need to fill in my brows unless I just want to dress up my look. I still have to wear mascara daily, but have had comments on how long my lashes look. They are not necessarily darker or thicker, but are definitely longer. I had some mild irritation when I first started using it but it no longer bothers me. This will definitely be a staple in my beauty routine and it is worth a try!</li>
            <li> So it says on the box you will see noticable result in a week. Eh, in a week I didn´t see much. But in a month I saw my eyelashes getting longer, but the ends were not very dark, so only visible really with mascara. 6 months later the entire length was dark, and a year later, I can´t even imagine how sad my lashes used to look, judging by old pictures. I hope Rapid Lash will only continue making this product better and better. I don´t ever want to go back to tiny thin lashes. I apply it before bed every day, and it´s important not to be stingy with it. You need to see some goo on your lashes in the morning. And be patient to see results.</li>
            <li> I like this better than any other one I&#x27;ve tried!  It says it is for sensitive eyes and doesn&#x27;t burn if you accidentally slip.  :(  It works GREAT!!!  My eyelashes are almost twice as long now.</li>
            <li> My lashes are naturally blonde and are invisible without mascara.  8 weeks into applying an average of 5 nights a week, they are longer, thicker, and the base of each lash is slightly darker.  Not really amazing to look at without mascara still, but better.  when I apply mascara is when you can really see the difference.  One coat and they look lush and long.  Really love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed very slight skin coloration changes on my eyelids along my lash line, just slight darkening-- almost a purple hue.  Pretty much unnoticeable to others when bare faced and is completely covered when eyeshadow and eyeliner applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other side effects for me. Will reorder and keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and apply it to my brows as well--they&#x27;re less sparse.  One tube will have lasted me over 2 months.</li>
            <li> I never knew my lashes could look so good without mascara! Really works!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are thicker and longer after using Rapidlash Eyelash Serum.  It works!!</li>
            <li> I love it and it is the best over-the-counter eyelash serum that I have tried!  I am very glad I came back to this product.</li>
            <li> No need to spend a ton of money.  This works.  Use regularly and enjoy the results.  Used on eyelashes and ends of eyebrows.  Eyelashes worked pretty rapidly, took longer for eyebrows but that works too.  Stop using then of course it stops working.  But I&#x27;ve enjoyed the results and plan of continuing to use.  Very easy to use too.</li>
            <li> The container did not have any serum in it.....nothing!</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working, few weeks in and lashes are longer. I would recommend this product to everyone I know that is interested.</li>
            <li> Was awesome for like the first two weeks, then my eyelashes started to fall out, I don&#x27;t know what that was about... I think you shouldn&#x27;t use it for an extended amount of time. Once I stopped using it, they stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost one year now and I&#x27;m really happy with the results! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I was never a believer in this type of product, but this one REALLY does work. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and definitely notice a difference if I stop for an extended period of time</li>
            <li> I used Skin Research Neulash and it worked like magic.  So I wanted to try this brand because it has similar ingredients and is cheaper.  I think it works just fine.  I gave it 3 stars because either it dried out or has a bad design of the container, I was not able to get much out.  I had to leave the bottle upside down all day just to be able to use it for just  10 days while the Skin Research lasted me 5 weeks.  I&#x27;m not saving any money.</li>
            <li> Seems to work for me. But the only reason I could not give it a 5 star rating is because it does irritate my eyes at times.</li>
            <li> Bad packaging and dried up.</li>
            <li> I finally received the product two days ago.  Too early to tell if it works.  Will advise again later on. Welcome to remind me.</li>
            <li> This product did cause my eyebrows to become fuller.  I used it before I went to bed every night for eight weeks and then 2-3 times a week for about 2 months and than once a week after that.  I didn&#x27;t realize how fine my brows were from the arch to the corner of my eye until I used this product.  I think it makes my eyes look better.  I haven&#x27;t had to use my eyebrow pencil which is a plus. I&#x27;ve been using it since the summer 2014 and my eyebrows aren&#x27;t bushy but fuller.</li>
            <li> I love this product, unfortunatelly for some unknown reason Amazon cannot send it me anymore!</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well! My eyelashes are noticeably longer , darker and thicker.  It works pretty well on my eyebrows, too. This is an inexpensive way to strengthen and lengthen your eyelashes.  AND IT WORKS!! Thank you for creating this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This is clear, has no tint, and you put it on before bed.  It doesn&#x27;t work like the expensive prescription Latisse, but is a good conditioner for lashes and brows.</li>
            <li> Okay, now for an update on the re-use of Rapidlash. As I said before, this was the very first eyelash enhancer product I ever used and that was in 2009. I have revisted this product as of July 5th 2014, and it is now October 31st and I am truly amazed at the length of my eyelashes. Latice didn&#x27;t come anywhere close to this enhancement. I just hope it lasts longer than the 8 month period like it did the first time I used it. I&#x27;m still on my first tube and I&#x27;ve been using it a.m. and p.m. even though it only says I need to use at bedtime. Don&#x27;t know if this makes a difference or not. However, since I also put eye ointment in my eyes every night, I&#x27;m adding extra insurance by applying in the morning as well. Will provide updates as needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50, and my lower lashes were almost nonexistent.  I was very careful applying mascara to my upper lashes because I didn&#x27;t want the sparse lashes to clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After four weeks (since I didn&#x27;t use consistently for the first two), I have fantastic eyelashes again, upper and lower.  My upper lashes are extremely thick and longer.  I can&#x27;t wear my glasses when I&#x27;m wearing mascara because the lashes brush against them.  Even when I&#x27;m not wearing mascara, my lashes get my glasses a bit dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fantastic.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> This one really works. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works... I don&#x27;t think I see a difference</li>
            <li> After passing the age of 45 my once very long and full eyelashes were disappearing. I&#x27;ve used this for about a month and they&#x27;re even fuller, longer, thicker and darker than before! I also suffered from over-plucked brows and now they&#x27;re filling in nicely. Another perk -  I don&#x27;t even need mascara anymore and when I put it on, they actually look too long/overdone. I just rub a little Egyptian Magic around my eye area up to my eyebrows for moisture and shine and it&#x27;s enough. Maybe all of this is because I used to have thick lashes, but either way, I&#x27;m 100% pleased. No side effects and it&#x27;s simple to apply. I do 1 or 2x&#x27;s a day...have even skipped/forgot.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to this product and I am so glad I tried it. It really works. My lashes are longer and darker.</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old and began noticing last year that the long lashes that I had always been fortunate enough to have had become short and sparse.  I heard great things about Latisse, but what I had heard about the cost had kept me from seeking a prescription.  Four months ago I began reading reviews on Amazon for various lash enhancing products, and for the affordable 30$ price tag decided to give Rapidlash a try and I am so glad I did.  I started using the product 3 days before Christmas.  The first few days my eyes itched like crazy, but I hung in there.  After a few weeks I began to do double takes of myself in the mirror after taking my makeup off at night.  What caught my attention was that my left eye which had always had noticeably shorter lashes than my right now looked as though I had mascara remaining on them even after my makeup was removed.  The lashes weren&#x27;t longer, but they were much darker, and so thick that it almost looked as though more than one lash was growing out of some of the follicles.  Needless to say, I was very encouraged, and continued to apply every night in spite of the fact that i saw no other significant difference over the next month other than a few extremely long lashes that were ridiculous in length compared to the remainder of my lashes.  Today (three and a half months in) I am pleased to say that I am enjoying my 4th or maybe even 5th week of long, full, even lashes.  I only need one sweep of mascara and my lashes reach my brows.  Of course I have loved makeup and how it makes me feel for 30 years, so I go for the full exaggerated look of more than one coat, but this is the first time in my life that my lashes have ever needed so little mascara to touch my brows.  And in case you are wondering, I am still on my first tube.  WELL WORTH IT!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your time on the negative reviews. Don&#x27;t waste another day that you could spend working on the beautiful lashes you&#x27;ve always wanted. 30$,one nightly application, a little patience and you can bat those beautiful lashes.  Update: Recently one of the guys at work interrupted our conversation to ask me if my lashes were real. I proudly responded with a yes to which he responded &amp;#34; cause that&#x27;s about as long as you would want lashes to be. I mean some girls look like they are trying to put trees on their eyes&amp;#34;.  My take away...my lashes are long and beautiful without looking ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine through Amazon but judging by the description and picture I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the same product. I started using this serum on February 17 , 2015 so it has been almost 8 weeks now. It really worked. The picture at the top was taken before I started using it and the two picture in the middle were taken in between February and April. The picture at the very bottom was taken today. I wasn&#x27;t wearing mascara in any of the pictures. My eyelashes have definitely grown longer and thicker. Also I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation, infection, and/or skin coloration change on my eyelids. Will recommend this to anyone who wants bigger and longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for three weeks but have not noticed any difference yet.</li>
            <li> It absolutely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> followed directions but saw no changes in eylashes</li>
            <li> I had plucked my eyebrows too much and bought this product almost a year ago from a doctors office for much higher price.  I could tell it was working so I found it onAmazon.  I truly like it!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I bought the more expensive li&#x27; lash and it didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  This Rapid Lash is good stuff!</li>
            <li> Works extremely well!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product since I got it and still see no difference. Also,  the box that it came in was kind of damage – not sure if that had anything to do with it or if this will affect the product at all. Still waiting for some change</li>
            <li> Visible result in just a few days of application.  Only con is that product last for only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using RapidLash daily for about 7 weeks. For the first 3 weeks, I didn&#x27;t notice any change, but was hopeful and stuck with it. Glad I did, because by the end of the 4th week, change was apparent. Lashes are thicker and longer. My lashes were somewhere between puny and average in thickness and length before starting. They look pretty awesome at this point. I still wear mascara, because my lashes have not become darker (only thicker and longer), but I only need to use 1 quick, light coat. If I apply 2 coats of mascara, I look like I&#x27;m wearing falsies. I am completely satisfied and will continue using this product. I am still on my first tube, although I notice it is almost out, so you&#x27;ll probably get 2 months of daily use from 1 tube. I haven&#x27;t tried other lash enhancing products to compare, but I&#x27;ll stick with Rapidlash since I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST ON THE MARKET.&lt;br /&gt;MY EYES LOOK FANTASTIC. ITS ALSO VERY EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> Significant results after about 4 weeks use, and it works on my thinning eyebrows too.  Lasts a long time, about 6 months per tube.</li>
            <li> I STILL HAVE NOT SEE ANY RESULTS BUT IM VERY HOPEFUL</li>
            <li> The reason I gave Rapidlash 4 stars is because when I first purchased it my lashes did grow but at some point they stopped growing. I went thru about 3 of them. Well, decided to give it another try. It does cause a little darkening along your lash line but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  I did get a few comments. BTW: So far I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon &amp; my orders come in within days. 😊</li>
            <li> I love the results I get from this product.  I tried another and came back to Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> After using for one month, I am already noticing increased rate of growth and density in eyebrows. No significant changes to eyelashes yet but will continue for 12 more weeks for full effect. I have had no problems with skin or eye irritation or discoloration. Overall, I am pleased with the product and plan to order again in the future. I may change my rating to 5 stars if I see noticeable improvement with my eyelashes. I have NOT tried any other products like this, neither over-the-counter nor prescription, and therefore have no basis for comparison at this time.</li>
            <li> The product does work if you are consistent in applying it as directed.  My lashes are longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year. I noticed a little improvement with the length of my lashes, but not a huge difference. I&#x27;m not totally sold on this brand, I may try another.</li>
            <li> Not much in the way of results here that I could see after using the entire container.</li>
            <li> after trying this product for 4 wks I can see little improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month and I haven&#x27;t seen a change in my brows. The bottle also seemed to be drying out some after the second week of use.</li>
            <li> Lost my eyebrows due to thyroid issue.  This really works and much of my eyebrows have come back.  Worked better than&lt;br /&gt;the prescription</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 wks now...not really any improvement seen yet</li>
            <li> It seems to be working as expected, though I haven&#x27;t had it long.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting.  It actually dries my eyelashes and eyebrows out.  They seem to be more brittle and I haven&#x27;t notice any growth at all.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the sort of shopper that is highly sceptical when it comes to &amp;#34;visible results&amp;#34;. Still, everyone always wants &amp; hopes for better so I still try products out while expecting minimal or no results. I&#x27;m also patient for the results &amp; will diligently use a product for the length of time required.. This product gave me results in 3 weeks! It&#x27;s amazing! My upper lashes are now obviously longer &amp; fuller. I don&#x27;t see any significant difference in my lower lashes though. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants longer &amp; thicker eyelashes. I wash my face as per normal &amp; cleanse with my usual astringent for sensitive skin before applying this. I wink to apply &amp; perhaps apply more than I need. More seems better so my results are not compromised by too little but now that I have the results, I apply a more reasonable amount to maintain. I put on my usual eye lotion afterwards &amp; work my way more carefully than usual to not interfere with this serum. I noticed that the serum caused creases under the inside of my eyes after it dries up when I wake up in the morning.. I wash my face &amp; do my usual routine &amp; the creases do go away though there is still minimal light lines remaining. I suppose skin does not bounce back if it spends 8 hours creased up while you sleep. They do disappear later in the day but reappear the next morning again. I might stop the lower eyelash application because of this. The serum doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for my lower lashes anyway. As another reviewer said, this serum does make my eyes feel crusty &amp; dry. Another side effect is itchiness. My eyes feel itchy sometimes &amp; that makes me wanna rub them. I restrained myself from doing so as much as I can. The itchiness dwindled after some days &amp; maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to it. Maybe it was itchy because the eyelash was growing? I&#x27;m on my 20th day &amp; I can&#x27;t stop looking at my lashes whenever I go to the bathroom. What I&#x27;d like to know is whether this result would last or will my lashes shrink back? I intend to finish this bottle &amp; then stop.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months and my lashes have almost doubled in length!  I use it every night before bed.  It is odorless and does not irritate my eyes.  My first bottle lasted 3 months, and I just received another one.  Definitely a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I used only on my eyebrows and they look amazing! Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> When I look up my lashes touch my eyebrows, with a very healthy, natural appearance.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a difference in the length of my lashes.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> If I could give 0 or -1 stars, I would. The product caused a horrible infection on both lids. They were inflamed for days. It was painful.</li>
            <li> Nothing like getting something that expired 2 years ago</li>
            <li> I originally didn&#x27;t care for this product as for a few days I had bags under my eyes.  Then they went away.  So I&#x27;m using it every night before bed and it&#x27;s working great.  Tonight will be my 35th evening in a row and my lashes have more then doubled in length.  They look great and you really see the difference.  I&#x27;ve had several people ask me if they were my lashes lol.  Many people&#x27;s reviews say they&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in length and not thickness but mine have gotten thicker.  You just have to be patient with the product.  I&#x27;m giving it 3 months to see the full results and if still pleased I will continue to buy and use Rapidlash.  I&#x27;m also looking into the generic Latise brand called Careprost which is supposed to have faster results and create thickness.</li>
