            <li>The best thing about this type of polish is it adds thickness and strength to your nails.   </li>
            <li>perfect for spring!</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, cures beautifully and no shrinkage.  </li>
            <li>The color however is beautiful but the wrinkles are aweful.</li>
            <li>GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
            <li>It is a great color, but the quality makes it unusable.  </li>
            <li>Gellish is perfect and I love the product</li>
            <li>It is bright but not quite neon.</li>
            <li>Will never use it again although a nice spring bright peachy color.</li>
            <li>Many compliments!</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be spending my own money for that hassle.  </li>
            <li>I ended up doing a rockstar nail with a pretty similiar colored glitter over the top and it looks great!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li>Lovely to go into summer and nice for toes as well</li>
            <li>I do my own nails a majority of the time, but about once a season I stop into my favorite nail place to check out colors and get a quick mani, then I come home and order the color for the season!  </li>
            <li>Love this gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li>the polish didn&#x27;t stick as well and started peeling at the top edge.  </li>
            <li>I was able to decrease the bubbles by rolling the container, but it didn&#x27;t mix fully.</li>
            <li>I use a glitter coat on top sometimes</li>
            <li>Took me 2 try&#x27;s and its still wrinkled, but I love this color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I really love this color.</li>
            <li>This bottle of polish had many clumps in it.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this polish- until it was applied.  </li>
            <li>I got this polish after I fell in love with the color.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It will wick up under the skin, and as it grows out you&#x27;ll have a huge ridge.  </li>
            <li>so you get a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>You will require an LED or UV curing light.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is this supplier or just this color, but it just won&#x27;t apply smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I wish these reviews were available then...</li>
            <li>I was really excited..</li>
            <li>The polish seemed like a normal thickness in the bottle, and I applied it like normal with great results.</li>
            <li>Such a unique, gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>They finally got it thinned to where it looks good</li>
            <li>this is a pastel cantaloupe color, this is very pretty color for spring time  or Easter time.</li>
            <li>Make sure to really clean the nail up near the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>I love this new color, like nothing I have ever seen before.  </li>
            <li>Great new color for the approaching summer!  </li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t coral or salmon, it&#x27;s distinctly orange.</li>
            <li>This is a nice orange, similar to Orange cream dream.  </li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite relish color so far.</li>
            <li>It will wrinkle up and u can just peal it right off</li>
            <li>I did notice that after the first cure the polish seemed to shrink away from the edges of my nail, but the second and third coats evened it out beautifully.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t the first manicure I did on myself and</li>
            <li>Clearly that person didn&#x27;t understand that this type of polish requires a light to cure and the cleaning solution at the end.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about ordering this polish because of the poor reviews it received, but I love the color so much I decided to try for it and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>Very high quality gel</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t very even.</li>
            <li>I have tried several times to make it go on smooth, but it just won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Normally the wrinkles will disappear with other colors they offer once you use the top coat</li>
            <li>I have purchased many of the gellish colors oddly this one color which I as well as my friend both purchased and both had the same&lt;br /&gt;Problem.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have read a little more before buying it.</li>
            <li>I use a q-tip and really scrub near the cuticle with the cleaning solution, and that seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pity, because I absolutely adore this color!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more frustrating than its worth.</li>
            <li>thats old.</li>
            <li>So much that I wrote hand and harmony never received a response back though.</li>
            <li>so far I would say not to buy.</li>
            <li>Ps I&#x27;m a professional nail tech for 20 years</li>
            <li>I have more than 200 gel polish and over 100 from Gelish and this one is very thick.</li>
            <li>It works the same as any of my other colors, but I took a star away just because it didn&#x27;t come right.  </li>
            <li>It really does last as long as Gelish says it will.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not careful with it either.  </li>
            <li>I did use three thin coats, although I think two would have been ok.</li>
            <li>and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>

            <li> Sure enough, when It came it seemed very thick, so I immediately added a little top coat to it to thin it out a little.  </li>
            <li> and then I feel my polish doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the peachy color of this polish, but when I started to apply it I noticed it was REALLY thick, much worse than other gelish brand polishes.</li>
            <li> The other thing to be mindful of is to be careful when applying near the cuticles.  </li>
            <li> Several other buyers have commented on this same fact.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my current polish on for 2 weeks without a single chip or loss of shine!  </li>
            <li> The consistency of this color is very thick much like a white reg nail&lt;br /&gt;Polish</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different Gelish colors before, even the magneto ~ never had results so consistently bad before.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a single one break or tear while I&#x27;ve had this polish on.  </li>
            <li> There are a couple of things to be careful of when applying.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It stinks since its such a pretty color</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this I read all the reviews complaining that this one for some reason is thicker and doesn&#x27;t apply as well as all the other Gelish colors.  </li>
            <li> Used it 3 times now and nothing works to make it look anything other than, well, blotchy and bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shrinks when applied and impossible to get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous but the polish quality is terrible.</li>
            <li> It was not a smooth application like all the other Gelish colors I have.</li>
            <li> I do all kinds of gardening work and house remodeling projects, so there are plenty of chances to mess it up.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest that they make it a little thinner</li>
            <li> I even tried all these little tips and tricks I read online for it nothing worked.</li>
            <li> A waste of money from this source.</li>
            <li> it will leave a residue of wet polish behind.</li>
            <li> It looks horrible no matter how many coats you apply, hoping against all hope that maybe it will even out and the mottled look will go away with another layer.  </li>
            <li> There is obviously something wrong with this polish.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve been disappointed in.</li>
            <li> Epic Fail Gelish!</li>
            <li> This is a thicker formula, so you have to be very careful and apply extremely thin coats to avoid wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> When you apply the polish, since it&#x27;s a thick gel, it settles out any brush strokes before it cures</li>
            <li> It was thick and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is this came very thin!</li>
            <li> Based on other negative reviews I think this is just a bad batch of polish.</li>
            <li> Despite the thickness I managed a pretty thin application and stuck my hand in the nail dryer, when it came out it looked awful.</li>
            <li> It took 1.5 hours to apply, cure, scrape off, file off, thin, reapply, cure, scrape off, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have very weak nails</li>
            <li> If you try to stay a little ways away from the base of the nail it won&#x27;t be a problem.  </li>
            <li> Finally, as you&#x27;re working on your nails, just ignore how awful the cuticles look.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several Gelish colors, and never had one as terrible as this.  </li>
            <li> Gelish needs to figure out what is wrong with this formula and fix it.</li>
            <li> but it instantly looks horrible once cured bubbles and peels off immediately.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of gelish colors and never had it happen this bad before.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> This polish bubbles and wrinkles really bad!</li>
            <li> It wrinkled terribly and wouldn&#x27;t adhere to the base coat.</li>
            <li> I wore it once because the consistency is horrible.</li>
            <li> No matter what I have tried it wrinkles up terribly.</li>
            <li> I bought every color from the spring line and each one bubbles horribly.</li>
            <li> This one was the worst.</li>
            <li> this polish is TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> but it is AWFUL.</li>

            <li> Love this gel nail polish.  It really does last as long as Gelish says it will.  I&#x27;ve had my current polish on for 2 weeks without a single chip or loss of shine!  And I&#x27;m not careful with it either.  I do all kinds of gardening work and house remodeling projects, so there are plenty of chances to mess it up.  The best thing about this type of polish is it adds thickness and strength to your nails.   I have very weak nails and I haven&#x27;t had a single one break or tear while I&#x27;ve had this polish on.  When you apply the polish, since it&#x27;s a thick gel, it settles out any brush strokes before it cures so you get a smooth finish.  There are a couple of things to be careful of when applying.  Make sure to really clean the nail up near the cuticle.  I didn&#x27;t the first manicure I did on myself and the polish didn&#x27;t stick as well and started peeling at the top edge.  I use a q-tip and really scrub near the cuticle with the cleaning solution, and that seems to do the trick.  The other thing to be mindful of is to be careful when applying near the cuticles.  It will wick up under the skin, and as it grows out you&#x27;ll have a huge ridge.  If you try to stay a little ways away from the base of the nail it won&#x27;t be a problem.  Finally, as you&#x27;re working on your nails, just ignore how awful the cuticles look.  The cleaning solution drys them out, but the nourish oil fixes it all up at the end.  Read the directions on the Gelish website.  You will require an LED or UV curing light.  I think I saw someone else complain that the polish never dried on this product or one of the other Gelish polishes I was looking at on Amazon.  Clearly that person didn&#x27;t understand that this type of polish requires a light to cure and the cleaning solution at the end.</li>
            <li> The consistence of this is not what I want or expect in a gel polish. I wore it once because the consistency is horrible. Will never use it again although a nice spring bright peachy color.</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous but the polish quality is terrible. A waste of money from this source. Polish behaves as if it had thinner added to it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, cures beautifully and no shrinkage.  This is a thicker formula, so you have to be very careful and apply extremely thin coats to avoid wrinkles.  Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t coral or salmon, it&#x27;s distinctly orange. It also isn&#x27;t very even. I was able to decrease the bubbles by rolling the container, but it didn&#x27;t mix fully.</li>
            <li> Bought this color for my mom, she loves it! Very high quality gel polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sold &amp; Shipped by: A-Z NAIL SUPPLY&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 6 days after order date</li>
            <li> This polish bubbles and wrinkles really bad! I have used a lot of gelish colors and never had it happen this bad before.</li>
            <li> I love this new color, like nothing I have ever seen before.  I ended up doing a rockstar nail with a pretty similiar colored glitter over the top and it looks great!  Many compliments!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many of the gellish colors oddly this one color which I as well as my friend both purchased and both had the same&lt;br /&gt;Problem. The consistency of this color is very thick much like a white reg nail&lt;br /&gt;Polish thats old. No matter what I have tried it wrinkles up terribly. Normally the wrinkles will disappear with other colors they offer once you use the top coat but this one that does not work. It will wrinkle up and u can just peal it right off it will leave a residue of wet polish behind. The color however is beautiful but the wrinkles are aweful. So much that I wrote hand and harmony never received a response back though. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this one color it&#x27;s more frustrating than its worth. Gellish is perfect and I love the product it&#x27;s just this one color so far I would say not to buy. Ps I&#x27;m a professional nail tech for 20 years so I do know my stuff. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I have more than 200 gel polish and over 100 from Gelish and this one is very thick. It shrinks when applied and impossible to get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I have bought several Gelish colors, and never had one as terrible as this.  It was thick and clumpy.  It wrinkled when it was applied, and wouldn&#x27;t not cure properly.  DO NOT BUY THIS!! Several other buyers have commented on this same fact.  Had I known, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.  It is a great color, but the quality makes it unusable.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> this is a pastel cantaloupe color, this is very pretty color for spring time  or Easter time. I use a glitter coat on top sometimes</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the peachy color of this polish, but when I started to apply it I noticed it was REALLY thick, much worse than other gelish brand polishes. Despite the thickness I managed a pretty thin application and stuck my hand in the nail dryer, when it came out it looked awful. The nail polish was wrinkled looking, as if it had been trying to slid off my nails in the dryer. Based on other negative reviews I think this is just a bad batch of polish.</li>
            <li> This is a nice orange, similar to Orange cream dream.  Lovely to go into summer and nice for toes as well</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this I read all the reviews complaining that this one for some reason is thicker and doesn&#x27;t apply as well as all the other Gelish colors.  Sure enough, when It came it seemed very thick, so I immediately added a little top coat to it to thin it out a little.  It did the trick, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems applying it.  It works the same as any of my other colors, but I took a star away just because it didn&#x27;t come right.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to alter it.  Gelish needs to figure out what is wrong with this formula and fix it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is this supplier or just this color, but it just won&#x27;t apply smoothly.  It looks horrible no matter how many coats you apply, hoping against all hope that maybe it will even out and the mottled look will go away with another layer.  Nope.  Used it 3 times now and nothing works to make it look anything other than, well, blotchy and bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different Gelish colors before, even the magneto ~ never had results so consistently bad before.  Save yourself the trauma and find another orange Gelish color.</li>
            <li> Such a unique, gorgeous color. perfect for spring! This is probably my favorite relish color so far. I would wear this all the time if I could.</li>
            <li> Took me 2 try&#x27;s and its still wrinkled, but I love this color. I would suggest that they make it a little thinner so it&#x27;s easier to apply !</li>
            <li> There is obviously something wrong with this polish. I have tried several times to make it go on smooth, but it just won&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s a shame because I really love this color. I haven&#x27;t seen anything in this shade like it on the market. I was really excited.. Too bad. Epic Fail Gelish!</li>
            <li> Love this color! My only problem is this came very thin! I have to put on 3 coats sometimes and then I feel my polish doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> This bottle of polish had many clumps in it. It was not a smooth application like all the other Gelish colors I have. This is the first one I&#x27;ve been disappointed in. For anyone looking for a pastel orange-this is in no way pastel</li>
            <li> I bought every color from the spring line and each one bubbles horribly. This one was the worst. It stinks since its such a pretty color but it instantly looks horrible once cured bubbles and peels off immediately. I even tried all these little tips and tricks I read online for it nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails a majority of the time, but about once a season I stop into my favorite nail place to check out colors and get a quick mani, then I come home and order the color for the season!  I fell in love with this polish- until it was applied.  It took 1.5 hours to apply, cure, scrape off, file off, thin, reapply, cure, scrape off, etc.  and I walked in with naked nails!  It wrinkled terribly and wouldn&#x27;t adhere to the base coat. They finally got it thinned to where it looks good -without charging me-but I won&#x27;t be spending my own money for that hassle.  It&#x27;s a pity, because I absolutely adore this color!!!</li>
            <li> I got this polish after I fell in love with the color. I wish these reviews were available then... I think I got mine around the same time as everyone else... this polish is TERRIBLE. It is clumpy and wrinkles and when I had my nails done, the nail technician redid my polish 4 times before giving up. I don&#x27;t know what the seller did to the polish but it is AWFUL. I will never buy anything from them again.</li>
            <li> Great new color for the approaching summer!  It is bright but not quite neon. I think my clients will like it.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about ordering this polish because of the poor reviews it received, but I love the color so much I decided to try for it and hope for the best. I am so glad I did. The polish seemed like a normal thickness in the bottle, and I applied it like normal with great results. I did use three thin coats, although I think two would have been ok. I did notice that after the first cure the polish seemed to shrink away from the edges of my nail, but the second and third coats evened it out beautifully. I paired it with Meet the King on an accent nail. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Wish I would have read a little more before buying it. During the curing process the polish wrinkles and looks as if it is melting off of the nail. Bummer.</li>
