            <li>Very cool product in good price.</li>
            <li>Also, polish gets under them very easily</li>
            <li>good fit -</li>
            <li>Honestly, this can be an issue with most guides</li>
            <li>These are by far the easiest to use and the best nail guide stickers I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>very cheaply made</li>
            <li>It was good for it&#x27;s price, however you needed to crease it all down or it wouldn&#x27;t come out perfect.</li>
            <li>Need something that works better and not adhere so hardily to skin.</li>
            <li>Therse r ok they stick to ur nail</li>
            <li>this ithem is ok for some one else not me ty</li>
            <li>ive gotten so many compilments on these</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>No problems!! :)</li>
            <li>This is definitely more suited for people who love the curve to be the correct shape.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I think, this product is OK.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 packs not realizing there are so many in one pack.</li>
            <li>Cost More</li>
            <li>I love to use them and all my friends think I went and had my nails done at the shop.</li>
            <li>good and easy to use, it peel off clean..</li>
            <li>I love the moon look</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The trick is to run the sticker across your fingers for a while until you&#x27;ve gotten most of the stickiness off, then apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they are ok.  </li>
            <li>Excellent nail guides for french manicures.</li>
            <li>its okay because theres 4 in the pack.</li>
            <li>But I am sure I will like them</li>
            <li>I love working with these</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re line me, and can&#x27;t get the line right, these are good.</li>
            <li>, no polish gets under the sticker, for a clean nice looking line</li>
            <li>The seller seems pretty good, though.</li>
            <li>Did more free hand polishing tips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall worth the cost, and an effective guide set.</li>
            <li>These are so super easy to use, makes your french nail art look awesome..</li>
            <li>an don&#x27;t want to come off so easy</li>
            <li>Easy on, easy off.  </li>
            <li>its easy to stick on and remove.  </li>
            <li>Did not apply easily and pulled off polish.  </li>
            <li>Comes on easily and off easily.</li>
            <li>The adhesive is strong and at times would peel the underlying layer off ruining the finger and causing you to remove polish to start from the beginning.</li>
            <li>My French tips came out beautiful.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!  </li>
            <li>and they fit just fine.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t view this as a huge problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The seller did a simple but great job of packaging and shipping.  </li>
            <li>These are cheap.</li>
            <li>We have great looking nails using these for the french tip look.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great, definitely recommend for beginner manicurists.</li>
            <li>They do make a cleaner line than using a brush and free hand cleaning up the line.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews for this said they didn&#x27;t work very well, but these worked perfectly fine for me!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it but its good to have specially when you wanted to do the French tip every so often by yourself.</li>
            <li>What makes this a good product is that there are a variety, 2 or 3, different shaped line guides.</li>
            <li>easy to use and it what i needed to do my nails fast and pretty  and cute</li>
            <li>First, they arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>shipped quickly</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll last me for a long time and they work great!</li>
            <li>these really adhere to the nail but come off easily once the polish dries if you try to remove before polish dries it can smear.</li>
            <li>ITS EASY TO DO YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE PATIENCES TO PLACE IT IN THE NAIL STRAIGHT</li>
            <li>so, if you wanna be really thrifty, they can easily be moved from one nail to another in order to conserve guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>does exactly what I wanted it too!</li>
            <li>Make sure your nails are oil free or they won&#x27;t stick and make sure you have the guide firmly down on your nail so that polish will not seep underneath.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit (way too large on any finger) and didn&#x27;t make lines at all.</li>
            <li>Since I do my own polish job, found these to be a lot of work getting them off after creating French nail tips.  </li>
            <li>Shipping takes awhile but worth the price.</li>
            <li>This set of guides is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>For a novice who is attempting to paint their nails instead of going to the Salon it is useful.  </li>
            <li>I have used other nail stickers for French manicures and these are the best!</li>
            <li>These are super sticky so I tap them against my finger a couple times, that way they don&#x27;t pull off the first layer of polish/base coat.</li>
            <li>and I found that the guides did not bend very well in order to get full coverage in the corners.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>These were pretty fast to get to me and will be very helpful for the summer when i want that fresh manicure look!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is because I maintain short nails or if I just prefer a more gradual curve, but the results just weren&#x27;t quite what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think these are pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more of these.</li>
            <li>My wife has struggled to have the french tips made and tried many techniques without results.</li>
            <li>She got her french tips in record time and she is quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>They are pretty sticky and stay in place as you paint.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it makes the french manicure so fast and easy!</li>
            <li>Great for those of us with shaky hands and no patience.</li>
            <li>These are pretty much what I thought they would be.  </li>
            <li>Arrived pretty fast, in a good condition, small price.</li>
            <li>It made my french nail design easy.</li>
            <li>they are sticky enough to stay on your nail, but not too sticky - easy to remove and they don&#x27;t leave any gunk</li>
            <li>Ok, you&#x27;re better off just learning to have a steady hand, because these won&#x27;t save you time considering how long you have to wait for the underlayer to dry.</li>
            <li>these are nice little stickers.  </li>
            <li>and i do love them, but i think that they could be a little more sticky, but they work well enough to do their job.</li>
            <li>so this really helps out.</li>
            <li>i dont really understand how to use these really</li>
            <li>When available at local beauty supply, the price is astronomical</li>
            <li>They stick really well</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Good shipping to slow.</li>
            <li>It will take a few more tries for my left hand to be as good as my right</li>
            <li>I bought these when my nails were long and strong</li>
            <li>These guides are very easy to use and allows for different styles of french tips.</li>
            <li>AND IT CAN MAKE YOUR BASIC NAILS LOOK UNIQUE</li>
            <li>The thing I like about them is that I can use the same sticker on more than one nail and the lines are just as clear as if I&#x27;d used a brand new one.  </li>
            <li>it put a decent line without much smudging</li>
            <li>Do be aware that they are very sticky and if you put them directly on polished nails, they will pull up the polish.</li>
            <li>I wanted to start doing my own nails at home to save a little money and because I could sit in front of the tv in my pajamas on my day off!</li>
            <li>I have a little more patience to put them on a certain way before I paint over them with the polish, but someone else might not</li>
            <li>Did take a little longer to get them than expected my great product.</li>
            <li>so positioning them is a bit frustrating, but once you get them on secure and straight, painting your tips goes pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li>I found these guides to only extend beyond the nail of my thumb by at most 2 mil total.  </li>
            <li>The nail guides came quickly, but are very tiny.</li>
            <li>For single layer designs, these are fantastic, though.</li>
            <li>I figured out that you really need to make sure your white polish is dry before removing the guide, otherwise the line will smear.</li>
            <li>What I love about these little stickers:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It is kind of hard to line them up on the nail which reduces the stickyness of the guide.</li>
            <li>However, it does not stick to the finger nails too well.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion, not too bad, but not the best.</li>
            <li>I used to use these years ago and wanted to do some fun and funky nail designs but could not find these in any local stores</li>
            <li>Sticks to nail polish and leaks onto newly painted nail underneath.</li>
            <li>Makes doing the french nails so much easier!</li>
            <li>I was able to reuse some of the strips by saving them on a small piece of wax paper.</li>
            <li>Just used these last night for the first time.</li>
            <li>But, on the positive side, you can still use them for french manicures!</li>
            <li>my cousin looks so cute in her little french manicure</li>
            <li>and I didnt want to ruin them by getting acrylics or spend the money to get them done professionally.</li>
            <li>Looks just like a professional job.</li>
            <li>they didnt tell you these things stick and peal off the nail polish when your trying to complete the look.</li>
            <li>Comes with three shapes, the bulk of the shapes are the traditional curvature for a French tip, the other shapes are for V shaped tips and like a top of a heart shaped tips.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have super tiny hands, they&#x27;re still pretty small.  </li>
            <li>If you want a color above your tip, once top coat of clear has dried polish the color only to where your tip design starts.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to make designs with the strips but if they peel nail polish off, then they are no good.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li>and they left a sticky white good behind.</li>
            <li>it has the regular french shape and one that gives you a little different style, but looks real cool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are a pain to get off of the card and are incredibly sticky, so if you&#x27;re using a base color, don&#x27;t directly apply these to your nails.</li>
            <li>Let it dry, then polish your clear top coat or sheer pink all over and let dry for a salon finish.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t stick very well, As expected for the price</li>
            <li>When used properly you end up with a professional looking manicure.</li>
            <li>Pro Tip::: when doing French tips, the best way to do them is to put your base coat only on the area where your tip color will go.</li>
            <li>Ive used them a few times with success</li>
            <li>They do work pretty well for the most part, make sure your base color is fully dried, and</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to do just the plain smile line tips.  </li>
            <li>It was supposed to take several weeks to ship, and it actually arrived early!</li>
            <li>they really have a sharp curve to them.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a lot of space and is far too short for anyone with nails at all larger than my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just put the sticker down first and do the white tip before removing the sticker and painting the rest of the nail</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t care for any other designs, besides the classic.</li>
            <li>I paid less for these that came 4 packages with a whole lot of stripes in one pack</li>
            <li>And let the polish dry COMPLETELY before removing the guides.</li>
            <li>you will not get a straight line and will be a mess.</li>

            <li> It was good for it&#x27;s price, however you needed to crease it all down or it wouldn&#x27;t come out perfect.</li>
            <li> Need something that works better and not adhere so hardily to skin.</li>
            <li> Therse r ok they stick to ur nail</li>
            <li> this ithem is ok for some one else not me ty</li>
            <li> ive gotten so many compilments on these</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> No problems!! :)</li>
            <li> This is definitely more suited for people who love the curve to be the correct shape.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I think, this product is OK.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 packs not realizing there are so many in one pack.</li>
            <li> Cost More</li>
            <li> I love to use them and all my friends think I went and had my nails done at the shop.</li>
            <li> good and easy to use, it peel off clean..</li>
            <li> I love the moon look</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> The trick is to run the sticker across your fingers for a while until you&#x27;ve gotten most of the stickiness off, then apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they are ok.  </li>
            <li> Excellent nail guides for french manicures.</li>
            <li> its okay because theres 4 in the pack.</li>
            <li> But I am sure I will like them</li>
            <li> I love working with these</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re line me, and can&#x27;t get the line right, these are good.</li>
            <li> , no polish gets under the sticker, for a clean nice looking line</li>
            <li> The seller seems pretty good, though.</li>
            <li> Did more free hand polishing tips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall worth the cost, and an effective guide set.</li>
            <li> These are so super easy to use, makes your french nail art look awesome..</li>
            <li> an don&#x27;t want to come off so easy</li>
            <li> Easy on, easy off.  </li>
            <li> its easy to stick on and remove.  </li>
            <li> Did not apply easily and pulled off polish.  </li>
            <li> Comes on easily and off easily.</li>
            <li> The adhesive is strong and at times would peel the underlying layer off ruining the finger and causing you to remove polish to start from the beginning.</li>
            <li> My French tips came out beautiful.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!  </li>
            <li> and they fit just fine.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t view this as a huge problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seller did a simple but great job of packaging and shipping.  </li>
            <li> These are cheap.</li>
            <li> We have great looking nails using these for the french tip look.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great, definitely recommend for beginner manicurists.</li>
            <li> They do make a cleaner line than using a brush and free hand cleaning up the line.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews for this said they didn&#x27;t work very well, but these worked perfectly fine for me!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but its good to have specially when you wanted to do the French tip every so often by yourself.</li>
            <li> What makes this a good product is that there are a variety, 2 or 3, different shaped line guides.</li>
            <li> easy to use and it what i needed to do my nails fast and pretty  and cute</li>
            <li> First, they arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> shipped quickly</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll last me for a long time and they work great!</li>
            <li> these really adhere to the nail but come off easily once the polish dries if you try to remove before polish dries it can smear.</li>
            <li> ITS EASY TO DO YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE PATIENCES TO PLACE IT IN THE NAIL STRAIGHT</li>
            <li> so, if you wanna be really thrifty, they can easily be moved from one nail to another in order to conserve guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> does exactly what I wanted it too!</li>
            <li> Make sure your nails are oil free or they won&#x27;t stick and make sure you have the guide firmly down on your nail so that polish will not seep underneath.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit (way too large on any finger) and didn&#x27;t make lines at all.</li>
            <li> Since I do my own polish job, found these to be a lot of work getting them off after creating French nail tips.  </li>
            <li> Shipping takes awhile but worth the price.</li>
            <li> This set of guides is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> For a novice who is attempting to paint their nails instead of going to the Salon it is useful.  </li>
            <li> I have used other nail stickers for French manicures and these are the best!</li>
            <li> These are super sticky so I tap them against my finger a couple times, that way they don&#x27;t pull off the first layer of polish/base coat.</li>
            <li> and I found that the guides did not bend very well in order to get full coverage in the corners.  </li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> These were pretty fast to get to me and will be very helpful for the summer when i want that fresh manicure look!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is because I maintain short nails or if I just prefer a more gradual curve, but the results just weren&#x27;t quite what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think these are pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more of these.</li>
            <li> My wife has struggled to have the french tips made and tried many techniques without results.</li>
            <li> She got her french tips in record time and she is quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> They are pretty sticky and stay in place as you paint.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> it makes the french manicure so fast and easy!</li>
            <li> Great for those of us with shaky hands and no patience.</li>
            <li> These are pretty much what I thought they would be.  </li>
            <li> Arrived pretty fast, in a good condition, small price.</li>
            <li> It made my french nail design easy.</li>
            <li> they are sticky enough to stay on your nail, but not too sticky - easy to remove and they don&#x27;t leave any gunk</li>
            <li> Ok, you&#x27;re better off just learning to have a steady hand, because these won&#x27;t save you time considering how long you have to wait for the underlayer to dry.</li>
            <li> these are nice little stickers.  </li>
            <li> and i do love them, but i think that they could be a little more sticky, but they work well enough to do their job.</li>
            <li> so this really helps out.</li>
            <li> i dont really understand how to use these really</li>
            <li> When available at local beauty supply, the price is astronomical</li>
            <li> They stick really well</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Good shipping to slow.</li>
            <li> It will take a few more tries for my left hand to be as good as my right</li>
            <li> I bought these when my nails were long and strong</li>
            <li> These guides are very easy to use and allows for different styles of french tips.</li>
            <li> AND IT CAN MAKE YOUR BASIC NAILS LOOK UNIQUE</li>
            <li> The thing I like about them is that I can use the same sticker on more than one nail and the lines are just as clear as if I&#x27;d used a brand new one.  </li>
            <li> it put a decent line without much smudging</li>
            <li> Do be aware that they are very sticky and if you put them directly on polished nails, they will pull up the polish.</li>
            <li> I wanted to start doing my own nails at home to save a little money and because I could sit in front of the tv in my pajamas on my day off!</li>
            <li> I have a little more patience to put them on a certain way before I paint over them with the polish, but someone else might not</li>
            <li> Did take a little longer to get them than expected my great product.</li>
            <li> so positioning them is a bit frustrating, but once you get them on secure and straight, painting your tips goes pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li> I found these guides to only extend beyond the nail of my thumb by at most 2 mil total.  </li>
            <li> The nail guides came quickly, but are very tiny.</li>
            <li> For single layer designs, these are fantastic, though.</li>
            <li> I figured out that you really need to make sure your white polish is dry before removing the guide, otherwise the line will smear.</li>
            <li> What I love about these little stickers:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It is kind of hard to line them up on the nail which reduces the stickyness of the guide.</li>
            <li> However, it does not stick to the finger nails too well.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion, not too bad, but not the best.</li>
            <li> I used to use these years ago and wanted to do some fun and funky nail designs but could not find these in any local stores</li>
            <li> Sticks to nail polish and leaks onto newly painted nail underneath.</li>
            <li> Makes doing the french nails so much easier!</li>
            <li> I was able to reuse some of the strips by saving them on a small piece of wax paper.</li>
            <li> Just used these last night for the first time.</li>
            <li> But, on the positive side, you can still use them for french manicures!</li>
            <li> my cousin looks so cute in her little french manicure</li>
            <li> and I didnt want to ruin them by getting acrylics or spend the money to get them done professionally.</li>
            <li> Looks just like a professional job.</li>
            <li> they didnt tell you these things stick and peal off the nail polish when your trying to complete the look.</li>
            <li> Comes with three shapes, the bulk of the shapes are the traditional curvature for a French tip, the other shapes are for V shaped tips and like a top of a heart shaped tips.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have super tiny hands, they&#x27;re still pretty small.  </li>
            <li> If you want a color above your tip, once top coat of clear has dried polish the color only to where your tip design starts.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to be able to make designs with the strips but if they peel nail polish off, then they are no good.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li> and they left a sticky white good behind.</li>
            <li> it has the regular french shape and one that gives you a little different style, but looks real cool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a pain to get off of the card and are incredibly sticky, so if you&#x27;re using a base color, don&#x27;t directly apply these to your nails.</li>
            <li> Let it dry, then polish your clear top coat or sheer pink all over and let dry for a salon finish.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stick very well, As expected for the price</li>
            <li> When used properly you end up with a professional looking manicure.</li>
            <li> Pro Tip::: when doing French tips, the best way to do them is to put your base coat only on the area where your tip color will go.</li>
            <li> Ive used them a few times with success</li>
            <li> They do work pretty well for the most part, make sure your base color is fully dried, and</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to do just the plain smile line tips.  </li>
            <li> It was supposed to take several weeks to ship, and it actually arrived early!</li>
            <li> they really have a sharp curve to them.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a lot of space and is far too short for anyone with nails at all larger than my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just put the sticker down first and do the white tip before removing the sticker and painting the rest of the nail</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t care for any other designs, besides the classic.</li>
            <li> I paid less for these that came 4 packages with a whole lot of stripes in one pack</li>
            <li> And let the polish dry COMPLETELY before removing the guides.</li>
            <li> you will not get a straight line and will be a mess.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not love so much was how curved the french tips were...</li>
            <li> These are pretty short, and hardly even overlapped on my thumbs.  </li>
            <li> they stick totally flat</li>
            <li> Otherwise if the nail is not completely straight, the extra space between your nail and the line sticker that is left nail polish will get there any</li>
            <li> They work, but unless the nail polish is BONE dry (like an hour later dry), they tend to peel up ships of the layer underneath.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> French tips in the traditional form have a definitive dip, if you want it straighter and less defined then these aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Not only do the stickers have a hard time sticking to the nail, but the polish completely leaked through.</li>
            <li> I did let my nails dry for a day and when I used these guides</li>
            <li> i only use the regualr round french manicure ones.</li>
            <li> they are a little rubbery, so you can actually bend and stretch them if they are not aligning perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the stickers are a little thin but worth the money and does the job.</li>
            <li> Everything what I expected</li>
            <li> They also were delivered faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> They worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> Not what was expected at all from this product.  </li>
            <li> ill give them to someone else who know how to use them right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, my only other complaint is very minor.  </li>
            <li> Peel off when the paint is still wet and ta-da!</li>
            <li> I have very wide nails</li>
            <li> Even on my very wide thumb nail.</li>
            <li> You will waste your time if you try to do this with out letting coats fully dry.</li>
            <li> Of course I have a hard time making the french tip lines on my own...or there would be no need for me to buy the stickers.</li>
            <li> Some people are complaint that the curve is too deep.</li>
            <li> No more messy french nail designs.</li>
            <li> They stick down well, and don&#x27;t pull up the underlying polish.  </li>
            <li> Let it dry, then choose you tip guide and polish below the design as usual.</li>
            <li> these guides do not peel and do not stick properly, also very small</li>
            <li> The stickers do not easily pull apart from each other and makes you end up having to throw some of them out.</li>
            <li> These guides would get a 5 star if they were a little easier to get off the card.  </li>
            <li> These are almost a little too sticky.</li>
            <li> Other than the quantity, they are just ordinary tips.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is they&#x27;re hard to peel off the paper</li>
            <li> I go through these stickers crazy fast.  </li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The standard rounded guides are ok assuming you don&#x27;t use a base coat, or the base is 100% dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As background, my ring finger is a size 6.5, my gloves a size small.  </li>
            <li> It is small i didnt expect it to be small but</li>
            <li> My nails were a sloppy mess.</li>
            <li> They do take a little time to get use to, they are very small thin stickers</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the size</li>
            <li> If you apply a bottom coat and let it fully dry and then put the stickers on an paint over to make designs, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it take a month and a half to receive it, no matter what I did, it took my base color off:(</li>
            <li> These are difficult to find in my area.  </li>
            <li> The guides do not stick to the nail well, and they are difficult to separate from one another.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product because the strips stick too hard and peel nail polish off.</li>
            <li> I used a color base coat, waited an hour (definitely dry to the touch), and the base color still came off when I pulled the strips off.  </li>
            <li> shipping time wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll tear the base coat.</li>
            <li> but I always had to touch-up the base coat.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in it</li>
            <li> As for the angled designs--perhaps it is just me, but I thought they came out horrible.  </li>

            <li> My daughter and I used these to make beautiful nail art and it looked like the professionals.  Will have to buy more!</li>
            <li> Great for those of us with shaky hands and no patience.</li>
            <li> Since I do my own polish job, found these to be a lot of work getting them off after creating French nail tips.  Need something that works better and not adhere so hardily to skin. Did more free hand polishing tips.</li>
            <li> good fit - I have very wide nails and they fit just fine. Even on my very wide thumb nail.</li>
            <li> These guides would get a 5 star if they were a little easier to get off the card.  Nice shape.  Good sticking quality.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The seller did a simple but great job of packaging and shipping.  My only qualms are with the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As background, my ring finger is a size 6.5, my gloves a size small.  While I don&#x27;t have super tiny hands, they&#x27;re still pretty small.  I found these guides to only extend beyond the nail of my thumb by at most 2 mil total.  That&#x27;s not a lot of space and is far too short for anyone with nails at all larger than my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the curve of the regular (non-art) guides to be too severe.  I don&#x27;t know if this is because I maintain short nails or if I just prefer a more gradual curve, but the results just weren&#x27;t quite what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I found the guides to be too sticky even after using my skin to lessen the adherence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my only other complaint is very minor.  I have very deep nail beds and I found that the guides did not bend very well in order to get full coverage in the corners.  Honestly, this can be an issue with most guides so I don&#x27;t view this as a huge problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I will use them until they&#x27;re gone but will not be buying these guides again.  The seller seems pretty good, though.</li>
            <li> I wanted to start doing my own nails at home to save a little money and because I could sit in front of the tv in my pajamas on my day off! Of course I have a hard time making the french tip lines on my own...or there would be no need for me to buy the stickers. It will take a few more tries for my left hand to be as good as my right so this really helps out.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!  the price is AWESOME! I paid less for these that came 4 packages with a whole lot of stripes in one pack then I paid for one package here in my local store. These are so super easy to use, makes your french nail art look awesome..it comes with 2 different french styles..it has the regular french shape and one that gives you a little different style, but looks real cool.</li>
            <li> I have used other nail stickers for French manicures and these are the best! They stick great and the nail polish doesn&#x27;t bleed underneath the sticker so that&#x27;s a huge plus!</li>
            <li> Therse r ok they stick to ur nail an don&#x27;t want to come off so easy this ithem is ok for some one else not me ty</li>
            <li> works perfect my cousin looks so cute in her little french manicure shes 6  ive gotten so many compilments on these they look like pros did em&#x27;</li>
            <li> These are by far the easiest to use and the best nail guide stickers I&#x27;ve ever seen. I was a little skeptical about the size but they ended up fitting all of my nails perfectly. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It was good for it&#x27;s price, however you needed to crease it all down or it wouldn&#x27;t come out perfect.</li>
            <li> Does not do its intended job for me.  The adhesive is too sticky and the end result is ruined polish.</li>
            <li> Good shipping to slow.</li>
            <li> Everything what I expected</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find these to be very good.  They didn&#x27;t stick well to my nails and the nail polish got underneath.  My nails were a sloppy mess.</li>
            <li> Works great! Love them. Did take a little longer to get them than expected my great product. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I bought these when my nails were long and strong and I didnt want to ruin them by getting acrylics or spend the money to get them done professionally. They do take a little time to get use to, they are very small thin stickers so positioning them is a bit frustrating, but once you get them on secure and straight, painting your tips goes pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li> i dont really understand how to use these really and they left a sticky white good behind. ill give them to someone else who know how to use them right.</li>
            <li> These worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews for this said they didn&#x27;t work very well, but these worked perfectly fine for me! Loved them</li>
            <li> These guides are easy to use and make for a wonderful pedicure.  These are difficult to find in my area.  When available at local beauty supply, the price is astronomical</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not love so much was how curved the french tips were...they really have a sharp curve to them.</li>
            <li> Good product and a good deal.  Use it on your nails after you polish your nails with a file from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Salon.  Otherwise if the nail is not completely straight, the extra space between your nail and the line sticker that is left nail polish will get there any you will not get a straight line and will be a mess.</li>
            <li> I got these for designing my nails.  If you apply a bottom coat and let it fully dry and then put the stickers on an paint over to make designs, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.  The stickers will take the bottom coat off the nail, leaving unpainted nail underneath. If it doesn&#x27;t do its job, what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> These work perfectly!  They make a perfect line to paint/glitter my nail tips.  Came off nicely.  Didn&#x27;t take off my nail polish or leave a residue.  I would recommend these to all women who do their own nails at home!!  They also were delivered faster than expected.  Good product. Good seller.</li>
            <li> I think these are pretty self explanatory. These work great! I&#x27;ve used them on my finger nails and my toe nails. No problems!! :)</li>
            <li> Comes with three shapes, the bulk of the shapes are the traditional curvature for a French tip, the other shapes are for V shaped tips and like a top of a heart shaped tips. Some people are complaint that the curve is too deep. I personally don&#x27;t feel that way. French tips in the traditional form have a definitive dip, if you want it straighter and less defined then these aren&#x27;t for you. This is definitely more suited for people who love the curve to be the correct shape. Five star shapes indeed... Pro Tip::: when doing French tips, the best way to do them is to put your base coat only on the area where your tip color will go. Let it dry, then choose you tip guide and polish below the design as usual. Let it dry, then polish your clear top coat or sheer pink all over and let dry for a salon finish. If you want a color above your tip, once top coat of clear has dried polish the color only to where your tip design starts. (This is how I do it on my clients and self)</li>
            <li> these are a good deal. they work well to make different designs on your nails. shipping time wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> the stickers are a little thin but worth the money and does the job. i like the different designs. shipped quickly</li>
            <li> These guides are perfect.  Easy on, easy off.  I&#x27;ve had several compliments about my nails and people think i had them done at the salon.  I will buy again.  Very good value also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product for your  mani set at home. Shipping takes awhile but worth the price. Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> These are cheap. The stickers do not easily pull apart from each other and makes you end up having to throw some of them out.</li>
            <li> easy to use and it what i needed to do my nails fast and pretty  and cute i love it</li>
            <li> These are pretty short, and hardly even overlapped on my thumbs.  I used a color base coat, waited an hour (definitely dry to the touch), and the base color still came off when I pulled the strips off.  As for the angled designs--perhaps it is just me, but I thought they came out horrible.  The standard rounded guides are ok assuming you don&#x27;t use a base coat, or the base is 100% dry.</li>
            <li> I think, this product is OK. Arrived pretty fast, in a good condition, small price. However, it does not stick to the finger nails too well.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion, not too bad, but not the best.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they dont stick as well as they should. I have a little more patience to put them on a certain way before I paint over them with the polish, but someone else might not</li>
            <li> Got these in no time. Makes doing the french nails so much easier! And it came with the added bonus of different designs!</li>
            <li> Instead of 2 of each, I got 4 of the three different styles, but since they threw in an extra one, I&#x27;m not too upset. These are good guides, though if you&#x27;re looking at doing dual layers, these stick too well and will pull off the bottom layer of polish. Best to use nail tape for that. For single layer designs, these are fantastic, though. They stick really well so there is no bleeding of the colour underneath.</li>
            <li> I used to use these years ago and wanted to do some fun and funky nail designs but could not find these in any local stores so I was so grateful to find them thru Amazon. I ordered 2 packs not realizing there are so many in one pack. They&#x27;ll last me for a long time and they work great! Looks just like a professional job.</li>
            <li> These are almost a little too sticky. They work, but unless the nail polish is BONE dry (like an hour later dry), they tend to peel up ships of the layer underneath. Ok, you&#x27;re better off just learning to have a steady hand, because these won&#x27;t save you time considering how long you have to wait for the underlayer to dry.</li>
            <li> They worked as expected.  The itemed didnt come an they had to ship anther to me.  Ive used them a few times with success</li>
            <li> Definitely not as advertised. The listing states: 1 Set Of 4 Packs, which includes 2 Packs of Regular Rounded French Nail Guide and 2 Packs of 3 Style French Nail Guide. I only received 2 packs with three designs. You need to get your act together because it sounds like everyone gets something different.</li>
            <li> These French Nail Guide Stickers Stick To Your Nail Like They Should The Ones You Buy At The Store Cost More And They Don&#x27;t Work. I love to use them and all my friends think I went and had my nails done at the shop. I will keep buying these nail stickers as well as my girlfriends. Thank you and see you soon.</li>
            <li> These are pretty much what I thought they would be.  They do work pretty well for the most part, make sure your base color is fully dried, and then some.  You will waste your time if you try to do this with out letting coats fully dry.</li>
            <li> good and easy to use, it peel off clean.. it makes the french manicure so fast and easy! you can make your desings!</li>
            <li> these really adhere to the nail but come off easily once the polish dries if you try to remove before polish dries it can smear.</li>
            <li> Sticks to nail polish and leaks onto newly painted nail underneath. Might have to be a 2 day project instead of 1</li>
            <li> Very cool product in good price. No more messy french nail designs. It made my french nail design easy. Great buy. Already buy 3 for me and friends.</li>
            <li> I go through these stickers crazy fast.  The thing I like about them is that I can use the same sticker on more than one nail and the lines are just as clear as if I&#x27;d used a brand new one.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> these are nice little stickers.  I use to get that perfect manicure.  its easy to stick on and remove.  i only use the regualr round french manicure ones.</li>
            <li> ITS EASY TO DO YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE PATIENCES TO PLACE IT IN THE NAIL STRAIGHT AND IT CAN MAKE YOUR BASIC NAILS LOOK UNIQUE</li>
            <li> i recieved my guides today. i was dissapointed bc i thought i was getting 2 of the chevron nail guides. they sent me 4 regular french tip guides. i can never find the chevron tips and thats why i chose to order. waste of money bc i alreayy have the nailene tips that you can buy at walmart.</li>
            <li> Not only did it take a month and a half to receive it, no matter what I did, it took my base color off:(</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in some Easter Baskets that I made for my grown granddaughters.  I made them a nail salon basket, with every thing they need to do there nail, even with lots of decorations.  They loved them.</li>
            <li> Nice polish guides, good price. 3 different patterns for lots of designs. I will definitely order more of these. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love the moon look they give for my french tips. My only complaint is they&#x27;re hard to peel off the paper and then once they&#x27;re open, they stick to the inside of the plastic packaging. Otherwise, they work good and look good. Make sure your nails are oil free or they won&#x27;t stick and make sure you have the guide firmly down on your nail so that polish will not seep underneath. And let the polish dry COMPLETELY before removing the guides.</li>
            <li> I love this product actually looks like I went to do a french tip at the nail salon. Love it</li>
            <li> these guides do not peel and do not stick properly, also very small I do not recommend this item. very cheaply made</li>
            <li> Not only do the stickers have a hard time sticking to the nail, but the polish completely leaked through. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stick very well, As expected for the price</li>
            <li> worked great love using them for my nails.</li>
            <li> The nail guides came quickly, but are very tiny. They appear to be for a child&#x27;s fingers not adults. They fit my nails perfectly but I have not used them yet so hopefully it works well.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a pain to get off of the card and are incredibly sticky, so if you&#x27;re using a base color, don&#x27;t directly apply these to your nails. You&#x27;ll tear the base coat. The trick is to run the sticker across your fingers for a while until you&#x27;ve gotten most of the stickiness off, then apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stickers are a durable plastic so, if you wanna be really thrifty, they can easily be moved from one nail to another in order to conserve guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall worth the cost, and an effective guide set.</li>
            <li> I did let my nails dry for a day and when I used these guides it put a decent line without much smudging but I always had to touch-up the base coat.</li>
            <li> These items are way too sticky to use. Also, polish gets under them very easily and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this item again.</li>
            <li> My wife has struggled to have the french tips made and tried many techniques without results. These stickers were finally the solution to her problems. We were looking for them everywhere and thankfully they are here to order. She got her french tips in record time and she is quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> These were pretty fast to get to me and will be very helpful for the summer when i want that fresh manicure look!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters and myself. We have great looking nails using these for the french tip look. No &#x27;runs&#x27; when used correctly. They&#x27;re great, definitely recommend for beginner manicurists.</li>
            <li> These guides are very easy to use and allows for different styles of french tips. I was able to reuse some of the strips by saving them on a small piece of wax paper. Good product.</li>
            <li> i use these on my finger tip, under nail so my nail polish doesnt get on skin.  great for self-french mani too. resusable (but they wont tell u that)</li>
            <li> This set of guides is well worth the money.  They stick down well, and don&#x27;t pull up the underlying polish.  The 3 designs are perfect for someone who likes to switch up their look.</li>
            <li> I got these and i do love them, but i think that they could be a little more sticky, but they work well enough to do their job.</li>
            <li> The guides do not stick to the nail well, and they are difficult to separate from one another.  Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works great! Just put the sticker down first and do the white tip before removing the sticker and painting the rest of the nail</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect these to work as well as they said but they are amazing. My French tips came out beautiful.</li>
            <li> I used this product for quite sometime and they are ok.  For a novice who is attempting to paint their nails instead of going to the Salon it is useful.  I would recommend it for such a person.  I might buy it in the future.  I still have some I have not used.</li>
            <li> this would be a great kit for my nail if it works,  it didn&#x27;t work cz it doesn&#x27;t fit (way too large on any finger) and didn&#x27;t make lines at all.</li>
            <li> Did not apply easily and pulled off polish.  Not what was expected at all from this product.  Very disappointed in it</li>
            <li> To press it against your skin before putting it on your nail. The adhesive is strong and at times would peel the underlying layer off ruining the finger and causing you to remove polish to start from the beginning.</li>
            <li> does exactly what I wanted it too!</li>
            <li> Excellent nail guides for french manicures. Comes on easily and off easily. When used properly you end up with a professional looking manicure.</li>
            <li> It is small i didnt expect it to be small but its okay because theres 4 in the pack. havent used it yet though</li>
            <li> I just haven&#x27;t had time to use these yet.. But I am sure I will like them I have had these before and loved them.</li>
            <li> First, they arrived very quickly.  Way before the delivery estimate.  A very pleasant surprise.  Second, they work well.  They are pretty sticky and stay in place as you paint.  Peel off when the paint is still wet and ta-da! perfect lines.</li>
            <li> Good product, it is as described. It works very well. I had no problems with it at all (no sticky residue, etc..). A must have! However, I don&#x27;t care for any other designs, besides the classic.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected. It was supposed to take several weeks to ship, and it actually arrived early! Do be aware that they are very sticky and if you put them directly on polished nails, they will pull up the polish. As others recommend, try sticking them to your clothing once or twice to reduce the tackiness before applying to your nails.</li>
            <li> they didnt tell you these things stick and peal off the nail polish when your trying to complete the look.</li>
            <li> What makes this a good product is that there are a variety, 2 or 3, different shaped line guides. You don&#x27;t have to do just the plain smile line tips.  Other than the quantity, they are just ordinary tips.  If you&#x27;re line me, and can&#x27;t get the line right, these are good.</li>
            <li> I love working with these I will be ordering more soon. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really nice for the price! These are super sticky so I tap them against my finger a couple times, that way they don&#x27;t pull off the first layer of polish/base coat.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but its good to have specially when you wanted to do the French tip every so often by yourself.</li>
            <li> What I love about these little stickers:&lt;br /&gt;- they are a little rubbery, so you can actually bend and stretch them if they are not aligning perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;- they are sticky enough to stay on your nail, but not too sticky - easy to remove and they don&#x27;t leave any gunk&lt;br /&gt;- they stick totally flat, no polish gets under the sticker, for a clean nice looking line</li>
            <li> They work well I am just not as talented as I would like to be with them.</li>
            <li> Just used these last night for the first time. They do make a cleaner line than using a brush and free hand cleaning up the line. I figured out that you really need to make sure your white polish is dry before removing the guide, otherwise the line will smear. Some of the guides stuck together on the sheet and were not usable. It is kind of hard to line them up on the nail which reduces the stickyness of the guide. But it will get better with some practice! I&#x27;ll continue to use these for when I want to do a french mani!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product because the strips stick too hard and peel nail polish off. I was hoping to be able to make designs with the strips but if they peel nail polish off, then they are no good. But, on the positive side, you can still use them for french manicures! They would be really good for that!</li>
            <li> I like the product and how it would turn out if they weren&#x27;t so sticky. They leave a residue of the adhesive on your nail which does not come off.</li>
