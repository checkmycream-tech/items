            <li> This was absolutely horrible. I purchased this shampoo online because i didn&#x27;t have time to go to the beauty supply store that I usually go to. I buy this shampoo ALL THE TIME and I can tell you this is NOT real Mizani. I washed my hair in it and it became SEVERELY MATTED. It took me like 4 hours to comb through I was furious and in tears because I almost had to cut my hair. The bottle is even lighter than the regular Mizani bottle. I was very disappointed because I was trying to do my hair before the long weekend as I was going out of town. Such a disaster. I will never purchase from this seller again nor will I buy shampoo online again from anyone but the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a stylist. I have noticed smoother, softer hair after having used this shampoo and conditioner. I also use the oil after drying my hair before styling.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Mizani hair care products!!!! The shampoo &amp; conditioner leaves my hair feeling silky, smooth &amp; puts moisture back into my hair. I would highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> I love Mizani products, always does the trick!</li>
            <li> Older product that does not work as it is supposed.  Recieved different bottles from what was illustrated in pictures. Very unhappy and dissappointed.</li>
            <li> No good for my hair.it was my bad choice</li>
            <li> I love this product. The salon where I get my hair styled uses the complete line of amazing products. I like the shampoo because my hair feels clean, squeaky clean.  The conditioner add just the right amount of softness back on the hair after it is shampooed.</li>
            <li> I use Mizani on my daughter&#x27;s hair. It makes her hair easier to comb and blow dry. I definitely recommend this product for african american hair.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves your hair feeling soft and moisturrized. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Mizani products and after using them for three yhing to a different product, I went back to Mizani and my hair is healthy and continuously growing. I entend to stay with Mizani as long as my hair ir relaxed. If I go natural I&#x27;ll probably use their product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitley recommend their entire hair care line. I use Butter Blend Sensitive scalp relaxer.</li>
            <li> These are great salon quality hair care products. My hair came out smelling great and looking great too.  It was smooth, full of body and bounce.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I have curly hair and Mizani products work wonders with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Made my natural hair silky and bouncy!</li>
            <li> This Shampoo and Conditioner helps with stretching your relaxers. This combination leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable. The conditioner provides a &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; feeling in your hair.</li>
            <li> I expected a silkier result, I also expected to use very little to get this result because of the cost. I usually use the pantene products that are very rich, cheaper and you use less of it to get results. this product has the hair lighter than the pantene products. This can be improve by making it soapier so that less can be use for the same results, lighter hair.</li>
            <li> I have no chemicals or color in my hair, I have been natural for about I year and a half.  I thought this was the product for me but, it turned out that it made my hair frizzy  and dry.  I was truly disappointed and I&#x27;m sorry that I spent money  on a product that use to be superior in hair  care.</li>
            <li> too heavy for my hair. but is good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter because her hair was over processed and she found it helped Very much.  Her hair became more moisterized, less dry &amp;  looked much healthier.</li>
            <li> This is amazing product. the shampoo goes along way. You just need a nickel size amount and it gives you so much lather. These products are amazing. They leave your hair soft. Perfect for natural heads and people who are transitioning to natural from relaxer. worth every penny.</li>
            <li> As described! Great products</li>
            <li> Loved it! Great price for these bundle.</li>
            <li> Mizani is the best!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! The shampoo lathers very well and the conditioner makes my hair silky soft and easy to manage.
