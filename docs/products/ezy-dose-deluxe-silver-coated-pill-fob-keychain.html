            <li>The metal isn&#x27;t the top-notch aluminum container I would expect, but I get what I paid.</li>
            <li>Excellent built quality.  </li>
            <li>This worked great!</li>
            <li>if you take alot of pills it will work great for you good deal!!</li>
            <li>Its great when you forget or are at a thing</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>works  great for carrying my enzyme pills so that I can eat out whenever I am away from home.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value and does the job, so I had to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping an emergency supply of prescription meds in your pocket.  </li>
            <li>and I was quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good size to keep about a 2 week supply in.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>good price and good quality.</li>
            <li>Great product; makes sure my migraine meds (which I have to take as soon as I feel one coming) are always handy.</li>
            <li>I love that you can attach this to your keychain!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great product &amp; quick shipping!</li>
            <li>I believe that this kind of thing could save a life, and that everybody should have one.</li>
            <li>Very accurate product description.  </li>
            <li>These are huge!</li>
            <li>I love it, and my friends saw it they all like it and will buy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold as many pills as the capsules by Bison Designs, but is sturdier for keychain use.</li>
            <li>It helps stay more organized.  </li>
            <li>Works perfect for keeping your daily meds.</li>
            <li>Most of the discussion and confusion here is the size.  </li>
            <li>I would know for sure if it is all scratched and worn out.  </li>
            <li>A rubber O-ring makes sure it is air and water tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well made, and I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it was said before, but the Dollar Tree has these for a buck.</li>
            <li>I love this Metal Pill fob.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is perfect size (even for the larger pills) to carry a couple with me during the workday or if we are going to be out.</li>
            <li>I still wonder if we would have been able to save our precious friend&#x27;s life had we been able to get aspirin to him as soon as his symptoms began.  </li>
            <li>Look for something better.</li>
            <li>Men need a place to carry these aspirin since they don&#x27;t have purses.  :)</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s a screw top</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised that the original bottle fits inside just perfectly.</li>
            <li>Once in a while the canister unscrews and it drops off the keychain but the construction otherwise is just fine.</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>The container itself is super durable!</li>
            <li>Holds my little bottle of Nitro (just in case) pills perfectly.</li>
            <li>I can fit both the micro usb and a wireless adapter with room to spare.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap and a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>EZY-Dose also make a plastic pill fob keychain which is far superior to this metal one.</li>
            <li>the lid from my original unscrewed and was lost, so this is a replacement.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, does what it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li>Good quality and low price</li>
            <li>But there is a solid O-ring in the container to give it a good seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This container is pretty large, was expecting something more pocket friendly.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super lightweight</li>
            <li>Super light and not terribly clunky, it isn&#x27;t tiny however.</li>
            <li>It holds about a weeks worth of pills.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yis just the right size that you can carry in your pocket.</li>
            <li>Now I can carry low dose aspirin on my person very easily just in case.  </li>
            <li>I know having this in my pocket keeps my medicine safe, dry and clean.</li>
            <li>The first one the keyring broke.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would carry more than a daily dose.  </li>
            <li>It holds a lot of different pills safely and they do not break up in my pocket.</li>
            <li>satisfied with low price and faaast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Like most people I have to take some daily medications</li>
            <li>okay quality and price for a different use.</li>
            <li>One can definitely find a better quality pill box for the price.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Very well made and good size to carry a few aspirins in my purse.  </li>
            <li>If you only need to carry a days worth of small pills or one large dose, this is great.  </li>
            <li>and they last plenty fine for me.</li>
            <li>He does not take nitro frequently AT ALL, he just carries it for emergency purposes, so it was important that the nitro bottle itself, still sealed, fit in this container, rather than having to take the pills out and keep them loose which alters the integrity of the pills after time.  </li>
            <li>Nice little keychain pill fob keeps my pills at the ready, when I need them.  </li>
            <li>put a piece of cotton inside to prevent the pills from jiggling too much and hitting the container walls and pulverizing it.</li>
            <li>This means I can leave my house with just wallet and keys, and not bring my whole purse all the time.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and functional.</li>
            <li>It is as described and seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It is very well made.</li>
            <li>No inner lining and does not screw off smoothly.</li>
            <li>Very roomy.</li>
            <li>IT HOLDS A FULL BOTTLE OF NITRO, ITS AIR TIGHT AND KEEPS THE LIGHT OUT</li>
            <li>Good product, but a little too bulky to carry on my key chain in my pant pocket</li>
            <li>I purchased this particular item mainly because of Ezy Dose reputation.  </li>
            <li>Clearly that is my fault for not reading more carefully.</li>
            <li>If you are worried about the actual size, it is 2 inches high (including the tip where the tringle clip is hooked) and about 0.8 inch in diameter; or better yet check the actual size at the store.  </li>
            <li>I love the size of this little container.  </li>
            <li>Simple over-the-counter stuff that can easily hold capsule sized pills but probably two to three larger size pills.</li>
            <li>It is water proof and just the right size to put on a key chain.</li>
            <li>Right size and fits on my key chain.</li>
            <li>works great for pills or other small items......</li>
            <li>I am sure the experience was just what the juvenile who put it in there was hoping for.</li>
            <li>metal is heavy duty, make the pill container strong.  </li>
            <li>Very well constructed, and feels solid but be aware if you are only looking for something to carry one or two pills, keep looking.</li>
            <li>Even it is not made of stainless steel, it is durable enough for the price.</li>
            <li>It is also completely airtight, as it claims.</li>
            <li>So far I have it for three weeks</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is waterproof, although I haven&#x27;t tested it completely.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it is so lightweight, I would have preferred stainless steel or some heavier metal.  </li>
            <li>Having \\&quot;spares\\&quot; of necessary medication, i.e. aspirin, Nitroglycerin or extra pain pills easily accessible on my keychain is terrific.  </li>
            <li>Previously, I never seem to remember to take pills along.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Size is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Must have for mobile folks taking large numbers of critical pills daily....</li>
            <li>No other pill container can do this.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate the quality screw top and the little plastic ring which keeps the pills inside it dry.  </li>
            <li>calcium and multivitamins are going to be a tight squeeze if you need to put a days worth.  </li>
            <li>so you barely notice that you&#x27;re carrying it.</li>
            <li>I took the other reviews with a grain of salt when they said this thing was large, but boy they were not exaggerating.</li>
            <li>I would have to say this is a little too small for all the horse pills I take, but it is large enough for the important three - vitamin, garlic, and immune booster.</li>
            <li>This one carries about a dozen standard oval pills or a full 50 or so small caplets.</li>
            <li>When I opened it I was expectingly surprised by the site and the small of the large insect.  </li>
            <li>This is large enough that I waste about 70% of the space and may even order a smaller one.</li>

            <li> I would have to say this is a little too small for all the horse pills I take, but it is large enough for the important three - vitamin, garlic, and immune booster.</li>
            <li> This one carries about a dozen standard oval pills or a full 50 or so small caplets.</li>

            <li> This is large enough that I waste about 70% of the space and may even order a smaller one.</li>
            <li> i really dont think its 100% water tight but it will keep things dry....</li>
            <li> The name Rite-Aid should have been a clue - much bigger than anticipated, and very cheaply made - a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> the only down side is that the outside plating is starting to crack off cause it gets banged around a lot.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried keeping an extra in his wallet  (gets crushed), in glove box of car  </li>
            <li> Because we were unable to quickly find any aspirin stashed in our purses, we lost the chance to possibly save his life.  </li>
            <li> Keeps items dry</li>
            <li> Whether you are carrying your medicine or just a few aspirin or cold pills it is a handy item to have around</li>
            <li> It is not very large, but it does hold up.  </li>
            <li> Extra doses are always with him now,  and it&#x27;s small enough that it&#x27;s not a nuisance on his keys.</li>
            <li> but The seal ring looks sturdy, staying in place and the lid screws on tightly; possibly too tight for elderly persons.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My daughter uses this all the time, great product!</li>
            <li> I use this for my allergy medicine if I need it.  Simple over-the-counter stuff that can easily hold capsule sized pills but probably two to three larger size pills.</li>
            <li> This Pill container is tall enough to put in the &amp;#34;Nitrostat&amp;#34; (Nitroglycerin tab) bottle. No other pill container can do this. It is water proof and just the right size to put on a key chain. Even it is not made of stainless steel, it is durable enough for the price. I love it, and my friends saw it they all like it and will buy.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, does what it&#x27;s intended for. Fits about 5 medium sized pills. I keep this for my vitamins on my gym bag</li>
            <li> This container is pretty large, was expecting something more pocket friendly.  I didn&#x27;t need a nitro pill size nor a big fob but it will do the job.</li>
            <li> A sturdy sealed pill container for your keychain. It doesn&#x27;t hold as many pills as the capsules by Bison Designs, but is sturdier for keychain use.</li>
            <li> My daughter has to take several prescrition meds a day.  This is a good size to keep about a 2 week supply in.  Since it&#x27;s attached to her keyring if she forgets before work she has them with her when she remembers later in the day.  This is her 2nd one in the past year.  The first one the keyring broke.  The container itself is super durable!</li>
            <li> I love that you can attach this to your keychain!  It helps stay more organized.  It is also completely airtight, as it claims.</li>
            <li> Once in a while the canister unscrews and it drops off the keychain but the construction otherwise is just fine.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for keeping your daily meds.</li>
            <li> works great for pills or other small items......i really dont think its 100% water tight but it will keep things dry....</li>
            <li> Most of the discussion and confusion here is the size.  If you are worried about the actual size, it is 2 inches high (including the tip where the tringle clip is hooked) and about 0.8 inch in diameter; or better yet check the actual size at the store.  In my case, I needed a bigger one because I have three smaller pill containers in my keychain.  I thought, why not just bring a bigger one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at the store and it looks like plastic.  But it does clink if I hit it with a metal spoon and the screw screeches like aluminum when I tighten it, so I figured it is metal.  I would know for sure if it is all scratched and worn out.  So far I have it for three weeks and it is still looks metal to me.  A rubber O-ring makes sure it is air and water tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;I put a piece of cotton inside to prevent the pills from jiggling too much and hitting the container walls and pulverizing it.</li>
            <li> Great product; makes sure my migraine meds (which I have to take as soon as I feel one coming) are always handy. This means I can leave my house with just wallet and keys, and not bring my whole purse all the time. Makes me feel a bit like a spy... except I don&#x27;t carry cyanide or sodium pentothal.</li>
            <li> Well made, and I&#x27;m glad I got it. Unfortunately it is about twice the size of a previous pill fob I had from another supplier (now out of business): the lid from my original unscrewed and was lost, so this is a replacement. I believe that this kind of thing could save a life, and that everybody should have one.</li>
            <li> I needed this for some big pills... It could carry a daily dose and was attached to a keychain.  I was hoping it would carry more than a daily dose.  But, it serves its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it was said before, but the Dollar Tree has these for a buck. Same thing. I grabbed a bunch of these and they last plenty fine for me.</li>
            <li> The name Rite-Aid should have been a clue - much bigger than anticipated, and very cheaply made - a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Love it! My husband takes an Rx that must be taken on time,  without fail. When we end up with unscheduled plans (at ER with a family member), he still needs that med. We&#x27;ve tried keeping an extra in his wallet  (gets crushed), in glove box of car  (Texas heat is brutal...we had concerns about impact on med). This product is the answer. Extra doses are always with him now,  and it&#x27;s small enough that it&#x27;s not a nuisance on his keys. I&#x27;m ordering another to keep in my purse, for when we&#x27;return not in his car.</li>
            <li> Good quality and low price</li>
            <li> Ive been using this fob for quite a while now. probably over a year. it has remained air tight and i havent had any leaks even when submerged in water. the only down side is that the outside plating is starting to crack off cause it gets banged around a lot. but all in all id recommend it</li>
            <li> Very convenient and functional.</li>
            <li> fits a ton.  not too bulky.</li>
            <li> I took the other reviews with a grain of salt when they said this thing was large, but boy they were not exaggerating. Very well constructed, and feels solid but be aware if you are only looking for something to carry one or two pills, keep looking. This one carries about a dozen standard oval pills or a full 50 or so small caplets. Good product, but a little too bulky to carry on my key chain in my pant pocket hence the 4 stars intsead of five.</li>
            <li> Must have for mobile folks taking large numbers of critical pills daily....keeps a days stash in one container for me.</li>
            <li> Well constructed; holds 15 of my prescription pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to try it for a while to see if the cap comes loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to pad your pills with cotton to keep them from rattling.</li>
            <li> I would have to say this is a little too small for all the horse pills I take, but it is large enough for the important three - vitamin, garlic, and immune booster.</li>
            <li> This pill holder is big But well made and if you take alot of pills it will work great for you good deal!!</li>
            <li> I love this Metal Pill fob. Sometimes I forget to take my medication and having it on my key chain that I put on my belt with my keys I have my medication with me all the time..Love it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to put nitroglycerin pills in. Pleasantly surprised that the original bottle fits inside just perfectly.</li>
            <li> It holds a lot of different pills safely and they do not break up in my pocket.</li>
            <li> I use it for salt. Yes salt. Its great when you forget or are at a thing and theres no salt.</li>
            <li> It is great. I can cary enough pain med&#x27;s whev ever I need them.</li>
            <li> I purchased Pill Fob Key Chain based on a recommendation of a colleague at work. When my key fob came it had a big nasty, smelly bug sealed inside.  When I opened it I was expectingly surprised by the site and the small of the large insect.  I am sure the experience was just what the juvenile who put it in there was hoping for. I have lost all enthusiasm for this product and have returned it to Amazon.com</li>
            <li> geaet item. The others I ordered were too large.&lt;br /&gt;Yis just the right size that you can carry in your pocket.</li>
            <li> Works just fine. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I was scrounging for something waterproof that could keep my micro usb on my key-chain.  Bingo.  I can fit both the micro usb and a wireless adapter with room to spare.  Super light and not terribly clunky, it isn&#x27;t tiny however.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AND HAVE IT BY MY BEDSIDE IT HOLDS A FULL BOTTLE OF NITRO, ITS AIR TIGHT AND KEEPS THE LIGHT OUT</li>
            <li> I have never taken medicine, and am now on something I need to take 3 times  a day. This is perfect size (even for the larger pills) to carry a couple with me during the workday or if we are going to be out. It&#x27;s durable, and holds together well. I often cram it in my pockets, and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> works  great for carrying my enzyme pills so that I can eat out whenever I am away from home. Previously, I never seem to remember to take pills along.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with low price and faaast shipping. Recommend!</li>
            <li> I ordered this container because I wanted to carry my daily medication when I was away from home and in a renaissance costume. I now have this attached to my keychain for use any time I leave home and it performs admirably. This is large enough that I waste about 70% of the space and may even order a smaller one.</li>
            <li> My husband found these on Amazon, and purchased 3 (one for him, one for me, and one as a spare).  I love the size of this little container.  I especially appreciate the quality screw top and the little plastic ring which keeps the pills inside it dry.  I don&#x27;t worry that this pill container will open up with the bangs and bumps of every day use.  Having \\&quot;spares\\&quot; of necessary medication, i.e. aspirin, Nitroglycerin or extra pain pills easily accessible on my keychain is terrific.  I only wish I had this pill container a few years ago when a co-worker had a heart attack at a company function.  Everyone was frantically looking for an aspirin to give him as we waited for paramedics to arrive.  Because we were unable to quickly find any aspirin stashed in our purses, we lost the chance to possibly save his life.  I still wonder if we would have been able to save our precious friend&#x27;s life had we been able to get aspirin to him as soon as his symptoms began.  This little pill container could have (literally) been a life saver.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an item like this for a while.  Now I know it is called a pill fob.  I purchased this particular item mainly because of Ezy Dose reputation.  Now I can carry low dose aspirin on my person very easily just in case.  I have not yet tested to see if it is waterproof but The seal ring looks sturdy, staying in place and the lid screws on tightly; possibly too tight for elderly persons.  I have low dose aspirin stored in these fobs.  I do hope I never need the aspirin and I am very happy with my purchase.   I have now purchased an additional two fobs for friends.</li>
            <li> The metal isn&#x27;t the top-notch aluminum container I would expect, but I get what I paid. Size is exactly what I expected. Keeps my caffeine pills for the week so I don&#x27;t have to lug around a big bottle. Small size means it&#x27;s discrete. You can hold it in your palm without people noticing it. It does make squeaky noises as it&#x27;s being opened though.</li>
            <li> This broke in less than 2 months.  It is cheap and a piece of junk.  The one I had before lasted 5 years.  Look for something better.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is as described and seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than I expected, but it does what I need.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Right size and fits on my key chain. Fits plenty of meds.  It&#x27;s not going to work for vitamins for example calcium and multivitamins are going to be a tight squeeze if you need to put a days worth.  Only con is how it screws on it can be a little tricky. X</li>
            <li> My husband carries his aspirin in this case---just in case. If a person thinks they are having a heart attack, they are to take a baby aspirin and call 911. Men need a place to carry these aspirin since they don&#x27;t have purses.  :)</li>
            <li> Very well made and good size to carry a few aspirins in my purse.  I like that it&#x27;s a screw top so there is no danger of it opening in my purse.</li>
            <li> Like most people I have to take some daily medications and I don&#x27;t like to miss taking them. When my wife and I are out I just drop the pills into this aluminum pocket pill carrier and put it into my pocket. I like that it is made of metal and that the screw on lid has an O-ring seal to keep the bottle airtight and watertight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to you can put this onto your key ring but I just prefer it in my pocket. Whether you are carrying your medicine or just a few aspirin or cold pills it is a handy item to have around and I use it whenever we are away from home. I know having this in my pocket keeps my medicine safe, dry and clean. It is well made and I have used mine for several years without any problems. It is a good product. I have posted a couple of photos that might be of use to you.</li>
            <li> These are huge! Clearly that is my fault for not reading more carefully. I was purchasing to use for Nitro tabs and this  does not appear to have a moisture barrier.  Other than that okay quality and price for a different use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this several months and it&#x27;s well built and does the job. It holds about a weeks worth of pills.</li>
            <li> Hubby uses this to carry nitro on him.  He does not take nitro frequently AT ALL, he just carries it for emergency purposes, so it was important that the nitro bottle itself, still sealed, fit in this container, rather than having to take the pills out and keep them loose which alters the integrity of the pills after time.  It does this without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is waterproof, although I haven&#x27;t tested it completely.  But there is a solid O-ring in the container to give it a good seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal is heavy duty, make the pill container strong.  I can see where this would be a detriment, and could be construed as too heavy if you can&#x27;t get used to it on your key ring.</li>
            <li> Very accurate product description.  Excellent built quality.  Holds my little bottle of Nitro (just in case) pills perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d get a larger container, but it was basically the same size as all the others on line. It is very well made. I may use it, but it is not what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to screw and unscrew the cap. EZY-Dose also make a plastic pill fob keychain which is far superior to this metal one.</li>
            <li> One can definitely find a better quality pill box for the price.  No inner lining and does not screw off smoothly.</li>
            <li> If you only need to carry a days worth of small pills or one large dose, this is great.  It is not very large, but it does hold up.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it is so lightweight, I would have preferred stainless steel or some heavier metal.  It&#x27;s a great value and does the job, so I had to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very roomy. Carries well. Exactly as described. There&#x27;s not much else to say. It&#x27;s a well designed product and meets all my expectations. Buy it if you need it.</li>
            <li> I take a multivitamin 3 times a day and was looking for something to carry them in. This worked great! good price and good quality.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping an emergency supply of prescription meds in your pocket.  The threading on the cap was a little tight at the beginning but repeated use has made it easier to put on.  I&#x27;m considering getting another for those days when I don&#x27;t want or need to carry a 7-day pill case.</li>
            <li> It is chrome colored plastic.  I had one that was made of aluminum and I was quite happy with it.  I lost it and wanted to replace it.  Unfortunately it is now chrome colored plastic and the fake metal is rubbing off in my pocket.  They should have just made it colored plastic rather prank us with this junk.</li>
            <li> Nice little keychain pill fob keeps my pills at the ready, when I need them.  Keeps items dry and it&#x27;s super lightweight so you barely notice that you&#x27;re carrying it.</li>
