            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>That also brightens my eyes and gives a more refreshed, youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>The pencil is great for women of color or when you using cheaper shadow colors to really give your eye shadows depth of color and longevity.</li>
            <li>I love the way that it goes on</li>
            <li>This white eye pencil works great!!</li>
            <li>I love how it just glides on.</li>

            <li>They go on great, spread easily and really make your eyeshadow pop.</li>

            <li>Use it as a primer under bright eyeshadow colors, really does help them pop.</li>
            <li>and so easy to apply</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It doubles as a concealer for my super-fair skin but easy does it.  </li>
            <li>It smelled strongly of chemicals, almost like spray paint.  </li>
            <li>An honest must have for anyone who&#x27;s a self-claimed make-up artist-- or even a real one!</li>
            <li>It makes the eye shadow colors more true.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it shipped rather quickly</li>
            <li>bright white as I wanted :)</li>
            <li>Now I need a sharpener that these fit...</li>
            <li>The pigment of the liner is great because it&#x27;s very creamy, easy to smudge for an extra glow to the inner eye and stays great on the waterline.</li>
            <li>Great little creamy pencils.... easy to apply and blends easily.  </li>
            <li>Work tremendously well</li>
            <li>Quick application.  </li>
            <li>It stayed on better with my Urban Decay primer underneath and eyeshadow on top.  </li>
            <li>The product came quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and easily goes on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that these pencils really make your eyeshadow pop!</li>
            <li>And for good reason - it&#x27;s a great white alternative to standard grease paint type white</li>
            <li>Upon uncapping the pencil I IMMEDIATELY noticed a distinct smell.  </li>
            <li>These are very helpful when you want to make some of your more vibrant eye color pop.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and it helps me create many modern looks</li>
            <li>definitely will be buying more â™¡</li>
            <li>There are so many different ways you can use them in your makeup application!</li>
            <li>Very pigmented!</li>
            <li>the record, I really wanted these to work!  </li>
            <li>which makes your makeup pops and last even more.</li>
            <li>and I do not feel safe wearing anything that smells like KRYLON near something as sensitive as MY EYEBALLS.  </li>
            <li>but I know for certain that I will be making this purchase again when my pencils run out.</li>
            <li>This works very well</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re unsure, they are of course available individually as well.</li>
            <li>These pencils really make your eye shadow pop.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product as described.</li>
            <li>Very creamy/smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable,</li>
            <li>My eyes felt very itchy and irritated after application</li>
            <li>I really like these pencils.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I even use it as a primer for my mineral eyeshadows and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Great base for bright eye shadows/pigments like the Urban Decay Electric palette.</li>
            <li>Great makeup base, highlighter, great for mixing with dark lipsticks to make a lighter colour.</li>
            <li>Its a large pencil which makes it ideal to use as a base for colorful eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday for work, and I have had no irritation, it allows the eye-shadow to adhere better to where I am placing it, and it allows the eye-shadow color to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Once again NYX beats out the high end, over priced competition by far.</li>
            <li>I had gotten the 3 pack for around $11, so I did save some money, but they are also quite soft so frequent use will wear them down quickly!</li>
            <li>The white really brings out the color and the consistency is sticky enough that your can really pack your shadow on.</li>
            <li>I like how the pencil is soft.</li>
            <li>But when I applied those same colors with the 640 milk color pencil over my primer people were commenting that my eyes really popped.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin-</li>
            <li>This a great base or you can use it to soften other color by blending over the top.  </li>
            <li>I think this is definitely something to think about getting for just an every day make up, but definitely if you want your colors to standout a little better and not run or mix every time you blink.</li>
            <li>They all came individually wrapped which I was surprised but not upset by, and they are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Will definitely make your colors come alive.</li>
            <li>, this is the best white eyeliner and white shadow base.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite base for true color payoff on my eyeshadows!</li>
            <li>This little triple threat is inexpensive and shipped incredibly fast!</li>
            <li>If having trouble sharpening put them in a paper towel with the lid on and in the freezer for 15 mins and then sharpen with a large pencil sharpener</li>

            <li> I like to use them as an eyeshadow base most of the time, it really makes the shadow color POP!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many variety of White pencil sticks because i use them as a base for my eye shadow to really get the colors to pop.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than expected, but it does have enough to last just as long.</li>
            <li> I wont go back to any other white pencil again.  </li>
            <li> I like it, gives you a good eye base before you apply your eye shadow on.</li>
            <li> I always have a hard time finding white eyeliner because normally its too rough or won&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes felt very strange when I put this on</li>
            <li> I also use it a little in the inner corner and under my eye.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works as expected!</li>
            <li> formula is extremely creamy for a pencil, which makes it visible on the waterline.</li>
            <li> They always let me down.</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying to my eyelids</li>
            <li> I use these as the base coat on my eyelids before doing crazy rainbow makeup and they work great to brighten all the colors</li>
            <li> To start with, Ive tried expensive Mac, Stila, and a few drug store white pencil eyeliners, which were terrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I started using this pencil as an eye primer/eyeshadow base, my only complaint was that one pencil was not enough.</li>
            <li> I always use it as my primary base for my eye makeup!</li>
            <li> I use them on eyelids over primer as a base for shadow and it really makes the colors pop.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use this over the NYX eyeshadow base in white because that formula is way too creamy/</li>
            <li> Esp for the price you cannot go wrong to use this as a primer.</li>
            <li> If worn by itself it creases/rubs off like crazy.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base for my eye shadow and as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> Like others, I watch the YouTube makeup videos and ordered these for a base before shadow and for eye brightening.  </li>
            <li> I put on my primer, the milk nyx as my base, and</li>
            <li> , I use this as a base under my eyeshadow to make colours pop</li>
            <li> This was the worst product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> THE WORST CON:  </li>

            <li> Love it, very smooth. I always have a hard time finding white eyeliner because normally its too rough or won&#x27;t show. This works very well and I don&#x27;t have to fight with it to show up, definitely will be buying more â™¡</li>
            <li> There are so many uses for NYX jumbo pencil in milk. I use it as a base for my eye shadow and as a highlighter. It&#x27;s creamy consistency allows it to glide on. It doesn&#x27;t clump, but your makeup stays in place.</li>
            <li> This product is great esp for a tan-darker skin tones because it allows for eyeshadows to pop! Esp for the price you cannot go wrong to use this as a primer. Only con is that it does create a crease but after 6+ hrs of having eyeshadow on. Otherwise, I do recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Work tremendously well definetly recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> If I could give this 0 stars I would! This was the worst product I have ever purchased. This is a cheap and poor quality. Do NOT buy.</li>
            <li> I love this pencil. I use it everyday and it really makes my eye shadow last all day. A little goes a long way. I ordered a 3 pk to share with family. This pencil just glides on your skin,very nice and creamy.</li>
            <li> Love the size. Also gave some to a friend who loves it! Purchasing the NYX Sharpener along with the pencils was a great idea. Wondering if I should stay with MAC or change to NYX - quite pleased with it!</li>
            <li> I love these.  Like others, I watch the YouTube makeup videos and ordered these for a base before shadow and for eye brightening.  Based on these, and user feedback, I have now ordered some colors - blue, lavender, lime.  I hope the colors will be as versatile and wearable as the milk.</li>
            <li> I love these jumbo milk sticks. Must set with powder, otherwise they cease and are oily. Works well with concealer and powder before adding shadows. There are so many different ways you can use them in your makeup application!</li>
            <li> When I started using this pencil as an eye primer/eyeshadow base, my only complaint was that one pencil was not enough. This little triple threat is inexpensive and shipped incredibly fast! I don&#x27;t have anyplace close to me that carries Nyx products, so I can&#x27;t compare price to in-store but I know for certain that I will be making this purchase again when my pencils run out.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I use this for every eyeshadow I have. It was smaller than expected, but it does have enough to last just as long. A tip: use your finger to apply it, because you&#x27;ll be better able to control the setting and consistency. Great as a primer!</li>
            <li> Love my eye shadow sticks</li>
            <li> Excellent! Once again NYX beats out the high end, over priced competition by far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that these pencils really make your eyeshadow pop! The white really brings out the color and the consistency is sticky enough that your can really pack your shadow on. I sometimes use this as a matte highlight in the corner of my eye as well as white liner on my lower waterline to wake my eyes up a bit. Prior to trying this, I had read some people use solely this product as an eye primer. After use I would say if you have hooded eyes (I do), I would not expect this product to keep your shadows from creasing. It&#x27;s so sticky it&#x27;s of course going to stick to itself! Out side of that, I still love these. I had gotten the 3 pack for around $11, so I did save some money, but they are also quite soft so frequent use will wear them down quickly! If you&#x27;re unsure, they are of course available individually as well.</li>
            <li> I put on my primer, the milk nyx as my base, and color stays over 9 hours. Doesn&#x27;t fade or crease. (Urban decay primer) No matter what color I use it sticks, works well with my glitter eyeshadow also.</li>
            <li> As described. The many reviews helped me settle on this. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful as a primer for eyeliner! Putting this on before your eyeliner makes it last all day. It also makes the color of your eyeliner pop and remain truer to the color as it looks on the color sample when you buy it. This is a must!</li>
            <li> Use it as a primer under bright eyeshadow colors, really does help them pop. If having trouble sharpening put them in a paper towel with the lid on and in the freezer for 15 mins and then sharpen with a large pencil sharpener and they get that perfect point everytime!</li>
            <li> I wont go back to any other white pencil again.  I have tried so many variety of White pencil sticks because i use them as a base for my eye shadow to really get the colors to pop. They always let me down. Not this one. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  It goes on nice and smooth. It wont feel like your rubbing a lava rock against your lids to try and apply some color. I think this is definitely something to think about getting for just an every day make up, but definitely if you want your colors to standout a little better and not run or mix every time you blink.</li>
            <li> Great makeup base, highlighter, great for mixing with dark lipsticks to make a lighter colour. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing this product intensify the eye shawdow. I WOULD DEFINTELY RECOMMEND TO MY FRIENDS. VERY EFFECTIVE PRODUCT. EVERY WOMEN MUST HAVE</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. The pigment of the liner is great because it&#x27;s very creamy, easy to smudge for an extra glow to the inner eye and stays great on the waterline. I would recommand this to everyone I know!!</li>
            <li> Works as expected! Now I need a sharpener that these fit...</li>
            <li> I use these as the base coat on my eyelids before doing crazy rainbow makeup and they work great to brighten all the colors</li>
            <li> The creamy white color goes on strong and is perfect for making any color lighter, or pop more. An honest must have for anyone who&#x27;s a self-claimed make-up artist-- or even a real one!</li>
            <li> They all came individually wrapped which I was surprised but not upset by, and they are exactly what I expected. I like the price and quality of the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> These pencils really make your eye shadow pop. Iove them now.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it shipped rather quickly</li>
            <li> great price&lt;br /&gt;creamy and so easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;very bright white as I wanted :)</li>
            <li> Great base for bright eye shadows/pigments like the Urban Decay Electric palette. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> A must have in your makeup collection. Especially if you like your shadows to pop.. nyx jumbo milk pencil. Will definitely make your colors come alive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because a YouTube poster uses it as a primer for their eye makeup. It is very creamy and easily goes on. It makes the eye shadow colors more true. Keep in mind, though, add eye shadow to get deeper colors. I like it, like it, like it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I like how the pencil is soft.</li>
            <li> great item and fast post, I use this as a base under my eyeshadow to make colours pop im really happy</li>
            <li> Excellent eye pencils. Very pigmented!</li>
            <li> They arrived in good condition and I like them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this stuff. I always use it as my primary base for my eye makeup!</li>
            <li> And for good reason - it&#x27;s a great white alternative to standard grease paint type white face paint.  Smooth on with a triangle sponge, set w translucent powder, good to go.</li>
            <li> Use under eyeshadow. Works great!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as described.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t see the point of this eye pencil! It doesn&#x27;t look well anywhere I have tried it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product,,,I use this to enhance my eye shadow color...will be purchasing again</li>
            <li> PROS: No animal testing!  Lovely packaging.  Easy to hold. Very creamy/smooth.  No tugging.  Quick application.  Makes eyeshadow &amp;#34;pop.&amp;#34;  Very affordable, (but you get what you pay for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The color almost disappeared when I attempted to blend it out.  If worn by itself it creases/rubs off like crazy. It stayed on better with my Urban Decay primer underneath and eyeshadow on top.  I have semi-hooded eyelids and creases were showing up after an hour or so, even with powder on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And THE WORST CON:  THE SMELL.  Upon uncapping the pencil I IMMEDIATELY noticed a distinct smell.  It smelled strongly of chemicals, almost like spray paint.  The skin around my eyes felt very strange when I put this on and I do not feel safe wearing anything that smells like KRYLON near something as sensitive as MY EYEBALLS.  My eyes felt very itchy and irritated after application and I washed it all off.  FURTHERMORE: THEY CONTAIN PARABENS &#x3D; NO BUENO.&lt;br /&gt;Also: MADE IN TAIWAN (CHINA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the smell ALONE I do NOT recommend these to ANYONE.  Hence the 1 star rating.  This is the last time I put anything this toxic on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I really wanted these to work!  They seemed so perfect! ;_;</li>
            <li> LOVE it!! I bought the 3-pack and gave one pencil to my mom and one to my cousin&#x27;s wife.  Like me, they now use this as a primer before using eye-shadow. I use it everyday for work, and I have had no irritation, it allows the eye-shadow to adhere better to where I am placing it, and it allows the eye-shadow color to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;. I LOVE this product. I will never wear eye-shadow again without this as my base/primer. I have also used this Milk pencil to line my inner bottom eye (inside the lash line). After applying, I &amp;#34;tap it out&amp;#34; so it is not so bright, and it truly brightens my eyes, giving a refreshed appearance.  I also use it to line underneath the contour of my entire eyebrow, before applying my brow-shadow.  That also brightens my eyes and gives a more refreshed, youthful appearance. I will always have this product in my make-up case from now on, and I will continue to recommend it to family and friends.  LOVE!!</li>
            <li> This a great base or you can use it to soften other color by blending over the top.  I am a professional makeup artist and it helps me create many modern looks</li>
            <li> Love these pencils! Beat value too buying the pack of three! I like to use them as an eyeshadow base most of the time, it really makes the shadow color POP! But as an eyeliner or highlighter they work great too!</li>
            <li> To start with, Ive tried expensive Mac, Stila, and a few drug store white pencil eyeliners, which were terrible.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is extremely creamy for a pencil, which makes it visible on the waterline. Its a large pencil which makes it ideal to use as a base for colorful eyeshadows. I prefer to use this over the NYX eyeshadow base in white because that formula is way too creamy/wont set.&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, this is the best white eyeliner and white shadow base.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite base for true color payoff on my eyeshadows! This 3pack is a great deal for anyone looking to buy them</li>
            <li> I like it, gives you a good eye base before you apply your eye shadow on. which makes your makeup pops and last even more.</li>
            <li> Great eye shadow base.  I also use it a little in the inner corner and under my eye.  It doubles as a concealer for my super-fair skin but easy does it.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I really like these pencils. They go on great, spread easily and really make your eyeshadow pop. I applied my eyeshadow without the pencil and it looked good. But when I applied those same colors with the 640 milk color pencil over my primer people were commenting that my eyes really popped. The pencil is great for women of color or when you using cheaper shadow colors to really give your eye shadows depth of color and longevity.</li>
            <li> this pencil is amazing I love the way that it goes on and it smooths out really easy love it very good product and fast shipping thank you so much</li>
            <li> great amount for the price. fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These are very helpful when you want to make some of your more vibrant eye color pop.  I even use it as a primer for my mineral eyeshadows and it works very well.  It can be a little drying to my eyelids however- I have sensitive skin- so I don&#x27;t use it daily.  Overall I like the product.</li>
            <li> Product: This white eye pencil works great!! I love how it just glides on. Seller: The product came quickly. I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great little creamy pencils.... easy to apply and blends easily.  I use them on eyelids over primer as a base for shadow and it really makes the colors pop.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with having to reapply if I apply over a primer and use urban decay &amp;#34;all-nighter&amp;#34; setting spray.  Ive known some to use this as a lid primer but I haven&#x27;t done that.</li>
