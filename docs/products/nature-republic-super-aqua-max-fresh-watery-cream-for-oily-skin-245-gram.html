            <li>and I must say it is THE best moisturizer for oily skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed</li>
            <li>It suites me perfectly!</li>
            <li>Feeling and smelling both are really awesome.</li>
            <li>*GREAT FOR PEOPLE WITH OILY/COMBINATION SKIN**&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>it has a great</li>
            <li>Great smell</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s amazing when you put it on.</li>
            <li>Visiting Korea we liked this product and it&#x27;s great to see it is available on amazon since we have not found this product in Chicago stores.</li>
            <li>This product has the best smell--clean and fresh, comes in a lovely glass jar with a spatula, and goes on smooth and lucious on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Very light, non greasy yet moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>my skin wasn&#x27;t extra oily and felt great and moisturized!</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel comfortable!</li>
            <li>We kept hearing about the magical skin care over there.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>i was in korea and wanted to test this product before i bought more.</li>
            <li>I even wore it as a day cream today and it was lovely.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice and light.  </li>
            <li>its okay</li>
            <li>First the good</li>
            <li>Its scent is nice, is like smelling flowers, is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I also got a bunch of cool samples from the seller, will buy from them again!</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely oily, This has been a best cream I have tasted to control the oiliness.</li>
            <li>It could have easily been opened and modified, so I feel unsafe using the cream.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised as it was incredibly light but made my skin feel very nice.</li>
            <li>but I do see it has seaweed which I am thankfully not allergic to because I bet that is why it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more especially for this summer as it has cooling properties that I’m sure will feel awesome on my feet!</li>
            <li>cool to the touch, not sticky, refreshing on the skin, quick to absorb.</li>
            <li>: A nice flower smell that fades after 20 min( smells almost like oil of olay), makes your skin very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>not disappointed with this purchase&lt;</li>
            <li>and this is a nice addition as I begin delving into the wild world of Korean skincare.</li>
            <li>Super perfumey.  </li>
            <li>I love love this product, and wish they had an accompanying facial wash and toner!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes me smile.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the first moisturiser I&#x27;ve ever used that does not break me out and that my skin slurps right up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not goopy, smells really good and has a mattifying effect without feeling tight.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I came here to learn more about the product because the English site is not loading on my iPad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice and hot this summer, but I was sent the pink one.</li>
            <li>the jar is pretty and made of glass.  </li>
            <li>Check the ingredients carefully to make sure you have no allergies, other than that I feel it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Nice hydration for other parts of the body though</li>
            <li>/&gt;It felt very creamy at first but after applying it to my face</li>
            <li>It much here</li>
            <li>My skin was totally oil free all day today.......</li>
            <li>but it kind of leave my face stiff after wards</li>
            <li>It feels a little unusual at first, but it soaks in quickly and leaves an almost powdery or velvety finish.</li>
            <li>I finally found the right product for my skin.</li>
            <li>and she loves it too, no effects even though she has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Soooo, I ordered the blue cream as I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Makes my feet so soft.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Really helps my skin being watery enough and not oily anymore.</li>
            <li>Not a clean, fresh smell.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> , I still adore it, it sinks right in, isn&#x27;t in the least bit greasy, and actually matifies the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely come back to get other one.</li>
            <li> The texture is between a gel and a cream, it comes with a little clear spatula and</li>

            <li> I have the oiliest skin of anyone I&#x27;ve ever known, to the point where any moisturiser I have ever tried just lays on my skin, doesn&#x27;t sink in, and turns me into a greasy, pimply mess.</li>

            <li> Now the bad: unfortunately, my face began to swell a little, I found out I have a mild allergy to seaweed(main ingredient)</li>
            <li> I think this product is a keeper at least through summer.</li>
            <li> It made me feel like I must be rubbing a lot of unnecessary chemicals on my face for it to be that pungent.  </li>
            <li> Returned, sadly.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> There is product all over the inside of the lid and worst of all it&#x27;s supposed to come with a spatula and didn&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

            <li> I have the oiliest skin of anyone I&#x27;ve ever known, to the point where any moisturiser I have ever tried just lays on my skin, doesn&#x27;t sink in, and turns me into a greasy, pimply mess. This stuff is the first moisturiser I&#x27;ve ever used that does not break me out and that my skin slurps right up. In fact, it seems to have a somewhat mattifying effect. If you have extremely oily, acne-prone skin I cannot recommend this enough!</li>
            <li> cool to the touch, not sticky, refreshing on the skin, quick to absorb.</li>
            <li> **GREAT FOR PEOPLE WITH OILY/COMBINATION SKIN**&lt;br /&gt;Was not disappointed with this purchase&lt;br /&gt;It felt very creamy at first but after applying it to my face I realized there wasn&#x27;t any extra greasel my skin wasn&#x27;t extra oily and felt great and moisturized! Rather inexpensive for the amount and quality of the product as well. Definitely recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> Super perfumey.  It made me feel like I must be rubbing a lot of unnecessary chemicals on my face for it to be that pungent.  Returned, sadly.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It made my skin feel comfortable!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. It smells very strange to me. Not a clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed! I finally got this and it looks like someone beat the box all to hell and when I took it out of the box and opened the lid it looks like it&#x27;s already been used! Gross! There is product all over the inside of the lid and worst of all it&#x27;s supposed to come with a spatula and didn&#x27;t!!! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the name: watery cream. It makes me smile. It&#x27;s so perfect. Americans would describe it as a whipped gel. Whatever the name it has a great constituency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine brought it over from Seoul. We kept hearing about the magical skin care over there. She was told this is for oily skin. I love it. It&#x27;s not goopy, smells really good and has a mattifying effect without feeling tight. It smells pricey, when I opened it, I was like OMG what did she spend?  I came here to learn more about the product because the English site is not loading on my iPad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is. It much here but I do see it has seaweed which I am thankfully not allergic to because I bet that is why it feels so smooth. Sea weed can feel slimy but mixed with other ingredients I can see where it could feel heavenly.  I think this product is a keeper at least through summer. I will try the combination or even the moisturizing cream in the winter.</li>
            <li> Visiting Korea we liked this product and it&#x27;s great to see it is available on amazon since we have not found this product in Chicago stores.</li>
            <li> Used to use an Avon face creme like this, they discontinued it.  Bought this while in Korea--LOVE it!  Glad I found it at Amazon.  Got it faster than expected YES, will buy again.</li>
            <li> i was in korea and wanted to test this product before i bought more. note: i have oily skin. i put this on my face before i went to sleep, usually by next morning my face would already be oily. i noticed that my face wasn&#x27;t oily and when i touch my face no oil either. my brother even noticed that my face wasn&#x27;t oily. I HAVE FOUND THE PRODUCT FOR ME!! i have been repurchasing this ever since.</li>
            <li> This product has the best smell--clean and fresh, comes in a lovely glass jar with a spatula, and goes on smooth and lucious on the skin.  I used it at night only once, and must say it does work to control oil.  My skin was totally oil free all day today.......I must say again....I love love this product, and wish they had an accompanying facial wash and toner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been 2 months since I have used this product and I must say it is THE best moisturizer for oily skin I have ever used! Great smell, I still adore it, it sinks right in, isn&#x27;t in the least bit greasy, and actually matifies the skin. I would re-purchase this without a doubt!</li>
            <li> Soooo, I ordered the blue cream as I have very oily skin and it&#x27;s nice and hot this summer, but I was sent the pink one. I was about to return it when I figured I&#x27;d give it a go as a night cream or give it to my mom. I was pleasantly surprised as it was incredibly light but made my skin feel very nice. I even wore it as a day cream today and it was lovely.  The texture is between a gel and a cream, it comes with a little clear spatula and the jar is pretty and made of glass.  The scent is nice and light.  But it&#x27;s amazing when you put it on. It feels a little unusual at first, but it soaks in quickly and leaves an almost powdery or velvety finish. My skin is hydrated and I didn&#x27;t turn into an oil slick at all. I&#x27;m very impressed and this is a nice addition as I begin delving into the wild world of Korean skincare.</li>
            <li> I actually got this about 4 days ago and have been using it every night since. First the good: A nice flower smell that fades after 20 min( smells almost like oil of olay), makes your skin very soft and smooth.  Now the bad: unfortunately, my face began to swell a little, I found out I have a mild allergy to seaweed(main ingredient) so, I use it as a hand/foot cream with no problems. Makes my feet so soft. Check the ingredients carefully to make sure you have no allergies, other than that I feel it is a good product. I let my mother use some and she loves it too, no effects even though she has very sensitive skin. I will definitely buy more especially for this summer as it has cooling properties that I’m sure will feel awesome on my feet!</li>
            <li> I think the scent of this makes me break out. Nice hydration for other parts of the body though, I use it for hands/legs now.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes well but it kind of leave my face stiff after wards&lt;br /&gt;if i put i second coat over my face its okay</li>
            <li> Wow. I finally found the right product for my skin. It suites me perfectly! Really helps my skin being watery enough and not oily anymore. Feeling and smelling both are really awesome. Yeah. I&#x27;ll definitely come back to get other one.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the product, it was in an unsealed paper box and inside there was no cover seal. It could have easily been opened and modified, so I feel unsafe using the cream. Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of the H2O+ Oasis lotion.  Very light, non greasy yet moisturizing.  Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price of under $15 for 2oz of product.  I have oily skin and this suits me.  I also got a bunch of cool samples from the seller, will buy from them again!</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely oily, This has been a best cream I have tasted to control the oiliness. Its scent is nice, is like smelling flowers, is light and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
