            <li>This is an amazing product by Sigma Beaty.</li>
            <li>This brush up holder is amazing.  </li>
            <li>it came quicker then promised which is nice</li>
            <li>I will create some kind of a stand to place in the bottom of it to raise the height of my brushes.</li>
            <li>The oval design is a nice feature - fits well in my drawer.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality case.</li>
            <li>The snaps sometimes come apart on their own.</li>

            <li>Use to keep my brushes clean and nice, works great.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li>I am very happy I decided to purchase this with my new brushes!</li>
            <li>The great thing is that you can close it so your brushes stay clean from dust.</li>
            <li>I received my order very quickly which was great for me since I was going on vacation and looked forward to packing my brushes in the lovely Sigma Cup Holder.</li>
            <li>I know that when I accumulate more brushes I will be purchasing more of these cups!</li>
            <li>Seller was professional, excellent communication and service.  </li>
            <li>The quailty is wonderful and the sleek black holder looks great on my make up table.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect product that wants to have easy access on their bathroom counter and all close snap and go without any worry of your brushes.</li>
            <li>I find it now easy to travel with my makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>I love love love this!</li>
            <li>I traveled with it for the first time this Christmas, and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Not only is it great for travel, its a trendy way to store all of your brushes in one place!</li>
            <li>u can fit many brushes and can place the holder just about anywhere (office..bathroom..room!)</li>
            <li>Arrived in perfect condition and super fast.</li>
            <li>But for the most part fits my essentials:</li>
            <li>I like that you have two holders in one which makes it more convenient.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This brush cups holds them (even with the top on)</li>
            <li>and when I travel I will use the top to hold my brushes inside the cup and keep them protected in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a person who hates clutter and when you don&#x27;t have space for everything you love, you become creative.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this cute and stylish brush case.</li>
            <li>I have heard so many reviews on this brush cup holder that I just had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I love how all my brushes (about 25 brushes) fit in this holder with no problem!</li>
            <li>As I kept searching for the perfect brush holder, I began to think that perhaps no such holder existed.</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I thought about the roll up case but went against it since I wanted to be able to view and grab any brush at a glance.  </li>
            <li>You can pack your cosmetic bag and literally just throw this in your suitcase, very study and looks great too.</li>
            <li>I Love this.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for keeping your brushes from collecting dust and brushing that dust back on your face.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I made this purchase because for the price it was just what I needed.</li>
            <li>Overall great buy!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this brush holder.</li>
            <li>wish they had more colors of just the holder, rather than having to buy another set of brushes to get another color holder.</li>
            <li>Love my Sigma Brush holder.</li>
            <li>or you can use each side as one holder, depending on how many brushes you have.</li>
            <li>Heading over to the container store to find something better and cheaper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and recommend it to all the make-up lovers out there.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like an oval shape which doesn&#x27;t allow it to put more brushes I wanted something that fits all my brushes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>love, love, love</li>
            <li>I love the cup holder</li>
            <li>Love, love, love Sigma brushes too.</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because I have seen many make up tutorials that use these brushes.</li>
            <li>Love how the holder snaps into two halves to display brushes on vanity.</li>
            <li>I love the sizing and all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s challenging because it shifts the bristles.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the Sigma Brush Cup Holder because it makes storaging your brushes easy as well as the transition of being able to use your brushes at home and for traveling so conveient.</li>
            <li>This brush cup holder is very elegant  and useful.  </li>
            <li>Dust free and easy to travel with!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend $25 on a brush case but thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it&#x27;s so easy to return purchases bought on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is easily one of my top purchases with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The case looks nice, came quickly and does the job</li>
            <li>Plus I have two holders for the price of one, and lets not forget...keeps your brushes clean when traveling!</li>
            <li>Keeps my brushes clean and organized!</li>
            <li>This was my first Sigma purchase and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>, It is practical and can fit all my most used brushes in it.</li>
            <li>most so I can&#x27;t fit all of my brush into the cup.</li>
            <li>so I could fit more brushes.</li>
            <li>At home I have my brushes in a cup for easy access and when I travel I use to put my brushes in a brush bag and have to dig through them in the hotel bathroom.</li>
            <li>It allows for easy access to the brushes while applying makeup.</li>
            <li>In the youtube tutorials I watched all the brushes seemed to be easily identified while in the case.</li>
            <li>but this holds 15-20 easy.</li>
            <li>It makes traveling with your makeup brushes easy.</li>
            <li>but the smell of the can is so strong</li>
            <li>Opens easily and closes securely with snap on buttons on both sides.</li>
            <li>Product shape is oblong so can fit into spaces easily.</li>
            <li>perfect for all my black brushes and traveling ....</li>
            <li>Pretty sturdy and elegant I really love it</li>
            <li>It arrived in 2-3 days after purchase (thanks Amazon Prime) and I love it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit all my brushes, but I do have a lot.  </li>
            <li>When I travel, I just remove the brushes that can&#x27;t fit and put it somewhere else.  </li>
            <li>The Sigma Brush Cup Holder is GREAT for travel especially if there is a lot of off-site makeup applications.  </li>
            <li>If you only plan to use it as brush holders (not having to use the locks), then this product is great.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous looking brush holder that is conveniently functional.</li>
            <li>It is nice looking and seems to be very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I can fit over 20 brushes in this cup.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to store you make-up brushes and being that I have two different sets.</li>
            <li>So this sits on my bathroom vanity with my brushes inside and available as needed.</li>
            <li>An overall great brush holder.</li>
            <li>It can fit alot of eye brushes, but if you are planning to store face brushes, it&#x27;s not that roomy.</li>
            <li>I can keep by brushes free of dust and moisture when they&#x27;re not in use.</li>
            <li>i would definitely recommend this to all, great buy.</li>
            <li>It definitely won&#x27;t fit in any of your cosmetic bags</li>
            <li>but there is no way you can fit 15-20 brushes in it and have the case close.  </li>
            <li>It is in beautiful black leather and has a snap on top, just in case you need to pack it into a suitcase or you accidentally drop it from your bathroom shelf.  </li>
            <li>high quality all the way!The Brush Cup Holder is an innovative and functional container that turns into two brush holders!</li>
            <li>It will be very useful for traveling.</li>
            <li>Very useful case.</li>
            <li>This brush holder is not only functional but looks very nice as well.</li>
            <li>It protects fairly well and can be used as a cup (s) when opened to hold the items when not closed for travel.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to bring this around.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to buy this holder.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my products so far.</li>
            <li>I love this thing so much helps me not think about my brushes losing their shape!</li>
            <li>I have to many large brushes, so can&#x27;t fit them all in.</li>
            <li>great buy, and a great way to protect those expensive makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>It also keeps them clean and it&#x27;s not just one cup holder...</li>
            <li>I love that your able to purchase this seperately so you don&#x27;t have to get it with the complete brush set.</li>
            <li>Good product, and it keeps my brushes organized and clean, although I wish it comes in a larger size so that it could hold all my brush collections.</li>
            <li>Product could be lighter in weight but overall good quality material used.</li>
            <li>really couldn&#x27;t ask for more out of a brush cup.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this brush cup holder to 1) have a good quality place for my brushes and</li>
            <li>I really want to love this however</li>
            <li>I wanted a brush holder that would protect my full sized brushes from collecting dust while they were being displayed on my vanity.</li>
            <li>fits my full sized brushes so well.  </li>
            <li>The shape is very comfy, my brushes are safe from dust and damages, that&#x27;s all i need.  </li>
            <li>Love it and the snap buttons are very stong and won&#x27;t unsnap if I travel.</li>
            <li>It will stand on my vanity and look classy and nice.</li>
            <li>The craftsmanship of this bush cup holder is fabulous &amp; worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I usually put in my Sigma F80, Sigma F10, a HUGE powder brush from real techniques, a brow brush and a gel eyeliner brush, and it fits it all perfectly!</li>
            <li>Great to travel with and use it as cup holderâ€¦very roomy, both tall and wide!</li>
            <li>Its also easy to pack and  very travel friendly.</li>
            <li>Product appears to be fine when I first received it.</li>
            <li>day to day I leave the top off and it holds all of my brushes (if I had more brushes I could use both ends for daily storage)</li>
            <li>At first I wondered why the package was so huge.</li>
            <li>So super useful for travelling.</li>
            <li>Very usefull in traveling and even make my life easy to choose and see my brushes i recomend it .</li>
            <li>It fits about 10 of my brushes easily and is very durable.</li>
            <li>The Sigma brush holder was literally the ONLY brush holder I was able to find that would fit FULL sized brushes.</li>
            <li>Not only does it come with two cups, it fits so many brushes!</li>
            <li>It is easy to open &amp; close and looks even better in person than in the picture.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I could fit anymore large brushes in it though.</li>
            <li>This case is so nice that I bought a second one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>However, this is such a nice looking case that I have even had compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>Was much larger than I expected, however I am very happy that it is.</li>
            <li>This holder definitely worth to buy it.</li>
            <li>I rarely leave feedback but this product deserves one.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it since I was never going to use this thing.  </li>
            <li>but I was only able to fit like 4.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The cup have a nice weight to it, so it will not fall down easily.</li>
            <li>It looks chic and stylish and much better than a makeup bag or other holders.</li>
            <li>This brush holder is very user friendly and will keep your brushes well stored and organized</li>
            <li>Put my brushes in it right away</li>
            <li>I also received the cup holder and it is just the right size.</li>
            <li>These fit all of my brushes - this cup in particular</li>
            <li>I searched the Internet &amp; many online stores for such a brush holder, however, what I mostly found were travel sized cup holders that would only fit compact sized brushes.</li>
            <li>It actually looks like real leather and will keep my brushes clean and safe between uses.</li>
            <li>I really liked it but the locks seem to be loose.  </li>
            <li>As well as shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, it is exactly what is shows on the picture!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality is excellent and worth spending a bit extra to have a hard brush case versus a brush roll, which doesn&#x27;t protect the brushes as well.</li>
            <li>my big brushes inside of the top part.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product and look forward to buy more products from this seller.</li>
            <li>Not too many big brushes like powder brushes can be stored in it though.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>The smaller brush holders could hardly fit my full sized powder brush.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for to hold brushes at home and for traveling, will not leave home without it...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Then I just pop the top back on</li>
            <li>They hold a lot of brushes and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks again, Sigma!</li>
            <li>For travel, just put the brushes into one cup and close the other top, and your brushes are fully protected from dust and damage during any packing/moving!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 stars because it makes my life much easier!</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the holder it is sturdy, however when I try to put some of my larger brushes in the holder</li>
            <li>It is very practical, the brushes are kept safe and as soon as you open the cup the brushes are ready to use!               </li>
            <li>Product has a flat surface on both ends, so able to stand on either cup so can can be used as a brush carrier as well as 2 brush holders.</li>
            <li>it holds many brushes and easy to use, it can hold my 12pcs complete brushes and still has room for 2 or 3 other brushes, but i guess it&#x27;s heavier than brushes roll</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It comes apart into 2 separate cups for every day use and then snaps back together for easy storage and travel.</li>
            <li>The snaps on each side are easy to open and snap shut.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched so long for a good brush case and finally I found it.</li>
            <li>- I have 14 - three are large.  </li>
            <li>It is large, but it can be on the go if you are traveling with luggage.</li>
            <li>foundation brush (real tech), blush brush (sonia kashuk), bronzer brush (sonia kashuk), large powder brush (ecotools), eyebrow brush, spoolie, 2-3 eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>it is much nicer in person..bigger in person and will hold a lot of brushes..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable for traveling or using at home.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of faux leather that is very durable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!.</li>
            <li>WAY better quality than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>But since I don&#x27;t need to, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Its very durable and looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need to buy two, as one would hold all my brushes.</li>
            <li>Thanks goodness</li>
            <li>Thanks Sigma Beauty.</li>
            <li>I like to keep the top off and use as a brush holder but might be too massive and heavy to travel light with!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>All my brushes fit using both cups, but for travel, I needed to buy a second holder so the bristles wouldn&#x27;t get smooshed together.</li>
            <li>Very well-made and protective case.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>Makes my life much easier.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to purchase them</li>
            <li>I look forward to purchasing more in the near future.  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to ordering more in the near future!!</li>
            <li>Wish it came in other colors &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and as I use them I put them back in the original side.</li>
            <li>The only downside it that I also love sigma&#x27;s brushes and own quiet a few.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product review that I ever written on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this product at first but after contemplating it for a good three months, I decided to order it.</li>
            <li>I normally use a brush roll, but I prefer this, because I can keep my brushes protected in my bag, but when I&#x27;m ready to use them, they&#x27;re convenient in the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had liked Brush rolls in the past but it can be a hassle because brushes always tend to fallen out.</li>
            <li>since all young girls to mature women love their various makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>Very nice, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t fit my entire sigma set, which consists of 18 brushes.</li>
            <li>Way better than the typical bag or roll up.</li>
            <li>I Love my black brush cup....</li>
            <li>I got this for my sister, she loves it, the only thing is that she will wish that will hold more big brushes.</li>
            <li>Now I use the top to hold big brushes, and the bottom to hold eye shadow brushes, I just can&#x27;t close it, have to leave it open in order to hold all my 10 brushes.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when this came the other day!</li>
            <li>only reason why I would rate is four stars is the high price (especially with shipping) also the fact that you don&#x27;t know what side of top and what side is bottom.</li>
            <li>The Sigma brush holder is well designed &amp; high quality.</li>
            <li>High quality and well made.</li>
            <li>After doing a bit of research, I was surprised that there were so few products that could cover the brushes to keep them free from dust and be tall enough for most brushes.  </li>
            <li>Will highly recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>This is very durable and seems like it&#x27;s easy to wipe down.</li>
            <li>It has an oval shape and is a little more than 3 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>It does hold some regular size brushes as well, so I replaced some of the ones included in the set which I didn&#x27;t find useful.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to ruin my new brushes</li>
            <li>For instance, the face brush from Real Techniques would be too big in diameter and take up much of the space inside.</li>
            <li>But overall a fabulous sigma product and I look forward to purchasing from them in the future!</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that only 4 of my brushes fit the holder looks like it&#x27;s circle</li>
            <li>Very professional looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very professional looking and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I got this for my new sigma brushes, I had to turn some brushes upside down to fit ,</li>
            <li>The product is very sturdy, deep and wide; it can fit a lot of brushes.  </li>
            <li>When at home, I just separate the top and bottom of the make-up brush holder and put my small brushes inside of the bottom part and</li>
            <li>I was expecting to hold all of my powder brushes, blush brushes, eye shadow brushes and be able to close it so that I can bring it while traveling , but found out it only hold couple of big brushes and numerous eye shadow brushes if I try to close the holder.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough to hold many brushes (small and / or large) and I received the package right away.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this product was how BIG it is!</li>
            <li>Second, if you fill this with any med-large face brushes, the bristles get bent down when you put the top on.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a much smaller container; I don&#x27;t know why as I read the size but for travel I didn&#x27;t expect this large a container.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a brush holder that will fit taller brushes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a normal woman, not a makeup artist or anything, but even my small brush collection couldn&#x27;t fit into this.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I have much shorter brushes then the actual Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>It also holds all of your basic make-up brushes very well.</li>
            <li>It will fit my tall brushes and quit a few.</li>
            <li>but really didn&#x27;t realize how big it was until I got it.  </li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t justify the price since the smaller one comes with makeup brushes (which I really don&#x27;t need) and they charge $65+ for it.</li>
            <li>they add so much precision to my daily makeup wear</li>
            <li>Cuz my brushes are pretty long!  </li>
            <li>The Sigma brush holder is 9.5 inches tall, while other brush holders of similar style are typically only about 4.5 inches tall at the most.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t lock tightly thus, it can open easily which defeats the purpose if you want to bring it for travel.  </li>
            <li>I expected to get a next regular brush holder, but finally i got that totally satisfied me.</li>
            <li>I got this to help de-clutter and organize my small condo, I fit 80% of my makeup in the two cups.</li>
            <li>We spend so much money buying nice brushes and they have them get squished or dirty.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold that many brushes.</li>
            <li>However, you can only fit a few brushes without smashing the shape of the heads.</li>
            <li>Trying to get all the brushes out of the way to get the lid on was impossible and was catching on the brush bristles - exactly what I was trying to avoid.  </li>
            <li>Not really that practical, two large for traveling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and tall enough to hold all of long brushes and wide enough to ensure that ALL of my brushes are contained in one easy cup.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see that the holder is much larger than I had pictured it to be.</li>
            <li>The brush cup holder is pretty big, with the dimensions being roughly about 9.5 in x 3.5 in x 2.75 in (24 cm</li>
            <li>I have purchased a few Sigma producta over the past 6 months, loving each one.  </li>
            <li>It keeps them secure since the cup is thick and durable.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it is difficult to close the brush holder over top of brushes, and at times, the top crushes and smooshes brushes, damaging bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is made of real leather and is extremely sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty heavy though, but the quality is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting a much slimmer one that would hold like 10 brushes in each half if u used them like cups..</li>

            <li> The great thing is that you can close it so your brushes stay clean from dust.</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly which was great for me since I was going on vacation and looked forward to packing my brushes in the lovely Sigma Cup Holder.</li>
            <li> I know that when I accumulate more brushes I will be purchasing more of these cups!</li>
            <li> Seller was professional, excellent communication and service.  </li>
            <li> The quailty is wonderful and the sleek black holder looks great on my make up table.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect product that wants to have easy access on their bathroom counter and all close snap and go without any worry of your brushes.</li>
            <li> I find it now easy to travel with my makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> I love love love this!</li>
            <li> I traveled with it for the first time this Christmas, and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Not only is it great for travel, its a trendy way to store all of your brushes in one place!</li>
            <li> u can fit many brushes and can place the holder just about anywhere (office..bathroom..room!)</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition and super fast.</li>
            <li> But for the most part fits my essentials:</li>
            <li> I like that you have two holders in one which makes it more convenient.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This brush cups holds them (even with the top on)</li>
            <li> and when I travel I will use the top to hold my brushes inside the cup and keep them protected in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who hates clutter and when you don&#x27;t have space for everything you love, you become creative.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this cute and stylish brush case.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many reviews on this brush cup holder that I just had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I love how all my brushes (about 25 brushes) fit in this holder with no problem!</li>
            <li> As I kept searching for the perfect brush holder, I began to think that perhaps no such holder existed.</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> I thought about the roll up case but went against it since I wanted to be able to view and grab any brush at a glance.  </li>
            <li> You can pack your cosmetic bag and literally just throw this in your suitcase, very study and looks great too.</li>
            <li> I Love this.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for keeping your brushes from collecting dust and brushing that dust back on your face.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I made this purchase because for the price it was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush holder.</li>
            <li> wish they had more colors of just the holder, rather than having to buy another set of brushes to get another color holder.</li>
            <li> Love my Sigma Brush holder.</li>
            <li> or you can use each side as one holder, depending on how many brushes you have.</li>
            <li> Heading over to the container store to find something better and cheaper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and recommend it to all the make-up lovers out there.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like an oval shape which doesn&#x27;t allow it to put more brushes I wanted something that fits all my brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> love, love, love</li>
            <li> I love the cup holder</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Sigma brushes too.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I have seen many make up tutorials that use these brushes.</li>
            <li> Love how the holder snaps into two halves to display brushes on vanity.</li>
            <li> I love the sizing and all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s challenging because it shifts the bristles.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love the Sigma Brush Cup Holder because it makes storaging your brushes easy as well as the transition of being able to use your brushes at home and for traveling so conveient.</li>
            <li> This brush cup holder is very elegant  and useful.  </li>
            <li> Dust free and easy to travel with!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend $25 on a brush case but thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it&#x27;s so easy to return purchases bought on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is easily one of my top purchases with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The case looks nice, came quickly and does the job</li>
            <li> Plus I have two holders for the price of one, and lets not forget...keeps your brushes clean when traveling!</li>
            <li> Keeps my brushes clean and organized!</li>
            <li> This was my first Sigma purchase and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> , It is practical and can fit all my most used brushes in it.</li>
            <li> most so I can&#x27;t fit all of my brush into the cup.</li>
            <li> so I could fit more brushes.</li>
            <li> At home I have my brushes in a cup for easy access and when I travel I use to put my brushes in a brush bag and have to dig through them in the hotel bathroom.</li>
            <li> It allows for easy access to the brushes while applying makeup.</li>
            <li> In the youtube tutorials I watched all the brushes seemed to be easily identified while in the case.</li>
            <li> but this holds 15-20 easy.</li>
            <li> It makes traveling with your makeup brushes easy.</li>
            <li> but the smell of the can is so strong</li>
            <li> Opens easily and closes securely with snap on buttons on both sides.</li>
            <li> Product shape is oblong so can fit into spaces easily.</li>
            <li> perfect for all my black brushes and traveling ....</li>
            <li> Pretty sturdy and elegant I really love it</li>
            <li> It arrived in 2-3 days after purchase (thanks Amazon Prime) and I love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit all my brushes, but I do have a lot.  </li>
            <li> When I travel, I just remove the brushes that can&#x27;t fit and put it somewhere else.  </li>
            <li> The Sigma Brush Cup Holder is GREAT for travel especially if there is a lot of off-site makeup applications.  </li>
            <li> If you only plan to use it as brush holders (not having to use the locks), then this product is great.  </li>
            <li> This is a fabulous looking brush holder that is conveniently functional.</li>
            <li> It is nice looking and seems to be very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I can fit over 20 brushes in this cup.  </li>
            <li> This is a great way to store you make-up brushes and being that I have two different sets.</li>
            <li> So this sits on my bathroom vanity with my brushes inside and available as needed.</li>
            <li> An overall great brush holder.</li>
            <li> It can fit alot of eye brushes, but if you are planning to store face brushes, it&#x27;s not that roomy.</li>
            <li> I can keep by brushes free of dust and moisture when they&#x27;re not in use.</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this to all, great buy.</li>
            <li> It definitely won&#x27;t fit in any of your cosmetic bags</li>
            <li> but there is no way you can fit 15-20 brushes in it and have the case close.  </li>
            <li> It is in beautiful black leather and has a snap on top, just in case you need to pack it into a suitcase or you accidentally drop it from your bathroom shelf.  </li>
            <li> high quality all the way!The Brush Cup Holder is an innovative and functional container that turns into two brush holders!</li>
            <li> It will be very useful for traveling.</li>
            <li> Very useful case.</li>
            <li> This brush holder is not only functional but looks very nice as well.</li>
            <li> It protects fairly well and can be used as a cup (s) when opened to hold the items when not closed for travel.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to bring this around.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to buy this holder.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my products so far.</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much helps me not think about my brushes losing their shape!</li>
            <li> I have to many large brushes, so can&#x27;t fit them all in.</li>
            <li> great buy, and a great way to protect those expensive makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> It also keeps them clean and it&#x27;s not just one cup holder...</li>
            <li> I love that your able to purchase this seperately so you don&#x27;t have to get it with the complete brush set.</li>
            <li> Good product, and it keeps my brushes organized and clean, although I wish it comes in a larger size so that it could hold all my brush collections.</li>
            <li> Product could be lighter in weight but overall good quality material used.</li>
            <li> really couldn&#x27;t ask for more out of a brush cup.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this brush cup holder to 1) have a good quality place for my brushes and</li>
            <li> I really want to love this however</li>
            <li> I wanted a brush holder that would protect my full sized brushes from collecting dust while they were being displayed on my vanity.</li>
            <li> fits my full sized brushes so well.  </li>
            <li> The shape is very comfy, my brushes are safe from dust and damages, that&#x27;s all i need.  </li>
            <li> Love it and the snap buttons are very stong and won&#x27;t unsnap if I travel.</li>
            <li> It will stand on my vanity and look classy and nice.</li>
            <li> The craftsmanship of this bush cup holder is fabulous &amp; worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I usually put in my Sigma F80, Sigma F10, a HUGE powder brush from real techniques, a brow brush and a gel eyeliner brush, and it fits it all perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great to travel with and use it as cup holderâ€¦very roomy, both tall and wide!</li>
            <li> Its also easy to pack and  very travel friendly.</li>
            <li> Product appears to be fine when I first received it.</li>
            <li> day to day I leave the top off and it holds all of my brushes (if I had more brushes I could use both ends for daily storage)</li>
            <li> At first I wondered why the package was so huge.</li>
            <li> So super useful for travelling.</li>
            <li> Very usefull in traveling and even make my life easy to choose and see my brushes i recomend it .</li>
            <li> It fits about 10 of my brushes easily and is very durable.</li>
            <li> The Sigma brush holder was literally the ONLY brush holder I was able to find that would fit FULL sized brushes.</li>
            <li> Not only does it come with two cups, it fits so many brushes!</li>
            <li> It is easy to open &amp; close and looks even better in person than in the picture.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I could fit anymore large brushes in it though.</li>
            <li> This case is so nice that I bought a second one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> However, this is such a nice looking case that I have even had compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> Was much larger than I expected, however I am very happy that it is.</li>
            <li> This holder definitely worth to buy it.</li>
            <li> I rarely leave feedback but this product deserves one.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it since I was never going to use this thing.  </li>
            <li> but I was only able to fit like 4.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The cup have a nice weight to it, so it will not fall down easily.</li>
            <li> It looks chic and stylish and much better than a makeup bag or other holders.</li>
            <li> This brush holder is very user friendly and will keep your brushes well stored and organized</li>
            <li> Put my brushes in it right away</li>
            <li> I also received the cup holder and it is just the right size.</li>
            <li> These fit all of my brushes - this cup in particular</li>
            <li> I searched the Internet &amp; many online stores for such a brush holder, however, what I mostly found were travel sized cup holders that would only fit compact sized brushes.</li>
            <li> It actually looks like real leather and will keep my brushes clean and safe between uses.</li>
            <li> I really liked it but the locks seem to be loose.  </li>
            <li> As well as shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, it is exactly what is shows on the picture!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality is excellent and worth spending a bit extra to have a hard brush case versus a brush roll, which doesn&#x27;t protect the brushes as well.</li>
            <li> my big brushes inside of the top part.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product and look forward to buy more products from this seller.</li>
            <li> Not too many big brushes like powder brushes can be stored in it though.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> The smaller brush holders could hardly fit my full sized powder brush.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to hold brushes at home and for traveling, will not leave home without it...</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Then I just pop the top back on</li>
            <li> They hold a lot of brushes and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Thanks again, Sigma!</li>
            <li> For travel, just put the brushes into one cup and close the other top, and your brushes are fully protected from dust and damage during any packing/moving!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars because it makes my life much easier!</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the holder it is sturdy, however when I try to put some of my larger brushes in the holder</li>
            <li> It is very practical, the brushes are kept safe and as soon as you open the cup the brushes are ready to use!               </li>
            <li> Product has a flat surface on both ends, so able to stand on either cup so can can be used as a brush carrier as well as 2 brush holders.</li>
            <li> it holds many brushes and easy to use, it can hold my 12pcs complete brushes and still has room for 2 or 3 other brushes, but i guess it&#x27;s heavier than brushes roll</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It comes apart into 2 separate cups for every day use and then snaps back together for easy storage and travel.</li>
            <li> The snaps on each side are easy to open and snap shut.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched so long for a good brush case and finally I found it.</li>
            <li> - I have 14 - three are large.  </li>
            <li> It is large, but it can be on the go if you are traveling with luggage.</li>
            <li> foundation brush (real tech), blush brush (sonia kashuk), bronzer brush (sonia kashuk), large powder brush (ecotools), eyebrow brush, spoolie, 2-3 eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> it is much nicer in person..bigger in person and will hold a lot of brushes..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable for traveling or using at home.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of faux leather that is very durable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!.</li>
            <li> WAY better quality than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> But since I don&#x27;t need to, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Its very durable and looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need to buy two, as one would hold all my brushes.</li>
            <li> Thanks goodness</li>
            <li> Thanks Sigma Beauty.</li>
            <li> I like to keep the top off and use as a brush holder but might be too massive and heavy to travel light with!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> All my brushes fit using both cups, but for travel, I needed to buy a second holder so the bristles wouldn&#x27;t get smooshed together.</li>
            <li> Very well-made and protective case.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> Makes my life much easier.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to purchase them</li>
            <li> I look forward to purchasing more in the near future.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to ordering more in the near future!!</li>
            <li> Wish it came in other colors &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> and as I use them I put them back in the original side.</li>
            <li> The only downside it that I also love sigma&#x27;s brushes and own quiet a few.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product review that I ever written on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this product at first but after contemplating it for a good three months, I decided to order it.</li>
            <li> I normally use a brush roll, but I prefer this, because I can keep my brushes protected in my bag, but when I&#x27;m ready to use them, they&#x27;re convenient in the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had liked Brush rolls in the past but it can be a hassle because brushes always tend to fallen out.</li>
            <li> since all young girls to mature women love their various makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> Very nice, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t fit my entire sigma set, which consists of 18 brushes.</li>
            <li> Way better than the typical bag or roll up.</li>
            <li> I Love my black brush cup....</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister, she loves it, the only thing is that she will wish that will hold more big brushes.</li>
            <li> Now I use the top to hold big brushes, and the bottom to hold eye shadow brushes, I just can&#x27;t close it, have to leave it open in order to hold all my 10 brushes.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when this came the other day!</li>
            <li> only reason why I would rate is four stars is the high price (especially with shipping) also the fact that you don&#x27;t know what side of top and what side is bottom.</li>
            <li> The Sigma brush holder is well designed &amp; high quality.</li>
            <li> High quality and well made.</li>
            <li> After doing a bit of research, I was surprised that there were so few products that could cover the brushes to keep them free from dust and be tall enough for most brushes.  </li>
            <li> Will highly recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> This is very durable and seems like it&#x27;s easy to wipe down.</li>
            <li> It has an oval shape and is a little more than 3 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> It does hold some regular size brushes as well, so I replaced some of the ones included in the set which I didn&#x27;t find useful.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to ruin my new brushes</li>
            <li> For instance, the face brush from Real Techniques would be too big in diameter and take up much of the space inside.</li>
            <li> But overall a fabulous sigma product and I look forward to purchasing from them in the future!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that only 4 of my brushes fit the holder looks like it&#x27;s circle</li>
            <li> Very professional looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very professional looking and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my new sigma brushes, I had to turn some brushes upside down to fit ,</li>
            <li> The product is very sturdy, deep and wide; it can fit a lot of brushes.  </li>
            <li> When at home, I just separate the top and bottom of the make-up brush holder and put my small brushes inside of the bottom part and</li>
            <li> I was expecting to hold all of my powder brushes, blush brushes, eye shadow brushes and be able to close it so that I can bring it while traveling , but found out it only hold couple of big brushes and numerous eye shadow brushes if I try to close the holder.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough to hold many brushes (small and / or large) and I received the package right away.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product was how BIG it is!</li>
            <li> Second, if you fill this with any med-large face brushes, the bristles get bent down when you put the top on.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a much smaller container; I don&#x27;t know why as I read the size but for travel I didn&#x27;t expect this large a container.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a brush holder that will fit taller brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a normal woman, not a makeup artist or anything, but even my small brush collection couldn&#x27;t fit into this.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I have much shorter brushes then the actual Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> It also holds all of your basic make-up brushes very well.</li>
            <li> It will fit my tall brushes and quit a few.</li>
            <li> but really didn&#x27;t realize how big it was until I got it.  </li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t justify the price since the smaller one comes with makeup brushes (which I really don&#x27;t need) and they charge $65+ for it.</li>
            <li> they add so much precision to my daily makeup wear</li>
            <li> Cuz my brushes are pretty long!  </li>
            <li> The Sigma brush holder is 9.5 inches tall, while other brush holders of similar style are typically only about 4.5 inches tall at the most.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t lock tightly thus, it can open easily which defeats the purpose if you want to bring it for travel.  </li>
            <li> I expected to get a next regular brush holder, but finally i got that totally satisfied me.</li>
            <li> I got this to help de-clutter and organize my small condo, I fit 80% of my makeup in the two cups.</li>
            <li> We spend so much money buying nice brushes and they have them get squished or dirty.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold that many brushes.</li>
            <li> However, you can only fit a few brushes without smashing the shape of the heads.</li>
            <li> Trying to get all the brushes out of the way to get the lid on was impossible and was catching on the brush bristles - exactly what I was trying to avoid.  </li>
            <li> Not really that practical, two large for traveling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and tall enough to hold all of long brushes and wide enough to ensure that ALL of my brushes are contained in one easy cup.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that the holder is much larger than I had pictured it to be.</li>
            <li> The brush cup holder is pretty big, with the dimensions being roughly about 9.5 in x 3.5 in x 2.75 in (24 cm</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few Sigma producta over the past 6 months, loving each one.  </li>
            <li> It keeps them secure since the cup is thick and durable.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is difficult to close the brush holder over top of brushes, and at times, the top crushes and smooshes brushes, damaging bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is made of real leather and is extremely sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty heavy though, but the quality is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was expecting a much slimmer one that would hold like 10 brushes in each half if u used them like cups..</li>
            <li> The black leather-like oval brush holder is very well made and can be used with both large and small brushes.  </li>
            <li> 3 large brushes and 3 small concealer brushes.</li>
            <li> Professional black look.</li>
            <li> Two halves become loose after only days of having it.</li>
            <li> have similar products, but other brands, but not the final compartment of my makeup brushes with the Sigma.</li>
            <li> I was looking for brush holder for so long.</li>
            <li> When I start putting my makeup on, I like to open the holder, take out the brushes that I intend to use and put them in the empty side</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> cup holder is more for like small brushes or thin brushes and also works for 2 cup holders.</li>
            <li> I have seen other similar brush holders</li>
            <li> I have 8 powder, blush and face brushes in one side (standard size by Chanel, Mac, Bobbi Brown and Sigma) and probably 20 shadow, brow, blending, fan, thinner handled brushes on the other side.  </li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ve taken 2 trips with it now and the snap on one side is broken.</li>
            <li> But, it is a little deep for bushes that are not designed a Sigma brush or other short stemmed bushes.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly enough, it&#x27;s actually pretty difficult to find a brush cup holder that can hold full-sized brushes.</li>
            <li> i already have a sigma brush set with the coral pink holder, but i also bought some single brushes from sigma and some other places</li>
            <li> I received it only in a few days after ordering it.  </li>
            <li> My brushes don&#x27;t get crushed or reshaped like they would in my make up bags.</li>
            <li> It snaps closed for travel</li>
            <li> My use for the cup holder was to put dirty brushes used after makeup applications in the cup to keep them separate from the clean brushes.</li>
            <li> I am definitely a minimalist when it comes to makeup and their accessories, but I found this to just be too small for</li>
            <li> So when I found the Sigma brush holder, you can imagine how extremely ecstatic I was.</li>
            <li> but I still think this brush holder is too small (especially for powder brushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, my small brushes were too short to reach the lip of the cup, which made me fish around for them.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not worth the price I paid for.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would at least last a year or two.</li>
            <li> It was slightly difficult to open initially but could be due to the newness of it.</li>
            <li> For some odd reason all of my brushes seem to be swallowed up by the cup.</li>
            <li> I just use each half of this item to hold them both.</li>
            <li> The interior lining for the bottom half was slightly lifted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of a black leather-like material</li>
            <li> Reviews must be at least 20 words long</li>
            <li> and I have no clean up to do.  </li>
            <li> I can have all my brushes in it and it takes up so little space on my table.</li>
            <li> but it is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy duty</li>
            <li> This case is meticulously crafted, heavy duty and stores</li>
            <li> , I tried airing it out for a few days and its still there.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is one of the few if only manufacturers of a brush cup holder</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is going back.</li>
            <li> My brushes are protected and the bristles won&#x27;t bend from storage in a space too small.  </li>
            <li> This cup is WAY too small for my brushes.  </li>
            <li> I only have a few which I use on a daily base</li>
            <li> No more rustling through brushes in my makeup case, everything is organized.</li>
            <li> I have expensive brushes and while this holder isn&#x27;t crazy expensive, it&#x27;s not cheap enough to last for 2 uses.</li>
            <li> Another poorly made product.</li>
            <li> Me Crazy Travel Brush Set - which came with a purple cup.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient to travel and take all your brushes with and not worry about your clothes or make-up bag getting dirty.  </li>
            <li> Also, getting the lid on was impossible.  </li>

            <li> So super useful for travelling. At home I have my brushes in a cup for easy access and when I travel I use to put my brushes in a brush bag and have to dig through them in the hotel bathroom. Now that I have this brush cup holder it&#x27;s so convenient and versatile. I use this to hold my brushes without having to rummage through a bag and the cup holder protects my brushes when I put them back into my luggage. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold that many brushes. For instance, the face brush from Real Techniques would be too big in diameter and take up much of the space inside. But for the most part fits my essentials: foundation brush (real tech), blush brush (sonia kashuk), bronzer brush (sonia kashuk), large powder brush (ecotools), eyebrow brush, spoolie, 2-3 eyeshadow brushes. Happy with my purchase and great as a gift!</li>
            <li> Great handcrafted quality! Bought this to store some brushes I dont use that often. However, you can only fit a few brushes without smashing the shape of the heads. I am definitely a minimalist when it comes to makeup and their accessories, but I found this to just be too small for even me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit 3 large brushes and 3 small concealer brushes.</li>
            <li> This is the best great quality and fit all my sigma brushes</li>
            <li> I did not like the cup because the side closures were not secured closures. My use for the cup holder was to put dirty brushes used after makeup applications in the cup to keep them separate from the clean brushes. The side snap closures were not secure.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Not really that practical, two large for traveling.  Can&#x27;t be washed. two big for some brushes. This is just my opinion, I bought it from the good reviews that I had read.</li>
            <li> Just received the sigma beauty brush cup holder and I must say its just perfect for me! I&#x27;ve been looking for something to take with me while I travel or just even in my purse and the size of this product is amazing! u can fit many brushes and can place the holder just about anywhere (office..bathroom..room!)</li>
            <li> This was a really GREAT product. I received it only in a few days after ordering it.  The product is very sturdy, deep and wide; it can fit a lot of brushes.  It doesn&#x27;t fit all my brushes, but I do have a lot.  When at home, I just separate the top and bottom of the make-up brush holder and put my small brushes inside of the bottom part and my big brushes inside of the top part.  When I travel, I just remove the brushes that can&#x27;t fit and put it somewhere else.  I would highly recommend this product! Wish it came in other colors &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this because I thought it would be perfect for travel and my brushes would be protected.  First, I&#x27;ve taken 2 trips with it now and the snap on one side is broken. And it&#x27;s not something I can fix. Second, if you fill this with any med-large face brushes, the bristles get bent down when you put the top on. Not acceptable. I have expensive brushes and while this holder isn&#x27;t crazy expensive, it&#x27;s not cheap enough to last for 2 uses. Garbage!!</li>
            <li> The Sigma Brush Cup Holder is GREAT for travel especially if there is a lot of off-site makeup applications.  We use Brush Guard tips with the Sigma Brush Holder to keep all of the fibers intact.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister, she loves it, the only thing is that she will wish that will hold more big brushes.</li>
            <li> Look chic, haut de gamme, trÃ¨s pratique pour transporter ses pinceaux partout. Livraison trÃ¨s rapide en Ã  peine une semaine.</li>
            <li> Enviado via iPad    This brush cup holder is very elegant  and useful.  It is very practical, the brushes are kept safe and as soon as you open the cup the brushes are ready to use!

            <li> This holder is wonderful for traveling or to use at home to keep all your brushes secure.</li>
            <li> The picture on Amazon does not do this product justice!..it is much nicer in person..bigger in person and will hold a lot of brushes..it smells like leather..would tell everyone to get this!..it came quicker then promised which is nice</li>
            <li> I received my Sigma brush holder today and am very pleased with my order.  The black leather-like oval brush holder is very well made and can be used with both large and small brushes.  It&#x27;s very durable for traveling or using at home.  I like that you have two holders in one which makes it more convenient.  I would definitely recommend this brush holder to keep your brushes from getting damaged when traveling or using at home.  Thank&#x27;s Sigma for a well designed product.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, it is exactly what is shows on the picture! Good quality! It was beyond my expectations!! Love it!!! I would recomend this product!!</li>
            <li> Product is versatile. Opens easily and closes securely with snap on buttons on both sides. Product shape is oblong so can fit into spaces easily. Product has a flat surface on both ends, so able to stand on either cup so can can be used as a brush carrier as well as 2 brush holders. Fits about 10-12 basic brushes in one cup. Product could be lighter in weight but overall good quality material used. Professional black look. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for my brushes. I use it for traveling to hold them all in place. When at home I separate it and use for my brushes. It fits standing up in a drawer by my vanity. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something tall enough to hold my largest Sigma brushes.  This brush cups holds them (even with the top on) perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For day to day I leave the top off and it holds all of my brushes (if I had more brushes I could use both ends for daily storage) and when I travel I will use the top to hold my brushes inside the cup and keep them protected in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really couldn&#x27;t ask for more out of a brush cup.  It holds all of my brushes and is also a very nice quality that IMO looks better in person than in the photos.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this brush cup holder to 1) have a good quality place for my brushes and 2) match my level of investment in my growing make up collection. This cup is convenient for traveling with the button clasps for security also the detail of the cup is very beautiful and simplistc. It was slightly difficult to open initially but could be due to the newness of it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for brush holder for so long. While surfing on amazon website, I came accross this one. After reading some reviews, I decided to give it a try. And now I am so happy with this purchase. It can hold all of my expensive makeup brushes and keep them safe from harm and dust. I definitely recommend this product and look forward to buy more products from this seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big brush carrier, but I like how I can use it for travel or for every day use. It&#x27;s multi-purpose. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I really liked it but the locks seem to be loose.  They don&#x27;t lock tightly thus, it can open easily which defeats the purpose if you want to bring it for travel.  If you only plan to use it as brush holders (not having to use the locks), then this product is great.  I really want to love this however, it&#x27;s not worth the price I paid for.  Unfortunately, this is going back.</li>
            <li> great storage place, ease to use, feels strong for traveling and will hold for a while it works for me... excellent $$ and got right on time with no delays. ... tks</li>
            <li> I am happy with my Sigma Brush Cup Holder. It allows for easy access to the brushes while applying makeup. I would recommend the product to others. Not too many big brushes like powder brushes can be stored in it though.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to store your brushes and travel with them. The only downfall is that some brushes with shorter handles will get lost in the tall cup. But overall a fabulous sigma product and I look forward to purchasing from them in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who hates clutter and when you don&#x27;t have space for everything you love, you become creative. This is the reason I purchased this holder. I can have all my brushes in it and it takes up so little space on my table. It looks chic and stylish and much better than a makeup bag or other holders. I have a trip coming up and I can finally take all my brushes without worrying about space. It arrived in 2-3 days after purchase (thanks Amazon Prime) and I love it! Get it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to get something to keep my brushes in for every day use but also wanted something to store them in for traveling. This cup holder is perfect for both of these things!! It comes apart into 2 separate cups for every day use and then snaps back together for easy storage and travel. It is very sturdy and I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this cute and stylish brush case. Not only is it great for travel, its a trendy way to store all of your brushes in one place!</li>
            <li> I have heard so many reviews on this brush cup holder that I just had to give it a try.  So very glad I did.  The quailty is wonderful and the sleek black holder looks great on my make up table.  I now understand others comments on this.  I have purchased a few Sigma producta over the past 6 months, loving each one.  Thank you Sigma for the quality we are all looking for as well as at an affordable price.  I look forward to purchasing more in the near future.  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Snaps did not stay together. Returned this item.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of Sigma makeup brushes and needed a holder for them.  The Sigma Beauty Brush Cup holds all 25 brushes easily and looks great.</li>
            <li> This holder is larger than I thought!  Which is a good thing!  Cuz my brushes are pretty long!  The container is heavy-duty as well, so you can tell that it&#x27;s quite durable!  I love love love this!</li>
            <li> I had originally bought just the brushes which i loved! I didn&#x27;t want to ruin my new brushes so bought the sigma  brush cup holder and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. It&#x27;s heavy duty so it&#x27;s perfect to travel with. When im home I use it as two cups and when I&#x27;m on the go I&#x27;ll just close it.. Deff a good buy. Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product by Sigma Beaty. Excellent quality! I was travelling in US and it just arrived on time at my friends house.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for on the go. I just wish it was bigger. I&#x27;ll have to buy another one so I can take all my brushes with me.</li>
            <li> I love how all my brushes (about 25 brushes) fit in this holder with no problem! The holder makes it easier for me to see all my brushes without having to search all over a box or bag for them. Its also easy to pack and  very travel friendly. Beyond convenient for me</li>
            <li> I wanted a brush holder that would protect my full sized brushes from collecting dust while they were being displayed on my vanity. I searched the Internet &amp; many online stores for such a brush holder, however, what I mostly found were travel sized cup holders that would only fit compact sized brushes. The Sigma brush holder was literally the ONLY brush holder I was able to find that would fit FULL sized brushes. The Sigma brush holder is 9.5 inches tall, while other brush holders of similar style are typically only about 4.5 inches tall at the most. The smaller brush holders could hardly fit my full sized powder brush. As I kept searching for the perfect brush holder, I began to think that perhaps no such holder existed. So when I found the Sigma brush holder, you can imagine how extremely ecstatic I was. The Sigma brush holder is well designed &amp; high quality. It has an oval shape and is a little more than 3 inches in diameter. It&#x27;s made of faux leather that is very durable. It is easy to open &amp; close and looks even better in person than in the picture. This is a fabulous looking brush holder that is conveniently functional. I believe it&#x27;s the best option for full sized brushes!</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition and super fast. Fits all size brushes and keeps vanity nice and neat! I LOVE this brush holder its a must have and is beautifully crafted. high quality all the way!The Brush Cup Holder is an innovative and functional container that turns into two brush holders! Now you can keep your brushes organized at home or on the go.</li>
            <li> High quality and well made. Best you can find with this price range. I am happy with the product</li>
            <li> This brush up holder is amazing.  Not only does it come with two cups, it fits so many brushes! This was my first Sigma purchase and I am very pleased.  I also purchased the Make Me Crazy Travel Brush Set - which came with a purple cup.  These fit all of my brushes - this cup in particular fits my full sized brushes so well.  I know that when I accumulate more brushes I will be purchasing more of these cups!</li>
            <li> I love this holder! Can use it while traveling or when at home! It&#x27;s hard to find a brush holder that will fit taller brushes!</li>
            <li> Product appears to be fine when I first received it. But after about a month of use, the straps broke. Seller doesn&#x27;t even respond to any messages. Another poorly made product. I was hoping it would at least last a year or two.</li>
            <li> Hi All. For some odd reason all of my brushes seem to be swallowed up by the cup. I have to take them all out to identify and choose the one I wish to use.In the youtube tutorials I watched all the brushes seemed to be easily identified while in the case. Perhaps I have much shorter brushes then the actual Sigma brushes. I will create some kind of a stand to place in the bottom of it to raise the height of my brushes. It is nice looking and seems to be very sturdy. I will eventually sell this one on E-bay and get a brighter color in a similar product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping all of your investment makeup brushes organized and clean. Lightweight but sturdy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend $25 on a brush case but thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it&#x27;s so easy to return purchases bought on Amazon.  I AM SO GLAD I DID!!!  This case is meticulously crafted, heavy duty and stores A LOT of brushes - I have 14 - three are large.  The snaps on each side are easy to open and snap shut.  The oval design is a nice feature - fits well in my drawer.  My brushes are protected and the bristles won&#x27;t bend from storage in a space too small.  I thought about the roll up case but went against it since I wanted to be able to view and grab any brush at a glance.  Again - glad I made this choice!  This is easily one of my top purchases with Amazon.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This product is great. We spend so much money buying nice brushes and they have them get squished or dirty. This is the perfect product that wants to have easy access on their bathroom counter and all close snap and go without any worry of your brushes. Way better than the typical bag or roll up. You can pack your cosmetic bag and literally just throw this in your suitcase, very study and looks great too. I highly recommend this product!.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to hold brushes at home and for traveling, will not leave home without it...Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush holder.  I can fit over 20 brushes in this cup.  I like the fact that it is balanced, both ends are the same size so I don&#x27;t need to worry about it falling over.  When I start putting my makeup on, I like to open the holder, take out the brushes that I intend to use and put them in the empty side and as I use them I put them back in the original side. Then I just pop the top back on and I have no clean up to do.  I have seen other similar brush holders but this was the best price for the product.</li>
            <li> This case is SO beautiful. WAY better quality than I expected for the price. I would recommend this to anyone in search of the perfect make up crush holder!!</li>
            <li> This is a great way to store you make-up brushes and being that I have two different sets. I just use each half of this item to hold them both. I probably will end up purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> This is a a great item for holding makeup brushes and pencil type items for travel. It protects fairly well and can be used as a cup (s) when opened to hold the items when not closed for travel.</li>
            <li> I got this for my new sigma brushes, I had to turn some brushes upside down to fit , no problem they hold their shape even after being in the tube all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this if you need to store your brushes away from your train case, it separates into two cups for your brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> This case is so nice that I bought a second one for my daughter.  It is in beautiful black leather and has a snap on top, just in case you need to pack it into a suitcase or you accidentally drop it from your bathroom shelf.  I don&#x27;t like lots of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in view in a bathroom area where there may be lots of traffic by guests.  However, this is such a nice looking case that I have even had compliments on it.  It also holds all of your basic make-up brushes very well.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Perfect for organising my brushes on my dressing table and when travelling. Would definitely recommend. Great delivery service too.</li>
            <li> The size of this blew me away when I opened the package!! I was expecting a much smaller container; I don&#x27;t know why as I read the size but for travel I didn&#x27;t expect this large a container. So this sits on my bathroom vanity with my brushes inside and available as needed.</li>
            <li> Was much larger than I expected, however I am very happy that it is. It will fit my tall brushes and quit a few. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I Love this. It&#x27;s great to carry brushes and also to organize them at home</li>
            <li> Two halves become loose after only days of having it.</li>
            <li> I find it now easy to travel with my makeup brushes! (which is also a sigma) and it keeps my brushes from dust too!</li>
            <li> Bought this from etailz, and it is authentic and beautiful. I usually put in my Sigma F80, Sigma F10, a HUGE powder brush from real techniques, a brow brush and a gel eyeliner brush, and it fits it all perfectly! I don&#x27;t know if I could fit anymore large brushes in it though. But since I don&#x27;t need to, I really like it. It keeps them secure since the cup is thick and durable. The holder doesn&#x27;t open up accidentally while travelling either.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moGC4BZ562JK2U]]Great for big brushes, I have another one for my smaller brushes. These are perfect for keeping your brushes from collecting dust and brushing that dust back on your face.  I am glad I made this purchase because for the price it was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Very usefull in traveling and even make my life easy to choose and see my brushes i recomend it .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this holder its great for traveling and also to have on my bathroom counter its nice to have two separate containers to split the brushes up. Its very durable and looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I received the product within the specified time. At first I wondered why the package was so huge. I was truly amazed by the size of the holder. It didn&#x27;t look this big in the pictures. I was expecting a much slimmer one that would hold like 10 brushes in each half if u used them like cups.. but this holds 15-20 easy. Its really deep too. Looks good. Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. They arrived in a timely manner, and are excellent quality. I would definitely recommend this item and would buy it again. The price is perfect. They hold a lot of brushes and was exactly what I was looking for. I purchased two cases. One for my bigger brushes and another for my smaller ones. I didn&#x27;t really need to buy two, as one would hold all my brushes. However, I am using both and they look beautiful, neat and tidy on my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job, Sigma!</li>
            <li> This brush holder is very user friendly and will keep your brushes well stored and organized but it is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> An overall great brush holder. My only complaint is that it is difficult to close the brush holder over top of brushes, and at times, the top crushes and smooshes brushes, damaging bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is excellent and worth spending a bit extra to have a hard brush case versus a brush roll, which doesn&#x27;t protect the brushes as well.</li>
            <li> I expected to get a next regular brush holder, but finally i got that totally satisfied me. The shape is very comfy, my brushes are safe from dust and damages, that&#x27;s all i need.  This holder definitely worth to buy it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a make-up brush holder to place on my counter.  After doing a bit of research, I was surprised that there were so few products that could cover the brushes to keep them free from dust and be tall enough for most brushes.  Thanks goodness I came across the Sigma Beauty Brush Cup Holder.  It fits all my brushes of different sizes and keeps them from getting dust.  If you are looking for a great brush holder, I would rec. this one!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. It&#x27;s sturdy and tall enough to hold all of long brushes and wide enough to ensure that ALL of my brushes are contained in one easy cup. Love it and the snap buttons are very stong and won&#x27;t unsnap if I travel.</li>
            <li> I rarely leave feedback but this product deserves one. I&#x27;ve searched so long for a good brush case and finally I found it. Absolutely love this brush holder. Will highly recommend to my family and friends. Thanks Sigma Beauty.</li>
            <li> The interior lining for the bottom half was slightly lifted.</li>
            <li> Great quality but too tall! I like to keep the top off and use as a brush holder but might be too massive and heavy to travel light with!</li>
            <li> I use this to hold all my sigma brushes in! I like it because its tall and a lot larger than it looks online. It holds a lot brushes! My brushes don&#x27;t get crushed or reshaped like they would in my make up bags. Plus, it&#x27;s perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> The product is great. Fully meets my expectations. I will indicate to all who are interested.&lt;br /&gt;I have similar products, but other brands, but not the final compartment of my makeup brushes with the Sigma.</li>
            <li> I have to many large brushes, so can&#x27;t fit them all in. It will be very useful for traveling. Nice quality case.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush holder is beautiful! It is well made and durable. I bought it together with my Sigma brush set and I could not be happier with it. It will stand on my vanity and look classy and nice. The great thing is that you can close it so your brushes stay clean from dust. It is large, but it can be on the go if you are traveling with luggage. For a carry on or purse, I would suggest getting a travel brush set and roll or case. I am very happy I decided to purchase this with my new brushes!</li>
            <li> Perfect and durable to keep my brushes in good condition when I travel. I love the sleek look of the case and the great price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This is the first product review that I ever written on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this product at first but after contemplating it for a good three months, I decided to order it. I don&#x27;t regret it one bit! Alot of people say this product is BIG, but I have to disagree. It can fit alot of eye brushes, but if you are planning to store face brushes, it&#x27;s not that roomy. I can store a few Real Technique brushes, sigma eye brushes, and Sephora brushes... but I still think this brush holder is too small (especially for powder brushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be traveling abroad next semester and I&#x27;m excited to bring this around. This is very durable and seems like it&#x27;s easy to wipe down. It&#x27;s pretty heavy though, but the quality is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I would rate is four stars is the high price (especially with shipping) also the fact that you don&#x27;t know what side of top and what side is bottom.</li>
            <li> great holder for brush</li>
            <li> I was expecting to hold all of my powder brushes, blush brushes, eye shadow brushes and be able to close it so that I can bring it while traveling , but found out it only hold couple of big brushes and numerous eye shadow brushes if I try to close the holder.  Now I use the top to hold big brushes, and the bottom to hold eye shadow brushes, I just can&#x27;t close it, have to leave it open in order to hold all my 10 brushes.</li>
            <li> it holds many brushes and easy to use, it can hold my 12pcs complete brushes and still has room for 2 or 3 other brushes, but i guess it&#x27;s heavier than brushes roll</li>
            <li> Whoever came up with this is fairly brilliant in my opinion. I can keep by brushes free of dust and moisture when they&#x27;re not in use. And when I&#x27;m using them frequently, it&#x27;s actually 2 cups. I traveled with it for the first time this Christmas, and it worked great. I normally use a brush roll, but I prefer this, because I can keep my brushes protected in my bag, but when I&#x27;m ready to use them, they&#x27;re convenient in the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great buy, and a great way to protect those expensive makeup brushes. Just make sure you pay attention to which side is up! Don&#x27;t want to store your brushes sitting on their bristles.</li>
            <li> this brush cup holder is very nice, It is practical and can fit all my most used brushes in it.</li>
            <li> i already have a sigma brush set with the coral pink holder, but i also bought some single brushes from sigma and some other places and i wanted another holder to store them in. this holder is absolutely perfect, great for keeping your brushes seprate while using them or washing them. wish they had more colors of just the holder, rather than having to buy another set of brushes to get another color holder. quaulity is great! i would definitely recommend this to all, great buy. price is good too.</li>
            <li> Great to travel with and use it as cup holderâ€¦very roomy, both tall and wide! Love my Sigma Brush holder.</li>
            <li> This is cool &amp; perfect to take on the go without ruining the brushes!</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I expected. However, it still hold a good amount of brushes. Very professional looking. The snaps sometimes come apart on their own.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for brush management for traveling. Well made. Fast shipping. Would definitely buy again and maybe I will as I grow my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my brushes.  Dust free and easy to travel with!</li>
            <li> I just received my Sigma brush cup and I am very pleased at the size and sturdiness of it. It snaps closed for travel or you can use each side as one holder, depending on how many brushes you have. It actually looks like real leather and will keep my brushes clean and safe between uses. Thanks again, Sigma! Looking forward to ordering more in the near future!!</li>
            <li> Handy for travel and for storage between uses.  Holds my entire brush collection.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when this came the other day! Put my brushes in it right away and it looks great and of good quality. Going on vacation this weekend and I can&#x27;t wait to bring it with!</li>
            <li> This case ended up being a bit too big for my taste.  It definitely won&#x27;t fit in any of your cosmetic bags so be prepared to have to carry this separately if you&#x27;re traveling.  Take note of the measurements before you buy.  I thought I had but really didn&#x27;t realize how big it was until I got it.  Unfortunately, this is one of the few if only manufacturers of a brush cup holder and I do like the style and functionality because you can use it as a stand/holder for your brushes on your counter as well.  The company does offer a smaller travel-sized version but I couldn&#x27;t justify the price since the smaller one comes with makeup brushes (which I really don&#x27;t need) and they charge $65+ for it.</li>
            <li> I debated about whether or not to spend $30 on this brush cup, but the reviews were so good, I decided to go for it.  This cup is WAY too small for my brushes.  I&#x27;m just a normal woman, not a makeup artist or anything, but even my small brush collection couldn&#x27;t fit into this.  Also, my small brushes were too short to reach the lip of the cup, which made me fish around for them.  Also, getting the lid on was impossible.  Trying to get all the brushes out of the way to get the lid on was impossible and was catching on the brush bristles - exactly what I was trying to avoid.  I returned this item and had to eat the $6 shipping but it was worth it since I was never going to use this thing.  Heading over to the container store to find something better and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: BTW, I found the best brush holder ever with the Glass Straw Dispenser sold on amazon.  It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> The cup holder exceeded my expectations! The product is made of real leather and is extremely sturdy. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great size. All my brushes fit using both cups, but for travel, I needed to buy a second holder so the bristles wouldn&#x27;t get smooshed together.</li>
            <li> travel with your brushes and have a place to stand them up as well.&lt;br /&gt;this is awesome  and i love the look!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received my Sigma Beauty cup holder and I absolutely LOVE it!  It&#x27;s so convenient to travel and take all your brushes with and not worry about your clothes or make-up bag getting dirty.  It also keeps them clean and it&#x27;s not just one cup holder... once at home it works as two cup holders.  I absolutely love it and recommend it to all the make-up lovers out there.</li>
            <li> The craftsmanship of this bush cup holder is fabulous &amp; worth every penny. But, it is a little deep for bushes that are not designed a Sigma brush or other short stemmed bushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough to hold many brushes (small and / or large) and I received the package right away. Great service!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a make up brush holder to hold atleast all my make up brushes I only have a few which I use on a daily base so I was excited to buy this holder. Shipping was pretty fast. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that only 4 of my brushes fit the holder looks like it&#x27;s circle it&#x27;s more like an oval shape which doesn&#x27;t allow it to put more brushes I wanted something that fits all my brushes but I was only able to fit like 4.&lt;br /&gt;This cup holder is more for like small brushes or thin brushes and also works for 2 cup holders.</li>
            <li> The item arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> I love the Sigma Brush Cup Holder because it makes storaging your brushes easy as well as the transition of being able to use your brushes at home and for traveling so conveient. I had liked Brush rolls in the past but it can be a hassle because brushes always tend to fallen out. I love that your able to purchase this seperately so you don&#x27;t have to get it with the complete brush set. As well as shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly enough, it&#x27;s actually pretty difficult to find a brush cup holder that can hold full-sized brushes. However, once I stumbled upon this Sigma Brush Cup Holder, I didn&#x27;t even hesitate to buy it. It&#x27;s made of a black leather-like material and it&#x27;s GORGEOUS. It features two separate cups that can be put together and secured by two snap buttons to hold your brushes for storage. This product holds FULL-SIZED makeup brushes, for BOTH travel and for storage at home. For travel, just put the brushes into one cup and close the other top, and your brushes are fully protected from dust and damage during any packing/moving! But if you want to just store them at home, the Sigma Brush Cup Holder can be split into two cups, so you have two spaces to store your makeup brushes. It&#x27;s basically a win-win situation. :D The brush cup holder is pretty big, with the dimensions being roughly about 9.5 in x 3.5 in x 2.75 in (24 cm x 9 cm x 6.75 cm), but it&#x27;s understandable when I think about it having to carry my bigger powder brushes along with all my eye makeup brushes. All in all, it&#x27;s a great product and it&#x27;s definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> Very nice, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t fit my entire sigma set, which consists of 18 brushes. I would say it fits 10, which would consist of different size brushes. Very well-made and protective case.</li>
            <li> It was def what I was expecting. Loved it. Just as described. Thanks so much I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Very useful case. I love how it turns into two perfect brush holders when travelling. No more rustling through brushes in my makeup case, everything is organized. It does hold some regular size brushes as well, so I replaced some of the ones included in the set which I didn&#x27;t find useful. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> The cup have a nice weight to it, so it will not fall down easily. Is the perfect size for traveling too. The brushes will not get crush inside this</li>
            <li> FINALLY something that holds all my brushes (tall ones too). I have about 12 brushes in mine.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product was how BIG it is! I was pleasantly surprised to see that the holder is much larger than I had pictured it to be. It fits about 10 of my brushes easily and is very durable. This brush holder is not only functional but looks very nice as well. I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this. Fits almost all of my brushes. It&#x27;s very professional looking and sturdy. I just wish it was a smidge bigger</li>
            <li> Yes!!!!  I highly recommend.  No complaints....  Seller was professional, excellent communication and service.  Thank you.  Excellent for storing brushes stationary or when you travel.  Great vision of the creator.... love, love, love</li>
            <li> The case looks nice, came quickly and does the job but there is no way you can fit 15-20 brushes in it and have the case close.  I have 8 powder, blush and face brushes in one side (standard size by Chanel, Mac, Bobbi Brown and Sigma) and probably 20 shadow, brow, blending, fan, thinner handled brushes on the other side.  I just leave them open and separate but if you&#x27;re looking for something you can fill up and then close to save counter space or room, this won&#x27;t hold a ton without likely damaging your brush handles and bristles.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars because it makes my life much easier! I use it as a brush cup holder to decorate my vanity and I also use it as a travel brush holder. Great material used for this product. Makes my life much easier.</li>
            <li> I love the cup holder it is ideal for traveling.  I received my order very quickly which was great for me since I was going on vacation and looked forward to packing my brushes in the lovely Sigma Cup Holder.</li>
            <li> I Love my black brush cup.... perfect for all my black brushes and traveling .... will definitely buy another one soon..</li>
            <li> Use to keep my brushes clean and nice, works great. Good quality for a great price. Love, love, love Sigma brushes too.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I have seen many make up tutorials that use these brushes. I really wanted to purchase them so I recently received the performance eye kit. I loveeee them they add so much precision to my daily makeup wear and they are the perfect size for the eyes. I also received the cup holder and it is just the right size. I am very pleased with my products so far.</li>
            <li> Have several of these brush holders now.  They are sturdy and attractive.  Love how the holder snaps into two halves to display brushes on vanity.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!! It makes traveling with your makeup brushes easy. Plus I have two holders for the price of one, and lets not forget...keeps your brushes clean when traveling!</li>
            <li> Good product, and it keeps my brushes organized and clean, although I wish it comes in a larger size so that it could hold all my brush collections.</li>
            <li> I like it because I could leave it on my vanity with a cover to avoid dust particles getting on my brushes and I could travel with it but the smell of the can is so strong, I tried airing it out for a few days and its still there.</li>
            <li> Great for home use &amp; on the go use.  I love the sizing and all. A great buy for a girl who loves her makeup tools.  The only downside it that I also love sigma&#x27;s brushes and own quiet a few.  The handles are a bit larger then most so I can&#x27;t fit all of my brush into the cup. I use it for my daily routine brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the holder it is sturdy, however when I try to put some of my larger brushes in the holder it&#x27;s challenging because it shifts the bristles.</li>
            <li> Aaaahmazing just what I needed! Keeps my brushes clean and organized! Wish it wasn&#x27;t oval so I could fit more brushes. But The hight is perfect! I think it&#x27;s great for travel as wellðŸ™Œ</li>
            <li> This brush case is great, it protects the brushes and it can be used as 2 separate containers on the field. I love it and I think every makeup artist should have it. Thank you Sigma Beauty!</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much helps me not think about my brushes losing their shape! Pretty sturdy and elegant I really love it</li>
            <li> Sigma&#x27;s Brush Cup Holder is perfect! Now all my cosmetic brushes are organized and in one place.</li>
            <li> I got this to help de-clutter and organize my small condo, I fit 80% of my makeup in the two cups. It&#x27;s bigger and sturdier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Love it! It fits well in my makeup vanity and keeps all my brushes upright and not getting any dust on them from sitting in an open container on your vanity. It will be great for traveling!  I would buy it again and as a great for everyone from 13-100, since all young girls to mature women love their various makeup brushes! Jennifer D Gonzalez</li>
