Our snail cream &amp;#34;Snail Extract Cream&amp;#34; provides a pleasant feeling, a better look and miraculous healing properties for the skin!

Cream 100% natural and organic helps to smooth wrinkles on the face, neck and hands, cure acne scars, burns, blemishes and stretch marks leaving a silky feel with a radiant glow and soft to the touch. The serum secreted by the land snail Helix aspersa MÃ¼ller de Chile has powerful antioxidants that protect you from an atmosphere of oxygen radicals. When applied to serum fibroblasts, this increases the proliferation and functional ability of these cells. The fibroblasts are responsible for generating all elements of the skin matrix, including collagen, elastic fibers, glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans. The latter two provide firmness, strength, flexibility and elasticity to the skin to contain water, which in turn provides healing benefits. The highly effective blend of moisturizing and nourishing ingredients with antioxidants snail and adding collagen and elastin have formulated a cream intended to stimulate the skin in a completely natural way; penetrates to the deeper layers of the skin and firms and tones your skin from the first application !</li>
