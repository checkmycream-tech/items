            <li> Also I&#x27;m not sure I can refill them as the lid part is a very tight fit.</li>
            <li> the plastic roller ball does not move as easily as I would like making it difficult to use</li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve only used one, just a few times and the roller piece fell out.</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to snap the white part onto the bottle, but they don&#x27;t leak</li>
            <li> Half of the bottles came withour rollers.</li>
            <li> rollers did not fit snug in bottles, kept them anyway,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making me insane.  </li>

            <li> These small roller bottles are just the right size for giving goDesana essential oil samples to people or to keep smaller bottles in my purse.  They are sturdy bottles, that will not break easily if dropped.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>

            <li> I purchased these to make some concoctions with my essential oils.  Lets just say they are a pain to use. Out of 6 only 2 were able to fit the roller ball in easily. I also used the tips they give with the instructions but no dice.  Find another product, I know I sure will!</li>
            <li> glass vials were exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> The roller balls fall out EVERY TIME I USE THEM.  It&#x27;s making me insane.  I use these bottles for essential oil blends, and what ends up happening is that the oils just seep out all over my purse.  The good news is, my purse now smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my samples of EO.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using them for essential oils and I was looking for a small size and cute looking bottles , the roll on works great and they fit perfectly I only give it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t use them enough to see if the blue coat lasts</li>

            <li> This is my first purchase of these. they are OK. They are a little hard to snap the white part onto the bottle, but they don&#x27;t leak either so maybe that&#x27;s why?</li>
            <li> perfect.... exactly what I needed.</li>
