            <li>I SMELL AMAZING</li>
            <li>I love all of the Herbal Essences products because the scents/fragrances are always so good.</li>
            <li>Smell like a butterfly from the most amazing garden of all time.</li>
            <li>Smells good, and the price was right too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok</li>
            <li>Love this body wash, and love that I can have</li>
            <li>it delivered to my door - FREE SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>this stuff is cheap and amazing.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Love Love Love the scent</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend and I will be purchasing more!! :)</li>
            <li>I would say for the price I paid this is a pretty good value.</li>
            <li>It keeps you feeling clean most of the day, and does smell like roses.</li>
            <li>This has a pretty light scent that is both sweet and light rose :)</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled that Herbal Essences came out with a body wash, this stuff smells like pure heaven in a bottle.</li>
            <li>we all love this product and plan on purchasing this again but more frequently.</li>
            <li>I loooove their hair care, and now I can love my skin as much as my hair after a bath or a shower.</li>
            <li>It was tempting to order several of these incase they discontinue like they did their awesome dry shampoos!</li>
            <li>Even though i think the old body wash was better and the aromas much stronger, the new line is okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sorry I did.  </li>
            <li>So much bubbles!</li>
            <li>But not overly of one or the other- just an amazing combination.</li>
            <li>Skin is clean, soft, and silky after every use.</li>
            <li>I tend to break out easily with body washes that are too moisturizing and was worried when I first tried this, but two weeks later and not one breakout.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting like the shampoo which is very fragrant.</li>
            <li>it lathers great and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I love this product I never used it until couple months ago got a free sample in the mail I usually buy generic stuff.  </li>
            <li>Better than my more expensive body washes!</li>
            <li>The only issues, the scent is a little to light, and it smells way to much like Shampoo.</li>
            <li>….it lasts all day long and it has such a sweet smelling scent.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product but just let down at how little it lathers.</li>
            <li>I love how a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I usually use it after I have already used my Dove deep clean soap,,to add a lil scent.</li>
            <li>I probably would not buy w/o coupon or markdown,paid less than $3 for this,,seems reasonable,,</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Oh my how long i&#x27;ve been waiting for Herbal Essence to come back out with their body wash line.</li>
            <li> However, i can only use it in the warmer weather because my skin gets dry since I sometimes shower twice a day due to working out/exercising!</li>
            <li> I wanted this because I love the smell of roses, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad but should smell like roses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the smell of this- same scent as the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> but the scent was weak.</li>

            <li> Smells strange...like penicillin.</li>
            <li> Smell like a butterfly from the most amazing garden of all time. All I can say is FINALLY!!! I loooove their hair care, and now I can love my skin as much as my hair after a bath or a shower. It smells so fruity and floral. But not overly of one or the other- just an amazing combination. You will thank yourself for buying this! Skin is clean, soft, and silky after every use. If only they&#x27;d make a lotion to go with it... HEAR THAT HERBAL ESSENCES? WE WANT LOTION, TOO!!</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash. Cleans wonderfully! However, i can only use it in the warmer weather because my skin gets dry since I sometimes shower twice a day due to working out/exercising!</li>
            <li> I wanted this because I love the smell of roses, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad but should smell like roses. It&#x27;s just ok</li>

            <li> I saw an advert for this online and instantly put it on my list of things to get while out shopping.  I&#x27;m not sorry I did.  It smells great, not too overpowering.  I tend to break out easily with body washes that are too moisturizing and was worried when I first tried this, but two weeks later and not one breakout.  Will continue to buy this.  Did I mention it smells great :)</li>
            <li> I love this product I never used it until couple months ago got a free sample in the mail I usually buy generic stuff.  This smells really good my daughter just loves to use it great product!</li>

            <li> I loooveeee this body wash!! I had not used herbal essences since the 90s and I forgot how fabulous it smells!! This has a pretty light scent that is both sweet and light rose :) it lathers great and a little goes a long way! And at a steal of a price! The scent is lasting after use.. Better than my more expensive body washes! Highly reccommend and I will be purchasing more!! :)</li>
            <li> I love all of the Herbal Essences products because the scents/fragrances are always so good.</li>
            <li> I suppose it cleaned well but the scent was weak. I was expecting like the shampoo which is very fragrant.</li>
            <li> I SMELL AMAZING this stuff is cheap and amazing. i love it</li>

            <li> Good body wash, but others I&#x27;ve used the smell on your skin lingers longer. Bubbles up well though! Smells good, and the price was right too!</li>

            <li> This product has a great lather to it. It keeps you feeling clean most of the day, and does smell like roses. The only issues, the scent is a little to light, and it smells way to much like Shampoo. Is this made with traditional body wash ingredients?</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled that Herbal Essences came out with a body wash, this stuff smells like pure heaven in a bottle. It was tempting to order several of these incase they discontinue like they did their awesome dry shampoos! I can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
