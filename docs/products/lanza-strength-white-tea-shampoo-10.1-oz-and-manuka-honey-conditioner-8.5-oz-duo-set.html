            <li>smell lasts which is impressive to me.</li>
            <li>Probably one of the best shampoo and conditioner product line on the market today.  </li>
            <li>Amazon also happens to have the best pricing on anything in the Lanza lines.</li>
            <li>GREAT VALUE Thank you!!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s really GOOD!</li>
            <li>This is another great Lanze shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Lanza products are great.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and my hair felt wonderful afterwards.</li>
            <li>Great smell</li>
            <li>Also, the scent is not that great.</li>
            <li>I loved loved loved this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>The product smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I would have loved to give this review 5 stars</li>
            <li>Smells really good.</li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo/conditioner combination.</li>
            <li>However the timing in which I recieved my purchase was very satisfying (5 stars)</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>So you can guess my excitement when I found my favorite L&#x27;Anza on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>much  more manageable!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>but it is very rich!</li>
            <li>I am so happy because my hair is damaged and fine</li>
            <li>but when i started to use this shampoo it was amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just amazing</li>
            <li>The conditioner is awesome because it is not heavy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal for the price, but if you want shiny and beautiful hair I would suggest Lanza&#x27;s moisture shampoo and conditioner in the blue bottles.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel silky smooth before applying the conditioner!</li>
            <li>This is magical potion for the hair.</li>
            <li>This is essential for me and the price is perfect!</li>
            <li>and my hair is the longest it&#x27;s ever been and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I love Lanza products.  </li>
            <li>They are sulfate free and leave my hair soft and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>Love the L&#x27;anza line since my hairdresser introduced me to it about two years ago.  </li>
            <li>This works wonders on my aging, overprocessed hair and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this shampoo and conditioner from the packaging to the product.</li>
            <li>As if that was enough the consistency of the shampoo and conditioner are wonderful!</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely in love with this combination.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love Lanza products.  </li>
            <li>I must say it&#x27;s better than Time Reset and my hair always looks shiny, bouncy and healthy after each use.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love how this shampoo and conditioner leave my hair smelling and feeling....</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it :)</li>
            <li>Loved this at first.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, although it is pricey but totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I switched my hairdresser and could not find L&#x27;Anza easily.  </li>
            <li>Just takes a little to make a great lather!</li>
            <li>An amazing shampoo at a much lower price than any salon.</li>
            <li>and they do a fabulous job.  </li>
            <li>The price for this product was very good compared to other websites and stores.</li>
            <li>Today I tried Wen for the first time with hopes that my hair would be even better.  </li>
            <li>I love the shampoo, but the conditioner I couldn&#x27;t see so much results...</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re not use to a sulfate free shampoo, then this one is a good transition because it does lather unlike other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li>My color stays more vibrant and “fresh” looking allowing me to stretch the time between my appointments by a week or so.  </li>
            <li>Both products have a mild scent – not floral or like perfume – and leave my hair just smelling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started losing my natural shine and after using this product my hair is back to its original state, it is truly amazing, I recommend this product to every woman!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price for the healing properties for your hair.</li>
            <li>Frequent trims keep my hair in pretty good shape, but color can be drying and I need a shampoo that’s mild and not going to leave my hair feeling dry and straw-like.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast, on a holiday at that!</li>
            <li>I first tried this product out at my salon, it was the voluminizing  shampoo that comes in the orange bottle</li>
            <li>Definitely better than the regular shampoo&#x27;s you&#x27;d buy at a Walmart or a pharmacy store.</li>
            <li>it is consistent as I like but when enter in contact with my hair looks not so much concentrated.</li>
            <li>This White Tea shampoo is very gentle and the sulfate free formula is not loaded with detergent that will cause my color to fade.  </li>
            <li>I jumped in the shower when it arrived and the caps were easy to open and close, which sometimes is a problem.</li>
            <li>It really has made a difference in my hair, it has grown longer.</li>
            <li>really like the L’ANZA line, but they’re not immune to hype.  </li>
            <li>Greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>My whole life I used over the counter items nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very damage</li>
            <li>and I was losing so much hair all the time no matter what.</li>
            <li>and I think is already time to say that really works.</li>
            <li>After much research, I discovered L&#x27;Anza.</li>
            <li>FAST Shipping and carefully packed for safe shipping.</li>
            <li>And many other ingredients that I thought were sulfate a?</li>
            <li>It is ok, but not sure it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo &amp; only need to use a small amount!</li>
            <li>This is a product I can highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed, I had to use my old conditioner.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is my questioning the &#x27;sulfate free&#x27; claim on the bottle yet the second ingredient was sodium olefin sulfonate?</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and much cheaper than buying it in the salon!</li>
            <li>I have super fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>but I have been buying this particular shampoo because my hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo and conditioner, it feels so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in Southern CA and it can really do a number on the hair.</li>
            <li>I use this Lanza religiously this is the real thing not a knock off.</li>
            <li>After shampooing my hair is soft</li>
            <li>Lanza is better than any of the more expensive products I have tried so I am trying to replace all of my other products with Lanza ones.</li>
            <li>And while the shampoo is sulfate free, it does contain ingredients (chemicals) that perform in the same manner as sulfates do, so it comes down to semantics.  </li>
            <li>It may not sound like much, but if saves me time and money and over the course of a year it really adds up.  </li>
            <li>I used this product five years ago, and constantly received complements on the natural shine and texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love Lanza products but this is one that I cannot get behind.</li>
            <li>no split ends not dry and crispy at the end</li>

            <li> no split ends not dry and crispy at the end</li>
            <li> In fact I think I have ordered a new product every week for the past 3 or 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried using other product lines but always come back to Lanza.  </li>
            <li> My hair is on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> My hair was so dry</li>
            <li> Also helped me a lot with my dry ends!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After the 3rd use, seemed to build up or leave a slight film.</li>
            <li> I do not get that dry rough feeling.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> It is not even close, my hair looks extremely tangled and frizzy with the Wen product.  </li>
            <li> The Manuka Honey conditioner provides moisture without weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Half what I would pay at my salon.</li>
            <li> After using this, my hair became dull and dry.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for a few minutes while I shower</li>
            <li> I was afraid they would drive busted but seller took the time to individually tape the cap and bubble wrap the bubbles.</li>
            <li> If you are a product hoarder like I am them you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> and it started to become weak.</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering on Amazon for fear of getting a fake product, but this stuff seemed legit.</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive, but it gets results.  </li>
            <li> but the ends would be horribly damaged</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is another great Lanze shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is on the dry side.  After using this shampoo and conditioner, it feels so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Love it!  The best hair products I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of shampoo and conditioner. My reason for a one star is because they sent me two bottles of shampoo when I was supposed to recieve one shampoo and one conditioner. I was very dissapointed, I had to use my old conditioner. However the timing in which I recieved my purchase was very satisfying (5 stars) I would have loved to give this review 5 stars but I couldn&#x27;t because I didn&#x27;t recieve what I purchased. The price for this product was very good compared to other websites and stores.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! It really has made a difference in my hair, it has grown longer. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it either, it lathers wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I used this product five years ago, and constantly received complements on the natural shine and texture of my hair.  I loved loved loved this stuff!!  I switched my hairdresser and could not find L&#x27;Anza easily.  Today I tried Wen for the first time with hopes that my hair would be even better.  It is not even close, my hair looks extremely tangled and frizzy with the Wen product.  So you can guess my excitement when I found my favorite L&#x27;Anza on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love! Smells really good. And if you&#x27;re not use to a sulfate free shampoo, then this one is a good transition because it does lather unlike other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li> Loved this at first. After the 3rd use, seemed to build up or leave a slight film. Lanza products are great. I think you need a clarifying shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, on a holiday at that! The product is excellent. Makes hair feel silky smooth before applying the conditioner!</li>
            <li> I’ve been using L’ANZA products for years and this shampoo and conditioner combo is a staple in my arsenal of hair care products.  I have color treated hair that I shampoo and heat style daily.  Frequent trims keep my hair in pretty good shape, but color can be drying and I need a shampoo that’s mild and not going to leave my hair feeling dry and straw-like.  This White Tea shampoo is very gentle and the sulfate free formula is not loaded with detergent that will cause my color to fade.  The Manuka Honey conditioner provides moisture without weighing my hair down.  Both products have a mild scent – not floral or like perfume – and leave my hair just smelling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the L’ANZA line, but they’re not immune to hype.  Referring to this product as “anti-aging” strikes me as a bit of a gimmick, “anti-aging” seems to be the industry buzzword these days and should be taken with a grain of salt.  And while the shampoo is sulfate free, it does contain ingredients (chemicals) that perform in the same manner as sulfates do, so it comes down to semantics.  I’m not a chemist, all I can tell you is that regular use of these products extends the life of my salon color.  My color stays more vibrant and “fresh” looking allowing me to stretch the time between my appointments by a week or so.  It may not sound like much, but if saves me time and money and over the course of a year it really adds up.  This is a product I can highly recommend.</li>
            <li> did not like the smell at all.</li>
            <li> An amazing shampoo at a much lower price than any salon. Well worth the price for the healing properties for your hair.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo &amp; only need to use a small amount!</li>
            <li> It is ok, but not sure it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo/conditioner combination. The smell is nice and my hair felt wonderful afterwards. I was worried about ordering on Amazon for fear of getting a fake product, but this stuff seemed legit. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is my questioning the &#x27;sulfate free&#x27; claim on the bottle yet the second ingredient was sodium olefin sulfonate? And many other ingredients that I thought were sulfate a?</li>
            <li> This is magical potion for the hair. My hair was so dry and now it&#x27;s so soft and silky. I&#x27;m in Southern CA and it can really do a number on the hair. This is essential for me and the price is perfect! Half what I would pay at my salon. Thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> I was afraid they would drive busted but seller took the time to individually tape the cap and bubble wrap the bubbles. Thank you! Greatly appreciated. I use this Lanza religiously this is the real thing not a knock off. My whole life I used over the counter items nothing worked.  I have super fine thin hair. Always wanted to grow out my hair but the ends would be horribly damaged so I would have to chop it off. I decided to give this Lanza a try. My ends are all repaired no split ends not dry and crispy at the end and my hair is the longest it&#x27;s ever been and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I just try this product because the reviews that I read here. It&#x27;s really GOOD! OMG!!! My hair was very damage and I was losing so much hair all the time no matter what. I have been using this product for two weeks now and I think is already time to say that really works. My hair fells an look health and shine. Also helped me a lot with my dry ends!&lt;br /&gt;I definitively recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I ve  been using it for 3 years now and there is nothing like it in the market! Best product ever!!!</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo, but the conditioner I couldn&#x27;t see so much results... it is consistent as I like but when enter in contact with my hair looks not so much concentrated.</li>
            <li> I love Lanza products.  They are sulfate free and leave my hair soft and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love the L&#x27;anza line since my hairdresser introduced me to it about two years ago.  This works wonders on my aging, overprocessed hair and I love the scent.  It may seem expensive, but it gets results.  And, you only need to use about a dime-size amount on shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this shampoo and conditioner from the packaging to the product. I jumped in the shower when it arrived and the caps were easy to open and close, which sometimes is a problem. The product smells AMAZING! As if that was enough the consistency of the shampoo and conditioner are wonderful! If you are a product hoarder like I am them you know what I mean. After shampooing my hair is soft I do not get that dry rough feeling. A little goes a long way as well. The conditioner is awesome because it is not heavy but it is very rich! I let it sit for a few minutes while I shower and when I rinse my hair feels like silk .The smell lasts which is impressive to me. Once I am done I follow up with the healing moisture leave in and I am absolutely in love with this combination. Lanza is better than any of the more expensive products I have tried so I am trying to replace all of my other products with Lanza ones. In fact I think I have ordered a new product every week for the past 3 or 4 weeks. I am so happy because my hair is damaged and fine so if you are thinking about buying Lanza DO IT!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Lanza products.  Probably one of the best shampoo and conditioner product line on the market today.  Great smell and they do a fabulous job.  Have used Lanza for years.  I have tried using other product lines but always come back to Lanza.  Amazon also happens to have the best pricing on anything in the Lanza lines.</li>
            <li> Ever since Redkin discontinued their Time Reset hair line I&#x27;ve been in despair. After much research, I discovered L&#x27;Anza. I must say it&#x27;s better than Time Reset and my hair always looks shiny, bouncy and healthy after each use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love how this shampoo and conditioner leave my hair smelling and feeling....much  more manageable!</li>
            <li> After using this, my hair became dull and dry. Also, the scent is not that great. I love Lanza products but this is one that I cannot get behind. It&#x27;s a great deal for the price, but if you want shiny and beautiful hair I would suggest Lanza&#x27;s moisture shampoo and conditioner in the blue bottles.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and much cheaper than buying it in the salon!</li>
            <li> I had my hair damaged but when i started to use this shampoo it was amazing. My hair shined, smoother, softer but not greasy.I recommend 100 %.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, although it is pricey but totally worth every penny! I first tried this product out at my salon, it was the voluminizing  shampoo that comes in the orange bottle and it&#x27;s just amazing but I have been buying this particular shampoo because my hair is very fine and thin and it started to become weak. I started losing my natural shine and after using this product my hair is back to its original state, it is truly amazing, I recommend this product to every woman! Definitely better than the regular shampoo&#x27;s you&#x27;d buy at a Walmart or a pharmacy store. Absolutely love it :)</li>
            <li> FAST Shipping and carefully packed for safe shipping. ALL AS DESCRIBED. GREAT VALUE Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! Makes my hair look, feel, and smell great! Just takes a little to make a great lather!</li>
