            <li>The smell is pleasant and it didn&#x27;t stain anything.</li>
            <li>The fact that it doesn&#x27;t make me look orange, especially on my fair skin, is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>The bottle was good size</li>
            <li>All in all this was a good product that I could see myself countining to use.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and haven&#x27;t found a tanner yet until this one.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work on fair skinned people.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give the tanner a fair chance</li>
            <li>I just rubbed it in good, like you would with a serum and voila.</li>
            <li>I have fair to medium skin</li>
            <li>I was not expecting this to be as good as it was, think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li>This tanner covers lightly with excellent results.</li>
            <li>my makeup and the result was a gorgeous tan and glow.</li>
            <li>Good stuff here.</li>
            <li>I think it blends very easily and gives a really great hint of color.</li>
            <li>I remove the top, put some on my fingers and spread it mostly on my cheeks and T zone for an Awesome Bronzy Glow.</li>
            <li>This product actually is extraordinary and it is affordable!!!  </li>
            <li>The self tanner is a great product, it is not greasy or sticky like most self tanners.</li>
            <li>Feels good to have a nice tan in December.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this as I am very fair.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>

            <li>You can imagine with the skin problems I&#x27;ve had how I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is one totally great item I am so glad that I got this because I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a couple months since I purchased my own Bronzbody bottle</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still loving it.</li>
            <li>This was sent to me at a discount for my honest review. . .</li>
            <li>I did not notice its &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; capabilities, to be honest.</li>
            <li>In any case, it&#x27;s a nice &amp;#34;bronzing veil&amp;#34; but no way a self tanner, as it claims to be, hence 3 stars.</li>
            <li>After working in the beauty industry for over 5 years, I have tried almost every product on the market, including foundations, mascara, skincare and more than my fair share of self tanners.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am thrilled that I gave this product a chance.  </li>
            <li>A nice, even bronze tan in the matter of one minute.</li>
            <li>liked that it did not turn my face orange.</li>
            <li>I always liked the way that looked.</li>
            <li>I always liked the way that looked.</li>
            <li>Nice color, and goes on evenly.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice scent and bronze color you can see when you apply.</li>
            <li>It gave me nice color that can be built on.  </li>
            <li>It gave me a nice tanned look with a nice-looking glow.  </li>
            <li>receiveda his product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and it in no way influenced my decision.</li>
            <li>Color was nice but didn&#x27;t matter that it was a mist because still need cotton ball or gloves to apply.</li>
            <li>I found that I liked the application best by spraying hands and then wiping it on my face rather than spraying it directly on my face.</li>
            <li>I am naturally fair skinned and burn easily.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was surprised and impressed.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>very nice light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>No irritation ( I have sensitive eczema skin) and best of all, I have a healthy looking glow.    </li>
            <li>More natural and just beautiful when applied!</li>
            <li>First one worked great??  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I picked this product for my first sunless tanning experience</li>
            <li>This self tanner is easy to blend and develops nicely into an even bronzed glow.</li>
            <li>Incredible color, stays on for awhile, doesn&#x27;t make me break out and is so natural looking!</li>
            <li>I wish the packaging was nicer, it doesn&#x27;t fit the product!</li>
            <li>This is an okay product.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t, be sure to use a nail brush to get the product out of the area around your finger nails.</li>
            <li>and I feel so much better about myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many drug store brands like Jergen&#x27;s, L&#x27;Oreal and Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I love the color.</li>
            <li>Nice, yet doesn&#x27;t spray even or lightly, use your fingertips to blending hairline. ..</li>
            <li>Would suggest to use a Self tanning mitt as it help you to apply the mist in more even fashion.</li>
            <li>Make sure to moisturize your skin often to extend the life of your Mist Self Tanner.</li>
            <li>but I was able to work with that by mixing it with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Need more and cant find it.</li>
            <li>My face never looked so healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li>Ok face tanner.</li>
            <li>but there are so many self tanning products on the market.</li>
            <li>And I am so glad that I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I was terrified of trying another self tanner, I am so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>I will be getting a refill for sure  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>so when you spray it in your hands you have to make sure your hands are over the sink</li>
            <li>This product was fantastic!</li>
            <li>It goes on light and gives amazing color.</li>
            <li>Sure, I&#x27;d love a tan.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions and they all broke me out, or did not give the color I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Glow face tanning towels which are phenomenal.</li>
            <li>If I felt like I needed more after applying it to my face than I would add another pump onto my fingers.</li>
            <li>so I added some more because I didn&#x27;t know if I was supposed to wait or not.</li>
            <li>It looked healthy and my skin looked sun kissed.</li>
            <li>After applying this, be sure to wash your hands with soap.</li>
            <li>It looked healthy and my skin looked sun kissed.</li>
            <li>After applying this, be sure to wash your hands with soap.</li>
            <li>but as for actual product was very happy!</li>
            <li>I am not one to think looking like a leather bag is appealing, so I refrain.</li>
            <li>I have also used on my legs and love it as they are transparent also.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; would recommend.</li>
            <li>Works ok.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to rub the product into my skin thoroughly so it would look even, and I washed my hands immediately after applying because I did notice a brown tint on my fingers.</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle had instructions and more information on the product, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I have finally found the perfect face tanner.  </li>
            <li>I have been using MIST since the fall  and people compliment all the time on how healthy my skin looks.</li>
            <li>so you can see where you are putting it better.</li>
            <li>so the spray is more of a nuance.</li>
            <li>I thought that this product was just okay.</li>
            <li>This stuff is easy to use and works great, my face looks tan and not fake or blotchy.  </li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and my girlfriend seems very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, easy and gives great results.</li>
            <li>First the product has no smell which is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so thrilled that the claims were true...</li>
            <li>and it looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>- looks great so far!</li>
            <li>I love the color this gives me with just a light spray.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth almost radiant look I get from this bronzer.  </li>
            <li>Gave me a great even tone, and looked completely natural.</li>
            <li>Works great and looks so natural</li>
            <li>I adore the fact that it is healthy and free of toxins, this is important to me for sure.</li>
            <li>Great for a natural looking ran on your face.</li>
            <li>Unlike most of the reviewers, I was not given this product for free, I bought it myself.</li>
            <li>I did like it to spray directly to my chest, that gave me really great results.</li>
            <li>It was very easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on.</li>
            <li>I noticed a color difference very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and rub into my skin.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and rub into my skin.</li>
            <li>Application was so easy</li>
            <li>It was easy to see where I had applied</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>It does in fact blend easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.</li>
            <li>What I like: Goes on easy.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I just had to leave a review!</li>
            <li>This bottle seemed like the packaging on the front was homemade and printed off someone&#x27;s computer, which is fine, but made me wonder before putting it on my face.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>So many products claim to deliver extraordinary results</li>
            <li>The product came quickly and was well packaged also!  </li>
            <li>This turns your face a gorgeous brown - very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I had to play with it a little to figure out to apply best for me.  </li>
            <li>Probably better for VERY FAIR girls who can&#x27;t use regular tanner, but I have olive skin tone and this did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>It felt light and watery, not oily.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this bronzer, it&#x27;s not too over powering</li>
            <li>The color was a nice light color so needed a second application, and had nice tanned look.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, blends well with skin tone and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>The Tanner/Bronzer went on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>As I sit here in bed writing this review, my face feels baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>Women want to look and feel great but don&#x27;t always have the time to spend time lounging outdoors or running in and out of a tanning bed several days a week.  </li>
            <li>But regardless, it&#x27;s just a fantastic product</li>
            <li>I think it is important to include this type of information with the product</li>
            <li>The couple times I have used it I really liked it, but I was apprehensive about using it too much for that over tanned look.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Detailed directions 3.</li>
            <li>I enjoy playing sports</li>
            <li>Now I have an even and smooth looking tan.</li>
            <li>Paraben free.</li>
            <li>This product has been good to me so far.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, be sure to rub it in and exfoliate first to prevent orange</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wash your hands right away.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I used a very light hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The product is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Had to use a pumice stone to get the color off my hands but was only partially successful.</li>
            <li>Rich tan after  1time use..</li>
            <li>Love that it is not at all orange in color and has no weird odor either.  </li>
            <li>so I was really excited to try the MIST self tanner and bronzer on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have never had any luck with self tanners in the past, but this stuff is really great!</li>
            <li>Hands come clean when washed immediately.</li>
            <li>It spreads smoothly and evenly and I would recommend it for a quick glow to your face and neck.</li>
            <li>As with most self tanners, if applying with your hands, moisturize your hands first and rub the product in quickly.</li>
            <li>but they did it right!</li>
            <li>, right!  </li>
            <li>So nice and natural.</li>
            <li>Second one is going on..weird color..not nearly as good??</li>
            <li>As I mentioned above, whenever I have tried self tanning products, they make my fair skin look orange or a color of tan that is unnatural.  </li>
            <li>The color was instant and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper and is darker and works better.</li>
            <li>I love it and it shipped amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>This bottle arrived on time (early in fact) after I purchased it for a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a couple of days, so I cannot say if the self tanner aspect of the product works well or not, but I will update my review when I have used it for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I have such fair skin and just about everything I use breaks out my face.</li>
            <li>It gives you a nice, even, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I did.&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as St. Tropez, but I would consider it a close second.</li>
            <li>No bad smell..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and gives the prettiest, most natural glow.</li>
            <li>Other than that, goes on great and no breakouts/residue under makeup.</li>
            <li>Other spray tanners I&#x27;ve used have irritated my skin but this one was Great..</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great about this product is that I have full control of how dark I want my tan</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more:)</li>
            <li>Dries super quickly, and you can put makeup on almost immediately after applying it.  </li>
            <li>Dries quick.</li>
            <li>Although, effective in producing an instant tan, I noticed a significant darkening &amp; intensifying effect on my liver or age spots which remained even after tan wore off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as the spray booth products and lasts just as long.</li>
            <li>Lastly this is a great constancy, not thick and oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I am not allergic to - and it works!</li>
            <li>I just love that it is natural and made here in the U.S. too!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It gets dark on my light skin fairly quickly so one or two times a week are pretty good for me.</li>
            <li>The color is pleasant and not orange like other tanning products.  </li>
            <li>She mentioned that she had been using Mist by Bronz Body for a few weeks and had been very happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s not over the top brown, so looks natural.</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li>I would prefer it to be more of a mist than a direct squirt.</li>
            <li>that being said I felt like it was much better for me because it was all natural</li>
            <li>My palms are callused, and even though I washed my hands after applying my calluses remained very tanned :)  I HIGHLY recommend this product!  .</li>
            <li>The color is nice but does not last.</li>
            <li>I spray it into my palm first the n spread quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;During a recent girls night out, I asked my friend where she had been vacationing, assuming that her gorgeous tan was a result of some exotic week long cruise or trip.  </li>
            <li>However, you need to wash your hands right away because it will stain your hands if you aren&#x27;t wearing gloves.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job right away.  </li>
            <li>I used my hands for application and it washed right off.  </li>
            <li>(I did wash them RIGHT after I used it).</li>
            <li>When I received this product I wanted to try it right away.</li>
            <li>that I wondered if I did it right.</li>
            <li>You have to mix it with lotion and the lotion dilutes it, so it takes longer to figure out the right lotion to spray ratio to get the right amount of tan.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried thus far because I literally can&#x27;t tell I have self tanner on usually...</li>
            <li>I could once again feel myself falling into the trap of trying another beauty product but could not get past how perfect and natural her tan looked.  </li>
            <li>It sprays on easily and looks very natural..</li>
            <li>it looks natural and so easy to use</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly and the color was completely even.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly and the color was completely even.</li>
            <li>For someone with sensitive skin that burns easily, this stuff is where it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li>Happy to have finally found something that created a natural bronze, without hurting my very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It is extremely light on the skin and provides a very natural looking sun-kissed look on your face.  </li>
            <li>I like this Mist product very much.</li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt for a facial tanner and have now found my new favorite!  </li>
            <li>I used it on my hand first to test it.  </li>
            <li>(and I DO have sensitive skin, mind you) and it gives me the most natural, golden glow.</li>
            <li>Before using this or any self tanner make sure to exfoliate about 24 hours before you plan to use product such as this.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Mist Oil Free Self Tanner And Bronzer For The Face.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>With an awesome color, feel, scent, and price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li>Going forward, Mist will definitely be one of my top 10</li>
            <li>I tried this face tanner out for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>LOVE this facial tanner!</li>
            <li>I forgot all about that and did not wash my hands after applying this my first time.</li>
            <li>I forgot all about that and did not wash my hands after applying this my first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now used it a few times, and am really impressed by the color and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a sunless tanner</li>
            <li>so just be aware of that when you use it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it had more of a tint</li>
            <li>, kinda looked funny.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This did nothing for me and the first time I used it all the writing on bottle smeared into a bunch of nothing</li>
            <li>sent the company a mail inquiring when it would be available and they got back to me quickly with the info I wanted to hear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on differently, thinner than water and it will darken pretty fast the first time so be sure to spread it out well.</li>
            <li>Now, as a male in his late 30&#x27;s this is the best product I have used.</li>
            <li>I notice that all the &amp;#34;sponsored&amp;#34; products have unbelievably positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several tanning products in the past but this particular spray tan mist is the best because I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>for a spray bronzer, this looks really close to the real deal!</li>
            <li>When I first used it though, the spray really struggled to come out of the bottle and did not spray evenly.</li>
            <li>have remotely fair skin, and despite it being winter (and feeling a little on the pale side), when I put this product on, it gives me such a healthy tint, that I feel confident without makeup when I have it on.</li>
            <li>application is easy and non-greasy, you simply spray it onto your hands and rub on your face.  </li>
            <li>I am a person that is very particular about what I put on my face.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the fact that it&#x27;s been a very mild summer in the mid-west, so tanning regularly just isn&#x27;t gonna happen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pale and this gives me a nice tan quickly and it looks very natural with no streaking.</li>
            <li>At first when I sprayed this into my hands, I was worried it was going to be way too dark on my face, so I tried on the top of my arm first.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very runny; the consistency is the same as water, so it&#x27;s not as easy to apply as you might think.</li>
            <li>Gives a very ruddy/reddish tan vs an olive color that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>I really like this spray.</li>
            <li>Within minutes you can really see a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The scent of the product is light and minimal: nofake or obnoxious pina colada or coconut odors,  While I understand the concept behind making a product smell nice for a consumer, I want to be able to smell the perfume that I chose to wear over the self tanner that I am using.  </li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>Looks like a real tan and no smell at all.</li>
            <li>product is very liquid</li>
            <li>This self-tanner really does work.</li>
            <li>so you need to use a glove for sure.. even with a glove, though, it really isnt worth the trouble (try a lotion or something</li>
            <li>It really does go on very even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally very oily and this does not add to that.</li>
            <li>Then head straight to the sink to wash it off, no prob.</li>
            <li>The mist itself felt really sticky</li>
            <li>My husband said I applied too much and being that it is February</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It worked really well</li>
            <li>and this is definitely the most natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I have used it just a few times, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if I could use it everyday, or if it washes off at the end of the day, or if it builds up over time and leaves a nice tanned looked.</li>
            <li>This tanner is easy to use, very natural looking and lasts several days.</li>
            <li>There are never streaks and clean up is as simple as washing your hands.  </li>
            <li>I then spilled the bottle open when trying to clean up and</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was skeptical at first but this self tanner is great.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I forget to wash my hands after applying self tanner and luckily, with this one, my hands didn&#x27;t get really orange and gross.</li>
            <li>This self-tanner gives me a deep natural tan that I can easily control.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product based on the reviews, but I was very let down.</li>
            <li>Looks a bit purple when it is on initially, but not a bad product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the size of the bottle I will say I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth double the original price.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply because of the spray bottle, i was just nervous spraying my face with my eyes closed.</li>
            <li>I would just caution super white girls to use this sparingly or do a test patch before applying all over the face.</li>
            <li>The only makeup I had to put on to go out last night was mascara! :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try this...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product along with a body spray tan to match your face.</li>
            <li>In high school, I always wanted a tan like my friends but trying always ended in disaster.</li>
            <li>I find the application to be high maintenance.</li>
            <li>Make sure you mix with water or it is a little too tan.</li>
            <li>product was easy to use and was not greasy or oily like other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>There weren&#x27;t directions as to how much or how often to apply so naturally, I over applied.</li>
            <li>This product provides instant gratification and the 30 seconds it takes to apply is well worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I tried it a few more times, attempting to use the sprayer instead.</li>
            <li>It did not look nice but at least it was not my face.</li>
            <li>It did not look nice but at least it was not my face.</li>
            <li>However,  this winter has been harsh and I am looking a lot more like Casper than anything, so I said why not?</li>
            <li>If you over do it the natural color seems to become more red maroon rather than red tan.</li>
            <li>And another Plus, it has no icky smell, no fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not a complaint, but it sticks with you.</li>
            <li>Exfoliation removes old &amp; dead skin cells which allows the Mist Self Tanner to better absorb.</li>
            <li>I should start off by saying that I have porcelain  and very, very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I tend to break out or get a rash from everything.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have tried at least twenty facial self-tanners and this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that has both a great color and does not leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>After having applied it hours before, I was streaked where I touched my face and around my mouth was natural color!  </li>
            <li>so it apparently looks real.</li>
            <li>Have me a lightly tanned look with no streaking or mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay though because when I finally noticed I was tanner, it looked natural and was not too dark.</li>
            <li>Like that the product is easy to use, and it has no strong scent.</li>
            <li>I like the product but one thing I could change would be the packaging.... seems a little on cheap side</li>
            <li>So happy I found this product and love that it does not have nasty chemicals on it.</li>
            <li>It left absolutely no streaks, which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the natural color it gives my face and neck without making me look orange.  </li>
            <li>So far, no break outs (NO Pimples emerging),</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li>have self-tanned at nearly every salon and used almost every product</li>
            <li>I really hope it gets back on Amazon soon!</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive that just about anything I use on it causes a break out.  </li>
            <li>color looks natural.  </li>
            <li>product feels natural.  </li>
            <li>The liquid was light enough to spread evenly and dried very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, it was so natural looking</li>
            <li>However, it looked so natural that no one else would have any idea that I used something.</li>
            <li>However, it looked so natural that no one else would have any idea that I used something.</li>
            <li>the self tanner looks quite natural although I would not apply too often.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spray it directly on my face; therefore, I sprayed it into my hands and rubbed it into my face and neck.</li>
            <li>My skin looked natural and even.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if I just received a old bottle</li>
            <li>I find the Palmers Instant Bronzer Moisturizer to be much easier to use than this product</li>
            <li>Been using this Product for the last few weeks and have Really enjoyed its consistency..</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.kin was darker a few hours later when I went into the restroom.  </li>
            <li>This is mostly because I&#x27;m so pale and white that self tanners make me turn orange and blotchy.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of a face-friendly tanner that comes in a cute little travel bottle, but this turned me from porcelain to Jersey Shore brown, and that looks really weird when your face is super dark but the rest of your body is translucent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Tan Towels or Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical with this product as most of the other tanning products I&#x27;ve loved have been lotions.</li>
            <li>I spray a small amount on my face and use one of those triangle sponges to smooth and even it out.  </li>
            <li>ok, so maybe I am not good at reading directions; that said, this stuff made me look tanned until I had lunch.</li>
            <li>I really do not intend to use this product again after the first couple of applications.  </li>
            <li>First will see how long this bottle will last me.</li>
            <li>but it actually looks natural and wears off naturally too  </li>
            <li>this one is VERY messy.. got all over the sink right off the bat, stained my hands VERY VERY quickly and VERY dark</li>
            <li>but maybe the fact that it does not smell like all the other self tanners is what exactly reveals that it is not a self tanner but just another cosmetic &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; of sorts that is supposed to wash away immediately?</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have had similar dismal results with other popular self-tanners like Fake Bake and St Tropez, so it might just be me since I&#x27;m the common denominator here.</li>
            <li>so when I applied, barely anything came on my face.</li>
            <li>I can tell this bottle is going to last me even with frequent use.</li>
            <li>This does look dark brown at first when it comes out of the bottle, which was concerning to me.</li>
            <li>The color is natural (but not that deep), though, and there&#x27;s no smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried better and worse.  </li>
            <li>This still isn&#x27;t dramatic enough for me and it will settle on dry spots if you do not exfoliate before applying, but I am able to get some color out of it if I apply very liberally.  </li>
            <li>The only negative thing I have to say is that I rubbed it in and it very quickly stained my fingers so I would recommend using gloves or a facial pad to apply</li>
            <li>What a powerful little bronzer!</li>
            <li>(I usually apply right before bed).  </li>
            <li>I know the risk of sun over-exposure and since I have rather sensitive skin (spent my share of days covered in aloe), I generally opt to stay inside/</li>

            <li> Maybe it would work on fair skinned people.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give the tanner a fair chance</li>
            <li> I just rubbed it in good, like you would with a serum and voila.</li>
            <li> I have fair to medium skin</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this to be as good as it was, think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This tanner covers lightly with excellent results.</li>
            <li> my makeup and the result was a gorgeous tan and glow.</li>
            <li> Good stuff here.</li>
            <li> I think it blends very easily and gives a really great hint of color.</li>
            <li> I remove the top, put some on my fingers and spread it mostly on my cheeks and T zone for an Awesome Bronzy Glow.</li>
            <li> This product actually is extraordinary and it is affordable!!!  </li>
            <li> The self tanner is a great product, it is not greasy or sticky like most self tanners.</li>
            <li> Feels good to have a nice tan in December.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this as I am very fair.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It smells okay and doesnt leave any streaks!</li>
            <li> and this is the first self tanner that looks great and doesn&#x27;t give me an allergic reaction!</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner!</li>
            <li> Will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> but I am so glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Love this face bronzer!</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t overwhelming and no orange spots!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this more than I thought!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I put it on instead of makeup and it looks even better!</li>
            <li> You can imagine with the skin problems I&#x27;ve had how I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is one totally great item I am so glad that I got this because I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a couple months since I purchased my own Bronzbody bottle</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still loving it.</li>
            <li> This was sent to me at a discount for my honest review. . .</li>
            <li> I did not notice its &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; capabilities, to be honest.</li>
            <li> In any case, it&#x27;s a nice &amp;#34;bronzing veil&amp;#34; but no way a self tanner, as it claims to be, hence 3 stars.</li>
            <li> After working in the beauty industry for over 5 years, I have tried almost every product on the market, including foundations, mascara, skincare and more than my fair share of self tanners.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am thrilled that I gave this product a chance.  </li>
            <li> A nice, even bronze tan in the matter of one minute.</li>
            <li> liked that it did not turn my face orange.</li>
            <li> I always liked the way that looked.</li>
            <li> I always liked the way that looked.</li>
            <li> Nice color, and goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice scent and bronze color you can see when you apply.</li>
            <li> It gave me nice color that can be built on.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a nice tanned look with a nice-looking glow.  </li>
            <li> receiveda his product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and it in no way influenced my decision.</li>
            <li> Color was nice but didn&#x27;t matter that it was a mist because still need cotton ball or gloves to apply.</li>
            <li> I found that I liked the application best by spraying hands and then wiping it on my face rather than spraying it directly on my face.</li>
            <li> I am naturally fair skinned and burn easily.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was surprised and impressed.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> very nice light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> No irritation ( I have sensitive eczema skin) and best of all, I have a healthy looking glow.    </li>
            <li> More natural and just beautiful when applied!</li>
            <li> First one worked great??  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I picked this product for my first sunless tanning experience</li>
            <li> This self tanner is easy to blend and develops nicely into an even bronzed glow.</li>
            <li> Incredible color, stays on for awhile, doesn&#x27;t make me break out and is so natural looking!</li>
            <li> I wish the packaging was nicer, it doesn&#x27;t fit the product!</li>
            <li> This is an okay product.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t, be sure to use a nail brush to get the product out of the area around your finger nails.</li>
            <li> and I feel so much better about myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many drug store brands like Jergen&#x27;s, L&#x27;Oreal and Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I love the color.</li>
            <li> Nice, yet doesn&#x27;t spray even or lightly, use your fingertips to blending hairline. ..</li>
            <li> Would suggest to use a Self tanning mitt as it help you to apply the mist in more even fashion.</li>
            <li> Make sure to moisturize your skin often to extend the life of your Mist Self Tanner.</li>
            <li> but I was able to work with that by mixing it with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Need more and cant find it.</li>
            <li> My face never looked so healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li> Ok face tanner.</li>
            <li> but there are so many self tanning products on the market.</li>
            <li> And I am so glad that I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I was terrified of trying another self tanner, I am so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> I will be getting a refill for sure  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> so when you spray it in your hands you have to make sure your hands are over the sink</li>
            <li> This product was fantastic!</li>
            <li> It goes on light and gives amazing color.</li>
            <li> Sure, I&#x27;d love a tan.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions and they all broke me out, or did not give the color I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Glow face tanning towels which are phenomenal.</li>
            <li> If I felt like I needed more after applying it to my face than I would add another pump onto my fingers.</li>
            <li> so I added some more because I didn&#x27;t know if I was supposed to wait or not.</li>
            <li> It looked healthy and my skin looked sun kissed.</li>
            <li> After applying this, be sure to wash your hands with soap.</li>
            <li> It looked healthy and my skin looked sun kissed.</li>
            <li> After applying this, be sure to wash your hands with soap.</li>
            <li> but as for actual product was very happy!</li>
            <li> I am not one to think looking like a leather bag is appealing, so I refrain.</li>
            <li> I have also used on my legs and love it as they are transparent also.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works ok.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to rub the product into my skin thoroughly so it would look even, and I washed my hands immediately after applying because I did notice a brown tint on my fingers.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle had instructions and more information on the product, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have finally found the perfect face tanner.  </li>
            <li> I have been using MIST since the fall  and people compliment all the time on how healthy my skin looks.</li>
            <li> so you can see where you are putting it better.</li>
            <li> so the spray is more of a nuance.</li>
            <li> I thought that this product was just okay.</li>
            <li> This stuff is easy to use and works great, my face looks tan and not fake or blotchy.  </li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and my girlfriend seems very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, easy and gives great results.</li>
            <li> First the product has no smell which is good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so thrilled that the claims were true...</li>
            <li> and it looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> - looks great so far!</li>
            <li> I love the color this gives me with just a light spray.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth almost radiant look I get from this bronzer.  </li>
            <li> Gave me a great even tone, and looked completely natural.</li>
            <li> Works great and looks so natural</li>
            <li> I adore the fact that it is healthy and free of toxins, this is important to me for sure.</li>
            <li> Great for a natural looking ran on your face.</li>
            <li> Unlike most of the reviewers, I was not given this product for free, I bought it myself.</li>
            <li> I did like it to spray directly to my chest, that gave me really great results.</li>
            <li> It was very easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I noticed a color difference very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and rub into my skin.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and rub into my skin.</li>
            <li> Application was so easy</li>
            <li> It was easy to see where I had applied</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li> It does in fact blend easily.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily.</li>
            <li> What I like: Goes on easy.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I just had to leave a review!</li>
            <li> This bottle seemed like the packaging on the front was homemade and printed off someone&#x27;s computer, which is fine, but made me wonder before putting it on my face.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> So many products claim to deliver extraordinary results</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and was well packaged also!  </li>
            <li> This turns your face a gorgeous brown - very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I had to play with it a little to figure out to apply best for me.  </li>
            <li> Probably better for VERY FAIR girls who can&#x27;t use regular tanner, but I have olive skin tone and this did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> It felt light and watery, not oily.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this bronzer, it&#x27;s not too over powering</li>
            <li> The color was a nice light color so needed a second application, and had nice tanned look.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, blends well with skin tone and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> The Tanner/Bronzer went on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> As I sit here in bed writing this review, my face feels baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> Women want to look and feel great but don&#x27;t always have the time to spend time lounging outdoors or running in and out of a tanning bed several days a week.  </li>
            <li> But regardless, it&#x27;s just a fantastic product</li>
            <li> I think it is important to include this type of information with the product</li>
            <li> The couple times I have used it I really liked it, but I was apprehensive about using it too much for that over tanned look.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Detailed directions 3.</li>
            <li> I enjoy playing sports</li>
            <li> Now I have an even and smooth looking tan.</li>
            <li> Paraben free.</li>
            <li> This product has been good to me so far.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, be sure to rub it in and exfoliate first to prevent orange</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wash your hands right away.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I used a very light hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The product is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Had to use a pumice stone to get the color off my hands but was only partially successful.</li>
            <li> Rich tan after  1time use..</li>
            <li> Love that it is not at all orange in color and has no weird odor either.  </li>
            <li> so I was really excited to try the MIST self tanner and bronzer on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have never had any luck with self tanners in the past, but this stuff is really great!</li>
            <li> Hands come clean when washed immediately.</li>
            <li> It spreads smoothly and evenly and I would recommend it for a quick glow to your face and neck.</li>
            <li> As with most self tanners, if applying with your hands, moisturize your hands first and rub the product in quickly.</li>
            <li> but they did it right!</li>
            <li> , right!  </li>
            <li> So nice and natural.</li>
            <li> Second one is going on..weird color..not nearly as good??</li>
            <li> As I mentioned above, whenever I have tried self tanning products, they make my fair skin look orange or a color of tan that is unnatural.  </li>
            <li> The color was instant and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper and is darker and works better.</li>
            <li> I love it and it shipped amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> This bottle arrived on time (early in fact) after I purchased it for a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a couple of days, so I cannot say if the self tanner aspect of the product works well or not, but I will update my review when I have used it for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have such fair skin and just about everything I use breaks out my face.</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice, even, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I did.&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as St. Tropez, but I would consider it a close second.</li>
            <li> No bad smell..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and gives the prettiest, most natural glow.</li>
            <li> Other than that, goes on great and no breakouts/residue under makeup.</li>
            <li> Other spray tanners I&#x27;ve used have irritated my skin but this one was Great..</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great about this product is that I have full control of how dark I want my tan</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more:)</li>
            <li> Dries super quickly, and you can put makeup on almost immediately after applying it.  </li>
            <li> Dries quick.</li>
            <li> Although, effective in producing an instant tan, I noticed a significant darkening &amp; intensifying effect on my liver or age spots which remained even after tan wore off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as the spray booth products and lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> Lastly this is a great constancy, not thick and oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I am not allergic to - and it works!</li>
            <li> I just love that it is natural and made here in the U.S. too!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It gets dark on my light skin fairly quickly so one or two times a week are pretty good for me.</li>
            <li> The color is pleasant and not orange like other tanning products.  </li>
            <li> She mentioned that she had been using Mist by Bronz Body for a few weeks and had been very happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s not over the top brown, so looks natural.</li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I would prefer it to be more of a mist than a direct squirt.</li>
            <li> that being said I felt like it was much better for me because it was all natural</li>
            <li> My palms are callused, and even though I washed my hands after applying my calluses remained very tanned :)  I HIGHLY recommend this product!  .</li>
            <li> The color is nice but does not last.</li>
            <li> I spray it into my palm first the n spread quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;During a recent girls night out, I asked my friend where she had been vacationing, assuming that her gorgeous tan was a result of some exotic week long cruise or trip.  </li>
            <li> However, you need to wash your hands right away because it will stain your hands if you aren&#x27;t wearing gloves.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job right away.  </li>
            <li> I used my hands for application and it washed right off.  </li>
            <li> (I did wash them RIGHT after I used it).</li>
            <li> When I received this product I wanted to try it right away.</li>
            <li> that I wondered if I did it right.</li>
            <li> You have to mix it with lotion and the lotion dilutes it, so it takes longer to figure out the right lotion to spray ratio to get the right amount of tan.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried thus far because I literally can&#x27;t tell I have self tanner on usually...</li>
            <li> I could once again feel myself falling into the trap of trying another beauty product but could not get past how perfect and natural her tan looked.  </li>
            <li> It sprays on easily and looks very natural..</li>
            <li> it looks natural and so easy to use</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly and the color was completely even.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly and the color was completely even.</li>
            <li> For someone with sensitive skin that burns easily, this stuff is where it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li> Happy to have finally found something that created a natural bronze, without hurting my very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It is extremely light on the skin and provides a very natural looking sun-kissed look on your face.  </li>
            <li> I like this Mist product very much.</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for a facial tanner and have now found my new favorite!  </li>
            <li> I used it on my hand first to test it.  </li>
            <li> (and I DO have sensitive skin, mind you) and it gives me the most natural, golden glow.</li>
            <li> Before using this or any self tanner make sure to exfoliate about 24 hours before you plan to use product such as this.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Mist Oil Free Self Tanner And Bronzer For The Face.  </li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> With an awesome color, feel, scent, and price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Going forward, Mist will definitely be one of my top 10</li>
            <li> I tried this face tanner out for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> LOVE this facial tanner!</li>
            <li> I forgot all about that and did not wash my hands after applying this my first time.</li>
            <li> I forgot all about that and did not wash my hands after applying this my first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used it a few times, and am really impressed by the color and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a sunless tanner</li>
            <li> so just be aware of that when you use it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it had more of a tint</li>
            <li> , kinda looked funny.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me and the first time I used it all the writing on bottle smeared into a bunch of nothing</li>
            <li> sent the company a mail inquiring when it would be available and they got back to me quickly with the info I wanted to hear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on differently, thinner than water and it will darken pretty fast the first time so be sure to spread it out well.</li>
            <li> Now, as a male in his late 30&#x27;s this is the best product I have used.</li>
            <li> I notice that all the &amp;#34;sponsored&amp;#34; products have unbelievably positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several tanning products in the past but this particular spray tan mist is the best because I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> for a spray bronzer, this looks really close to the real deal!</li>
            <li> When I first used it though, the spray really struggled to come out of the bottle and did not spray evenly.</li>
            <li> have remotely fair skin, and despite it being winter (and feeling a little on the pale side), when I put this product on, it gives me such a healthy tint, that I feel confident without makeup when I have it on.</li>
            <li> application is easy and non-greasy, you simply spray it onto your hands and rub on your face.  </li>
            <li> I am a person that is very particular about what I put on my face.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the fact that it&#x27;s been a very mild summer in the mid-west, so tanning regularly just isn&#x27;t gonna happen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale and this gives me a nice tan quickly and it looks very natural with no streaking.</li>
            <li> At first when I sprayed this into my hands, I was worried it was going to be way too dark on my face, so I tried on the top of my arm first.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very runny; the consistency is the same as water, so it&#x27;s not as easy to apply as you might think.</li>
            <li> Gives a very ruddy/reddish tan vs an olive color that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray.</li>
            <li> Within minutes you can really see a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The scent of the product is light and minimal: nofake or obnoxious pina colada or coconut odors,  While I understand the concept behind making a product smell nice for a consumer, I want to be able to smell the perfume that I chose to wear over the self tanner that I am using.  </li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> Looks like a real tan and no smell at all.</li>
            <li> product is very liquid</li>
            <li> This self-tanner really does work.</li>
            <li> so you need to use a glove for sure.. even with a glove, though, it really isnt worth the trouble (try a lotion or something</li>
            <li> It really does go on very even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally very oily and this does not add to that.</li>
            <li> Then head straight to the sink to wash it off, no prob.</li>
            <li> The mist itself felt really sticky</li>
            <li> My husband said I applied too much and being that it is February</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It worked really well</li>
            <li> and this is definitely the most natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I have used it just a few times, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I could use it everyday, or if it washes off at the end of the day, or if it builds up over time and leaves a nice tanned looked.</li>
            <li> This tanner is easy to use, very natural looking and lasts several days.</li>
            <li> There are never streaks and clean up is as simple as washing your hands.  </li>
            <li> I then spilled the bottle open when trying to clean up and</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical at first but this self tanner is great.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I forget to wash my hands after applying self tanner and luckily, with this one, my hands didn&#x27;t get really orange and gross.</li>
            <li> This self-tanner gives me a deep natural tan that I can easily control.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product based on the reviews, but I was very let down.</li>
            <li> Looks a bit purple when it is on initially, but not a bad product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the size of the bottle I will say I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth double the original price.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply because of the spray bottle, i was just nervous spraying my face with my eyes closed.</li>
            <li> I would just caution super white girls to use this sparingly or do a test patch before applying all over the face.</li>
            <li> The only makeup I had to put on to go out last night was mascara! :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try this...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product along with a body spray tan to match your face.</li>
            <li> In high school, I always wanted a tan like my friends but trying always ended in disaster.</li>
            <li> I find the application to be high maintenance.</li>
            <li> Make sure you mix with water or it is a little too tan.</li>
            <li> product was easy to use and was not greasy or oily like other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> There weren&#x27;t directions as to how much or how often to apply so naturally, I over applied.</li>
            <li> This product provides instant gratification and the 30 seconds it takes to apply is well worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I tried it a few more times, attempting to use the sprayer instead.</li>
            <li> It did not look nice but at least it was not my face.</li>
            <li> It did not look nice but at least it was not my face.</li>
            <li> However,  this winter has been harsh and I am looking a lot more like Casper than anything, so I said why not?</li>
            <li> If you over do it the natural color seems to become more red maroon rather than red tan.</li>
            <li> And another Plus, it has no icky smell, no fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not a complaint, but it sticks with you.</li>
            <li> Exfoliation removes old &amp; dead skin cells which allows the Mist Self Tanner to better absorb.</li>
            <li> I should start off by saying that I have porcelain  and very, very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I tend to break out or get a rash from everything.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have tried at least twenty facial self-tanners and this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that has both a great color and does not leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> After having applied it hours before, I was streaked where I touched my face and around my mouth was natural color!  </li>
            <li> so it apparently looks real.</li>
            <li> Have me a lightly tanned look with no streaking or mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay though because when I finally noticed I was tanner, it looked natural and was not too dark.</li>
            <li> Like that the product is easy to use, and it has no strong scent.</li>
            <li> I like the product but one thing I could change would be the packaging.... seems a little on cheap side</li>
            <li> So happy I found this product and love that it does not have nasty chemicals on it.</li>
            <li> It left absolutely no streaks, which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the natural color it gives my face and neck without making me look orange.  </li>
            <li> So far, no break outs (NO Pimples emerging),</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li> have self-tanned at nearly every salon and used almost every product</li>
            <li> I really hope it gets back on Amazon soon!</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive that just about anything I use on it causes a break out.  </li>
            <li> color looks natural.  </li>
            <li> product feels natural.  </li>
            <li> The liquid was light enough to spread evenly and dried very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, it was so natural looking</li>
            <li> However, it looked so natural that no one else would have any idea that I used something.</li>
            <li> However, it looked so natural that no one else would have any idea that I used something.</li>
            <li> the self tanner looks quite natural although I would not apply too often.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spray it directly on my face; therefore, I sprayed it into my hands and rubbed it into my face and neck.</li>
            <li> My skin looked natural and even.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if I just received a old bottle</li>
            <li> I find the Palmers Instant Bronzer Moisturizer to be much easier to use than this product</li>
            <li> Been using this Product for the last few weeks and have Really enjoyed its consistency..</li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.kin was darker a few hours later when I went into the restroom.  </li>
            <li> This is mostly because I&#x27;m so pale and white that self tanners make me turn orange and blotchy.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of a face-friendly tanner that comes in a cute little travel bottle, but this turned me from porcelain to Jersey Shore brown, and that looks really weird when your face is super dark but the rest of your body is translucent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Tan Towels or Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical with this product as most of the other tanning products I&#x27;ve loved have been lotions.</li>
            <li> I spray a small amount on my face and use one of those triangle sponges to smooth and even it out.  </li>
            <li> ok, so maybe I am not good at reading directions; that said, this stuff made me look tanned until I had lunch.</li>
            <li> I really do not intend to use this product again after the first couple of applications.  </li>
            <li> First will see how long this bottle will last me.</li>
            <li> but it actually looks natural and wears off naturally too  </li>
            <li> this one is VERY messy.. got all over the sink right off the bat, stained my hands VERY VERY quickly and VERY dark</li>
            <li> but maybe the fact that it does not smell like all the other self tanners is what exactly reveals that it is not a self tanner but just another cosmetic &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; of sorts that is supposed to wash away immediately?</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have had similar dismal results with other popular self-tanners like Fake Bake and St Tropez, so it might just be me since I&#x27;m the common denominator here.</li>
            <li> so when I applied, barely anything came on my face.</li>
            <li> I can tell this bottle is going to last me even with frequent use.</li>
            <li> This does look dark brown at first when it comes out of the bottle, which was concerning to me.</li>
            <li> The color is natural (but not that deep), though, and there&#x27;s no smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried better and worse.  </li>
            <li> This still isn&#x27;t dramatic enough for me and it will settle on dry spots if you do not exfoliate before applying, but I am able to get some color out of it if I apply very liberally.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is that I rubbed it in and it very quickly stained my fingers so I would recommend using gloves or a facial pad to apply</li>
            <li> What a powerful little bronzer!</li>
            <li> (I usually apply right before bed).  </li>
            <li> I know the risk of sun over-exposure and since I have rather sensitive skin (spent my share of days covered in aloe), I generally opt to stay inside/</li>
            <li> My face looked darker but it was done so naturally that I was not sure at first if this was due to the Mist Bronzer or what.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a natural way to give yourself some color without turning your self orange or some other funky color.</li>
            <li> Not sure why all these reviews are positive.</li>
            <li> It is a little alarming when you first apply it.  </li>
            <li> I am very careful about what I put on my face since I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I did my usual exfoliating routine and the color only diminished a little, which was fine with me and it lasted roughly 3 days.</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Upon further inspection my husband discovered that the tube for the sprayer was too long and was folded at the bottle of the jar preventing it from picking up liquid.</li>
            <li> For example, how long is this product supposed to last on my face?</li>
            <li> No icky smell even after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I typically steer clear of sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have a weird smell and came off my hands easily after application</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product does not come with much information and the bottle doesn&#x27;t say much either.</li>
            <li> I felt like I would have to spray a LOT directly on my face in order to even get a little bit of a tint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to have a little bit of a smell which i do not like, but i am extremely sensitive to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other (more expensive) products that left me feeling like my face was covered with make up, or after applying i wondered if I should go buy some makeup to hide the dark spots they left.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not orange or strange looking.</li>
            <li> Not much of a self tanner guy, but it definitely works well and didn&#x27;t turn me orange.  </li>
            <li> Being a Florida girl, I&#x27;ve seen gorgeous natural tans and unfortunate fake ones.</li>
            <li> Debating on returning as no other reviews mention that it is black.</li>
            <li> No funny smells, not too oily and definitely not an orange glow!</li>
            <li> Let dry</li>
            <li> I discovered these big, dark brown patches on my palm and fingers.</li>
            <li> I discovered these big, dark brown patches on my palm and fingers.</li>
            <li> Once the color developed after a few hours, I sprayed another layer for a little bit of a deeper bronze.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheaper, has just a regular lotion smell, and provides instant results without having to work as hard for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian, medium oilve skin tone and a sucker for cosmetics and beauty products such as spray tanners.</li>
            <li> and then it does get darker a few hours later</li>
            <li> It is a thin liquid and soaked into the sponge too much.</li>
            <li> It looks like I spent the day at the beach.    </li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin was darker a few hours later when I went into the restroom.  </li>
            <li> Not a lot of the spray was needed to give a nice base of color.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t quite give enough color, and it has the typical self-tanner smell.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed each time.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t blotchy like other products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I am against bronzing cremes and such because usually you end up looking like Garfield the cat.</li>
            <li> Small bottle for big price.</li>
            <li> have tried other self tanners in the past and had the same three complaints with every product: 1)</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this and will keep purchasing - Thanks Bronz Body!</li>
            <li> Bc your hands will stain (like any other tanning product)</li>
            <li> I fell like if I use it every day it will build and it may be too dark for me, so I am using it every couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I went to sleep with the liquid on my face and when I woke up the color was quite dark.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, it does not look that dark on your skin.</li>
            <li> it wasnt that dark of a tan, was kinda orange, and it was sticky.</li>
            <li> and it was not too dark.</li>
            <li> Do not be discouraged by how dark it is out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> And it makes your hands a dark brown that needs to be scrubbed off immediately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a bit uneven in spots although I was careful on application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like a few other reviewers state, this has the consistency of water</li>
            <li> , my hands turned black after applying the tanner to my face.</li>
            <li> and it takes about a half hour to an hour for the color to appear.</li>
            <li> The solution glides on evenly and does not lay in slight wrinkles or imperfections on your skin.</li>
            <li> but what came out was black in color</li>
            <li> Nervous to rub the black liquid on my face.</li>
            <li> The color was a little dark</li>
            <li> No sticky mess going along with the application of the bronzer.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t create a mess.</li>
            <li> I waited a few minutes and it stained my hands slightly.</li>
            <li> and there was no strong odor like the other tanners!</li>
            <li> Just sprayed a little on fingers and rubbed into face.</li>
            <li> The next day I got at LEAST 6 complements on my tan!</li>
            <li> Works well, and has little scent.</li>
            <li> It did remind me of when I&#x27;ve been out in the sun for a little bit and would come home with color on my face.</li>
            <li> It did remind me of when I&#x27;ve been out in the sun for a little bit and would come home with color on my face.</li>
            <li> Made a little difference but nothing drastic</li>
            <li> I recommend using gloves and a little sponge applicator.  </li>
            <li> Mist has a very subtle, barely there scent...</li>
            <li> When I applied to a makeup sponge (as directed on the bottle) it turned my makeup sponge green and immediately soaked into the sponge</li>
            <li> but it was messy no matter what.  </li>
            <li> I used a round makeup sponge to apply my Mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves uneven tan with streaks.</li>
            <li> Will I see the color immediately after applying or does it take a few hours/days?</li>
            <li> I used this a few times as well</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t horrible just wasn&#x27;t effective.</li>
            <li> A warning that the color develops over a few hours so people don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the liquid is supposed to be black or not??</li>
            <li> The liquid was extremely watery and hard to use.</li>
            <li> It is that time of year when my skin gets really pale because of our winter weather.  </li>
            <li> it was hard to use because its really watery and the spray is not nice and mist-like, it is a weird uneven spray.</li>
            <li> I found that I usually need to reapply every 3 days or so in order to keep up the bronze look</li>
            <li> I get spray tans in the winter, and my face usually fades faster than my body.</li>
            <li> Ladies and men, if you&#x27;re skeptical, there&#x27;s the 100% money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Would suggest working in small circle like motions.</li>
            <li> I just used it on my face and neck for now, small bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to waste my time or money in a tanning bed because I know that it is not good for me</li>
            <li> Hard to get even coverage</li>
            <li> I do not recommend spraying this on your face, because it is too hard to know where the spray will land.</li>
            <li> it was hard to blend.</li>
            <li> And the smell is hard to handle all day.</li>
            <li> It does not have a nasty scent which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried them, then you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Although I think a lot of the reviews are fake, I was still curious!</li>
            <li> very shady looking.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because I&#x27;m so white</li>
            <li> Every time I take a leap of faith, I am let down by funky smells, blotchy patches, and fake orange coloring.  </li>
            <li> I mix with my moisturizer to give it an even, subtle color.</li>
            <li> It turned an odd fake brown color on my skin.  </li>
            <li> so people will pay the ridiculously inflated prices.  </li>
            <li> The direction are a little vague.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours I already noticed a difference and when I woke up in the morning I looked bronzed but not orange or fake either.</li>
            <li> but they were noticeably fake looking to me and a few of my beauty guru friends.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was going to be way too dark.</li>
            <li> gave no warm ness to your face!</li>
            <li> and if I ever need to stop using it, it slowly fades away leaving NO STREAKS!  </li>
            <li> Being a woman can be difficult and time consuming and it is hard to know which products to trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left no color awful waste of money.</li>
            <li> The color is subtle, I like that!</li>
            <li> It is a very subtle tan though you can reapply soon after to get a darker look.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t look like a fake bronze or orange.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m finally realizing how terrible tanning beds are.  </li>
            <li> Also, my face hasn&#x27;t broken out  using this product for about a month!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with self tanners for the face because I hate being pale</li>
            <li> I hate looking pale</li>
            <li> I am allergic to all the other sunless tanners I&#x27;ve tried - if I apply them to my face I break out horribly.  </li>
            <li> I did not like how it looked dirty on my face though</li>
            <li> Some self tanners she&#x27;s used in the past would leave a nasty orange colored  tan, not this one.</li>
            <li> Very sad.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle?</li>
            <li> Too bad :(</li>
            <li> and I hated the bottling I had to return this product.</li>
            <li> He did not do anything very bad product</li>

            <li> This bottle seemed like the packaging on the front was homemade and printed off someone&#x27;s computer, which is fine, but made me wonder before putting it on my face. When I applied to a makeup sponge (as directed on the bottle) it turned my makeup sponge green and immediately soaked into the sponge so when I applied, barely anything came on my face. I felt like I would have to spray a LOT directly on my face in order to even get a little bit of a tint. Probably better for VERY FAIR girls who can&#x27;t use regular tanner, but I have olive skin tone and this did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I am allergic to all the other sunless tanners I&#x27;ve tried - if I apply them to my face I break out horribly.  This is the first product that I am not allergic to - and it works! I am naturally fair skinned and burn easily.  This turns your face a gorgeous brown - very natural looking.  Not orange at all! It is a little alarming when you first apply it.  I spray it onto my fingers (it looks like soy sauce) and then rub it into my face.  You see instant results when you spread it on your face and then it does get darker a few hours later (I usually apply right before bed).  However, you need to wash your hands right away because it will stain your hands if you aren&#x27;t wearing gloves.  I found that I usually need to reapply every 3 days or so in order to keep up the bronze look but it literally takes 2 minutes so it&#x27;s not a hassle at all. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love the idea of a face-friendly tanner that comes in a cute little travel bottle, but this turned me from porcelain to Jersey Shore brown, and that looks really weird when your face is super dark but the rest of your body is translucent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my hands turned black after applying the tanner to my face. Had to use a pumice stone to get the color off my hands but was only partially successful. I might just be too white to ever be a bronze bombshell, but I just wanted a bit of color for a cruise. To be fair, I have had similar dismal results with other popular self-tanners like Fake Bake and St Tropez, so it might just be me since I&#x27;m the common denominator here. I would just caution super white girls to use this sparingly or do a test patch before applying all over the face.</li>
            <li> So nice and natural. Not orange at all. I mix with my moisturizer to give it an even, subtle color.</li>
            <li> the package looked like someone printed the label on a sticker at home...very shady looking. Ended up not using it</li>
            <li> Feels good to have a nice tan in December.</li>
            <li> Orange-y. Gives a very ruddy/reddish tan vs an olive color that I&#x27;m used to. Other than that, goes on great and no breakouts/residue under makeup. Too bad :(</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this as I am very fair.  The product recommends use with a sponge- I did not do that. It is a thin liquid and soaked into the sponge too much. I would up spraying it on my hands and rubbing it on my face. It felt light and watery, not oily.  The color is subtle, I like that! I don&#x27;t wnat ot be orange!  I fell like if I use it every day it will build and it may be too dark for me, so I am using it every couple of days.  I wish the packaging was nicer, it doesn&#x27;t fit the product!</li>
            <li> This tanner is easy to use, very natural looking and lasts several days. Only a small amount is needed each time. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this bronzer, it&#x27;s not too over powering and it applies smoothing and evenly. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, be sure to rub it in and exfoliate first to prevent orange</li>
            <li> First one worked great??  Second one is going on..weird color..not nearly as good??</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I appreciate the natural color it gives my face and neck without making me look orange.  Not a lot of the spray was needed to give a nice base of color.  It does come out in a mist, but spreads evenly with hands (follow directions).  Hands come clean when washed immediately.</li>
            <li> Works great! Just sprayed a little on fingers and rubbed into face. Have me a lightly tanned look with no streaking or mess. Didn&#x27;t irritate skin.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my facial lotion in the mornings. Works fine.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used! I get spray tans in the winter, and my face usually fades faster than my body. This is comparable and keeps my face looking youthful and glowing. So happy I found this product and love that it does not have nasty chemicals on it. No orangey color just a beautiful bronze. Please don&#x27;t stop making this...you have a customer for life. Will recommend and I am going to stock up! Thank you!</li>
            <li> If you are fair and have freckles this product is not for YOU!!!</li>
            <li> This product is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It&#x27;s easy to use and gives the prettiest, most natural glow. AND it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;I have remotely fair skin, and despite it being winter (and feeling a little on the pale side), when I put this product on, it gives me such a healthy tint, that I feel confident without makeup when I have it on.</li>
            <li> This is an okay product. Definitely need to use plastic gloves. II you don&#x27;t, be sure to use a nail brush to get the product out of the area around your finger nails.</li>
            <li> Great product without the tanning spray scent!</li>
            <li> This is one totally great item I am so glad that I got this because I love it. It is a tan for the face but it also helps with the aging Also. When I use it it makes my face younger and I feel so much better about myself. When I use it, it moisturizers my skin and even takes the wrinkles and lines out of my face so I look younger people tell me I look 5 to 7 days younger. Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
            <li> Does not work as described. I cannot ger stain to set on my skin. Very sad.</li>
            <li> Rich tan after  1time use.. The color is brown, NO yellow at all.. NO over drying .. No bad smell..</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical with this product as most of the other tanning products I&#x27;ve loved have been lotions. I found that I liked the application best by spraying hands and then wiping it on my face rather than spraying it directly on my face. It does not have a nasty scent which is a huge plus. Sometimes I forget to wash my hands after applying self tanner and luckily, with this one, my hands didn&#x27;t get really orange and gross. Within a few hours I already noticed a difference and when I woke up in the morning I looked bronzed but not orange or fake either. I would repurchase this in a hearbeat!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian, medium oilve skin tone and a sucker for cosmetics and beauty products such as spray tanners. I&#x27;ve used many drug store brands like Jergen&#x27;s, L&#x27;Oreal and Neutrogena.  Those big name products were so-so to me but they were noticeably fake looking to me and a few of my beauty guru friends. If you&#x27;ve tried them, then you know what I mean. My friend, whom introduced me to this stay tan, had purchased Bronzbody and it looked great on her.  I tried her bottle on myself and \\&quot;Do I look yummy?\\&quot; I love the color. It looks like I spent the day at the beach.    It&#x27;s been a couple months since I purchased my own Bronzbody bottle and I&#x27;m still loving it. So far, no break outs (NO Pimples emerging), No irritation ( I have sensitive eczema skin) and best of all, I have a healthy looking glow.    Ladies and men, if you&#x27;re skeptical, there&#x27;s the 100% money back guarantee. Just try it! It works and it gives a beautiful color to your skin.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with this product. This self tanner is easy to blend and develops nicely into an even bronzed glow. I used it on my face, neck, chest, arms, and legs. The first time I tried it, I used a very light hand. Once the color developed after a few hours, I sprayed another layer for a little bit of a deeper bronze. As with most self tanners, if applying with your hands, moisturize your hands first and rub the product in quickly. Scrub hands with soap as soon as you are done rubbing it in. Otherwise, use gloves to avoid hand staining.</li>
            <li> This tanning agent does it&#x27;s job right away.  The color is pleasant and not orange like other tanning products.  I used it on my hand first to test it.  That was 4 days ago.  I still have a tanned looking appearence on my hand.  I am going to use it on my face today. . . It is that time of year when my skin gets really pale because of our winter weather.  Looking forward to a bronzed color boost tomorrow.  This was sent to me at a discount for my honest review. . . I will report back if my experience using it on my face is any different from using it on my hand.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray. It smells okay and doesnt leave any streaks! Just make sure to get behind the ear and on the neck!</li>
            <li> I love the color this gives me with just a light spray. Color is even, and does not streak!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! Make sure you mix with water or it is a little too tan. Even used on my chest and neck. Works great!</li>
            <li> I mix 1-2 pumps of this with Cereve moisturizing lotion and apply it to my face and neck at night. Doesn&#x27;t break me out at all (and I DO have sensitive skin, mind you) and it gives me the most natural, golden glow. Absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Nice, yet doesn&#x27;t spray even or lightly, use your fingertips to blending hairline. ..</li>
            <li> . First the product has no smell which is good. I spray the Mist Self tanner on to a Self tanning mitt.  I sprayed it about 10 times to fully do my face, neck &amp; décolletage area. Before using this or any self tanner make sure to exfoliate about 24 hours before you plan to use product such as this. Exfoliation removes old &amp; dead skin cells which allows the Mist Self Tanner to better absorb. It also helps it to develop evenly. Would suggest working in small circle like motions. Personally I noticed the tan in about an hour.  The color was a nice light color so needed a second application, and had nice tanned look. It&#x27;s not orange or strange looking. Would suggest to use a Self tanning mitt as it help you to apply the mist in more even fashion. The tan seemed to fade about 4 or 5 days later. Make sure to moisturize your skin often to extend the life of your Mist Self Tanner. Do wish it came in a bigger size, and it had instructions. Do like the product, and may buy it again. First will see how long this bottle will last me. Like that the product is easy to use, and it has no strong scent.</li>
            <li> I should start off by saying that I have porcelain  and very, very sensitive skin and this is the first self tanner that looks great and doesn&#x27;t give me an allergic reaction! With that being said, if it works on me, it will definitely work on you!&lt;br /&gt;The application is easy and non-greasy, you simply spray it onto your hands and rub on your face.  There are never streaks and clean up is as simple as washing your hands.  This self-tanner gives me a deep natural tan that I can easily control.  What&#x27;s great about this product is that I have full control of how dark I want my tan and if I ever need to stop using it, it slowly fades away leaving NO STREAKS!  Plus, I can add color to my kneck and chest, too!  The fact that it doesn&#x27;t make me look orange, especially on my fair skin, is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;I have self-tanned at nearly every salon and used almost every product and this is definitely the most natural looking.  It gives you that perfect sun-kissed glow and also helps make your skin look more even!  I 100% recommend this product!</li>
            <li> works well did not streak. I suggest you use some sort of glove to apply it. It did stain my hands</li>
            <li> I felt like this self tanner gave my skin great color. The color was a little dark but I was able to work with that by mixing it with my moisturizer. The smell is pleasant and it didn&#x27;t stain anything. The bottle was good size and I feel like it would last quite awhile. All in all this was a good product that I could see myself countining to use.</li>
            <li> I tried applying it every way recommended in reviews but it was messy no matter what.  It also did not come off my fingers even with lemon juice or peroxide.  It turned an odd fake brown color on my skin.  I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would say this but this stuff is good it looks natural and so easy to use but it actually looks natural and wears off naturally too  don&#x27;t know how they did it but they did it right!</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner! Not greasy, blends well with skin tone and goes on smooth. I really hope it gets back on Amazon soon! Need more and cant find it.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive that just about anything I use on it causes a break out.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Mist Oil Free Self Tanner And Bronzer For The Face.  The Tanner/Bronzer went on smoothly and evenly. My face never looked so healthy and glowing. Summer is almost here so it will be great to have a glowing skin tone for once.  I absolutely love it !!</li>
            <li> I did not notice its &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; capabilities, to be honest. It is just another &amp;#34;bronzing veil&amp;#34; from what I can tell - it does not &amp;#34;stay on&amp;#34;. It washes off every day with my evening shower. I gave it a 3 star rating because it does not smell (it&#x27;s a plus!) - but maybe the fact that it does not smell like all the other self tanners is what exactly reveals that it is not a self tanner but just another cosmetic &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; of sorts that is supposed to wash away immediately? In any case, it&#x27;s a nice &amp;#34;bronzing veil&amp;#34; but no way a self tanner, as it claims to be, hence 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Hard to get even coverage but it works</li>
            <li> This product really works! I am a person that is very particular about what I put on my face. My biggest concerns before using Bronz Body were, would this product make me break out, and would this product moisturize. To my delight it did not make me break out, and was moisturizing without being oily. The best application that I found was to just spray the product into my hand and then rub it evenly onto my face. I then I immediately washed my hands to avoid any hand staining. It was very easy and quick. Just after one application I had comments from co-workers (who did not know I used the product) on how nice and tan my face looked! I would definitely recommend using Bronz Body face tanner. Within minutes you can really see a difference.</li>
            <li> tarte maracuja bronzing serum</li>
            <li> Ok face tanner. I used it all over my face and neck/chest area. It gets dark on my light skin fairly quickly so one or two times a week are pretty good for me. I also blend it with lotion at the time of use for easier flawless application. Doesn&#x27;t break out my face either. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> After working in the beauty industry for over 5 years, I have tried almost every product on the market, including foundations, mascara, skincare and more than my fair share of self tanners.  Every time I take a leap of faith, I am let down by funky smells, blotchy patches, and fake orange coloring.  I don&#x27;t want to waste my time or money in a tanning bed because I know that it is not good for me but there are so many self tanning products on the market. Being a woman can be difficult and time consuming and it is hard to know which products to trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a recent girls night out, I asked my friend where she had been vacationing, assuming that her gorgeous tan was a result of some exotic week long cruise or trip.  She mentioned that she had been using Mist by Bronz Body for a few weeks and had been very happy with the results so far.  I could once again feel myself falling into the trap of trying another beauty product but could not get past how perfect and natural her tan looked.  So I decided to go for it and try it out for myself... And I am so glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The color looks natural.  In the winter, I wear the 1st and 2nd lightest shades of foundation that cosmetic companies carry.  As I mentioned above, whenever I have tried self tanning products, they make my fair skin look orange or a color of tan that is unnatural.  The color was instant and gorgeous.  I did not have to wait for hours for the color to arrive which was helpful when applying the product to my face. I used a round makeup sponge to apply my Mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The product feels natural.  This product feels great on my skin.  As I sit here in bed writing this review, my face feels baby smooth.  There is no greasy residue and I can go to sleep knowing that the Mist will not be all over my pillow cases and sheets in the morning.  The liquid was light enough to spread evenly and dried very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The scent of the product is light and minimal: nofake or obnoxious pina colada or coconut odors,  While I understand the concept behind making a product smell nice for a consumer, I want to be able to smell the perfume that I chose to wear over the self tanner that I am using.  Mist has a very subtle, barely there scent... perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The product is quick and easy to use.  Women want to look and feel great but don&#x27;t always have the time to spend time lounging outdoors or running in and out of a tanning bed several days a week.  This product provides instant gratification and the 30 seconds it takes to apply is well worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You can not beat the cost of Mist.  So many products claim to deliver extraordinary results so people will pay the ridiculously inflated prices.  This product actually is extraordinary and it is affordable!!!  Imagine that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am thrilled that I gave this product a chance.  While I was terrified of trying another self tanner, I am so glad that I did.  With an awesome color, feel, scent, and price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  Going forward, Mist will definitely be one of my top 10 Must Have Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this face tanner out for the first time yesterday. I liked it so much, I just had to leave a review! I used my hands for application and it washed right off.  A nice, even bronze tan in the matter of one minute. The only makeup I had to put on to go out last night was mascara! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so thrilled that the claims were true... it wasn&#x27;t oily at all and there was no strong odor like the other tanners! I just love that it is natural and made here in the U.S. too! I can tell this bottle is going to last me even with frequent use. Hoping they will come out with a body spray too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister and she said it was the best spray tanner she has ever used. She will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> He did not do anything very bad product</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!!!! I&#x27;ve tried several tanning products in the past but this particular spray tan mist is the best because I have super sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I&#x27;m pale and this gives me a nice tan quickly and it looks very natural with no streaking. Also it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell or harsh chemicals. I highly recommend you try this...you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
            <li> Been using this Product for the last few weeks and have Really enjoyed its consistency.. Other spray tanners I&#x27;ve used have irritated my skin but this one was Great.. Will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and haven&#x27;t found a tanner yet until this one. I just used it on my face and neck for now, small bottle. Goes on differently, thinner than water and it will darken pretty fast the first time so be sure to spread it out well. I spray it into my palm first the n spread quickly. Wash your hands within a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I am a tanning product junkie!  I am always on the hunt for a facial tanner and have now found my new favorite!  It is very lightweight and non-greasy.  I am very careful about what I put on my face since I have sensitive skin.  No problems at all.  I noticed a color difference very quickly.  I would recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> I really do not intend to use this product again after the first couple of applications.  Although, effective in producing an instant tan, I noticed a significant darkening &amp; intensifying effect on my liver or age spots which remained even after tan wore off.</li>
            <li> Awesome consistency on my skin.  Wasn&#x27;t blotchy like other products I&#x27;ve used.  I will be getting a refill for sure  LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved the product! Very easy to use and blended with my skin perfectly. No break outs or an orange tint! You can use it to your color liking as well! Will definitely buy more:)</li>
            <li> I love the smooth almost radiant look I get from this bronzer.  I had to play with it a little to figure out to apply best for me.  I spray a small amount on my face and use one of those triangle sponges to smooth and even it out.  Let dry and I am set.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Wow! It Does Work. Awesome!</li>
            <li> LOVE this facial tanner! I have tried at least twenty facial self-tanners and this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that has both a great color and does not leave my skin feeling greasy. However - I did purchase this on Amazon when the price was $16.97 - I have seen the price fluctuate all the way up to $34.99... for the size of the bottle I will say I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth double the original price. But regardless, it&#x27;s just a fantastic product and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a great oil-free self tanner!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Looks like a real tan and no smell at all. Highly recommend this product along with a body spray tan to match your face.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin a shade darker&lt;br /&gt;Applies on evenly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;the product is very liquid so when you spray it in your hands you have to make sure your hands are over the sink&lt;br /&gt;Does not come with a makeup sponge&lt;br /&gt;Product does not was off of hands easily--it&#x27;s not noticeable but when you compare your hands you can tell</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any color change. Maybe it would work on fair skinned people.</li>
            <li> ok, so maybe I am not good at reading directions; that said, this stuff made me look tanned until I had lunch.Know why we brush our teeth before applying makeup?  the white circle affect, right!  After having applied it hours before, I was streaked where I touched my face and around my mouth was natural color!  I was glad I didn&#x27;t see anyone I knew!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves uneven tan with streaks. Color doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter who is always using self-tanning products.  I tried it out before giving it to her and was very impressed.  It is extremely light on the skin and provides a very natural looking sun-kissed look on your face.  The product came quickly and was well packaged also!  Once my daughter has a chance to use it, I&#x27;ll up date this review with her feedback as well!</li>
            <li> This product was fantastic! I don&#x27;t often use self tanner but I am so glad I tried it! It was really simple to use. I just sprayed some onto my hands and rubbed it into my face. Within minutes I could tell a difference. The next day I got at LEAST 6 complements on my tan! It is a very subtle tan though you can reapply soon after to get a darker look. It didn&#x27;t have a weird smell and came off my hands easily after application (I did wash them RIGHT after I used it). I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a self tanner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It goes on light and gives amazing color. My skin is very sensitive and I tend to break out or get a rash from everything. This caused me zero issues. Will definitely be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> Works well, and has little scent.</li>
            <li> I typically steer clear of sunless tanners. Being a Florida girl, I&#x27;ve seen gorgeous natural tans and unfortunate fake ones. I know the risk of sun over-exposure and since I have rather sensitive skin (spent my share of days covered in aloe), I generally opt to stay inside/covered in sunscreen/pale. Sure, I&#x27;d love a tan. But I&#x27;d rather be a vampire than look orange . Having heard great things about this product, I decided to give it a try. Happy to have finally found something that created a natural bronze, without hurting my very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Great!!!&lt;br /&gt;This product was easy to use and was not greasy or oily like other products I have tried. Gave me a great even tone, and looked completely natural.</li>
            <li> Not much of a self tanner guy, but it definitely works well and didn&#x27;t turn me orange.  Plus it&#x27;s not over the top brown, so looks natural.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product based on the reviews, but I was very let down. I was searching for a self tanner for my face that would not clog my pores or break me out. I have tried many lotions and they all broke me out, or did not give the color I was hoping for. When I received this product I wanted to try it right away. As others suggested I poured the liquid in my hands and then rubbed it on my face. The liquid was extremely watery and hard to use. I had difficulty getting and spreading it on my face. I washed my hands immediately. I then spilled the bottle open when trying to clean up and the liquid got all over my counter. I also tried the spray nozzle but it seemed to be clogged. I went to sleep with the liquid on my face and when I woke up the color was quite dark. I did not like how it looked dirty on my face though and it fell in my pores appearing splotchy. I wanted to give the tanner a fair chance so I tried it a few more times, attempting to use the sprayer instead. The spray didn&#x27;t work well and went everywhere but on my face, I had to resort back to the hand method to get enough on my face. Upon further inspection my husband discovered that the tube for the sprayer was too long and was folded at the bottle of the jar preventing it from picking up liquid. Since the color didn&#x27;t work well for me and I hated the bottling I had to return this product. I would highly recommend the Tan Towels or Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Glow face tanning towels which are phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Left no color awful waste of money.</li>
            <li> This self-tanner really does work. It does not leave any streaks either. I was surprised and impressed. Unfortunately, this product does not come with much information and the bottle doesn&#x27;t say much either. I had several questions that I wished had been answered. For example, how long is this product supposed to last on my face? Is it just a daily application and then it goes away after washing or not does it keep your face tan for a couple days? Will I see the color immediately after applying or does it take a few hours/days? How often should I reapply? I think it is important to include this type of information with the product so everyone knows what to expect from it.  Other than that though, this was a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that it did not turn my face orange. In fact, it was so natural looking that I wondered if I did it right. I did not notice my tan immediately. My face looked darker but it was done so naturally that I was not sure at first if this was due to the Mist Bronzer or what. It left absolutely no streaks, which is a huge plus for me. I like this Mist product very much. I do not recommend spraying this on your face, because it is too hard to know where the spray will land. The spray is a spray and not a lotion. I sprayed it onto my fingers and then rubbed it into my skin. I just sprayed about two times. If I felt like I needed more after applying it to my face than I would add another pump onto my fingers. This does look dark brown at first when it comes out of the bottle, which was concerning to me. I was afraid it was going to be way too dark. Thankfully, it does not look that dark on your skin. I just rubbed it in good, like you would with a serum and voila. My color didn’t change so I added some more because I didn&#x27;t know if I was supposed to wait or not. It didn&#x27;t tell me that on the bottle. It&#x27;s okay though because when I finally noticed I was tanner, it looked natural and was not too dark. It was perfect. I noticed that my skin was darker a few hours later when I went into the restroom.  I am assuming it probably takes a couple hours to see your tan. However, it looked so natural that no one else would have any idea that I used something. So it definitely is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s non-oily and non-greasy. It was easy to apply and rub into my skin. It dries very quickly and the color was completely even. I was actually amazed at how even my color was. It did remind me of when I&#x27;ve been out in the sun for a little bit and would come home with color on my face. I always liked the way that looked. It looked healthy and my skin looked sun kissed. This is the closest thing I have found to that look without actually going out in the sun. After applying this, be sure to wash your hands with soap. I forgot all about that and did not wash my hands after applying this my first time. I discovered these big, dark brown patches on my palm and fingers. LOL! It did not look nice but at least it was not my face. I received a discount on this product through a promotion.

            <li> I used this product on my face and neck to help extend a tan I got on vacation. I&#x27;ve received numerous comments about still being tan so it apparently looks real. Going to stop using and start again before summer so will see how it works after no pre-tan</li>
            <li> I like the product but one thing I could change would be the packaging.... seems a little on cheap side but as for actual product was very happy!</li>
            <li> Works great and looks so natural</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend as a gift set; purchased this one and the body self tanner. A friend had recommended this brand. She loves it and has been using it for quite sometime. Great spray. I used this a few times as well and it looks pretty good. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Does not seem like its a self tanner, a bronzer maybe. But i had to mix it with another bronzer to get deeper color. I like that not scented.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my winter white legs.  Love that it is not at all orange in color and has no weird odor either.  Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I like this bronzer a lot. I am against bronzing cremes and such because usually you end up looking like Garfield the cat. I am not one to think looking like a leather bag is appealing, so I refrain. However,  this winter has been harsh and I am looking a lot more like Casper than anything, so I said why not? This product has been good to me so far. No funny smells, not too oily and definitely not an orange glow! I have used it just a few times, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t horrible just wasn&#x27;t effective. Small bottle for big price. Go for norvell touch up for faces. Much cheaper and is darker and works better. Not sure why all these reviews are positive. I notice that all the &amp;#34;sponsored&amp;#34; products have unbelievably positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because I&#x27;m so white I&#x27;m transparent and any self tanners have only turned me orange.  But this is the BEST!!!!!!  It gives me color and it doesn&#x27;t look orange or like I&#x27;m faked baked.  If I use daily it makes me darker!!! I have also used on my legs and love it as they are transparent also.  I&#x27;m so glad I took the promotional price and made this purchase as this is the best self tanner on the market!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably used around 10+ different self tanners in my life.. this one is VERY messy.. got all over the sink right off the bat, stained my hands VERY VERY quickly and VERY dark so you need to use a glove for sure.. even with a glove, though, it really isnt worth the trouble (try a lotion or something lol) it was hard to use because its really watery and the spray is not nice and mist-like, it is a weird uneven spray. it was hard to blend. it wasnt that dark of a tan, was kinda orange, and it was sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. Warning: it&#x27;s very runny; the consistency is the same as water, so it&#x27;s not as easy to apply as you might think. I have gotten best results from spraying it into moisturizer and then applying...much more even. The color is natural (but not that deep), though, and there&#x27;s no smell.</li>
            <li> for a spray bronzer, this looks really close to the real deal! don&#x27;t look like a fake bronze or orange.</li>
            <li> This tan washes off after two rinses.</li>
            <li> The direction are a little vague. I didn&#x27;t know if I could use it everyday, or if it washes off at the end of the day, or if it builds up over time and leaves a nice tanned looked. The couple times I have used it I really liked it, but I was apprehensive about using it too much for that over tanned look. It spreads smoothly and evenly and I would recommend it for a quick glow to your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who was in Panama and her tan was fading, she loves that she can keep her tan and still tell stories about her trip.</li>
            <li> This stuff is easy to use and works great, my face looks tan and not fake or blotchy.  I love it &amp; would recommend.</li>
            <li> very nice light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Works ok.  I&#x27;ve tried better and worse.  Dries super quickly, and you can put makeup on almost immediately after applying it.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t quite give enough color, and it has the typical self-tanner smell.</li>
            <li> Nice color, and goes on evenly. When I first used it though, the spray really struggled to come out of the bottle and did not spray evenly. It does have a nice scent and bronze color you can see when you apply. I have fair to medium skin and it was not too dark. Dries quick. I&#x27;ve now used it a few times, and am really impressed by the color and how long it lasts. No icky smell even after a few hours. It really does go on very even. I was not expecting this to be as good as it was, think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again. I also used it on my neck, chest and arms and it worked great.</li>
            <li> the self tanner looks quite natural although I would not apply too often.  If you over do it the natural color seems to become more red maroon rather than red tan.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a sunless tanner and I am very pleased with the results! I was scared my skin would look orange or streaky and I wouldn&#x27;t know how to apply it correctly. I made sure to rub the product into my skin thoroughly so it would look even, and I washed my hands immediately after applying because I did notice a brown tint on my fingers. Like a few other reviewers state, this has the consistency of water so just be aware of that when you use it. I&#x27;m happy I picked this product for my first sunless tanning experience - looks great so far!</li>
            <li> Although I think a lot of the reviews are fake, I was still curious! I&#x27;m obsessed with self tanners for the face because I hate being pale and I&#x27;m finally realizing how terrible tanning beds are.  This still isn&#x27;t dramatic enough for me and it will settle on dry spots if you do not exfoliate before applying, but I am able to get some color out of it if I apply very liberally.  Not my HG but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried thus far because I literally can&#x27;t tell I have self tanner on usually... I think it might just be my skin though...</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I use it about 3 times per week before I go to bed and it keeps me with a perfect tan.  I have acne prone skin and this has not made me break out at all!</li>
            <li> Love this face bronzer! It doesn&#x27;t make my face turn orange and it takes about a half hour to an hour for the color to appear. Also, my face hasn&#x27;t broken out  using this product for about a month! I wish the bottle had instructions and more information on the product, hence the 4 stars. I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been big on self tanners. This is mostly because I&#x27;m so pale and white that self tanners make me turn orange and blotchy. In high school, I always wanted a tan like my friends but trying always ended in disaster. Tanning beds burn me, I peel then I&#x27;m white again (same with the sun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first but this self tanner is great. I&#x27;m naturally very oily and this does not add to that. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spray it directly on my face; therefore, I sprayed it into my hands and rubbed it into my face and neck. The color wasn&#x27;t overwhelming and no orange spots! I&#x27;ll be using this more than I thought!</li>
            <li> The self tanner is a great product, it is not greasy or sticky like most self tanners. It was easy to apply because of the spray bottle, i was just nervous spraying my face with my eyes closed. I would prefer it to be more of a mist than a direct squirt. I needed someone else to do it. that being said I felt like it was much better for me because it was all natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to have a little bit of a smell which i do not like, but i am extremely sensitive to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a natural way to give yourself some color without turning your self orange or some other funky color. I suggest you  have someone else spray your face</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other self tanners in the past and had the same three complaints with every product: 1) the color 2) the odor and 3) the viscosity.  I have finally found the perfect face tanner.  Application was so easy, I exfoliated then used a sponge (which did absorb a lot of the product). It was easy to see where I had applied and I think it took about 30 min to see the final result so plan accordingly if you are putting on makeup. The color looks great, no orange tints and no blotchiness.  I also didn&#x27;t notice an odor which if you have used any of the name brands you know the smell I&#x27;m talking about.  Lastly this is a great constancy, not thick and oily.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder how it would work on my legs?!</li>
            <li> I started using self tanners when i reached my 30&#x27;s to save my skin from sun damage  and tanning beds. Now, as a male in his late 30&#x27;s this is the best product I have used. This tanner covers lightly with excellent results. The solution glides on evenly and does not lay in slight wrinkles or imperfections on your skin. I have used other (more expensive) products that left me feeling like my face was covered with make up, or after applying i wondered if I should go buy some makeup to hide the dark spots they left. This tanner went on smoothly and thin. My skin looked natural and even. I have been using MIST since the fall  and people compliment all the time on how healthy my skin looks. I do recommend using a pair of latex gloves while applying. My palms are callused, and even though I washed my hands after applying my calluses remained very tanned :)  I HIGHLY recommend this product!  .</li>
            <li> Totally in LUV with this product!! I apply it every morning after my serums and moisturizer. I adore the fact that it is healthy and free of toxins, this is important to me for sure. I remove the top, put some on my fingers and spread it mostly on my cheeks and T zone for an Awesome Bronzy Glow. Then head straight to the sink to wash it off, no prob. Oh, And another Plus, it has no icky smell, no fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;I just went to reorder it and was freaked out, lol, Amazon had a message that it was unavailable. Yikes!!&lt;br /&gt;I sent the company a mail inquiring when it would be available and they got back to me quickly with the info I wanted to hear.&lt;br /&gt;Top of the line product &amp; company.  Go for it Girl Friends, you also can be a Bronze Goddess!!&lt;br /&gt;Namaste, Shine On,  Zoe</li>
            <li> The mist itself felt really sticky and I didn&#x27;t like the feeling on my face. Made a little difference but nothing drastic</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of tanning products and I recently tried this one. It goes on easy and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I recommend using gloves and a little sponge applicator.  It gave me nice color that can be built on.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it had more of a tint so you can see where you are putting it better.</li>
            <li> Definitely got me that color I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t leave me looking like an oompaloompa.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend and she couldn&#x27;t be happier. It shipped quickly and my girlfriend seems very satisfied with the product. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I hate looking pale so I was really excited to try the MIST self tanner and bronzer on my face.  It gave me a nice tanned look with a nice-looking glow.  I used it several days in a row and now don&#x27;t need to wear any makeup.  It sprays on easily and looks very natural..The only negative thing I have to say is that I rubbed it in and it very quickly stained my fingers so I would recommend using gloves or a facial pad to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I receiveda his product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and it in no way influenced my decision.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It doesn&#x27;t break you out and it tans your skin perfectly ! I love it and it shipped amazingly fast. ❤️</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product! Incredible color, stays on for awhile, doesn&#x27;t make me break out and is so natural looking! I put it on instead of makeup and it looks even better! More natural and just beautiful when applied! Obsessed with this and will keep purchasing - Thanks Bronz Body!</li>
            <li> What a powerful little bronzer! This bottle arrived on time (early in fact) after I purchased it for a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;To begin, if you have ever gone in to a tanning spray booth, you know the smell afterwards, same thing with this product. Not a complaint, but it sticks with you. There weren&#x27;t directions as to how much or how often to apply so naturally, I over applied. Rather than looking like an orange, over a span of an hour or so, the color built. By lunchtime, I looked like I went to the beach for a week! My husband said I applied too much and being that it is February, kinda looked funny. I only agreed to shut him up. Haha. I did my usual exfoliating routine and the color only diminished a little, which was fine with me and it lasted roughly 3 days. I would suggest when using this to wear latex gloves Bc your hands will stain (like any other tanning product) I put moisturizer on afterwards then my makeup and the result was a gorgeous tan and glow. I would suggest to the manufacturer to 1. Add suggested amount to use 2. Detailed directions 3. A warning that the color develops over a few hours so people don&#x27;t over do it. Otherwise, I will be purchasing this product again. It&#x27;s as good as the spray booth products and lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> At first when I sprayed this into my hands, I was worried it was going to be way too dark on my face, so I tried on the top of my arm first. I think it blends very easily and gives a really great hint of color. I have never had any luck with self tanners in the past, but this stuff is really great! Do not be discouraged by how dark it is out of the bottle. It does in fact blend easily. I have only been using it for a couple of days, so I cannot say if the self tanner aspect of the product works well or not, but I will update my review when I have used it for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Service was great.  No sticky mess going along with the application of the bronzer.  Packaging of the item was great, had no damage to the product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have such fair skin and just about everything I use breaks out my face. With The MIST Spray Tanner I haven&#x27;t had that problem at all.&lt;br /&gt; I enjoy playing sports so I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot here in California before my face would just burn. Now I have an even and smooth looking tan. You can imagine with the skin problems I&#x27;ve had how I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife who refuses to go anywhere without a tan. Even though she looks great with a tan, we all know the dangers of using a tanning bed, or laying out in the sun for that matter. She&#x27;s now using this self tanner instead and she loves the results. It&#x27;s fast, easy and gives great results. Some self tanners she&#x27;s used in the past would leave a nasty orange colored  tan, not this one. It gives you a nice, even, natural looking tan. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great for a natural looking ran on your face.</li>
            <li> Color was nice but didn&#x27;t matter that it was a mist because still need cotton ball or gloves to apply. Also blocked poors giving blackheads. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me and the first time I used it all the writing on bottle smeared into a bunch of nothing so you could not read the label anymore !&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I just received a old bottle but what came out was black in color gave no warm ness to your face!</li>
            <li> This is the best self-tanner I have ever used on my face. Does not make my face greasy. Goes on easily. Just make sure you wash your hands right away. I waited a few minutes and it stained my hands slightly.</li>
            <li> For someone with sensitive skin that burns easily, this stuff is where it&#x27;s at. Not to mention the fact that it&#x27;s been a very mild summer in the mid-west, so tanning regularly just isn&#x27;t gonna happen.  What I like: Goes on easy. Doesn&#x27;t create a mess. Does not look unnatural. Does not clog pores. Paraben free. Good stuff here.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the price. Tan lasts for one day. The color is nice but does not last. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Looks a bit purple when it is on initially, but not a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit uneven in spots although I was careful on application.&lt;br /&gt;My husband didn&#x27;t notice, but I did.&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as St. Tropez, but I would consider it a close second.</li>
            <li> Works very good but I do not spray it on my face. Put some on my finger with the wand and then apply to face.</li>
            <li> It worked really well</li>
            <li> The spray bottle does not distribute an even mist. It has to be used as lotion so the spray is more of a nuance. Product seems to add a subtitle bronze to skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is a great tanner and bronzer product!</li>
            <li> Not sure if the liquid is supposed to be black or not?? Nervous to rub the black liquid on my face. Tested a spot on my stomach and it appeared to look a bit tan later. Debating on returning as no other reviews mention that it is black. Maybe I got a bad bottle?</li>
            <li> I thought that this product was just okay. It&#x27;s not the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not the worst. Unlike most of the reviewers, I was not given this product for free, I bought it myself. I find the application to be high maintenance. You have to mix it with lotion and the lotion dilutes it, so it takes longer to figure out the right lotion to spray ratio to get the right amount of tan. And it makes your hands a dark brown that needs to be scrubbed off immediately. And the smell is hard to handle all day. I did like it to spray directly to my chest, that gave me really great results. But it says you can&#x27;t spray directly to your face, it&#x27;s harder to even out that way, so lotion helps with that. I find the Palmers Instant Bronzer Moisturizer to be much easier to use than this product, it&#x27;s cheaper, has just a regular lotion smell, and provides instant results without having to work as hard for it.</li>
