            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting the scrub I need to fully clean my face and pores.</li>

            <li>I love Kbeauty brands and trying any new I find!</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick too so</li>
            <li>Great little travel brush to help keep you clean.</li>
            <li>IT IS REALLY CUTE AND VERY SOFT</li>
            <li>love the soft brush!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and very light.</li>
            <li>My skin looked soooo clean when I used this for the first time.</li>
            <li>but I am not sure if it helped me clean my skin more effectively than if I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>but I would have liked it better if the bristles were a little thicker</li>
            <li>I love that this brush comes with its own little case.</li>
            <li>I feel like it clean my skin very thoroughly and cleans in your pores, but this brush is a gentle clean not an exfoliating clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft that I kind of question whether or not it really is doing the job it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>But certainly nothing to get all excited about.</li>
            <li>I do wash my hands, but I like knowing that everything is clean and really being gutted.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it much because I prefer using my hands to cleanse my face, but it was a nice product overall.</li>
            <li>Not only is the packaging super cute, but the brush is perfect for cleaning your pores because it is gentle enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li>This pore brush is very gentle on your my skin and does seem to work.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was an okay product.</li>
            <li>I love all Etude House products and the same goes for this one its so tiny and cute.</li>
            <li>pore brush comes with a cute container and is about 2.5 inches tall in total.</li>
            <li>the brush is too soft and i cant use it to clean my face since it just smushes into my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so soft, I used to clean my face every day after makeup</li>
            <li>I think the brush is too soft and doesn&#x27;t do the work it supposed to do- clean the pores.</li>
            <li>it is really soft that i wish it was a little bit rough XD, it is very gentle and way better than using your hands, and the price is so affordable, the packaging is GREAT &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where all my blackheads and large pores</li>
            <li>I really like the brush.</li>
            <li>When paired with Etude House Wonder Pore Whipping Foam, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is so much clearer and not as oily.</li>
            <li>and I felt very refreshed afterward.  </li>
            <li>This pore brush is REALLY soft!!!</li>
            <li>I doubt it does much more than using your hand or perhaps a wash cloth or any other cleansing device.</li>
            <li>If you want something hard this not for you, however if you have sensitive or dry skin it is perfect</li>
            <li>Etude is my favorite company to buy from as they never let me down.</li>
            <li>Very soft and gentle brush.</li>
            <li>An absolutely good product, the bristles are soft enough to use everyday and give a deep clean.</li>
            <li>Overall great, but don&#x27;t buy this expecting it to really get deep down or to remove any major dirt.</li>
            <li>It is soft but still gently exfoliates the skin.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>my brush container had a small crack in it when I opened the package, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li>The packaging is great because it essentially came with a little holder for you to dry and store the brush away.</li>
            <li>will buy new one soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>VERY SOFT</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me feel any cleaner because the brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is very soft on the skin would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and cleans well</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic little brush that I would recommend that everyone use.</li>
            <li>If your face needs to be exfoliated often due to excessive dead skin, this brush may not be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li>I feel like this does a better job that my fingers- which are smooth and potentially dirty.</li>
            <li>Way too soft to do anything</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I wanted for my sensitive Rosacea skin.  </li>
            <li>This brush is extremely soft *</li>
            <li>SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>Use this with a gentle cleanser to really give your skin a break from everything harsh in life.</li>
            <li>The brush is VERY soft, so don&#x27;t expect a deep clean/exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I personally felt the bristols were far too soft and gentle to truly exfoliate my skin, however, paired with some of Ã‰tude House&#x27;s facial cleansers this brush can actually do a little something.</li>

            <li> so gentle, i use this for an everyday routine and it seriously helps a lot, and it came with a cute little box.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that very much because it not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was still too much for my sensitive skin and my face turned red.  </li>
            <li> The shipping came about a month earlier than expected and its inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The bristle area is about an inch long.</li>
            <li> It sits upside down in the case so any excess moisture drains from the brush (which is necessary for the life of a brush), and the case has tiny drainage holes in the bottom to relieve the excess moisture.</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want something that is rough on my face</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> A little softer then I expected but it did its job</li>
            <li> The container has little holes on the bottom where the water can run out if your brush is still wet.</li>
            <li> It also helps to scrub off my makeup without getting my hands all wet and messy.</li>
            <li> Helps me use less amount of my face cleaning cream..</li>
            <li> but I dropped it a few times and it kept breaking</li>
            <li> It kept in closed container , preventing from getting dirty from the outside</li>
            <li> This is small and comes with</li>
            <li> For me, I noticed a small difference of cleaner pores every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I was shocked about how soft the bristles are on this brush.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately fell to the ground and broke.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed-</li>

            <li> i received my product on time and it was nicely packaged. I really like the brush. It is soft but still gently exfoliates the skin. I keep switching between this brush and my silicon gel cleansing brush. Comparing to the price you get more than you pay for. Totally recommend this</li>
            <li> the brush is too soft and i cant use it to clean my face since it just smushes into my face.</li>
            <li> An absolutely good product, the bristles are soft enough to use everyday and give a deep clean. Its way more sanitary than using your hands to wash your face. The shipping came about a month earlier than expected and its inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, it won&#x27;t scratch your face.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash/clean and helps clean my face.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use this in conjunction with some cleansing products. The bristles are soft and gentle on the skin but I am not sure if it helped me clean my skin more effectively than if I didn&#x27;t use it. The bristles were also somewhat sparse. The packaging is great because it essentially came with a little holder for you to dry and store the brush away. Overall, it was an okay product.</li>
            <li> Helps me use less amount of my face cleaning cream.. A little softer then I expected but it did its job</li>
            <li> This pore brush is very gentle on your my skin and does seem to work. It is cute, easy to use, and has a handy way to dry itself.</li>
            <li> Love the brush! It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> I like this brush, it does its job but don&#x27;t expect it to feel like an exfoliant. The bristles are soft and very light.</li>
            <li> Way too soft to do anything</li>
            <li> I really love it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so soft, I used to clean my face every day after makeup, I feel so clean and my skin can breath after i brush my face. But unfortunately fell to the ground and broke.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy new one soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you.</li>
            <li> VERY SOFT AND I FEEL LIKE ITS BETTER THAN USING MY HANDS TO CLEAN MY FACE. IT GETS IN THERE</li>
            <li> This brush is great for lathering product on your face, but the bristles are too fine to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me feel any cleaner because the brush is very soft. I did feel the pionty tips of the brush poke into my pores. I don&#x27;t like that very much because it not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I love all Etude House products and the same goes for this one its so tiny and cute. The brush itself is very soft on the skin would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and cleans well but I would have liked it better if the bristles were a little thicker so I can /really/ get the dirt out of my pores. When paired with Etude House Wonder Pore Whipping Foam, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is so much clearer and not as oily. I really like this brush :)</li>
            <li> I feel like it clean my skin very thoroughly and cleans in your pores, but this brush is a gentle clean not an exfoliating clean.I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> its so cute and i like it</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and does not irritate my skin. It also helps to scrub off my makeup without getting my hands all wet and messy.</li>
            <li> I personally felt the bristols were far too soft and gentle to truly exfoliate my skin, however, paired with some of Ã‰tude House&#x27;s facial cleansers this brush can actually do a little something. If your face needs to be exfoliated often due to excessive dead skin, this brush may not be a good fit for you. But on the plus side, its case is so hygienic and has vents to allow proper ventilation to take place, preventing bacteria to grow on your brush.</li>
            <li> If anything it&#x27;s good for massaging the product into your pores, if it even does that. The brush feels nice and soft so washing with it feels like a pleasant experience, it&#x27;s very soft and when mixed with the foam wash it feels rather nice. Other than that I doubt it does much more than using your hand or perhaps a wash cloth or any other cleansing device.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a face brush.  Works as a face brush should.  But certainly nothing to get all excited about.</li>
            <li> It.s a cute item. The bristles are very soft. It.s handy. And it was only a dollar or so.</li>
            <li> works nicely but I dropped it a few times and it kept breaking and I had to superglue it. Finally I just threw it out and ordered a wooden handled one.</li>
            <li> love the soft brush! my brush container had a small crack in it when I opened the package, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Really good and soft for my skin!! If you want something hard this not for you, however if you have sensitive or dry skin it is perfect</li>
            <li> I was shocked about how soft the bristles are on this brush. It truly is a great pair with the Wonder Pore foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> I Like this a lot - even though I can&#x27;t use it.  It has very fine bristles and they are very gentle.  That&#x27;s what I wanted for my sensitive Rosacea skin.  This is small and comes with it&#x27;s own cover making it perfect for travel and keeping it clean while in the drawer.  I used it with a creamy face wash and I felt very refreshed afterward.  Much more thorough and gentler than a this washcloth.Very easy to rinse out afterward.  Unfortunately it was still too much for my sensitive skin and my face turned red.  So, this is going to one of my daughters whose skin can handle it.  Everyone else I think this would work great for.</li>
            <li> Fluffy and wonderful. I got it along with the Wonder Pore Whipping Cream. I feel like this does a better job that my fingers- which are smooth and potentially dirty. I do wash my hands, but I like knowing that everything is clean and really being gutted. For me, I noticed a small difference of cleaner pores every time I use it.</li>
            <li> So cute and efficient, fits in my bag and suitable for travel</li>
            <li> This arrived on time a packaged perfectly. This is a fantastic little brush that I would recommend that everyone use. Etude is my favorite company to buy from as they never let me down.</li>
            <li> Love it. Clean up nicely and very gently. It is a little smaller than i expected. Cute packaging.</li>
            <li> so gentle, i use this for an everyday routine and it seriously helps a lot, and it came with a cute little box.</li>
            <li> This pore brush is REALLY soft!!! It&#x27;s so soft that I kind of question whether or not it really is doing the job it&#x27;s supposed to. It keeps you from scratching and tearing your skin though. I plan to use this on my nose and cheek area and possible my chin. That&#x27;s where all my blackheads and large pores congregate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pore brush comes with a cute container and is about 2.5 inches tall in total. That&#x27;s without attaching the end of the brush to the container it comes with. The bristle area is about an inch long. The container has little holes on the bottom where the water can run out if your brush is still wet. So you don&#x27;t have to worry about moisture collecting inside the container after you&#x27;ve just used the brush.</li>
            <li> Not only is the packaging super cute, but the brush is perfect for cleaning your pores because it is gentle enough for everyday use. This brush is now a staple for my skin care tools (:</li>
            <li> Great little travel brush to help keep you clean. The brush is VERY soft, so don&#x27;t expect a deep clean/exfoliation. Use this with a gentle cleanser to really give your skin a break from everything harsh in life. I love that this brush comes with its own little case. It sits upside down in the case so any excess moisture drains from the brush (which is necessary for the life of a brush), and the case has tiny drainage holes in the bottom to relieve the excess moisture. It&#x27;s brilliant packaging! It is, however, plastic so don&#x27;t just throw it around without care. Overall great, but don&#x27;t buy this expecting it to really get deep down or to remove any major dirt. I use after an oil cleanser, with another soap-free/gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> My skin looked soooo clean when I used this for the first time. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> Very soft and gentle brush. I didn&#x27;t use it much because I prefer using my hands to cleanse my face, but it was a nice product overall.</li>
            <li> This product is worth buying, the blush is so soft and clean your face very good.  I bought two of them, I love it.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for my sister.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft. I use it with my facial cleanser and it works great!</li>
            <li> it is really soft that i wish it was a little bit rough XD, it is very gentle and way better than using your hands, and the price is so affordable, the packaging is GREAT &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I think the brush is too soft and doesn&#x27;t do the work it supposed to do- clean the pores. You can do the same with your fingertips. Design is good, though. It kept in closed container , preventing from getting dirty from the outside</li>
            <li> Ive had my brush for 2 days already &amp; I adore it...My skin is so soft &amp; it lathers my products nicely. Also its very easy to clean</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. It&#x27;s super cute. I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This brush is extremely soft *~* I love how soft it is and cute. However it doesn&#x27;t give me that scrub feeling I need when washing my face. I have to scrub more with this. I don&#x27;t want something that is rough on my face but this is kind of a bit too gentle. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting the scrub I need to fully clean my face and pores. So that&#x27;s the only downfall. It does clean though and I love it. It&#x27;s very cute. I love Kbeauty brands and trying any new I find! So I always suggest trying them for yourself. Everything works differently for everyone. :)  Shipping was quick too so that&#x27;s always a bonus! I ordered the whipping foaming face wash with this so it&#x27;s included in my review photos.</li>
            <li> SO SOFT. I love this brush</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed- it&#x27;s a lot smaller than advertised, and doesn&#x27;t snap into lid like the image makes it seem. Still nice, and still works.</li>
            <li> IT IS REALLY CUTE AND VERY SOFT BUT YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITH A SPONGE OR WASH CLOTH.  I DON&#x27;T SEE THIS REALLY CLEANING OUT YOUR PORES, BETTER FOR KIDS AND PREETEENS</li>
