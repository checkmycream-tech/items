            <li> Cannot be returned, as it is &amp;#34;used&amp;#34;  Funny, hard to tell if something works if you can&#x27;t open it up and try it.  </li>
            <li> Much smaller bottles than expected based on earlier purchases.</li>
            <li> If I order this product again, I&#x27;ll stick with the pink only.</li>
            <li> BUT, IT IS INTENDED FOR HARDER NAILS</li>
            <li> Probably just a matter of personal taste, but the pink at least give a hint of pink color</li>
            <li> like the pink for a little bit of color.</li>
            <li> It also was about half the size of the bottles you would have thought you were getting for the price.</li>
            <li> Not sure which was the culprit, because there was extreme peeling when both applied.  </li>
            <li> so if your nails are not very attractive as you are trying to &#x27;treat&#x27; them, the pink helps to camouflage it just a bit.  </li>
            <li> In the past nothing would stay on without peeling off.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $!  </li>
            <li> very expensive product that yellows the nails and peels off.  </li>
            <li> This product damaged my nails so badly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible!</li>
            <li> I used to have the worst nails, they never grew, and even when i attempted to grow them, they would end up chipping or peeling.</li>

            <li> love this product, my nails have never looked so good or grown so long.  It takes something really drastic to break one.  I&#x27;ve been using this gel coat since March and only broke two nails.</li>
            <li> I did nails for over 28 years and find this product to be incredibly good for me.  My polish stays on until I take it off. In the past nothing would stay on without peeling off.  The way I have found to get the best results is put the clear base on first, followed by the pink gel coat and then I put only 1 coat of Mademoiselle by Essie and last Seche Vite top coat.  I found if I put more coats on it does peel off.  The fewer the coats the better it stays on.  Having said all of that, I have purchased for several of my friends and it did not work for them.  Mostly it peeled.  Maybe they put too many coats on.  Try the way I have suggested and you might get better results.</li>
            <li> Love this for keeping my nails strong</li>
            <li> This has worked wonders with my nails.....strong and growing beautifully!</li>
            <li> I like the clear look.  Also helps to strengthen nails.</li>
            <li> Did not work, nails continue to break</li>
            <li> I had seen this on one of the TV shopping channels. It looked really good on their nails. However when I put it on mine it didn&#x27;t look very consisted. It also was about half the size of the bottles you would have thought you were getting for the price. I have it a 3 because of the nice shine the clear me.</li>
            <li> This product looks great when you FIRST apply it - &amp; that&#x27;s it!! it starts peeling off right away.  Don&#x27;t waste your $!  It&#x27;s terrible!</li>
            <li> These are great instant MANI !!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I wish it came in a larger size and was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great products but not a good value. Much smaller bottles than expected based on earlier purchases. T.V. offers better values when product is showcased.</li>
            <li> ...but did not care for the &#x27;clear&#x27; gel coat.  Probably just a matter of personal taste, but the pink at least give a hint of pink color so if your nails are not very attractive as you are trying to &#x27;treat&#x27; them, the pink helps to camouflage it just a bit.  The clear made my nails look yellowish, which I did not care for.  If I order this product again, I&#x27;ll stick with the pink only.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I used to have the worst nails, they never grew, and even when i attempted to grow them, they would end up chipping or peeling. This gel coat not only makes my nails look SO healthy but I can honestly say I have never seen my nails so long and strong before. So glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it. I tried it on my nails for 6 weeks. I expected it to repair more damage than it did. I won&#x27;&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to make my nails stronger and grow longer, this gel helps a lot. It makes them stronger and the shine makes them look nice.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before because it makes the nails stronger.</li>
            <li> If you want pink nails that look natural and healthy and a shine that will last till it grows out then this is for you. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products but this exceeds all expectations. Buy it in the travel version as you can use every last speck of this polish without hardening in the bottle.</li>
            <li> IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KEEP YOUR NAILS HARDER. THIS IS THE STUFF.&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS A STRONG SMELL BUT, IT IS INTENDED FOR HARDER NAILS AND DOES THE JOB VERY WELL.&lt;br /&gt;I SURE YOU WILL BE HAPPY IF YOU PURCHASE THIS ITEM. I ALREADY AM ON MY SECOND SET.</li>
            <li> Like this product and size.  Easy to carry for travel.  Esp. like the pink for a little bit of color.</li>
            <li> This product damaged my nails so badly.  It&#x27;s been a couple of months since I used it and they are still all split and won&#x27;t grow.  Ugh!</li>
            <li> I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT PREVIOUSLY FROM A  SHOPPING CHANNEL FOR HIGHER PRICE PLUS S&amp;H. This is a very good product.  It protects my nails making them look almost like a French manicure. IT is translucent and has a soft pink tint.&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU ON NOT CARE. FOR COLORED POLISH, YOU  WILL LIKE THIS POLISHED LOOK ON YOUR NAILS.</li>
            <li> Not sure which was the culprit, because there was extreme peeling when both applied.  The Strong Nail System, counterpart, is excellent!  It strengthens peeling nail and makes them grow.</li>
            <li> My nails look very nice and the gel serves as protection from breakage. Works best for me when I add a clear coat. Prevents chipping of gel. Wished it came in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> very expensive product that yellows the nails and peels off.  Cannot be returned, as it is &amp;#34;used&amp;#34;  Funny, hard to tell if something works if you can&#x27;t open it up and try it.  Beware.  I am out $50 between this and the booster product</li>
