    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is just awesome.</li>
            <li>BUT it is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Awesome, makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>Like my great grandma&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li>and I just thought I was having a \\&quot;good skin day.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this from sehpora and loved it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SERUM!</li>
            <li>an amazing, noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;Another nice thing is that I&#x27;ve had to apply retinol nightly for years for hormonal acne, but with this I don&#x27;t have to use a separate retinol treatment.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to like it because of the price, but I liked it nevertheless.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t lose it; I just couldn&#x27;t decide if I liked it or not.</li>
            <li>If they don&#x27;t deter you, you will LOVE Good Genes.  </li>
            <li>I read reviews, viewed youtube video&#x27;s and heard so many good reviews on this.</li>
            <li>Been using Good Genes for awhile and think it does a fabulous job.  </li>
            <li>Days 2-6 were the ones where I made sure I had my receipt somewhere</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s the beginnings of a worry line across my forehead and if anything I thought it made it look more pronounced.</li>
            <li>I can still unscrew the top and use the plastic part for the pump to scrape some out, so I should be able to get more out that way</li>
            <li>It does something magical to my face.  </li>
            <li>should add that it doesn&#x27;t smell particularly good, but it&#x27;s certainly worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell didn&#x27;t bother me as I had read in many reviews.  </li>
            <li>More perfume sample, toothpaste (not together) and brush my hair, spritzing hair scent in.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in LOVE</li>
            <li>I really would have loved to say how amazing it is like the rest of the comments I have read.</li>
            <li>I ordered through a famous beauty site, not Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have generally pretty good skin.</li>
            <li>excellent for dry</li>
            <li>My skin is a lot brighter now and fine lines are more smoothed out, however I have noticed my skin breaking out</li>
            <li>My skin tone was more even, that line stopped being as pronounced, the zits went away, redness faded, it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>It brightens, tightens, and diminishes fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I think it smells citrusy and nice, but he&#x27;s not as much a fan.</li>
            <li>I got the free sample from Sephora and tried it as a mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: It&#x27;s April now (I wrote the original review in November)</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s almost familiar.</li>
            <li>already has a pretty great skin routine though and is just looking for that \\&quot;next</li>
            <li>&quot; so 1/2 pump will probably do it.uessing anyone thinking about getting this already has a pretty great skin routine though and is just looking for that \\&quot;next</li>
            <li>The serum minus the smell gave me great results.</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t be able to get away with 1/2 a pump; when I use my skincare products on my husband, who takes care of his skin sporadically, I have to use about 4x as much.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft when used with moisturizer and a nice oil.</li>
            <li>I mostly use a drop rubbed in every night, but I have tried it as a mask and think that it is great for immediate work but not everyday because your skin will dry out from over use.  </li>
            <li>Again, it fades quickly, so meh.</li>
            <li>Most highly recommended.</li>
            <li>so I had a good long while to think about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Even my husband noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>The first night I had it back, amazing.</li>
            <li>I managed enough samples for about 3 days, and after switching back to my old serum I kept wishing I had more Good Genes.</li>
            <li>(at this price per bottle you&#x27;d better believe I&#x27;m going to get every last bit I can!).</li>
            <li>will say that if your skin isn&#x27;t well-hydrated and such that it will soak in more of this</li>
            <li>There are a lot of outstanding reviews on Sephora already, too (same price there and here).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I unscrew the top and use the pumping wand to place a very tiny amount in my hand.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I have never spent this much money on any skin care, and was very excited to get it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy my first bottle of Good Genes from Amazon, but I was on here checking the price for my inevitable second bottle purchase and thought I&#x27;d review it.</li>
            <li>I got a teeny tiny sample of Good Genes from Sephora as a freebie, and was totally hooked.</li>
            <li>Product is very good but has a chemical or strong medicinal smell that is unpleasant.</li>
            <li>A small pump is all I need for it to make my skin look healthy, plumped, radiant, smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the pump because too much comes out for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like what it&#x27;s done for my complexion.</li>
            <li>I really was looking forward to receiving and using this.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Ahhhh,\\&quot; sighed I, \\&quot;this is really working.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel a difference really when I put it on my face.  </li>
            <li>Either way, my skin is glowing and clear thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>This serum is expensive and doesn&#x27;t smell great</li>
            <li>( very lemon-y, not in a natural way)</li>
            <li>I dread putting it on everyday because of the smell, but I love the effect of it.</li>
            <li>I have never had any issues with skin care products and I am one to try new products all the time.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this.  </li>
            <li>Love it for everyday  soft skin.</li>
            <li>It was such a mild sting, though, that I think even those with sensitive skin shouldn&#x27;t have a problem, but make sure you try it out before you commit to buy (or at least buy somewhere with a return policy)</li>
            <li>I tried it first as a sample and noticed results the next day.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used where I saw results IMMEDIATELY after the first use.  </li>
            <li>if that&#x27;s a concern.&lt;br /&gt;After that, though, some sort of secondary magic happened.</li>
            <li>But this is the first thing in a long time to make</li>
            <li>Wow is all I could say from the moment I used a sample of this.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it, but since it&#x27;s a chemical exfoliant, if you have sensitive skin you might want to try a sample and patch test first, and probably not use it daily.</li>
            <li>As for the smell that some people have complained about: I really don&#x27;t get it, the bottle I got smells fresh and citrusy.</li>
            <li>I used a gift card for this high dollar purchase and unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t able to get a refund.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to remember to update when the bottle finally kicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Early May, and the bottle&#x27;s kicked.</li>
            <li>With such an expensive purchase it&#x27;s good to have an idea of how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get instant results every night I use it and over 3 weeks of regular use, it has lightened and smoothed old scars.</li>
            <li>Also, the first few days I put it on I noticed a sting.</li>

            <li> I get instant results every night I use it and over 3 weeks of regular use, it has lightened and smoothed old scars.</li>
            <li> Also, the first few days I put it on I noticed a sting.</li>
            <li> My hormonal acne has always been BAD when left untreated, but so far I&#x27;ve been able to get away with just this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how long a bottle will last.</li>
            <li> But it was clearly watered down form on the sample.</li>
            <li> When I got the samples, 2 ml lasted about 2 nights, and one ounce is roughly 30 ml, so that would make me think that this bottle is only going to last me a month, but I think that doesn&#x27;t account for the amount of product that adhered to the side of the sample bottle.</li>
            <li> I am not old and don&#x27;t want to smell that way.</li>
            <li> So the bottle lasted about 6 months, using once a day at about a half pump per use, with a bit left to salvage in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I like to mix a little bit of GG with my regular spf30 moisturizer, and it does miracles -</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a retail of $200/year, which is kinda dramatic looking at it, but my skin really seems to be giving me an ultimatum over my continued use of this.</li>
            <li> Small red bumps.  </li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a sting, or any negative side effects (such as smell, acne, etc.)</li>
            <li> The scent, while a bit unpleasant, quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> On a slightly damp face, this will cover it.  </li>
            <li> is getting less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Using it this way, this small bottle should last at least 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried giving it up for a little while to see if my skin would revolt and</li>
            <li> A few zits around my hairline popped up.</li>
            <li> I tired this on several occasions over a three month period hoping the rash was caused by something else</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a glow and a plump that I don&#x27;t usually have; in addition, my worry lines fade a little every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a different product, because the one I ordered has a totally different smell, and its bad.</li>
            <li> The zits were really, really small, but I could see they were there even if no one else could.</li>
            <li> I must be an alien or something.</li>
            <li> That went away after a few days, or I got used to it, and it wasn&#x27;t that bad to begin with, but if you have really sensitive skin, it might be something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> It started to tingle, but I&#x27;m a hard -core beauty - cream fiend, so I got this.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever repurchase skin creams or serums</li>
            <li> I slink shamefully out of bed, aghast at my retching stench, and run down stairs to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> Who TF is cracking open those eggs, they&#x27;re BAD, throw them away!  </li>
            <li> husband also says my face smells weird when I put it on.</li>
            <li> It smells so so bad.</li>
            <li> To me the smell isn&#x27;t bad that everyone complains about.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really bad.</li>
            <li> Again, the smell is bad</li>
            <li> I am completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ending up trashing this which made me sick!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is just awesome. I get instant results every night I use it and over 3 weeks of regular use, it has lightened and smoothed old scars. Makes my skin super soft when used with moisturizer and a nice oil. I definitely recommend it, but since it&#x27;s a chemical exfoliant, if you have sensitive skin you might want to try a sample and patch test first, and probably not use it daily.</li>
            <li> I tried it first as a sample and noticed results the next day. I didn&#x27;t want to like it because of the price, but I liked it nevertheless. I managed enough samples for about 3 days, and after switching back to my old serum I kept wishing I had more Good Genes. Sephora was out of stock at the time so I had a good long while to think about it.&lt;br /&gt;Finally got it again about two months later. The first night I had it back, amazing. The next day my skin looked brighter, like it glowed, and softer. Days 2-6 were the ones where I made sure I had my receipt somewhere I wouldn&#x27;t lose it; I just couldn&#x27;t decide if I liked it or not. There&#x27;s the beginnings of a worry line across my forehead and if anything I thought it made it look more pronounced. A few zits around my hairline popped up. The zits were really, really small, but I could see they were there even if no one else could. Also, the first few days I put it on I noticed a sting. That went away after a few days, or I got used to it, and it wasn&#x27;t that bad to begin with, but if you have really sensitive skin, it might be something to keep in mind. It was such a mild sting, though, that I think even those with sensitive skin shouldn&#x27;t have a problem, but make sure you try it out before you commit to buy (or at least buy somewhere with a return policy) if that&#x27;s a concern.&lt;br /&gt;After that, though, some sort of secondary magic happened. One morning I woke up and I just thought I was having a \\&quot;good skin day.\\&quot; My skin tone was more even, that line stopped being as pronounced, the zits went away, redness faded, it was fantastic. I have generally pretty good skin. I wear sunscreen every day, and wash/treat/moisturize every morning and night. But this is the first thing in a long time to make an amazing, noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;Another nice thing is that I&#x27;ve had to apply retinol nightly for years for hormonal acne, but with this I don&#x27;t have to use a separate retinol treatment. My hormonal acne has always been BAD when left untreated, but so far I&#x27;ve been able to get away with just this.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how long a bottle will last. When I got the samples, 2 ml lasted about 2 nights, and one ounce is roughly 30 ml, so that would make me think that this bottle is only going to last me a month, but I think that doesn&#x27;t account for the amount of product that adhered to the side of the sample bottle. I&#x27;ll try to update this when the bottle finally runs out. With such an expensive purchase it&#x27;s good to have an idea of how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s April now (I wrote the original review in November) and I&#x27;ve got about 1/5 of the bottle left. I tend to use it once a day. I skip some, but I think that&#x27;s made up for when I do double days. I tried giving it up for a little while to see if my skin would revolt and it did.&lt;br /&gt;My husband also says my face smells weird when I put it on. About 5 minutes or so and then it fades. I think it smells citrusy and nice, but he&#x27;s not as much a fan. Again, it fades quickly, so meh. I&#x27;ll try to remember to update when the bottle finally kicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Early May, and the bottle&#x27;s kicked. I can still unscrew the top and use the plastic part for the pump to scrape some out, so I should be able to get more out that way (at this price per bottle you&#x27;d better believe I&#x27;m going to get every last bit I can!). So the bottle lasted about 6 months, using once a day at about a half pump per use, with a bit left to salvage in the bottle. I think that&#x27;s worth it. That&#x27;s a retail of $200/year, which is kinda dramatic looking at it, but my skin really seems to be giving me an ultimatum over my continued use of this. I would definitely recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that if your skin isn&#x27;t well-hydrated and such that it will soak in more of this and you won&#x27;t be able to get away with 1/2 a pump; when I use my skincare products on my husband, who takes care of his skin sporadically, I have to use about 4x as much. I&#x27;m guessing anyone thinking about getting this already has a pretty great skin routine though and is just looking for that \\&quot;next level,\\&quot; so 1/2 pump will probably do it.uessing anyone thinking about getting this already has a pretty great skin routine though and is just looking for that \\&quot;next level,\\&quot; so 1/2 pump will probably do it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy my first bottle of Good Genes from Amazon, but I was on here checking the price for my inevitable second bottle purchase and thought I&#x27;d review it. I LOVE THIS SERUM! This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used where I saw results IMMEDIATELY after the first use.  It does something magical to my face.  It brightens, tightens, and diminishes fine lines.  Even my husband noticed a difference right away. There are a lot of outstanding reviews on Sephora already, too (same price there and here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a very small amount.  I don&#x27;t use the pump because too much comes out for me.  I unscrew the top and use the pumping wand to place a very tiny amount in my hand.  On a slightly damp face, this will cover it.  Using it this way, this small bottle should last at least 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that it doesn&#x27;t smell particularly good, but it&#x27;s certainly worth it to me.  The smell and the price are the only negatives.  If they don&#x27;t deter you, you will LOVE Good Genes.  Most highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Life changing product! Definitely recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> It smells so so bad. I dread putting it on everyday because of the smell, but I love the effect of it. The serum minus the smell gave me great results.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  To me the smell isn&#x27;t bad that everyone complains about.  I also like the tingling sensation, makes me think its doing it&#x27;s job.  I mostly use a drop rubbed in every night, but I have tried it as a mask and think that it is great for immediate work but not everyday because your skin will dry out from over use.  It also makes my skin feel soft and smooth and I have even noticed my wrinkle that is in between my eyebrows is getting less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream 2 times a day, morning and night. I really like what it&#x27;s done for my complexion. My skin is a lot brighter now and fine lines are more smoothed out, however I have noticed my skin breaking out so I will try it once a week now and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> I read reviews, viewed youtube video&#x27;s and heard so many good reviews on this. I bit the bullet and shelled out $105 for this product.  I really was looking forward to receiving and using this.  I have never had any issues with skin care products and I am one to try new products all the time.  I have oily to combo skin.  This product continually broke me out in a rash on several occasions.  Small red bumps.  I found this product to sting as well.  The smell didn&#x27;t bother me as I had read in many reviews.  I tired this on several occasions over a three month period hoping the rash was caused by something else but I eliminated everything else but this.  I used a gift card for this high dollar purchase and unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t able to get a refund.  I ending up trashing this which made me sick!</li>
            <li> I got the free sample from Sephora and tried it as a mask. It started to tingle, but I&#x27;m a hard -core beauty - cream fiend, so I got this. It started to bad-itch, like you knew it would hurt to scratch but it itches but it would hurt.  \\&quot;Ahhhh,\\&quot; sighed I, \\&quot;this is really working. Excellent.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 minutes into this battle of Mind over Skin, and Skin engaged Olfactory reinforcements.  I was eventually overcome by my instinctual responses of:  Uggggggh!!!  Who TF is cracking open those eggs, they&#x27;re BAD, throw them away!  And, saints preSERve me, who let a feral cat in here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face but the scent lingered. I dabbed a bit of fragrance sampler in with my moisterizer, and went to bed. That was last night. This morning I wake up, my head nuzzled into my husband&#x27;s chest inhale deepl--heaven of mercy, WHAT did he EAT?  But it&#x27;s almost familiar. O.  M.  G.  It&#x27;s that nasty-ass sample again!  I slink shamefully out of bed, aghast at my retching stench, and run down stairs to exfoliate.  More perfume sample, toothpaste (not together) and brush my hair, spritzing hair scent in.  That was hopefully the last trace of anything to do with this in my house.</li>
            <li> Been using Good Genes for awhile and think it does a fabulous job.  People ask me about my skin all the time.</li>
            <li> Love it for everyday  soft skin.</li>
            <li> excellent for dry no -oily skin.</li>
            <li> I got a teeny tiny sample of Good Genes from Sephora as a freebie, and was totally hooked. I like to mix a little bit of GG with my regular spf30 moisturizer, and it does miracles - a little bit goes a long way! I immediately noticed a glow and a plump that I don&#x27;t usually have; in addition, my worry lines fade a little every time I use it. I didn&#x27;t notice a sting, or any negative side effects (such as smell, acne, etc.) - I think it&#x27;s because I mix it with my moisturizer. So before you chuck your GG for side effects, try mixing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in LOVE</li>
            <li> The smell is really bad. I can&#x27;t stand it when applying it on my face. I&#x27;m using the sample, so don&#x27;t know the result. But for the smell I won&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from sehpora and loved it. I don&#x27;t know if I got a different product, because the one I ordered has a totally different smell, and its bad. Like my great grandma&#x27;s smell. I am not old and don&#x27;t want to smell that way. And I don&#x27;t see any benefits form using this after 2 weeks. I have never spent this much money on any skin care, and was very excited to get it. But it was clearly watered down form on the sample. Again, the smell is bad and I don&#x27;t feel a difference really when I put it on my face.  I am completely disappointed. I really would have loved to say how amazing it is like the rest of the comments I have read. I must be an alien or something.</li>
            <li> Awesome, makes my skin feel great. As for the smell that some people have complained about: I really don&#x27;t get it, the bottle I got smells fresh and citrusy. Perhaps they&#x27;ve changed the formula a bit? Either way, my skin is glowing and clear thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Wow is all I could say from the moment I used a sample of this. I ordered through a famous beauty site, not Amazon. This serum is expensive and doesn&#x27;t smell great ( very lemon-y, not in a natural way) BUT it is amazing!! I use it sparingly when going out or when I want to look extra awake and radiant, because of the price tag. A small pump is all I need for it to make my skin look healthy, plumped, radiant, smooth and hydrated. I hardly ever repurchase skin creams or serums but I will never be without this one.</li>
            <li> Product is very good but has a chemical or strong medicinal smell that is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this.  It&#x27;s A-mazing!</li>
            <li> Never have I  used a product in my almost 60 years that there was immediate improvement.  Helps prevent  the sleep creases.  The scent, while a bit unpleasant, quickly dissipates.  Oh this review is by Ron&#x27;s wife, Debbie, but I believe he would be amazed also.</li>
