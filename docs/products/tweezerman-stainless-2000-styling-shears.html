            <li>they make a great product.  </li>

            <li>I think these will provide many years of excellent service.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best ones, and cut the best.</li>
            <li>happy happy : )</li>
            <li>It fits perfect on my wife&#x27;s hand, but i thought it would be nice to let you know. :)</li>
            <li>I have fairly medium sized hands for a girl</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Good size.</li>
            <li>They feel light and mid-level quality at best.  </li>
            <li>The scissors have a good feel/weight to them.  </li>
            <li>delivery time was good.</li>
            <li>Good for trimming bangs and split ends.</li>
            <li>I would not use them to cut hair, however they are good for trims.</li>
            <li>and they were doing a good job.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>â€¦stop buying rinky dink cheap scissors, these are perfect!</li>
            <li>It was a good item, and a good decision to buy.</li>
            <li>These are good quality scissors for the price.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re quite suitable for my hair!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe that you NEED to see a hair stylist to have healthy beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing super awesome with these.</li>
            <li>did a great job, but said she needed better scissors.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>Perfect, and worth the money.</li>
            <li>So if you have to cut hair more than once a month, they are a great buy.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to be hacking at my own hair, I might as well have a good pair of shears and these do the trick.</li>
            <li>and it fits my right hand perfectly.  </li>
            <li>, the seller was great and they arrived very quickly with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>Like all the Tweezerman products I have tried this pair of scissors is beautifully made , and Amazon delivered it in perfect condition a day earlier than they promised.  </li>
            <li>These are excellent - just holding them and the first snip shows you how very well made and perfectly balanced they are - go for it!</li>
            <li>After buying these shears, and watching Youtube video tutorials (search &amp;#34;dhukai&amp;#34; shes amazing), I have learned to cut my hair BEAUTIFULLY, better than my hairstylist!</li>
            <li>Great scissors to cut my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li>Very nice product and easy for wife to cut kids&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li>I am not a hair stylist; I bought these to cut my own hair at home.</li>
            <li>Nice results.</li>
            <li>Sharp...very nice weight...    </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>They are good quality as are most tweezerman brand.</li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>You know, the kind that moves around when you cut it unless you hold it in place with the pincer-like grip of a titan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered these so I can cut my own hair, which I&#x27;ve been doing for a couple years now.</li>
            <li>Nice shears</li>
            <li>I cut my husband&#x27;s hair (and my own) and</li>
            <li>I trim my own bangs and front sides</li>
            <li>I have always cut my own hair and probably have been using scissors not meant for hair at all.  </li>
            <li>They make more noise than a good pair of scissors would.</li>
            <li>Just bought them so that I could do my own self-trims on my curly hair.</li>
            <li>They are a nice weight, and have helped me keep my pixie nice and neat.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have around for home hair cuts and trim ups.</li>
            <li>But these almost appear to be pewter, and they&#x27;re not as lightweight as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I have cut all three heads of hair with these scissors and a friend&#x27;s - hair ranging from very fine to very course and they worked perfect every time.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, nice feel in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, if you&#x27;re using these just to cut your kids hair or are a man then you&#x27;ll be okay, but if you want to grow your hair out</li>
            <li>I have never had a pair of scissors that I liked better.</li>
            <li>Because of the great reviews I thought I would give these a try for such a great price.  </li>
            <li>They work perfectly, and you really can&#x27;t beat free sharpening for life.    </li>
            <li>These scissors were a great investment and were reasonably-priced, especially for the great quality I got.</li>
            <li>we now have many satisfied family members with nice hair cuts.</li>
            <li>They have a great feel and cut the hair easily and cleanly.</li>
            <li>They are very precise.  </li>
            <li>One aside, probably not so great for anyone that has large size fingers</li>
            <li>Love these scissors for haircuts.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give them a try since I love the Tweezerman slanted tweezers.  </li>
            <li>They do the job, but I would like something better.  </li>
            <li>Much better than my orange paper scissors.</li>
            <li>i bought these to trim my split ends and what i ended up with is just more split ends.</li>
            <li>I love these scissors.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s excellent for the occasional trims.  </li>
            <li>Why a month?...not sure.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>the look is sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li>I cut my daughters hair and makes me want to do more stylish do&#x27;s on her.</li>
            <li>Love that this product comes with a warranty.</li>
            <li>and I bought the shears to do a better job.</li>
            <li>love these had a pair for years and wanted another...</li>
            <li>Are ok, was hoping they were sharper</li>
            <li>I love the results I&#x27;ve gotten with these shears.</li>
            <li>You can spend on your money on some better shears out there.</li>
            <li>and she wanted me to buy better scissors.  </li>
            <li>We love these</li>
            <li>perfectly the entire length of the blades.  </li>
            <li>I have since purchased some scissors for $50 and am much more pleased.</li>
            <li>Also, the holes on these scissors are best for larger fingers.</li>
            <li>These are a perfect length for medium to short hair, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay . . .</li>
            <li>They did a wonderful job on my very fine, long hair.</li>
            <li>Great value - highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I used these with the CreaClip to cut my own hair and it went really well :) All those nerves were for naught!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on how they would fit larger hands but for me they are perfect</li>
            <li>I lost one of this, so that is why I asked for a third pair, they stay clean,sharp and are of very good quality.</li>
            <li>You can buy a sharper, more comfortable pair of shears at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for around $20.</li>
            <li>These scissors are good, very sturdy and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li>They may not be as good as what your hairdresser uses, but they are good enough to cut hair cleanly without causing any damage.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they&#x27;re awesome!</li>
            <li>They were perfectly packaged and sharp.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re well weighted, and the finger contours keep them both stable in your hand and easy to control.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is, it gets the job done and cuts easily.</li>
            <li>I have huge hands (but not sausage fingers) and the fit was okay.</li>
            <li>Strong and durable shears.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and work great!  </li>
            <li>Half an inch longer will be perfect.</li>
            <li>Super durable!</li>
            <li>Do it right the first time, works with any hair texture and does a darn good job at it too.</li>
            <li>fit just fine.  </li>
            <li>I do not have huge hands, so did not expect this.  </li>
            <li>The Wahl scissors weren&#x27;t able to cut through my hair when wet, so I&#x27;m happy to say that these can with ease.  </li>
            <li>They do not cut as smooth as I would like.  </li>
            <li>They have a lifetime sharpening warranty, and they are comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>Also note that Tweezerman will sharpen your Shears for free, although I have a feeling</li>
            <li>These ones are great, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fantastic for keeping around for hair trimming.  </li>
            <li>These scissors worked great on my son&#x27;s sideburns and the back parts that we can&#x27;t get with the clippers.  </li>
            <li>My hands fit in them without a problem</li>
            <li>I trim my bangs regularly with these and they do a great job.</li>
            <li>I bought these to replace the cheap scissors that came with my Wahl haircutting kit.  </li>
            <li>So far the Tweezerman brand is looking good</li>
            <li>These scissors are a very good quality, sharp and comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li>If you want to cut your own hair, do yourself a favor and get a decent pair of shears like these.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that is all you need in clippers.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and was in need of new scissors.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered the Tweezerman Stainless 2000 Styling Shears to cut my own hair and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the quality of the product... and free sharpening for life?</li>
            <li>They give me a clean cut every time.</li>
            <li>They feel good in the hand, well balanced, and cut reasonably well...as much as I could expect from the price.</li>
            <li>Easy to use for a novice and just the right length.</li>
            <li>so if you like split ends this is the right pair of scissors for you!</li>
            <li>She was right!</li>
            <li>Maybe I was expecting much more because of the great reviews these scissors received in the past.</li>
            <li>Currently don&#x27;t have a good case for it...but looking.    </li>
            <li>overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Early this year, I decided that I was going to start doing my own hair instead of paying 100</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews had me scared that they wouldn&#x27;t be good enough, but it was all I could afford.</li>
            <li>I am 60+ years old and have been trimming my own hair for years.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and cut hair beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Luckily my wife cuts my hair and her fingers</li>
            <li>It arrived SUPER quickly too.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought they would be to small for my hands, but they are perfect!!!!!</li>
            <li>They are adequate for how I use them.</li>
            <li>I love Tweezerman tweezers, and the haircutting scissors are great, if not better!</li>
            <li>The pair of Tweezerman shears I bought are great; they cut through my thick hair easily and cleanly.</li>
            <li>I bought two pairs of 5.5 inch shears for about the same price and these were far superior!  </li>
            <li>Sharp, comfortable, good size...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I trim my own hair until it the back gets too unruly, than I give into my hair stylist.      </li>
            <li>They are really worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad we bucked up and purchased professional quality sheers</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>and I would say that if you can&#x27;t afford to have a professional cut your hair these scissors should be able to give you a presentable look.</li>
            <li>They are nice and sharp and accurate.  </li>
            <li>i gave these shears a try and used them on 4 occasions and each time i used them the ends of my hair began splitting right from where i had cut.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp so they make nice clean and quick cuts.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great buy and worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re stainless steel, so I expect them to last me forever and so far, I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li>In general, they are a lot better that what I have, but my expectations were higher.</li>
            <li>I bought these solely for the occasional trim on myself and my family and these scissors work just fine!</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman Stainless 2000 was easier to use when trimming my sons hair, so I think these shears work much better for trims and bangs, but not for layering or major cuts.</li>
            <li>I have tried snipping away my split ends only to have the hair strand split even more.</li>
            <li>so I purchased these and just completed our first home cut.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly what  I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several pair of cheaper scissors that were better than this even after years of use.</li>
            <li>So far they have clipped my ends evenly and they don&#x27;t appear to be of cheap quality.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Best of all the company who makes them offers free sharping for the life of the scissors...buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li>I use it for trimming my pup&#x27;s hair since he moves so much (sound and pulling of old scissors freaked him out).  </li>
            <li>The scissors worked perfectly but now I look silly.</li>
            <li>Good quality and very sharp!  </li>
            <li>High quality, sharp, feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>Most women&#x27;s fingers will not be large enough to provide optimal control.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they seem like nice scizzors.  </li>
            <li>These shears are sharp, and come in a handy storage container.</li>
            <li>I wanted something better than the standard around the house scissor but at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Originally, I thought they were a little pricey, but I&#x27;m glad I made this</li>
            <li>For the man who has pretty much everything I puchased the Tweezerman 2000 styling shears for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>The product is as good if not better than advertised.</li>
            <li>I was doing a really good job, or so I thought, until my sister pointed out that.. Well, basically, I was using ordinary kitchen scissors to get rid of my split ends.</li>
            <li>These scissors are sharp, and they cut very well so far, and were a good price.</li>
            <li>I have large hands but slender fingers</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but i certainly wont be using these anymore.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They have a nice weight in your hand and are perfectly tight.  </li>
            <li>and No this will not help you get by until your next cut because like i said these scissors only create MORE split ends!</li>
            <li>Their only caveat it they do not have a fine point at the end.</li>
            <li>I wanted a nice little pair of trimming scissors</li>
            <li>Since I am an amateur, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot for a really good pair of scissors, but wanted something decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with them and would purchase them again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do too much hair trimming</li>
            <li>The scissors themselves cut very well and are priced well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;These scissors are very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>of stainless steel so that it won&#x27;t rust up or warp after</li>
            <li>I received it in a reasonable time frame.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much easier it is to cut my hair with these shears.  </li>
            <li>quality product with fast shipment to cut my hair..</li>
            <li>Perfect hair cutting scissors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these scissors to cut both my son and daughters hair and had an easier time using it on my son who has much shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I used it straight out of the box</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp and cut very very smoothly.</li>
            <li>She says these scissors are really high-quality, and just the right sharpness and open/close action.  </li>
            <li>I will agree with previous reviews that the thumb hole is small and if they were for me I&#x27;d deduct a star, but they work perfect for my wife.</li>
            <li>I like the their other products too and wil probably buy more of their tweezerman grooming stuffs</li>
            <li>A little small for my boyfriend&#x27;s fingers, but perfect for mine.</li>
            <li>Strong, sharp and did exactly what I needed them to do.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much because of the price, but I needed a new scissors to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Since I did not want to spend a lot of money on the new shears, I decided to go with Tweezerman Stainless 2000.</li>
            <li>A perfect tool for professional grade hair cutting without the cost of one.  </li>
            <li>Althought they cut ok, I should of gone with a slightly longer and lighter one.   </li>
            <li>If they were even half inch longer these would have been better.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to everyone.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these shears!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The motion of these scissors as you cut feels like you&#x27;re using high quality scissors.  </li>
            <li>you might want to shop around for something a little better.</li>
            <li>I wish the tips cut a little better for necklines and around the ears.</li>
            <li>3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to require much upkeep except for a quick rinse and wipe dry after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I bought these in addition to the Tweezerman Stainless 2000 Thinning Shears as a gift for the budding hairstylist in our family.  </li>
            <li>They do the job, but cut like normal scissors.</li>
            <li>average man size hands, shears small but fit nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used normal scissors before and they frayed my bangs, so I researched haircutting scissors to prevent this.</li>
            <li>This scissors may not be professional ones (you don&#x27;t get them for that price), but they are really ok and sharp!</li>
            <li>balance fine, cut sharp.</li>
            <li>Not the sharpest pair of scissors I&#x27;ve used, but definitely not dull by any means.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have chosen a better pair of scissors...very sharp and very comfortable in my small hand!</li>
            <li>the only time that i have had split ends are with these scissors (i do not get split ends because i keep a short bob cut so my hair is normally easy to maintain).</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, easy to handle and compact.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and very sharp.</li>
            <li>very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to handle,are not too large nor too small, and cut the hair with ease.</li>
            <li>Several others have mentioned that the finger holes are small, and it&#x27;s true they aren&#x27;t huge, so</li>
            <li>The scissors are very easy to handle for my small hands and cut through my thick hair very cleanly.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting the high quality, brushed stainless steel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really very sharp and light to use.</li>
            <li>The product was as described, they were very sharp and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Right out of the package, they&#x27;re not sharp enough to cut hair well.</li>
            <li>Also I noticed that they do a far better job with dry hair than wet hair, so please consider this also.</li>
            <li>I do have small hands, and I think they wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable to hold if you have particularly fat fingers.</li>
            <li>Using regular scissors will really damage your hair.    </li>
            <li>This makes the scissors unusable for 85% of adult users.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>you have adult sized hands and want to cut adult hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and trim my hair as needed with these shears.  </li>
            <li>I bought these as I had a pair of ice scissors that were getting old and started sticking.  </li>
            <li>I have owned expensive stainless steel hair scissors, and I knew better than to expect the same quality as the higher priced ones.  </li>
            <li>I have read that other people have had success with haircuts using these scissors as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharp and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>For less expensive scissors it is a very good idea to get a pair that have the micro-teeth.</li>
            <li>These shears are very sharp, easy to use, and just right for my small hands.</li>
            <li>We are not professional hair stylists, but we cut the whole family&#x27;s hair at home.  </li>
            <li>and they fit my small fingers well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, cuts very cleanly/sharply, small enough to fit my fingers (meant for female and/or small hands, my husband tried it and got stuck), has enough weight - not too light, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>The price was right for an initial investment, especially since she has now decided on another career path and uses them for personal purposes now.</li>
            <li>It was a bit pricier than the others, but this one actually works at cutting fine, loose, wispy kind of hair.</li>
            <li>Some Styling Shears can get really expensive, but if you need good basic shears, then these will do.</li>
            <li>These are not sharp at all.</li>
            <li>Not sharp at all.</li>
            <li>She used them in her Cosmetology classes; they worked well being of a comfortable weight and providing a precision sharpness for clean cutting.  </li>
            <li>The scissors are sharp, light, and the blades move well against each other with no gaps or catches.</li>
            <li>If you are not careful, you might cut yourself.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was a different purchase I ordered, but then I was surprised to find out</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s kind of expensive</li>
            <li>If you have very small hands, would probably work just fine.</li>
            <li>While they cost a lot less than professional shears, and they don&#x27;t cut quite as keenly as $200 scissors, they work really well for at-home trims.  </li>
            <li>They close really evenly and don&#x27;t miss any hairs, yet aren&#x27;t so sharp that I&#x27;m worried about accidentally knicking a child&#x27;s ear or gouging their eye.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy, sharp, and stainless.</li>
            <li>product is not sharp enough for my purposes</li>
            <li>Tried several styling shears during the years ; this one is not sharp at all compared to others.... should not have ordered.</li>
            <li>These scissors cut cleanly and are very sharp, they don&#x27;t pull the hairs while cutting and are very light in the hand.</li>
            <li>I was using the same shears that I cut paper and other household things with, and that doesn&#x27;t give the sharp, clean, uniform cuts that these shears give.  </li>
            <li>Great for cutting hair!</li>
            <li>These are sharp &#x3D; fast and quiet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some Tweezerman tweezers for the past 3-4 years and they are well worth it.</li>
            <li>so I needed something sharp but easy to use (small).  </li>
            <li>Sharp, holds hair well, easy for my small hands to use.</li>
            <li>These shears are not only sharp and ergonomicly designed, but have a very nice cutting feel when trimming hair, especially beards and moustaches.</li>
            <li>cut well, but a little heavy, which is fine b/c</li>
            <li>They do an amazing job cutting hair.  </li>

            <li> Perfect, and worth the money.</li>
            <li> So if you have to cut hair more than once a month, they are a great buy.</li>

            <li> If I&#x27;m going to be hacking at my own hair, I might as well have a good pair of shears and these do the trick.</li>

            <li> , the seller was great and they arrived very quickly with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Like all the Tweezerman products I have tried this pair of scissors is beautifully made , and Amazon delivered it in perfect condition a day earlier than they promised.  </li>

            <li> Nice results.</li>
            <li> Sharp...very nice weight...    </li>
            <li> I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> They are good quality as are most tweezerman brand.</li>
            <li> nice</li>
            <li> You know, the kind that moves around when you cut it unless you hold it in place with the pincer-like grip of a titan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered these so I can cut my own hair, which I&#x27;ve been doing for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> Nice shears</li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair (and my own) and</li>
            <li> I trim my own bangs and front sides</li>
            <li> I have always cut my own hair and probably have been using scissors not meant for hair at all.  </li>
            <li> They make more noise than a good pair of scissors would.</li>
            <li> Just bought them so that I could do my own self-trims on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> They are a nice weight, and have helped me keep my pixie nice and neat.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have around for home hair cuts and trim ups.</li>
            <li> But these almost appear to be pewter, and they&#x27;re not as lightweight as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I have cut all three heads of hair with these scissors and a friend&#x27;s - hair ranging from very fine to very course and they worked perfect every time.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, nice feel in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, if you&#x27;re using these just to cut your kids hair or are a man then you&#x27;ll be okay, but if you want to grow your hair out</li>
            <li> I have never had a pair of scissors that I liked better.</li>
            <li> Because of the great reviews I thought I would give these a try for such a great price.  </li>
            <li> They work perfectly, and you really can&#x27;t beat free sharpening for life.    </li>
            <li> These scissors were a great investment and were reasonably-priced, especially for the great quality I got.</li>
            <li> we now have many satisfied family members with nice hair cuts.</li>
            <li> They have a great feel and cut the hair easily and cleanly.</li>
            <li> They are very precise.  </li>
            <li> One aside, probably not so great for anyone that has large size fingers</li>
            <li> Love these scissors for haircuts.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give them a try since I love the Tweezerman slanted tweezers.  </li>
            <li> They do the job, but I would like something better.  </li>
            <li> Much better than my orange paper scissors.</li>
            <li> i bought these to trim my split ends and what i ended up with is just more split ends.</li>
            <li> I love these scissors.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s excellent for the occasional trims.  </li>
            <li> Why a month?...not sure.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> the look is sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li> I cut my daughters hair and makes me want to do more stylish do&#x27;s on her.</li>
            <li> Love that this product comes with a warranty.</li>
            <li> and I bought the shears to do a better job.</li>
            <li> love these had a pair for years and wanted another...</li>
            <li> Are ok, was hoping they were sharper</li>
            <li> I love the results I&#x27;ve gotten with these shears.</li>
            <li> You can spend on your money on some better shears out there.</li>
            <li> and she wanted me to buy better scissors.  </li>
            <li> We love these</li>
            <li> perfectly the entire length of the blades.  </li>
            <li> I have since purchased some scissors for $50 and am much more pleased.</li>
            <li> Also, the holes on these scissors are best for larger fingers.</li>
            <li> These are a perfect length for medium to short hair, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay . . .</li>
            <li> They did a wonderful job on my very fine, long hair.</li>
            <li> Great value - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used these with the CreaClip to cut my own hair and it went really well :) All those nerves were for naught!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on how they would fit larger hands but for me they are perfect</li>
            <li> I lost one of this, so that is why I asked for a third pair, they stay clean,sharp and are of very good quality.</li>
            <li> You can buy a sharper, more comfortable pair of shears at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for around $20.</li>
            <li> These scissors are good, very sturdy and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li> They may not be as good as what your hairdresser uses, but they are good enough to cut hair cleanly without causing any damage.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they&#x27;re awesome!</li>
            <li> They were perfectly packaged and sharp.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re well weighted, and the finger contours keep them both stable in your hand and easy to control.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is, it gets the job done and cuts easily.</li>
            <li> I have huge hands (but not sausage fingers) and the fit was okay.</li>
            <li> Strong and durable shears.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and work great!  </li>
            <li> Half an inch longer will be perfect.</li>
            <li> Super durable!</li>
            <li> Do it right the first time, works with any hair texture and does a darn good job at it too.</li>
            <li> fit just fine.  </li>
            <li> I do not have huge hands, so did not expect this.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl scissors weren&#x27;t able to cut through my hair when wet, so I&#x27;m happy to say that these can with ease.  </li>
            <li> They do not cut as smooth as I would like.  </li>
            <li> They have a lifetime sharpening warranty, and they are comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Also note that Tweezerman will sharpen your Shears for free, although I have a feeling</li>
            <li> These ones are great, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fantastic for keeping around for hair trimming.  </li>
            <li> These scissors worked great on my son&#x27;s sideburns and the back parts that we can&#x27;t get with the clippers.  </li>
            <li> My hands fit in them without a problem</li>
            <li> I trim my bangs regularly with these and they do a great job.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the cheap scissors that came with my Wahl haircutting kit.  </li>
            <li> So far the Tweezerman brand is looking good</li>
            <li> These scissors are a very good quality, sharp and comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li> If you want to cut your own hair, do yourself a favor and get a decent pair of shears like these.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that is all you need in clippers.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and was in need of new scissors.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the Tweezerman Stainless 2000 Styling Shears to cut my own hair and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the quality of the product... and free sharpening for life?</li>
            <li> They give me a clean cut every time.</li>
            <li> They feel good in the hand, well balanced, and cut reasonably well...as much as I could expect from the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use for a novice and just the right length.</li>
            <li> so if you like split ends this is the right pair of scissors for you!</li>
            <li> She was right!</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting much more because of the great reviews these scissors received in the past.</li>
            <li> Currently don&#x27;t have a good case for it...but looking.    </li>
            <li> overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Early this year, I decided that I was going to start doing my own hair instead of paying 100</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews had me scared that they wouldn&#x27;t be good enough, but it was all I could afford.</li>
            <li> I am 60+ years old and have been trimming my own hair for years.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and cut hair beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Luckily my wife cuts my hair and her fingers</li>
            <li> It arrived SUPER quickly too.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought they would be to small for my hands, but they are perfect!!!!!</li>
            <li> They are adequate for how I use them.</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman tweezers, and the haircutting scissors are great, if not better!</li>
            <li> The pair of Tweezerman shears I bought are great; they cut through my thick hair easily and cleanly.</li>
            <li> I bought two pairs of 5.5 inch shears for about the same price and these were far superior!  </li>
            <li> Sharp, comfortable, good size...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I trim my own hair until it the back gets too unruly, than I give into my hair stylist.      </li>
            <li> They are really worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad we bucked up and purchased professional quality sheers</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> and I would say that if you can&#x27;t afford to have a professional cut your hair these scissors should be able to give you a presentable look.</li>
            <li> They are nice and sharp and accurate.  </li>
            <li> i gave these shears a try and used them on 4 occasions and each time i used them the ends of my hair began splitting right from where i had cut.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp so they make nice clean and quick cuts.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great buy and worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re stainless steel, so I expect them to last me forever and so far, I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li> In general, they are a lot better that what I have, but my expectations were higher.</li>
            <li> I bought these solely for the occasional trim on myself and my family and these scissors work just fine!</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman Stainless 2000 was easier to use when trimming my sons hair, so I think these shears work much better for trims and bangs, but not for layering or major cuts.</li>
            <li> I have tried snipping away my split ends only to have the hair strand split even more.</li>
            <li> so I purchased these and just completed our first home cut.  </li>
            <li> These are exactly what  I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several pair of cheaper scissors that were better than this even after years of use.</li>
            <li> So far they have clipped my ends evenly and they don&#x27;t appear to be of cheap quality.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Best of all the company who makes them offers free sharping for the life of the scissors...buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I use it for trimming my pup&#x27;s hair since he moves so much (sound and pulling of old scissors freaked him out).  </li>
            <li> The scissors worked perfectly but now I look silly.</li>
            <li> Good quality and very sharp!  </li>
            <li> High quality, sharp, feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Most women&#x27;s fingers will not be large enough to provide optimal control.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they seem like nice scizzors.  </li>
            <li> These shears are sharp, and come in a handy storage container.</li>
            <li> I wanted something better than the standard around the house scissor but at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Originally, I thought they were a little pricey, but I&#x27;m glad I made this</li>
            <li> For the man who has pretty much everything I puchased the Tweezerman 2000 styling shears for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> The product is as good if not better than advertised.</li>
            <li> I was doing a really good job, or so I thought, until my sister pointed out that.. Well, basically, I was using ordinary kitchen scissors to get rid of my split ends.</li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp, and they cut very well so far, and were a good price.</li>
            <li> I have large hands but slender fingers</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but i certainly wont be using these anymore.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They have a nice weight in your hand and are perfectly tight.  </li>
            <li> and No this will not help you get by until your next cut because like i said these scissors only create MORE split ends!</li>
            <li> Their only caveat it they do not have a fine point at the end.</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice little pair of trimming scissors</li>
            <li> Since I am an amateur, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot for a really good pair of scissors, but wanted something decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with them and would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do too much hair trimming</li>
            <li> The scissors themselves cut very well and are priced well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;These scissors are very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> of stainless steel so that it won&#x27;t rust up or warp after</li>
            <li> I received it in a reasonable time frame.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much easier it is to cut my hair with these shears.  </li>
            <li> quality product with fast shipment to cut my hair..</li>
            <li> Perfect hair cutting scissors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these scissors to cut both my son and daughters hair and had an easier time using it on my son who has much shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I used it straight out of the box</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and cut very very smoothly.</li>
            <li> She says these scissors are really high-quality, and just the right sharpness and open/close action.  </li>
            <li> I will agree with previous reviews that the thumb hole is small and if they were for me I&#x27;d deduct a star, but they work perfect for my wife.</li>
            <li> I like the their other products too and wil probably buy more of their tweezerman grooming stuffs</li>
            <li> A little small for my boyfriend&#x27;s fingers, but perfect for mine.</li>
            <li> Strong, sharp and did exactly what I needed them to do.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much because of the price, but I needed a new scissors to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Since I did not want to spend a lot of money on the new shears, I decided to go with Tweezerman Stainless 2000.</li>
            <li> A perfect tool for professional grade hair cutting without the cost of one.  </li>
            <li> Althought they cut ok, I should of gone with a slightly longer and lighter one.   </li>
            <li> If they were even half inch longer these would have been better.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these to everyone.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these shears!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The motion of these scissors as you cut feels like you&#x27;re using high quality scissors.  </li>
            <li> you might want to shop around for something a little better.</li>
            <li> I wish the tips cut a little better for necklines and around the ears.</li>
            <li> 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to require much upkeep except for a quick rinse and wipe dry after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to cut my 22 months old fast growing hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to cut my 22 months old fast growing hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these in addition to the Tweezerman Stainless 2000 Thinning Shears as a gift for the budding hairstylist in our family.  </li>
            <li> They do the job, but cut like normal scissors.</li>
            <li> average man size hands, shears small but fit nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used normal scissors before and they frayed my bangs, so I researched haircutting scissors to prevent this.</li>
            <li> This scissors may not be professional ones (you don&#x27;t get them for that price), but they are really ok and sharp!</li>
            <li> balance fine, cut sharp.</li>
            <li> Not the sharpest pair of scissors I&#x27;ve used, but definitely not dull by any means.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have chosen a better pair of scissors...very sharp and very comfortable in my small hand!</li>
            <li> the only time that i have had split ends are with these scissors (i do not get split ends because i keep a short bob cut so my hair is normally easy to maintain).</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, easy to handle and compact.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and very sharp.</li>

            <li> Very sharp and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to handle,are not too large nor too small, and cut the hair with ease.</li>
            <li> Several others have mentioned that the finger holes are small, and it&#x27;s true they aren&#x27;t huge, so</li>
            <li> The scissors are very easy to handle for my small hands and cut through my thick hair very cleanly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the high quality, brushed stainless steel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really very sharp and light to use.</li>
            <li> The product was as described, they were very sharp and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Right out of the package, they&#x27;re not sharp enough to cut hair well.</li>
            <li> Also I noticed that they do a far better job with dry hair than wet hair, so please consider this also.</li>
            <li> I do have small hands, and I think they wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable to hold if you have particularly fat fingers.</li>
            <li> Using regular scissors will really damage your hair.    </li>
            <li> This makes the scissors unusable for 85% of adult users.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> you have adult sized hands and want to cut adult hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and trim my hair as needed with these shears.  </li>
            <li> I bought these as I had a pair of ice scissors that were getting old and started sticking.  </li>
            <li> I have owned expensive stainless steel hair scissors, and I knew better than to expect the same quality as the higher priced ones.  </li>
            <li> I have read that other people have had success with haircuts using these scissors as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> For less expensive scissors it is a very good idea to get a pair that have the micro-teeth.</li>
            <li> These shears are very sharp, easy to use, and just right for my small hands.</li>
            <li> We are not professional hair stylists, but we cut the whole family&#x27;s hair at home.  </li>
            <li> and they fit my small fingers well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, cuts very cleanly/sharply, small enough to fit my fingers (meant for female and/or small hands, my husband tried it and got stuck), has enough weight - not too light, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> The price was right for an initial investment, especially since she has now decided on another career path and uses them for personal purposes now.</li>
            <li> It was a bit pricier than the others, but this one actually works at cutting fine, loose, wispy kind of hair.</li>
            <li> Some Styling Shears can get really expensive, but if you need good basic shears, then these will do.</li>
            <li> These are not sharp at all.</li>
            <li> Not sharp at all.</li>
            <li> She used them in her Cosmetology classes; they worked well being of a comfortable weight and providing a precision sharpness for clean cutting.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp, light, and the blades move well against each other with no gaps or catches.</li>
            <li> If you are not careful, you might cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a different purchase I ordered, but then I was surprised to find out</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s kind of expensive</li>
            <li> If you have very small hands, would probably work just fine.</li>
            <li> While they cost a lot less than professional shears, and they don&#x27;t cut quite as keenly as $200 scissors, they work really well for at-home trims.  </li>
            <li> They close really evenly and don&#x27;t miss any hairs, yet aren&#x27;t so sharp that I&#x27;m worried about accidentally knicking a child&#x27;s ear or gouging their eye.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy, sharp, and stainless.</li>
            <li> product is not sharp enough for my purposes</li>
            <li> Tried several styling shears during the years ; this one is not sharp at all compared to others.... should not have ordered.</li>
            <li> These scissors cut cleanly and are very sharp, they don&#x27;t pull the hairs while cutting and are very light in the hand.</li>
            <li> I was using the same shears that I cut paper and other household things with, and that doesn&#x27;t give the sharp, clean, uniform cuts that these shears give.  </li>
            <li> Great for cutting hair!</li>
            <li> These are sharp &#x3D; fast and quiet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some Tweezerman tweezers for the past 3-4 years and they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> so I needed something sharp but easy to use (small).  </li>
            <li> Sharp, holds hair well, easy for my small hands to use.</li>
            <li> These shears are not only sharp and ergonomicly designed, but have a very nice cutting feel when trimming hair, especially beards and moustaches.</li>
            <li> cut well, but a little heavy, which is fine b/c</li>
            <li> They do an amazing job cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, you would feel like professional haircutter when you use it.</li>
            <li> I used these to texturize my bangs and they are not as sharp as my old $5 hardware store scissors were.</li>
            <li> I think they will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> They feel like they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> They are a little shorter than what I expected, but I find that I am really liking this shorter length.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and these worked very well to do both detail trimming and shortening up the back by a couple of inches.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scissor for cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Been cutting hair for many years</li>
            <li> I am not a professional and these worked well after watching a video on UTUBE</li>
            <li> They are a bit smaller than I expected so that also accounts for some of the problems I had when using them.</li>
            <li> I use them daily and they usually grab the most difficult hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a few years now.</li>
            <li> because of these shears ive been forced to cut my hair my often than is normally demanded.</li>
            <li> Previous types of scissors caused split ends, but these actually prevent them.</li>
            <li> They keep a sharp edge for a long time.</li>
            <li> The other scissors I&#x27;ve used in the past feel so flimsy and don&#x27;t cut near as well</li>
            <li> Sometimes they dig into my fingers a little, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> Off of Amazon it comes in a soft plastic packaging, in stores it comes in a hard plastic case that you wouldn&#x27;t mind leaving it in.</li>
            <li> this is only complaint but not enough to return them.</li>
            <li> These are not at all what I expected from the reviews.</li>
            <li> Please be careful when using this scissors.</li>
            <li> so if you are to, just be careful.</li>
            <li> I needed sharp scissors for cutting my bangs and little trims and these are fantastic for the price!</li>
            <li> This particular model should not be sold as shears but something for small uses and small users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still sharp, as expected.</li>
            <li> These shears work really well and are far less expensive than going to a barber every few weeks.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how well they&#x27;d work for larger hands.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t catch at all when you snip, unlike the other pair which were finished in Pakistan.  </li>
            <li> The finger/thumb holes are small and may be unusable for some people with larger hands.  </li>
            <li> I immediately put them to use, and I noticed that they were not too sharp</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use at home; I cut my husbands and children&#x27;s hair and my other scissors were falling apart.</li>
            <li> sooooo sharp.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, well made, the blades come together</li>
            <li> Stays sharp for the quality.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot because of how sharp it is</li>
            <li> No really, stop paying other people to cut your hair!</li>
            <li> It makes home hair cutting, especially for a squirming toddler, much easier.</li>
            <li> We really can&#x27;t afford the 100 dollars shears at the expensive stores</li>
            <li> I have quite long hair and usually cut it by myself.</li>
            <li> They are not as long as my previous pair, but work just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find them very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.  </li>
            <li> This is very sharp.  </li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp, and do not damage the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I got these years ago and they are still very sharp.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the finger holes are very small</li>
            <li> These are really very sharp scissors.  </li>
            <li> Only down size is that it is made for small hands, but I have small fingers</li>
            <li> On the shorter axis, the inner diameter is approximately 3/4 inch, or roughly 2 cm.</li>
            <li> Our previous pair was a cheaper set</li>
            <li> I did find that these shears are not that sharp and that they don&#x27;t really work well when cutting long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> opening/closing is a bit tight, but I assume that will fix itself as I use it more.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> I envisioned them a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> I think it was also a little pricey for what you get.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little bit elliptical.</li>
            <li> They are little heavier than I imagined, but doesn&#x27;t effect the outcome of the cut whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I bought this pair because my long-haired cat has been developing mats and these scissors sliced through them with little effort.  </li>
            <li> Just a little longer</li>
            <li> The holes for thumb and finger are entirely too small (unless you have very small fingers or are a child)  </li>
            <li> Just a little to get use to,because of the weight,not to heavy</li>
            <li> I will put another review of this as soon as it becomes dull, I am only cutting dog hair so it shouldn&#x27;t go dull so fast.</li>
            <li> They dulled after a few years, and lots of times bent the hair rather than cut it.</li>
            <li> After a few time uses of this gear, I like it.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp!</li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> I must say though, that the scissors are a little small.</li>
            <li> They are small and heavy.</li>
            <li> I had previously used the scissors/shears that came with a Wahl clipper set to cut my hair, but I found that I had to &amp;#34;chop&amp;#34; through to get them to cut my thick hair.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s too bad we are stuck paying 4 times as much for lower quality products.</li>
            <li> I feel like I got not much better than I paid for.  </li>
            <li> It may also be that I am an amateur and do not have the had muscles that a stylist has.</li>
            <li> have small hands, but even I find the holes and the length of the grip a bit short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have small fingers</li>
            <li> I usually cut my kids hair every 2 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticied that some people have been complaining about the finger holes being too small.</li>
            <li> With my old scissors, which were longer, I would sometimes snip my hand when I was cutting my hair, but with these, not once did I snip my hand.</li>
            <li> They are a small step up from the scissors that are often part of electric razor sets.</li>
            <li> I have been trimming my bangs for the past couple of months and have had no problems with these.</li>
            <li> My hand is really small and the size fits me well.</li>
            <li> No one likes to try to trim your hair and find that your scissors are dull.</li>
            <li> They arrived soon after ordering them, in a hard plastic package.</li>
            <li> My cat hardly noticed.</li>
            <li> Dull.</li>
            <li> He hardly knew it was happening as we laid on the couch.</li>
            <li> The length of the cutting surface is at least 2 inches too short for proper hair cutting.  </li>
            <li> My wife cuts hair with them at least once a week.</li>
            <li> But at least they did work, I can give them that.</li>
            <li> i bought it to use on bangs, not for cutting the entire head of hair</li>
            <li> They are a bit heavy in the hand, and I can see my hands getting tired after using them for awhile.</li>
            <li> I learned that this was a serious no-no the hard way.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for casual cutting.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is very long and thick and I struggled cutting her hair with these scissors.</li>
            <li> For minor hair cutting, it is a must at home.</li>
            <li> Not super uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The logo and the word on the shear are totally mess!!!</li>
            <li> I like cutting hair when it is wet,and I did not get the expected results with the shears I just received.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting 3 heads for months with this shears and have absolutely no problem with it...fully endorse!</li>
            <li> Sucker!</li>
            <li> Comparing to a dinosaur scissor I had before, this Tweezerman one reduces the cutting time almost half, and does not strain my hand.</li>
            <li> For those who care, I have very thick and  curly African-American hair</li>
            <li> poor poor quality.</li>
            <li> I find them awkward to use because they are hard to grip and the angles are awkward.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed when I could not insert my thumb into the thumb grip..too small a hole.  </li>
            <li> I felt a little bit weird, then I saw the shear, it is definitely fake!!!</li>
            <li> I have no hair cutting training or skill, but these scissors work well for my purpose.</li>
            <li> I like cutting my kids hair</li>
            <li> ive been cutting my hair for 4 yrs now and out of those four years</li>
            <li> Afraid to cut hair with them........</li>
            <li> These were purchased together with a panasonic hair trimmer as a means for finer hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I had already opened and used and realized how bad they are.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the construction and the way they cut hair.</li>
            <li> It feels like i&#x27;m cutting my hair with a knife!  </li>
            <li> Fake!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these scissors for haircuts. I thought I&#x27;d give them a try since I love the Tweezerman slanted tweezers.  The other scissors I&#x27;ve used in the past feel so flimsy and don&#x27;t cut near as well im comparison.  I have fairly medium sized hands for a girl but I&#x27;m not sure how well they&#x27;d work for larger hands.  Overall, great buy and worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find them very sharp. They do the job, but cut like normal scissors.</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice little pair of trimming scissors and I didn&#x27;t want to pay a fortune for them.  I am completely thrilled with these scissors!  I wasn&#x27;t expecting the high quality, brushed stainless steel. They are very sharp and cut hair beautifully.  They have a nice weight in your hand and are perfectly tight.  They are a little shorter than what I expected, but I find that I am really liking this shorter length. (See my picture with the ruler).  I would highly recommend these to everyone.  At this price, I&#x27;m going to buy an extra pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the seller was great and they arrived very quickly with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I am not a hair stylist; I bought these to cut my own hair at home. I had previously used the scissors/shears that came with a Wahl clipper set to cut my hair, but I found that I had to &amp;#34;chop&amp;#34; through to get them to cut my thick hair. The pair of Tweezerman shears I bought are great; they cut through my thick hair easily and cleanly. Nice results.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the Tweezerman Stainless 2000 Styling Shears to cut my own hair and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the quality of the product... and free sharpening for life? Heck yes! The scissors are very easy to handle for my small hands and cut through my thick hair very cleanly. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I bought this pair of shears to trim split ends. They are very sharp, easy to handle and compact. Good value.</li>
            <li> These shears are NOT made for S&amp;D. They are very basic shears. I have tried snipping away my split ends only to have the hair strand split even more.</li>
            <li> Sharp...very nice weight...    Only down size is that it is made for small hands, but I have small fingers so it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> They were great.  Very sharp.  Good size. I think they will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp! I cut my own hair. At this point it&#x27;s been two months since I last trimmed, and the ends of my hair are all still blunt. I don&#x27;t need another trim and that never happens. The price is perfect and they arrived in two days.</li>
            <li> I cut my husband, son and daughter&#x27;s hair.  Because of the great reviews I thought I would give these a try for such a great price.  I feel like I got not much better than I paid for.  They do not cut as smooth as I would like.  They feel light and mid-level quality at best.  I am going to pay up for some nicer ones soon.  They do the job, but I would like something better.  These are not 5* shears.</li>
            <li> I bought these to trim my hair inbetween salon cuts. These scissors are sharp, and they cut very well so far, and were a good price. I have no hair cutting training or skill, but these scissors work well for my purpose. They have a lifetime sharpening warranty, and they are comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scissor for cutting hair. Yes it&#x27;s kind of expensive but this is made with quality. It&#x27;s worth every penny. I am happy with this purchase and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for quality scissors.</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to trim my two dogs. I have a mini poodle and a Yorkshire Terrier and these scissors work great. They are easy to handle,are not too large nor too small, and cut the hair with ease. I&#x27;m very please with them and would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> They work great! Much better than my orange paper scissors. I trim my own hair until it the back gets too unruly, than I give into my hair stylist.      I have large hands but slender fingers and it fits my right hand perfectly.  Also note that Tweezerman will sharpen your Shears for free, although I have a feeling I&#x27;ll never need them sharpened.    Off of Amazon it comes in a soft plastic packaging, in stores it comes in a hard plastic case that you wouldn&#x27;t mind leaving it in. Currently don&#x27;t have a good case for it...but looking.    Highly recommend it for casual cutting.</li>
            <li> Used these to cut my own hair with the creaclip...worked great!</li>
            <li> I bought two pairs of 5.5 inch shears for about the same price and these were far superior!  Very smooth, nice feel in your hand.  They don&#x27;t catch at all when you snip, unlike the other pair which were finished in Pakistan.  These ones are great, especially for the price!  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> average man size hands, shears small but fit nicely. balance fine, cut sharp. ends are rounded, not pointed. this is only complaint but not enough to return them. overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I use these shears to trim my bangs and to cut my split ends off. They work perfectly, and you really can&#x27;t beat free sharpening for life.    If you want to cut your own hair, do yourself a favor and get a decent pair of shears like these. Using regular scissors will really damage your hair.    All in all, this is a great pair of shears for a good price. They may not be as good as what your hairdresser uses, but they are good enough to cut hair cleanly without causing any damage.</li>
            <li> These shears are not only sharp and ergonomicly designed, but have a very nice cutting feel when trimming hair, especially beards and moustaches.</li>
            <li> so if you like split ends this is the right pair of scissors for you! i bought these to trim my split ends and what i ended up with is just more split ends. Honestly, if you&#x27;re using these just to cut your kids hair or are a man then you&#x27;ll be okay, but if you want to grow your hair out I DO NOT recommend these.... you might want to shop around for something a little better. and No this will not help you get by until your next cut because like i said these scissors only create MORE split ends!</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the scissors that came with the Wahl hair trimmer/cutter.  They are very sharp and work great!  The finger/thumb holes are small and may be unusable for some people with larger hands.  Luckily my wife cuts my hair and her fingers fit just fine.  Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> I love these scissors.  Sometimes they dig into my fingers a little, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  Because of this and hair sheers, I&#x27;ve been cutting and styling my own hair now for almost a year.</li>
            <li> These are excellent styling shears.  They&#x27;re fantastic for keeping around for hair trimming.  I don&#x27;t do too much hair trimming but it&#x27;s excellent for the occasional trims.  No one likes to try to trim your hair and find that your scissors are dull.</li>
            <li> Super durable! Great cut.</li>
            <li> The scissors themselves cut very well and are priced well. My issues with the product are:&lt;br /&gt;1) The holes for thumb and finger are entirely too small (unless you have very small fingers or are a child)  This makes the scissors unusable for 85% of adult users.&lt;br /&gt;2) The length of the cutting surface is at least 2 inches too short for proper hair cutting.  This particular model should not be sold as shears but something for small uses and small users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have adult sized hands and want to cut adult hair you should try something else.</li>
            <li> This is very sharp.  If you are not careful, you might cut yourself.  On the other hand, you would feel like professional haircutter when you use it.</li>
            <li> You can buy a sharper, more comfortable pair of shears at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for around $20. That is my recommendation. These are not sharp at all.</li>
            <li> For the man who has pretty much everything I puchased the Tweezerman 2000 styling shears for Christmas.  He loves them.  Easy to hold and very sharp.</li>
            <li> I recently got blunt bangs and wanted to purchase some haircutting scissors to keep them trimmed between salon visits. I&#x27;ve used normal scissors before and they frayed my bangs, so I researched haircutting scissors to prevent this. These scissors were a great investment and were reasonably-priced, especially for the great quality I got. I love Tweezerman tweezers, and the haircutting scissors are great, if not better! Very impressed!</li>
            <li> These shears were sturdy, good quality shears, and they did a great job on my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It took a month to receive these scizzors.  Why a month?...not sure.  I was quite disappointed when I could not insert my thumb into the thumb grip..too small a hole.  I do not have huge hands, so did not expect this.  Returning them, and going to a store to actually try models on for size.  Other than that, they seem like nice scizzors.  If you have very small hands, would probably work just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to cut my 22 months old fast growing hair.  I soon realized that in order to keep his hair in a shaggy hair-do I would either have to make lots of trips to the salon or learn to do it myself.  The trips to the salon were a bit too pricey so I purchased these and just completed our first home cut.  The scissors have a good feel/weight to them.  They are the perfect size and easy to maneuver.  They are very sharp so they make nice clean and quick cuts.  We&#x27;re going to get a lot of use out of this item!!!</li>
            <li> The product is as good if not better than advertised. It&#x27;s really very sharp and light to use. For minor hair cutting, it is a must at home. No need to visit beauty or barber shop as often as before. Saves time and money.</li>
            <li> We are not professional hair stylists, but we cut the whole family&#x27;s hair at home.  These scissors worked great on my son&#x27;s sideburns and the back parts that we can&#x27;t get with the clippers.  I have naturally curly hair and trim my hair as needed with these shears.  (Doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s even, it&#x27;s curly!) They are nice and sharp and accurate.  They are not as long as my previous pair, but work just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have chosen a better pair of scissors...very sharp and very comfortable in my small hand!</li>
            <li> Great quality just like the Tweezerman tweezers.  I gave the two I ordered as gifts.  I think these will provide many years of excellent service.</li>
            <li> Great shears! I have thick curly hair and these worked very well to do both detail trimming and shortening up the back by a couple of inches.</li>
            <li> I envisioned them a little bit longer. Althought they cut ok, I should of gone with a slightly longer and lighter one.   I think it was also a little pricey for what you get.</li>
            <li> Bought these to touch up bangs at home. They are good quality as are most tweezerman brand. They are a bit heavy in the hand, and I can see my hands getting tired after using them for awhile. It may also be that I am an amateur and do not have the had muscles that a stylist has. These shears are sharp, and come in a handy storage container.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much because of the price, but I needed a new scissors to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair.  This pair worked perfectly--struggling with the cut or feeling as if the scissors would break.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> No really, stop paying other people to cut your hair! Learn how to yourself or ask a friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I convinced my girlfriend to cut my hair so that I could save 20 bucks, and now I&#x27;ll never go back.&lt;br /&gt;She did a great job, but said she needed better scissors.&lt;br /&gt;We ordered this pair, and we don&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Super slick.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t ever pay anyone to cut my hair again!</li>
            <li> the size of the product was great for my petite hands. delivery time was good. the look is sleek and stylish. I cut my daughters hair and makes me want to do more stylish do&#x27;s on her.</li>
            <li> Good for trimming bangs and split ends. I would not use them to cut hair, however they are good for trims.</li>
            <li> These are excellent - just holding them and the first snip shows you how very well made and perfectly balanced they are - go for it!</li>
            <li> These styling shears are great. They&#x27;re well weighted, and the finger contours keep them both stable in your hand and easy to control. Several others have mentioned that the finger holes are small, and it&#x27;s true they aren&#x27;t huge, so I thought I&#x27;d measure them. They&#x27;re a little bit elliptical. On the shorter axis, the inner diameter is approximately 3/4 inch, or roughly 2 cm. The longer axis is about 2 mm wider. Hope these measurements help in your making a selection!</li>
            <li> I purchased about 3 different styling scissors before trying this one. It was a bit pricier than the others, but this one actually works at cutting fine, loose, wispy kind of hair. You know, the kind that moves around when you cut it unless you hold it in place with the pincer-like grip of a titan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;These scissors are very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;The opening/closing is a bit tight, but I assume that will fix itself as I use it more.&lt;br /&gt;Made of stainless steel so that it won&#x27;t rust up or warp after 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to require much upkeep except for a quick rinse and wipe dry after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I have small hands, but even I find the holes and the length of the grip a bit short.&lt;br /&gt;The length of the blade is a bit short too. I guess the length in the description is overall and not the length of the blades.</li>
            <li> I ordered these so I can cut my own hair, which I&#x27;ve been doing for a couple years now. I&#x27;ve had plenty of scissors and they varied in quality. These are by far the best ones, and cut the best. They are little heavier than I imagined, but doesn&#x27;t effect the outcome of the cut whatsoever. Perfect, and worth the money. The product also somehow got to me in the next day of ordering it. I thought it was a different purchase I ordered, but then I was surprised to find out it was this. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Very nice haircutting shears that give a precision cut!</li>
            <li> Love that this product comes with a warranty. Great quality shears for cutting/trimming hair! I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I needed sharp scissors for cutting my bangs and little trims and these are fantastic for the price! I have small fingers so I can&#x27;t comment on how they would fit larger hands but for me they are perfect</li>
            <li> I like cutting my kids hair and I bought the shears to do a better job. I usually cut my kids hair every 2 months. Since I did not want to spend a lot of money on the new shears, I decided to go with Tweezerman Stainless 2000. They arrived soon after ordering them, in a hard plastic package. I immediately put them to use, and I noticed that they were not too sharp and they were doing a good job. Overall, they are smaller than I thought, and my hands are not too big, so please consider this when buying them for someone who has big hands. Also I noticed that they do a far better job with dry hair than wet hair, so please consider this also. I like cutting hair when it is wet,and I did not get the expected results with the shears I just received. In general, they are a lot better that what I have, but my expectations were higher. If you do not want to spend $200, then order Tweezerman 2000.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I received it in a reasonable time frame. Although the size of the item is listed in the description it was a lot smaller than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Early this year, I decided that I was going to start doing my own hair instead of paying 100$ every couple of weeks to have someone else do it for me. I was doing a really good job, or so I thought, until my sister pointed out that.. Well, basically, I was using ordinary kitchen scissors to get rid of my split ends. I learned that this was a serious no-no the hard way. So, I purchased these scissors and I am extremely happy with my results. They give me a clean cut every time. They&#x27;re stainless steel, so I expect them to last me forever and so far, I&#x27;m really happy. I&#x27;ve noticied that some people have been complaining about the finger holes being too small. My hands fit in them without a problem (I&#x27;m a ring size 7 if that helps at all). Originally, I thought they were a little pricey, but I&#x27;m glad I made this investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Oh! It arrived SUPER quickly too.</li>
            <li> These scissors are a very good quality, sharp and comfortable in your hand.  They are a great buy for the money!</li>
            <li> The product was as described, they were very sharp and comfortable to use. we now have many satisfied family members with nice hair cuts.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair and that these scissors are the best she&#x27;s ever used. Been cutting hair for many years</li>
            <li> Great scissors.  If I&#x27;m going to be hacking at my own hair, I might as well have a good pair of shears and these do the trick.</li>
            <li> While they cost a lot less than professional shears, and they don&#x27;t cut quite as keenly as $200 scissors, they work really well for at-home trims.  They close really evenly and don&#x27;t miss any hairs, yet aren&#x27;t so sharp that I&#x27;m worried about accidentally knicking a child&#x27;s ear or gouging their eye.  Nor have I ever accidentally cut my fingers while manipulating hair.  I do have small hands, and I think they wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable to hold if you have particularly fat fingers.</li>
            <li> I only needed a pair of scissors to trim my bangs. These work well for that. I like the size and they fit my small fingers well.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair 2 times a month. We really can&#x27;t afford the 100 dollars shears at the expensive stores so I bought these because of the reviews. They are really worth every penny. The scissors are sharp, light, and the blades move well against each other with no gaps or catches. My wife has been happy with them every since we got them and I think they deserve 5 stars for that and the fact that you get lifetime sharpening! So if you have to cut hair more than once a month, they are a great buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use at home; I cut my husbands and children&#x27;s hair and my other scissors were falling apart. I have cut all three heads of hair with these scissors and a friend&#x27;s - hair ranging from very fine to very course and they worked perfect every time. They have a great feel and cut the hair easily and cleanly. These are exactly what  I wanted.</li>
            <li> love these had a pair for years and wanted another... obviously they last and work for me... happy happy : )</li>
            <li> These shears are wonderful!!!! At first, I thought they would be to small for my hands, but they are perfect!!!!! They&lt;br /&gt;are very sharp and easy to use. With my old scissors, which were longer, I would sometimes snip my hand when I was cutting my hair, but with these, not once did I snip my hand. I would highly recommend these shears!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a Very Happy Customer&lt;br /&gt;Karen DeeDee Lee (NC)</li>
            <li> Good quality and very sharp!  My wife cuts hair with them at least once a week.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp, and do not damage the ends of my hair. Previous types of scissors caused split ends, but these actually prevent them. Great scissors!</li>
            <li> Use them to cut all three of the men in my life&#x27;s hair. Nice shears</li>
            <li> I bought these solely for the occasional trim on myself and my family and these scissors work just fine! I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much easier it is to cut my hair with these shears.  I was using the same shears that I cut paper and other household things with, and that doesn&#x27;t give the sharp, clean, uniform cuts that these shears give.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with these quality shears from Tweeserman  they make a great product.  I can always depend on this company</li>
            <li> Right out of the package, they&#x27;re not sharp enough to cut hair well. I&#x27;ve had several pair of cheaper scissors that were better than this even after years of use.</li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair (and my own) and the last pair of scissors I bought cost about $35 at Sally Beauty Supply. They dulled after a few years, and lots of times bent the hair rather than cut it. Since I am an amateur, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot for a really good pair of scissors, but wanted something decent. After reading others&#x27; reviews, I decided to take a chance on these. They feel good in the hand, well balanced, and cut reasonably well...as much as I could expect from the price. I wish the tips cut a little better for necklines and around the ears. They are adequate for how I use them.</li>
            <li> I bought these as I had a pair of ice scissors that were getting old and started sticking.  I trim my own bangs and front sides so I needed something sharp but easy to use (small).  I am very impressed with the quality and sharpness of the shears!  Great buy!  One aside, probably not so great for anyone that has large size fingers but they work great for hands that say have a woman&#x27;s size 7 ring finger.</li>
            <li> Are ok, was hoping they were sharper</li>
            <li> Sharp, comfortable, good size... they&#x27;re quite suitable for my hair! I cut my hair about 6 weeks ago with them and I&#x27;m still not seeing any split ends. I do moderate damage and heat on my hair. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> These worked perfectly. Some of the reviews had me scared that they wouldn&#x27;t be good enough, but it was all I could afford. Bottom line is, it gets the job done and cuts easily. I used these with the CreaClip to cut my own hair and it went really well :) All those nerves were for naught!</li>
            <li> product is not sharp enough for my purposes</li>
            <li> poor poor quality. I had already opened and used and realized how bad they are. Do not even resemble the photo......Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I love the results I&#x27;ve gotten with these shears. Sharp, holds hair well, easy for my small hands to use. Great value - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought these shears a month ago and they broke after three weeks. You can spend on your money on some better shears out there.</li>
            <li> quality product with fast shipment to cut my hair.. I am not a professional and these worked well after watching a video on UTUBE</li>
            <li> I have quite long hair and usually cut it by myself.This scissors may not be professional ones (you don&#x27;t get them for that price), but they are really ok and sharp!</li>
            <li> i gave these shears a try and used them on 4 occasions and each time i used them the ends of my hair began splitting right from where i had cut. because of these shears ive been forced to cut my hair my often than is normally demanded. ive been cutting my hair for 4 yrs now and out of those four years the only time that i have had split ends are with these scissors (i do not get split ends because i keep a short bob cut so my hair is normally easy to maintain). i don&#x27;t know if it was just my pair but i certainly wont be using these anymore.</li>
            <li> Like all the Tweezerman products I have tried this pair of scissors is beautifully made , and Amazon delivered it in perfect condition a day earlier than they promised.  I bought this pair because my long-haired cat has been developing mats and these scissors sliced through them with little effort.  My cat hardly noticed.</li>
            <li> We ordered these scissors because my wife occasionally likes to trim her and our sons hair, in between haircuts. Our previous pair was a cheaper set and she wanted me to buy better scissors.  The verdict: She says these scissors are really high-quality, and just the right sharpness and open/close action.  The only thing that surprised me upon opning the package was that I expected them to be marginally longer (like the ones you see in barber shops.</li>
            <li> I got these years ago and they are still very sharp. I trim my bangs regularly with these and they do a great job.</li>
            <li> I used this to cut some layers into my curly hair and they worked just great!  Strong, sharp and did exactly what I needed them to do.</li>
            <li> Do it right the first time, works with any hair texture and does a darn good job at it too. We love these and I&#x27;m glad we bucked up and purchased professional quality sheersâ€¦stop buying rinky dink cheap scissors, these are perfect!</li>
            <li> I use my friend&#x27;s account to buy this shear, but when I got this today, there is no recept in the box. I felt a little bit weird, then I saw the shear, it is definitely fake!!! It is different from the picture on both amazon website and Tweezerman official website!!!!!!!!!!!!! The logo and the word on the shear are totally mess!!! I cannot even return it!!! Fake!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sharp at all. Dull.</li>
            <li> What an incredible product for an outstanding price!  They did a wonderful job on my very fine, long hair. I&#x27;d recommend them to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the cheap scissors that came with my Wahl haircutting kit.  The Wahl scissors weren&#x27;t able to cut through my hair when wet, so I&#x27;m happy to say that these can with ease.  The motion of these scissors as you cut feels like you&#x27;re using high quality scissors.  Definitely worth the money.  If you need thinning shears, I would also check out Tweezerman&#x27;s.  They&#x27;re both great!</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to cut my 22 months old fast growing hair. I soon realized that in order to keep his hair in a shaggy hair-do I would either have to make lots of trips to the salon or learn to do it myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some Tweezerman tweezers for the past 3-4 years and they are well worth it. I use them daily and they usually grab the most difficult hairs. I purchased the scissors because of my experience with their tweezers and the reviews that I read. For those who care, I have very thick and  curly African-American hair and I bought these scissors to trim my ends but not for an all out haircut. So far they have clipped my ends evenly and they don&#x27;t appear to be of cheap quality. I have read that other people have had success with haircuts using these scissors as well. So far the Tweezerman brand is looking good and I would say that if you can&#x27;t afford to have a professional cut your hair these scissors should be able to give you a presentable look.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and was in need of new scissors. I talked to a stylist friend of mine and showed her these and she said they would be perfect. She was right! They&#x27;re sharp and cut very very smoothly. The only downside is that the finger holes are very small so sometimes it hurts my thumb. Other than that, they&#x27;re awesome!</li>
            <li> Es una tijera cÃ³moda, fila, lo malo que solo se pueden hacer cortes con la punta de la tijera porque por la mitad de la tijera no tiene firmesa.</li>
            <li> Afraid to cut hair with them........sooooo sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp! Great for cutting hair!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  They are sharp, well made, the blades come together perfectly the entire length of the blades.  They do an amazing job cutting hair.  I will agree with previous reviews that the thumb hole is small and if they were for me I&#x27;d deduct a star, but they work perfect for my wife.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my granddaughter for her to cut hers and her fiancee&#x27;s hair. She loves them! Best ones ever and has never had to sharpen them..I don&#x27;t believe you ever have to sharpen them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my hair twice, and my child&#x27;s hair three times. They are awesome. I am so happy to have a pair of scissors that cut well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp and definitely worth the price. Just wish I bought a longer one. Half an inch longer will be perfect.</li>
            <li> Very nice product and easy for wife to cut kids&#x27; hair.  Very sharp and easy to handle.  For my medium size hands it works well too.</li>
            <li> I wanted something better than the standard around the house scissor but at a reasonable price. These were it. It makes home hair cutting, especially for a squirming toddler, much easier. Their only caveat it they do not have a fine point at the end.</li>
            <li> great quality and price</li>
            <li> Just a little longer and they would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Just a little to get use to,because of the weight,not to heavy and they do cut your hair very nicely.I would recommend them to a friend.They keep a sharp edge for a long time.I like them.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting much more because of the great reviews these scissors received in the past. I was disappointed by the construction and the way they cut hair. I have since purchased some scissors for $50 and am much more pleased. For less expensive scissors it is a very good idea to get a pair that have the micro-teeth. Also, the holes on these scissors are best for larger fingers. Most women&#x27;s fingers will not be large enough to provide optimal control. They are a small step up from the scissors that are often part of electric razor sets.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, sharp, and stainless. I am pretty sure that is all you need in clippers. I like the their other products too and wil probably buy more of their tweezerman grooming stuffs</li>
            <li> These were purchased together with a panasonic hair trimmer as a means for finer hair cutting. These scissors cut cleanly and are very sharp, they don&#x27;t pull the hairs while cutting and are very light in the hand. Best of all the company who makes them offers free sharping for the life of the scissors...buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> These are really very sharp scissors.  I have always cut my own hair and probably have been using scissors not meant for hair at all.  So the sharpness of these were a surprise to me.  They are very precise.  It feels like i&#x27;m cutting my hair with a knife!  Perfect hair cutting scissors.</li>
            <li> It was a good item, and a good decision to buy. I recommend this for people who are on a budget.</li>
            <li> These shears are very sharp, easy to use, and just right for my small hands. I have been trimming my bangs for the past couple of months and have had no problems with these.</li>
            <li> These are not at all what I expected from the reviews. They are small and heavy. I find them awkward to use because they are hard to grip and the angles are awkward. They make more noise than a good pair of scissors would. If they were even half inch longer these would have been better. I used these to texturize my bangs and they are not as sharp as my old $5 hardware store scissors were. They sort of snag on the hairs. So it&#x27;s too bad we are stuck paying 4 times as much for lower quality products. But at least they did work, I can give them that.</li>
            <li> I lost one of this, so that is why I asked for a third pair, they stay clean,sharp and are of very good quality.</li>
            <li> The scissors seem to work well, do not make my hair ends split as they cut them.</li>
            <li> Nothing super awesome with these. Just bought them so that I could do my own self-trims on my curly hair. Not the sharpest pair of scissors I&#x27;ve used, but definitely not dull by any means. I have huge hands (but not sausage fingers) and the fit was okay. Not super uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These are a perfect length for medium to short hair, in my opinion.  I use it for trimming my pup&#x27;s hair since he moves so much (sound and pulling of old scissors freaked him out).  These are sharp &#x3D; fast and quiet. He hardly knew it was happening as we laid on the couch. Sucker!</li>
            <li> These scissors are good, very sturdy and seem to be well made. They feel like they&#x27;ll last a long time. I did find that these shears are not that sharp and that they don&#x27;t really work well when cutting long or thick hair. I&#x27;ve used these scissors to cut both my son and daughters hair and had an easier time using it on my son who has much shorter hair. My daughters hair is very long and thick and I struggled cutting her hair with these scissors. They are a bit smaller than I expected so that also accounts for some of the problems I had when using them. The Tweezerman Stainless 2000 was easier to use when trimming my sons hair, so I think these shears work much better for trims and bangs, but not for layering or major cuts.</li>
            <li> I used to pay literally hundreds of dollars a year for hair cuts, highlights and lowlights. After buying these shears, and watching Youtube video tutorials (search &amp;#34;dhukai&amp;#34; shes amazing), I have learned to cut my hair BEAUTIFULLY, better than my hairstylist! Don&#x27;t believe that you NEED to see a hair stylist to have healthy beautiful hair. Trims are essential for growth!! Start watching youtube and buy these scissors NOW.</li>
            <li> Great scissors to cut my daughter&#x27;s fine hair. Purchased this at Amazon because of the reviews and at a great price. Easy to use, cuts very cleanly/sharply, small enough to fit my fingers (meant for female and/or small hands, my husband tried it and got stuck), has enough weight - not too light, not too heavy. Very pleased with the product. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> cut well, but a little heavy, which is fine b/c i bought it to use on bangs, not for cutting the entire head of hair</li>
            <li> I use these in between cuts. They are a nice weight, and have helped me keep my pixie nice and neat.</li>
            <li> I bought these in addition to the Tweezerman Stainless 2000 Thinning Shears as a gift for the budding hairstylist in our family.  She used them in her Cosmetology classes; they worked well being of a comfortable weight and providing a precision sharpness for clean cutting.  The price was right for an initial investment, especially since she has now decided on another career path and uses them for personal purposes now.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have around for home hair cuts and trim ups. Stays sharp for the quality.</li>
            <li> After a few time uses of this gear, I like it. Comparing to a dinosaur scissor I had before, this Tweezerman one reduces the cutting time almost half, and does not strain my hand. So I go ahead putting an order of it&#x27;s pairing thinning shears.</li>
            <li> A perfect tool for professional grade hair cutting without the cost of one.  Very happy with my purchase, and my clients are happy as well.</li>
            <li> I have short hair which I like to trim myself between hair cuts. I am 60+ years old and have been trimming my own hair for years. I have never had a pair of scissors that I liked better. I would definitely recommend Tweezerman styling shears to all.</li>
            <li> Tried several styling shears during the years ; this one is not sharp at all compared to others.... should not have ordered.</li>
            <li> Strong and durable shears. You can feel the quality when you touch it. A little small for my boyfriend&#x27;s fingers, but perfect for mine.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay . . . I have owned expensive stainless steel hair scissors, and I knew better than to expect the same quality as the higher priced ones.  But these almost appear to be pewter, and they&#x27;re not as lightweight as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> makes trimming my hair a breeze,</li>
            <li> I have been cutting 3 heads for months with this shears and have absolutely no problem with it...fully endorse!</li>
            <li> High quality, sharp, feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product. I must say though, that the scissors are a little small. It fits perfect on my wife&#x27;s hand, but i thought it would be nice to let you know. :)</li>
            <li> Please be careful when using this scissors. I used it straight out of the box and I inadvertently made a tiny cut on my finger, trying to groom my dog. Yes, I am prone to accidents so if you are to, just be careful. I like it a lot because of how sharp it is, I have had it for two weeks now and it&#x27;s still sharp, as expected. I will put another review of this as soon as it becomes dull, I am only cutting dog hair so it shouldn&#x27;t go dull so fast.</li>
            <li> They were perfectly packaged and sharp. I was trying to cut bettie page style bangs by myself, and I totally botched my bangs. LOL Oh well. The scissors worked perfectly but now I look silly. Hehe</li>
            <li> These are good quality scissors for the price. Some Styling Shears can get really expensive, but if you need good basic shears, then these will do.</li>
            <li> Works great for at home haircuts for kids and husband! Easy to use for a novice and just the right length.</li>
            <li> I use this shear to cut my hair on a monthly basis. Super sharp and easy to use. My hand is really small and the size fits me well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a few years now. These shears work really well and are far less expensive than going to a barber every few weeks.</li>
