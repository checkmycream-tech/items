            <li> I am surprised that doctors don&#x27;t recommend this to people with reoccurring boils.</li>
            <li> This stuff healed my boil in two days and now is completely flat and almost disappeared.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Rite Aid after reading about the active ingredient, Ichthammol, in other drawing out salves.</li>
            <li> Like other Ichthammol salves it is messy and smells and looks like tar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gooey and black, but as she said &amp;#34;It draws the soreness out.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wasted my money</li>
            <li> Has unbelievable healing properties and stops infections!</li>
            <li> It was just a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I got it for an ingrown toenail and between this stuff and the sally hansen pedicure 2 sided tool and some anbesol numb agent</li>
            <li> This thing would come and go for months on end and was painful and lasted for weeks until it would &amp;#34;heal.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Ive had 3 ingrown toenails and if youve ever had them they are the WORST</li>

            <li> Just what I asked for great service</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Rite Aid after reading about the active ingredient, Ichthammol, in other drawing out salves. I didn&#x27;t order off of Amazon cause I needed immediate relief. Golf ball size boil came to a head and started draining after 22 hours. Granted I was drinking apple cider vinegar and turmeric, but I think those are more preventative and this salve is what did it. I had another boil that was similar to this in size and location, and it had to be lanced by the doctor (pierced with a needle) and the effect was the same as this salve, meaning it was draining in the same way. Salve helped it create a hole. It also started developing a second head so it was very effective. Saved me a trip to the doctor. Like other Ichthammol salves it is messy and smells and looks like tar. Try not to get it on your hands and clothes. I am surprised that doctors don&#x27;t recommend this to people with reoccurring boils.</li>
            <li> This is Awesome stuff I got it for an ingrown toenail and between this stuff and the sally hansen pedicure 2 sided tool and some anbesol numb agent I was able to fix it myself..Ive had 3 ingrown toenails and if youve ever had them they are the WORST and this stuff really works good. I always have some on hand and if you even FEEL one coming on I put it on. It STAINS sheets and clothes so wrap it good. LOVE THIS</li>

            <li> My husband has been using this stuff for years!  This stuff works great on minor cuts!  Has unbelievable healing properties and stops infections!</li>
            <li> Did not work. Wasted my money</li>
            <li> My mom used this stuff on us as kids.  It takes out splinters, zits, you name it.  It&#x27;s gooey and black, but as she said &amp;#34;It draws the soreness out.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had glass in my foot. Within hours it felt better. Within 24 hours it was gone and well on its way to healed. A medicine cabinet must have!</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff, but it&#x27;s only $8.99 at rite aid and on riteaid.com.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t worked for me but then I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun .</li>
            <li> Ointment helped!  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great for anything from cuts to sores!</li>
            <li> I had a boil for TWO YEARS and nothing helped. Tried tea tree oil, antibacterials, and was even put on antibiotics for it. This thing would come and go for months on end and was painful and lasted for weeks until it would &amp;#34;heal.&amp;#34; Did some research and found this. This stuff healed my boil in two days and now is completely flat and almost disappeared. Can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> Pleased w/ product and delivery time was reasonably quick.</li>
            <li> Works well on all kinds of skin issues.</li>
