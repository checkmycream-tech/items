            <li>A great value for the price.</li>
            <li>Battery life is shorter than a fruit fly&#x27;s (measures in days I believe).  </li>

            <li>Works as advertised, No issues, good purchase.</li>

            <li>For now I&#x27;m satisfied with my two NiMH&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Once I discovered what works for me, it is easy to use and gives great results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously great product, and cheap.</li>

            <li>Nice product that works well.</li>
            <li>nice power from batteries.</li>
            <li>Handy bag for all attachments.</li>
            <li>nice stuff  </li>
            <li>I bought this for trimming my sideburns to keep them nice and even.</li>
            <li>I use rechargeable batteries and always have spares handy</li>
            <li>Works good, hubby pleased</li>
            <li>which is nice...</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer..</li>
            <li>This is the best trimmer that I have ever used and the price is more right.</li>
            <li>Seems to be an excellent product I had a Remington that only lasted about 6 months and didn&#x27;t work as good as the Conair.</li>
            <li>Trimmed the &#x27;stache very easily.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best of the lot.  </li>
            <li>There were lots of products that cost much more than this one, but given the astounding price of this Conair model</li>
            <li>a good cheap beard trimmer</li>
            <li>Been working great... seems to work as good as my old rechargeable one</li>
            <li>Great product, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It works great and does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li>Very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>Does a quick, good job of trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li>Good product for trimming your nose/ear hair, bread not so much!!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for trimming facial hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The Conair trimmer is more quite than the Wahl and doesn&#x27;t seem to pluck out as many hairs as the Wahl.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I give it 5 stars, 4 just for accommodating rechargeable batteries, yes my NiMH batteries fit!</li>
            <li>I also tried one NiMH and 1 lithium, the speed is faster than just two NiMH&#x27;s, but again, the faster it goes i&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>sure Conair does not recommend mixing battery types.</li>
            <li>Rusty scissors cut hair better than this shaver.</li>
            <li>(gotta love Amazon&#x27;s ease of return) and requested a replacement.  </li>
            <li>but you must make sure you have some quality batteries on hand as you will breeze through them depending, of course, on frequency of use.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love them.  </li>
            <li>well what more can I ask,</li>
            <li>and you will get lots of shaves or trims depending how you use..  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>It had adjustable blade depth and more accessories.</li>
            <li>love item</li>
            <li>The circular ones Work much better</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>many attachments</li>
            <li>use it more for body trimming but sometimes on the face</li>
            <li>Best investment ever, especially if you&#x27;re not too keen on grooming your mane.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more..</li>
            <li>many times it fell off during my trimming, and i proceeded to trim a bald patch into my goatee.</li>
            <li>I would love it even more if it was rechargeable or electric.</li>
            <li>Has a variety of attachments, most of which i lost over the years...  </li>
            <li>Works very well, I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Are there better trimmers on the market?</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>not as good as my first conair beard and mustache trimmer since it doesn&#x27;t trim my beard as well.  </li>
            <li>Then I popped some new batteries in in and it worked great.</li>
            <li>It works as great as the old version I have had for years!</li>
            <li>It has a narrower head so should work even better than the one I have, which has worked fine.</li>
            <li>Overall, very good product.</li>
            <li>Powerful, effective.</li>
            <li>The new one works great, just like the old one,  Good product.</li>
            <li>These seem to lack power and jam up too easy.</li>
            <li>Tried 2 different Wahl Brands because they were rechargeable and 1 did do ok but wasn&#x27;t happy..</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>One of many good things, this one takes 2 batteries versus the old one 3.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maintain and use.</li>
            <li>Easy, two words-</li>
            <li>It is well built and strong.  </li>
            <li>Works fine on my beard, as an afterthought.</li>
            <li>just fine.  </li>
            <li>and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>trimmer is still going strong and has been perfect to use on my sensitive old dog&#x27;s face and feet.</li>
            <li>Works great with NiMH rechargeable batteries (eneloop).&lt;br /&gt;Vibrates very fast, seems high power.</li>
            <li>Huge plus that this is battery operated.</li>
            <li>Light, durable, cuts well enough, great for travelling.</li>
            <li>Prime is the way to go and this unit arrived within 2 days (free shipping with prime..yeehaw)</li>
            <li>Great for the price - been using it several times now and has held up well.</li>
            <li>Found this model and now back to happy..</li>
            <li>Razor cuts some smooth &amp;</li>
            <li>Bought this cheap piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>rechargeable batteries, which stay powerful for many uses with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>I liked this so much</li>
            <li>I only use one attachment in order to trim my goatie and it works great for that job.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>Great for travel and daily use.</li>
            <li>But was really cheap.</li>
            <li>it was cheap.</li>
            <li>And for the price, it&#x27;s a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>I have taken it apart 3 times to make sure every thing is working right.</li>
            <li>Much better than my previous Conair and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Still using the original batteries after 6 months.</li>
            <li>The trimmer looked like a bargain until I inserted the two new AA batteries of my own and discovered it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>So to clean it off I&#x27;d recommend using the brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer for the price, liked it so much I bought one as a gift</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>This little guy is WAY superior to the Conair rechargeable I had!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing it every other day this week just because I am so happy with it.</li>
            <li>It is quick and bullet proof</li>
            <li>It drains batteries quickly (and I use the copper topped brand).</li>
            <li>Uses up batteries quickly.</li>
            <li>Get what you pay for, but quick refund.</li>
            <li>I expected a sketchy product when I ordered this and was thoroughly pleased when this nice quality trimmer showed up.</li>
            <li>When that comes I will write a new review which hopefully will be better.</li>
            <li>The accessories all snap on and off easily and the blade heads trim very well</li>
            <li>I cannot stand our increasingly throwaway society and I am always willing to pay a fair price for a quality product that will last, if I can find it.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend even though batteries needed!!!  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted over 4 yrs!</li>
            <li>Has great power despite being battery operated, so no cords to mess with.</li>
            <li>One has to do some things that you&#x27;re quite certain will break the trimmer to get the blade off, but that&#x27;s precisely what has to happen to remove the blade.</li>
            <li>It is a great little trimmer, no matter the price.</li>
            <li>Works great, but I wish it had a little longer trimmer, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Amazing, especially at this price!  </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because all the parts were there and unbroken - kind of a low bar</li>
            <li>After alot of searching I figured this one was as close as I could get to my old favorite.</li>
            <li>new.)It was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Second one I&#x27;ve own.</li>
            <li>Even if it conks out soon, I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Powerful, did the job each time, then rechargeable battery died, could not find replacement.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plenty powerful</li>
            <li>if it lasts three years I will get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Time will tell whether or not this trimmer is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Price is right and does the job.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>One attachment won&#x27;t fit on the main shaft.</li>
            <li>The battery life is fantastic and the performance is strong enough to trim my stubborn parts of my head.  </li>
            <li>, it is powerful and does not get hot.</li>
            <li>It really works fine and very well priced.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a gizmo that would easily trim my beard, get rid of that pesky nasal hair without pain (or tickling), and the old geezer ear hair.</li>
            <li>The beard trimming head snaps off and a nose/ear trimming blade easily snaps on (my old model did not do noses).  </li>
            <li>This one works great but switching cutters is a little strange because they need to be pushed up and swung over the top and not twisted sideways.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems that the battery life is slightly less with the Conair, but it is a good trade off to receive a higher quality trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it very much, so</li>
            <li>The new one doesn&#x27;t fit in the stand as well as the old one did, but i can use the stand by putting the new one in it backwards, which is OK.</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer!!</li>
            <li>Okay for the low price.</li>
            <li>My last one was a rechargeable but worked okay.  </li>
            <li>As this was my first foray into maintaining a beard, I decided to go with something inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine using regular batteries for these things, would wind up spending more in batteries than I paid for the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I love the products they offer, but their customer service ( gives me the assurance) to always come back!!</li>
            <li>My first Conair All in One Battery Operated trimmer functioned for 4 years.  </li>
            <li>This is product satisfies its purpose exactly: a beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, I really like this!</li>
            <li>Be sure to brush and oil the blade regularly</li>
            <li>It took me a bit of experimenting with all the attachments at first.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on the first set of batteries after a month (rechageables).</li>
            <li>(I bought rechargeable &amp;#34;iGogreen&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>The tips of the old one&#x27;s blades were smooth.</li>
            <li>This Conair was pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li>this one did on the first try.</li>
            <li>When it died I didn&#x27;t think I would find an exact replacement</li>
            <li>The Wahl beard trimmer, similarly priced, is much better made.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be of even higher quality.</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>So being my blessedly light beard is never going to break ANY shaver, the GMT175R works great especially the painless and fast nose trimmer, which for me will likely be it&#x27;s sole function (the luck of some tools to be stuck up a person&#x27;s nose every day).</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I shave mustache only and it does much better job than its earlier version which was a bit light</li>
            <li>Nice little gadget that does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It feels good in my hand, the batteries last twice as long as they did in the Maverick, and it cuts like a dream.</li>
            <li>Turned it off and replaced the regular head with the nose trimmer, again it hummed away fine.  </li>
            <li>Regrew goatee years later, it still worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Nice little trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li>I have found with use that I really prefer the Conair over the Wahl</li>
            <li>Fortunately, hair grows back.</li>
            <li>This is cordless and does the job really well in trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to eat up much battery.</li>
            <li>, that trimmer&#x27;s battery lasted a whole 9 months.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is way better than I expected</li>
            <li>This trimmer is much quieter than the Weil unit it replaced.  </li>
            <li>I have used the 170 model for about 7 years and totally gave up blades altogether beings I enjoy the shadow look..</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give it a try; if I didn&#x27;t like it I wouldn&#x27;t be out of too much</li>
            <li>I really like that it works of AA batteries</li>
            <li>Both implements function very well.  </li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>It is a real struggle to move it it.  </li>
            <li>shiping so fast  </li>
            <li>but this has proven to be a real work horse and has lasted for years.</li>
            <li>Quiet and comfortable in use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through far too many such devices in my lifetime and appreciate that this one does the job, so well.</li>
            <li>This one works OK, but it only uses 2 AA batteries whereas the old one used 3.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had many in the past and found that battery operated is much better than those rechargeable ones, simply because the rechargeables tend to lose charge capacity over time.</li>
            <li>For example, the instructions for removing the main blade in order to attach the nose/ear trimmer isn&#x27;t very helpful.</li>
            <li>I still use a regular razor to clean the beard outline and to shave the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li>powerful enough to trim my beard ;-)  </li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer to replace an older Wahl trimmer that had worn out over the years.</li>
            <li>This is a decent trimmer however in order to use the nose/ear hair trimmer attachment you have to take the cutter apart</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li>Mine is a somewhat older model</li>
            <li>It had a very low price on Amazon.com as usual amazon delivered a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The new one, probably because new, runs much stronger.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to trim my very old Yorkie&#x27;s face and feet, as she was fighting me when I used regular clippers because they get very hot.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s old and does walk much so the hair grows under his paws.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s proof enough for me that this is a product worth buying again.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it more than a few times.  </li>
            <li>Like the fact batteries are replacable by regular 2 AA&#x27;s, can change them whenever I want fresh power.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and easy to handle and very fast.  </li>
            <li>Have had several different razors like this, and for the money it seems to be as good as some of the more expensive models I have tried.</li>
            <li>is also pretty great in my mind, no charger or adapter to keep up with or fail, no proprietary batteries to find and replace in future, just a bag for the trimmer</li>
            <li>The new guides do not seem as sturdy as they used to be.</li>
            <li>Put in new batteries</li>
            <li>a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t make that model of conair anymore...</li>
            <li>After 15 years my Maverick up and died so I have been on the hunt for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>(this is easy and takes me one minute or less).  </li>
            <li>2nd one I bought first was 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Running at full speed is essential for easy and PAINLESS trimming, since a slow motor yanks and pulls on hair, and that isn&#x27;t fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sent me a New Conair complete with a pre-paid return mailing label.  </li>
            <li>I truely hope this prevents anyone else from believing these other reviews, THEY ARE LIES.</li>
            <li>Even old and dull it did a better job than the Remington.</li>
            <li>The instructions provided aren&#x27;t all that clear.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my 20 year old Conair trimmer.</li>
            <li>I kept the old Conair all this time and would still use it when she wasn&#x27;t looking.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I am holding on to my old attachments as others have pointed out in their reviews.</li>
            <li>so much so that I initially started looking for a place to insert a screwdriver to pry it off.</li>
            <li>It works, not to loud.</li>
            <li>I like this unit so much that I purchased a second unit for my travel kit.</li>
            <li>Had an old rechargeable Norelco.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works as well as the old one.  </li>
            <li>So far he loves it.</li>
            <li>i had an old conair beard and mustache trimmer that lasted me about 7 years or so.</li>
            <li>Bought to replace 10 year old Conair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The old one had a plastic stand that held the unit and all of the accessories.</li>
            <li>No attachment, bare blades on my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t cut or get hot enough to burn.  </li>
            <li>Does not seem to cut a nice thin line when trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and has a small draw string bag to keep all the parts together.</li>
            <li>The body of the trimmer is cheap plastic similar to other products manufactured in China.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s various attachments, pretty sweet as I bought it at a crazy good sale price too (less than $10).</li>
            <li>This version is sharp and powerful.  </li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t seem quite as powerful, probably due to htat.</li>
            <li>The Conair trims differently than the older Wahl, but it seems to trim</li>
            <li>Obviously it doesn&#x27;t look exactly the same</li>
            <li>Quite decent overall</li>
            <li>No one that ever actually used this would ever give it a decent review.</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t bother with the nose trimmer attachment because it doesn&#x27;t work all that well - I highly recommend the Wahl 5545-400 for that job.</li>
            <li>It is small and light weight</li>
            <li>the old one *never* jammed and tugged on my beard.</li>
            <li>A super little beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I oiled blades and tried various new batteries</li>
            <li>I had asked for a new trimmer back then</li>
            <li>Finally decided was time for new because heads were worn after lots of torture..</li>
            <li>The new one only came with a bag to hold all the things.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its big enough for bigger hair cutting jobs but perfect for smaller trimming jobs....</li>
            <li>/&gt;These online reviews have helped me so much in recent years, really saved me from making some big mistakes.  </li>
            <li>It broke on me half way during my first time, it started going sluggish for a bit, then just completely died.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I took the old Conair out of its hiding place last week and the batteries had leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li>Tends to pinch if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>the old one simple hugged it from the two sides.</li>
            <li>I sought a replacement and found the this Conair product, which was the same trimmer, only new.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and works very well.</li>
            <li>I trimmed not a single hair.</li>
            <li>Uses only 2 batteries instead of the three in my old trimmer, but still equal to the job.</li>
            <li>Has very sharp blade and cuts straight in seconds without any pull at all.</li>
            <li>It is a wee bit on the loud side, compared to regular electric clippers, but not annoyingly loud.</li>
            <li>I really like this one - smaller than a wahl - less noisy</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it all that much yet, but so far the motor doesn&#x27;t slow down as some older trimmers I&#x27;ve used do.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall, however, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive but well functioning trimmer for the beard, mustache, and nose and ear.</li>
            <li> A great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Battery life is shorter than a fruit fly&#x27;s (measures in days I believe).  </li>

            <li> I know for a fact that these great reviews you see here were bought by Conair.</li>
            <li> not an attractive look.</li>
            <li> The quality is great.</li>
            <li> The ease of use is great.</li>

            <li> Works as advertised, No issues, good purchase.</li>
            <li> I would tell others about how good it works..</li>

            <li> Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Very satisfied from the transaction and the materials received</li>
            <li> For now I&#x27;m satisfied with my two NiMH&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Once I discovered what works for me, it is easy to use and gives great results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously great product, and cheap.</li>
            <li> so this is a nice upgrade.</li>
            <li> Nice product that works well.</li>
            <li> nice power from batteries.</li>
            <li> Handy bag for all attachments.</li>
            <li> nice stuff  </li>
            <li> I bought this for trimming my sideburns to keep them nice and even.</li>
            <li> I use rechargeable batteries and always have spares handy</li>
            <li> Works good, hubby pleased</li>
            <li> which is nice...</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer..</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer that I have ever used and the price is more right.</li>
            <li> Seems to be an excellent product I had a Remington that only lasted about 6 months and didn&#x27;t work as good as the Conair.</li>
            <li> Trimmed the &#x27;stache very easily.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best of the lot.  </li>
            <li> There were lots of products that cost much more than this one, but given the astounding price of this Conair model</li>
            <li> a good cheap beard trimmer</li>
            <li> Been working great... seems to work as good as my old rechargeable one</li>
            <li> Great product, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It works great and does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> Very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> Does a quick, good job of trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li> Good product for trimming your nose/ear hair, bread not so much!!  </li>
            <li> Perfect for trimming facial hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The Conair trimmer is more quite than the Wahl and doesn&#x27;t seem to pluck out as many hairs as the Wahl.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars, 4 just for accommodating rechargeable batteries, yes my NiMH batteries fit!</li>
            <li> I also tried one NiMH and 1 lithium, the speed is faster than just two NiMH&#x27;s, but again, the faster it goes i&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> sure Conair does not recommend mixing battery types.</li>
            <li> Rusty scissors cut hair better than this shaver.</li>
            <li> (gotta love Amazon&#x27;s ease of return) and requested a replacement.  </li>
            <li> but you must make sure you have some quality batteries on hand as you will breeze through them depending, of course, on frequency of use.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love them.  </li>
            <li> well what more can I ask,</li>
            <li> and you will get lots of shaves or trims depending how you use..  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> It had adjustable blade depth and more accessories.</li>
            <li> love item</li>
            <li> The circular ones Work much better</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> many attachments</li>
            <li> use it more for body trimming but sometimes on the face</li>
            <li> Best investment ever, especially if you&#x27;re not too keen on grooming your mane.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more..</li>
            <li> many times it fell off during my trimming, and i proceeded to trim a bald patch into my goatee.</li>
            <li> I would love it even more if it was rechargeable or electric.</li>
            <li> Has a variety of attachments, most of which i lost over the years...  </li>
            <li> Works very well, I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Are there better trimmers on the market?</li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> not as good as my first conair beard and mustache trimmer since it doesn&#x27;t trim my beard as well.  </li>
            <li> Then I popped some new batteries in in and it worked great.</li>
            <li> It works as great as the old version I have had for years!</li>
            <li> It has a narrower head so should work even better than the one I have, which has worked fine.</li>
            <li> Overall, very good product.</li>
            <li> Powerful, effective.</li>
            <li> The new one works great, just like the old one,  Good product.</li>
            <li> These seem to lack power and jam up too easy.</li>
            <li> Tried 2 different Wahl Brands because they were rechargeable and 1 did do ok but wasn&#x27;t happy..</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> One of many good things, this one takes 2 batteries versus the old one 3.  </li>
            <li> Easy to maintain and use.</li>
            <li> Easy, two words-</li>
            <li> It is well built and strong.  </li>
            <li> Works fine on my beard, as an afterthought.</li>
            <li> just fine.  </li>
            <li> and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> trimmer is still going strong and has been perfect to use on my sensitive old dog&#x27;s face and feet.</li>
            <li> Works great with NiMH rechargeable batteries (eneloop).&lt;br /&gt;Vibrates very fast, seems high power.</li>
            <li> Huge plus that this is battery operated.</li>
            <li> Light, durable, cuts well enough, great for travelling.</li>
            <li> Prime is the way to go and this unit arrived within 2 days (free shipping with prime..yeehaw)</li>
            <li> Great for the price - been using it several times now and has held up well.</li>
            <li> Found this model and now back to happy..</li>
            <li> Razor cuts some smooth &amp;</li>
            <li> Bought this cheap piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> rechargeable batteries, which stay powerful for many uses with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> I liked this so much</li>
            <li> I only use one attachment in order to trim my goatie and it works great for that job.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Great for travel and daily use.</li>
            <li> But was really cheap.</li>
            <li> it was cheap.</li>
            <li> And for the price, it&#x27;s a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> I have taken it apart 3 times to make sure every thing is working right.</li>
            <li> Much better than my previous Conair and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Still using the original batteries after 6 months.</li>
            <li> The trimmer looked like a bargain until I inserted the two new AA batteries of my own and discovered it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> So to clean it off I&#x27;d recommend using the brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer for the price, liked it so much I bought one as a gift</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> This little guy is WAY superior to the Conair rechargeable I had!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing it every other day this week just because I am so happy with it.</li>
            <li> It is quick and bullet proof</li>
            <li> It drains batteries quickly (and I use the copper topped brand).</li>
            <li> Uses up batteries quickly.</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for, but quick refund.</li>
            <li> I expected a sketchy product when I ordered this and was thoroughly pleased when this nice quality trimmer showed up.</li>
            <li> When that comes I will write a new review which hopefully will be better.</li>
            <li> The accessories all snap on and off easily and the blade heads trim very well</li>
            <li> I cannot stand our increasingly throwaway society and I am always willing to pay a fair price for a quality product that will last, if I can find it.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend even though batteries needed!!!  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted over 4 yrs!</li>
            <li> Has great power despite being battery operated, so no cords to mess with.</li>
            <li> One has to do some things that you&#x27;re quite certain will break the trimmer to get the blade off, but that&#x27;s precisely what has to happen to remove the blade.</li>
            <li> It is a great little trimmer, no matter the price.</li>
            <li> Works great, but I wish it had a little longer trimmer, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Amazing, especially at this price!  </li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because all the parts were there and unbroken - kind of a low bar</li>
            <li> After alot of searching I figured this one was as close as I could get to my old favorite.</li>
            <li> new.)It was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve own.</li>
            <li> Even if it conks out soon, I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Powerful, did the job each time, then rechargeable battery died, could not find replacement.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plenty powerful</li>
            <li> if it lasts three years I will get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> Got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Time will tell whether or not this trimmer is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Price is right and does the job.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> One attachment won&#x27;t fit on the main shaft.</li>
            <li> The battery life is fantastic and the performance is strong enough to trim my stubborn parts of my head.  </li>
            <li> , it is powerful and does not get hot.</li>
            <li> It really works fine and very well priced.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gizmo that would easily trim my beard, get rid of that pesky nasal hair without pain (or tickling), and the old geezer ear hair.</li>
            <li> The beard trimming head snaps off and a nose/ear trimming blade easily snaps on (my old model did not do noses).  </li>
            <li> This one works great but switching cutters is a little strange because they need to be pushed up and swung over the top and not twisted sideways.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems that the battery life is slightly less with the Conair, but it is a good trade off to receive a higher quality trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it very much, so</li>
            <li> The new one doesn&#x27;t fit in the stand as well as the old one did, but i can use the stand by putting the new one in it backwards, which is OK.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer!!</li>
            <li> Okay for the low price.</li>
            <li> My last one was a rechargeable but worked okay.  </li>
            <li> As this was my first foray into maintaining a beard, I decided to go with something inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using regular batteries for these things, would wind up spending more in batteries than I paid for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love the products they offer, but their customer service ( gives me the assurance) to always come back!!</li>
            <li> My first Conair All in One Battery Operated trimmer functioned for 4 years.  </li>
            <li> This is product satisfies its purpose exactly: a beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, I really like this!</li>
            <li> Be sure to brush and oil the blade regularly</li>
            <li> It took me a bit of experimenting with all the attachments at first.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on the first set of batteries after a month (rechageables).</li>
            <li> (I bought rechargeable &amp;#34;iGogreen&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> The tips of the old one&#x27;s blades were smooth.</li>
            <li> This Conair was pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li> this one did on the first try.</li>
            <li> When it died I didn&#x27;t think I would find an exact replacement</li>
            <li> The Wahl beard trimmer, similarly priced, is much better made.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be of even higher quality.</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> So being my blessedly light beard is never going to break ANY shaver, the GMT175R works great especially the painless and fast nose trimmer, which for me will likely be it&#x27;s sole function (the luck of some tools to be stuck up a person&#x27;s nose every day).</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I shave mustache only and it does much better job than its earlier version which was a bit light</li>
            <li> Nice little gadget that does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It feels good in my hand, the batteries last twice as long as they did in the Maverick, and it cuts like a dream.</li>
            <li> Turned it off and replaced the regular head with the nose trimmer, again it hummed away fine.  </li>
            <li> Regrew goatee years later, it still worked fine.  </li>
            <li> Nice little trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> I have found with use that I really prefer the Conair over the Wahl</li>
            <li> Fortunately, hair grows back.</li>
            <li> This is cordless and does the job really well in trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to eat up much battery.</li>
            <li> , that trimmer&#x27;s battery lasted a whole 9 months.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is way better than I expected</li>
            <li> This trimmer is much quieter than the Weil unit it replaced.  </li>
            <li> I have used the 170 model for about 7 years and totally gave up blades altogether beings I enjoy the shadow look..</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give it a try; if I didn&#x27;t like it I wouldn&#x27;t be out of too much</li>
            <li> I really like that it works of AA batteries</li>
            <li> Both implements function very well.  </li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> It is a real struggle to move it it.  </li>
            <li> shiping so fast  </li>
            <li> but this has proven to be a real work horse and has lasted for years.</li>
            <li> Quiet and comfortable in use.  </li>
            <li> Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through far too many such devices in my lifetime and appreciate that this one does the job, so well.</li>
            <li> This one works OK, but it only uses 2 AA batteries whereas the old one used 3.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had many in the past and found that battery operated is much better than those rechargeable ones, simply because the rechargeables tend to lose charge capacity over time.</li>
            <li> For example, the instructions for removing the main blade in order to attach the nose/ear trimmer isn&#x27;t very helpful.</li>
            <li> I still use a regular razor to clean the beard outline and to shave the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li> powerful enough to trim my beard ;-)  </li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace an older Wahl trimmer that had worn out over the years.</li>
            <li> This is a decent trimmer however in order to use the nose/ear hair trimmer attachment you have to take the cutter apart</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li> Mine is a somewhat older model</li>
            <li> It had a very low price on Amazon.com as usual amazon delivered a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The new one, probably because new, runs much stronger.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to trim my very old Yorkie&#x27;s face and feet, as she was fighting me when I used regular clippers because they get very hot.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s old and does walk much so the hair grows under his paws.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s proof enough for me that this is a product worth buying again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it more than a few times.  </li>
            <li> Like the fact batteries are replacable by regular 2 AA&#x27;s, can change them whenever I want fresh power.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and easy to handle and very fast.  </li>
            <li> Have had several different razors like this, and for the money it seems to be as good as some of the more expensive models I have tried.</li>
            <li> is also pretty great in my mind, no charger or adapter to keep up with or fail, no proprietary batteries to find and replace in future, just a bag for the trimmer</li>
            <li> The new guides do not seem as sturdy as they used to be.</li>
            <li> Put in new batteries</li>
            <li> a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t make that model of conair anymore...</li>
            <li> After 15 years my Maverick up and died so I have been on the hunt for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> (this is easy and takes me one minute or less).  </li>
            <li> 2nd one I bought first was 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Running at full speed is essential for easy and PAINLESS trimming, since a slow motor yanks and pulls on hair, and that isn&#x27;t fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sent me a New Conair complete with a pre-paid return mailing label.  </li>
            <li> I truely hope this prevents anyone else from believing these other reviews, THEY ARE LIES.</li>
            <li> Even old and dull it did a better job than the Remington.</li>
            <li> The instructions provided aren&#x27;t all that clear.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my 20 year old Conair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I kept the old Conair all this time and would still use it when she wasn&#x27;t looking.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I am holding on to my old attachments as others have pointed out in their reviews.</li>
            <li> so much so that I initially started looking for a place to insert a screwdriver to pry it off.</li>
            <li> It works, not to loud.</li>
            <li> I like this unit so much that I purchased a second unit for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> Had an old rechargeable Norelco.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works as well as the old one.  </li>
            <li> So far he loves it.</li>
            <li> i had an old conair beard and mustache trimmer that lasted me about 7 years or so.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace 10 year old Conair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The old one had a plastic stand that held the unit and all of the accessories.</li>
            <li> No attachment, bare blades on my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t cut or get hot enough to burn.  </li>
            <li> Does not seem to cut a nice thin line when trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has a small draw string bag to keep all the parts together.</li>
            <li> The body of the trimmer is cheap plastic similar to other products manufactured in China.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s various attachments, pretty sweet as I bought it at a crazy good sale price too (less than $10).</li>
            <li> This version is sharp and powerful.  </li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t seem quite as powerful, probably due to htat.</li>
            <li> The Conair trims differently than the older Wahl, but it seems to trim</li>
            <li> Obviously it doesn&#x27;t look exactly the same</li>
            <li> Quite decent overall</li>
            <li> No one that ever actually used this would ever give it a decent review.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t bother with the nose trimmer attachment because it doesn&#x27;t work all that well - I highly recommend the Wahl 5545-400 for that job.</li>
            <li> It is small and light weight</li>
            <li> the old one *never* jammed and tugged on my beard.</li>
            <li> A super little beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I oiled blades and tried various new batteries</li>
            <li> I had asked for a new trimmer back then</li>
            <li> Finally decided was time for new because heads were worn after lots of torture..</li>
            <li> The new one only came with a bag to hold all the things.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its big enough for bigger hair cutting jobs but perfect for smaller trimming jobs....</li>
            <li> /&gt;These online reviews have helped me so much in recent years, really saved me from making some big mistakes.  </li>
            <li> It broke on me half way during my first time, it started going sluggish for a bit, then just completely died.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I took the old Conair out of its hiding place last week and the batteries had leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> Tends to pinch if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> the old one simple hugged it from the two sides.</li>
            <li> I sought a replacement and found the this Conair product, which was the same trimmer, only new.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and works very well.</li>
            <li> I trimmed not a single hair.</li>
            <li> Uses only 2 batteries instead of the three in my old trimmer, but still equal to the job.</li>
            <li> Has very sharp blade and cuts straight in seconds without any pull at all.</li>
            <li> It is a wee bit on the loud side, compared to regular electric clippers, but not annoyingly loud.</li>
            <li> I really like this one - smaller than a wahl - less noisy</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it all that much yet, but so far the motor doesn&#x27;t slow down as some older trimmers I&#x27;ve used do.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, rarely hanging up in thick hairs.</li>
            <li> one is no where nearly as good, with no fine blade adjustments, few accessories, no carry bag, and a very sharp/rough uncomfortable feel.</li>
            <li> So i use the trimmer to get it down to the &amp;#34;five o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; stage, and then shave from there normally.  </li>
            <li> I am not a particularly hairy guy generally and have gotten by using simple blade razors</li>
            <li> Replacement was inferior and blade no way near as sharp as the one i discarded.</li>
            <li> For $12, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to make their beard/mustache look a little neater.</li>
            <li> Simple economical solution, tough to beat that.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if the blades are dull or that it takes two AA batteries as opposed to three in my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one improvement from the old version</li>
            <li> Conair cutter is somewhat fragile, but it should last if I am careful.</li>
            <li> I keep my beard short and for nearly 40 years have done so using small scissors.</li>
            <li> The  Weil unit I had was sufficiently noisey that it might harm hearing acuity with long term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves some long hairs in my beard.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times and so far have found that it works well for my needs.  </li>
            <li> I bought the same model about 10 years ago and it finally wore down...</li>
            <li> The price, with Amazon prime, was less than I would have paid at the big blue box retailer in town.  </li>
            <li> the old ones still had sharp blades and all, but the spring that holds the negative pole on the battery got corroded and fell off on my old ones.</li>
            <li> The fact GMT175R runs on plain old AA batteries</li>
            <li> It is solid and is not loud like one other trimmer i purchased.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my other bigger Conair trimmer with a cord.</li>
            <li> Not exactly a sturdy product but mine still works months later.</li>
            <li> It holds not only the trimmer but also the various little attachments (and lubricating oil and a cleaning brush) that otherwise would get scrambled or lost in a drawer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It skips every other hair causing you to go over &amp; over the same spot.</li>
            <li> The old one had finally become dull.  </li>
            <li> It was stored in a dry place.  </li>
            <li> My old trimmer was too small for rechargeable</li>
            <li> No cord to mess with and batteries seem to last forever.</li>
            <li> The only problem, I have is the guard is a little inexact, and if you tap it on the sink to get the hair out, you can unwittingly change the depth to a shorter trim.</li>
            <li> battery takes 3 months to empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of this type of trimmer over the last 3 years.  </li>
            <li> It works as expected and I would give it 5 Stars</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Not as solid and heavy as the one I bought about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I. Went back to the &amp;#34;stone age&amp;#34; of alkalines, which will always give you a predictable amount of power output.</li>
            <li> For now, it does the job as well as expected.</li>
            <li> It cuts poorly, and the plastic internal mechanism stopped working properly after only a few months of moderate use.</li>
            <li> it is raw from all the multiple passes.</li>
            <li> I will never buy anything other than this.</li>
            <li> bought one other brand before this one, it used to cut skin but not Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And a lot cheaper at the other places I went to here in Las Vegas,NV.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very rough; a hack job.</li>
            <li> Are the attachments on the Conair somewhat confusing and take a bit of skill to use properly?</li>
            <li> grief - pay more.</li>
            <li> Just pop in AA batteries when they run down, so you&#x27;re never without.</li>
            <li> I had previously used.</li>
            <li> I am sitting here with a half shaven beard as we speak, looking horrendous.</li>
            <li> A task that typically takes about a half hour once per week.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has replaced my scissors at less than 1/2 the cost.</li>
            <li> It is slightly noisier, but not bothersome.  </li>
            <li> the cutting just did not seem to have any power so went back to my old one.</li>
            <li> the shorter the life span, who knows how long, and what negative effects there are on the motor, I&amp;#34;m</li>
            <li> I bought this March 2014 because as I age I am sick of using tweezers to pull out the rogue nose hair as apparently while I slept my nose has decided to rent out space to a very tiny monkey.</li>
            <li> ** tight.  </li>
            <li> I have a regular Andis Dog Hair clipper I use to trim their hair, but I use small trimmers (like this one) to do the detail work (which doesn&#x27;t involve thick patches of hair-a beard would be thicker than what I&#x27;m using these for).  </li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble, dont buy this or youll end up like me, with half a beard.</li>
            <li> Could be a little lower on the decibels.</li>
            <li> this little machine trims my mustache and beard</li>
            <li> My biggest issue is that I wish it would cut just a little bit shorter.</li>
            <li> Yep, eleven little dollars for this puppy.</li>
            <li> That just means don&#x27;t slam it down, in other words, use common sense.  </li>
            <li> So the fact that I have to go over the same spots several times is a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I oiled them but they still have trouble trimming.</li>
            <li> put in two AA batteries, turned on the switch, and it hummed away for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Hope to get a few years out of it.</li>
            <li> I assumed the batteries were dead.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly I do not have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use a lot of parts, but a lot less tug and pull than the girly trimmers!</li>
            <li> It is quite course and stiff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use and almost impossible to make a mistake with it when using the proper trim guard.  </li>
            <li> IT IS WAY TOO TIGHT!  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a bad trimmer because I used  the batteries it came with</li>
            <li> Ive owner a few of these trimmers in the past, but I must admit I don&#x27;t have a beard.  </li>
            <li> The Conair does not come with a guard for the cutting head, I leave the number one guard attached to the new trimmer to act as a guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I power this bad boy with some rechargeable AA batteries which last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for small trimming jobs.</li>
            <li> I use them to clip small, detail areas on my dogs.</li>
            <li> I put the regular head back on in preparation for beard trimming - it never turned on again :( .  </li>
            <li> Does the job for small trim jobs.  </li>
            <li> It runs for no more than 2 minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li> Tired of those &amp;#34;rechargeable&amp;#34; shavers, that lose their capacity to hold a charge, no matter how carefully you recharge them?</li>
            <li> I usually use it to trim my beard</li>
            <li> Sucks please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I took the hard plastic packaging apart and all the parts were there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to believe that the price is</li>
            <li> i would say at least 6 years.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer arrived in a confusing package with a hazmat label, despite it having no batteries (as was advertised and known), let alone the supposed lithium ion battery stated on the caution sticker.  </li>
            <li> Complaint:  </li>
            <li> and it ran slowly.</li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard then I suggest you try another option.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is seriously underpowered.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous value...</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible, does not cut facial hair properly.</li>
            <li> not great for thick breads.</li>
            <li> So it is no surprise to discover that it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as other models in terms of its cutting edge.</li>
            <li> I think because I rinsed it with water all the time without drying it, and a spring eventually got rusty and weak.</li>
            <li> which is difficult to do to say the least.</li>
            <li> Guards can be broken, so don&#x27;t drop to floor.</li>
            <li> few gripes: (1)</li>
            <li> As battery dies, so does power and it sounds pathetic and barely cuts hair.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  </li>
            <li> which is unfortunate</li>
            <li> However, for the money, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this trimmer is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Appears to be a quality product where it counts: the cutting head.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m really disappointed in the battery life.  </li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed  </li>
            <li> The nose trimmer is just as bad, I am fearful to put this thing close to my nose or ears.</li>
            <li> And NO CORDS or worthless rechargeable batteries that die in a year.</li>
            <li> I have always hated it but had to use it anyway.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the worst purchases I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As described.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best trimmer, but it does get the job done. Still a good deal for the price</li>
            <li> I use one of these and it is awesom..  battery takes 3 months to empty.</li>
            <li> My son bought and uses this.</li>
            <li> Great for mustache and beard trimming. No cord to mess with and batteries seem to last forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before and it lasted me 5 years. At $10 - $15 (depending where you buy it), this cannot be beat. I think the only reason my last one didn&#x27;t last longer than 5 years was because I did not maintain it. It cuts great no snagged hairs or anything, and all the attachements that come with it make it great for any grooming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously great product, and cheap. I will never buy anything other than this.</li>
            <li> Price is right and does the job. Perfect for trimming facial hair. It had a very low price on Amazon.com as usual amazon delivered a good product at a reasonable price. Prime is the way to go and this unit arrived within 2 days (free shipping with prime..yeehaw)</li>
            <li> Great Value. Works great.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! Love it.</li>
            <li> use it every day its great for the price happy i bought it buy one</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace an older Wahl trimmer that had worn out over the years. The Conair trimmer is more quite than the Wahl and doesn&#x27;t seem to pluck out as many hairs as the Wahl. The Conair trims differently than the older Wahl, but it seems to trim better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming guards provided with the Conair are easier to use than the Wahl. The Conair does not come with a guard for the cutting head, I leave the number one guard attached to the new trimmer to act as a guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the battery life is slightly less with the Conair, but it is a good trade off to receive a higher quality trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this trimmer to someone who is considering the purchase of beard / mustache trimmer. I have found with use that I really prefer the Conair over the Wahl I had previously used.</li>
            <li> Okay for the low price.</li>
            <li> Every year or so I have to buy a trimmer because something breaks and they just stop working,  My last one was a rechargeable but worked okay.  This one works great but switching cutters is a little strange because they need to be pushed up and swung over the top and not twisted sideways.  Takes a couple of attempts to get it right but once you know it works okay.  Cuts well and the blade guards are good sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> As this was my first foray into maintaining a beard, I decided to go with something inexpensive. It works well, and I am on the same battery I put in it in August. The only problem, I have is the guard is a little inexact, and if you tap it on the sink to get the hair out, you can unwittingly change the depth to a shorter trim. Fortunately, hair grows back.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my other bigger Conair trimmer with a cord. This is cordless and does the job really well in trimming my beard. Well build and has enough power. I would recommend this for small trimming jobs. I don&#x27;t think its big enough for bigger hair cutting jobs but perfect for smaller trimming jobs....Doesn&#x27;t seem to eat up much battery.</li>
            <li> I shave mustache only and it does much better job than its earlier version which was a bit light weight.&lt;br /&gt;I  bought one other brand before this one, it used to cut skin but not Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair makes good product.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer for the price, liked it so much I bought one as a gift</li>
            <li> Great product, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, at a very reasonable price. What&#x27;s not to like? I bought two.</li>
            <li> It works great but goes through Batters</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars, 4 just for accommodating rechargeable batteries, yes my NiMH batteries fit! So the eneloop NiMH brand would work. I can&#x27;t imagine using regular batteries for these things, would wind up spending more in batteries than I paid for the trimmer. My old trimmer was too small for rechargeable&#x27;s so this is a nice upgrade. This is also coming after I bought one with a built in rechargeable battery, that trimmer&#x27;s battery lasted a whole 9 months. The trimmer is trash when those batteries go.  Update: It even has room for two 14500 &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; Lithium&#x27;s, however it makes the motor race like a doped up racehorse, not recommended! I also tried one NiMH and 1 lithium, the speed is faster than just two NiMH&#x27;s, but again, the faster it goes i&#x27;m sure the shorter the life span, who knows how long, and what negative effects there are on the motor, I&amp;#34;m sure Conair does not recommend mixing battery types. For now I&#x27;m satisfied with my two NiMH&#x27;s! Excellent product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent lightweight battery operated trimmer. I bought it to trim my very old Yorkie&#x27;s face and feet, as she was fighting me when I used regular clippers because they get very hot. I find this is the perfect size, it is powerful and does not get hot. It is a wee bit on the loud side, compared to regular electric clippers, but not annoyingly loud. I am very pleased with this purchase. I will update over time as to how well they hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 13, 2015 Update:&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is still going strong and has been perfect to use on my sensitive old dog&#x27;s face and feet. I just recently had to replace the battery. Not bad.</li>
            <li> Works fine on my beard, as an afterthought.</li>
            <li> Ive owner a few of these trimmers in the past, but I must admit I don&#x27;t have a beard.  I use them to clip small, detail areas on my dogs. I have a regular Andis Dog Hair clipper I use to trim their hair, but I use small trimmers (like this one) to do the detail work (which doesn&#x27;t involve thick patches of hair-a beard would be thicker than what I&#x27;m using these for).  These seem to lack power and jam up too easy. I oiled them but they still have trouble trimming.</li>
            <li> Rusty scissors cut hair better than this shaver. I oiled blades and tried various new batteries and it never worked, into the trash can it goes.</li>
            <li> I like the trimmer and accessories a lot!  The accessories all snap on and off easily and the blade heads trim very well</li>
            <li> Order arrived on time.  I took the hard plastic packaging apart and all the parts were there.  put in two AA batteries, turned on the switch, and it hummed away for a few seconds.  Turned it off and replaced the regular head with the nose trimmer, again it hummed away fine.  I put the regular head back on in preparation for beard trimming - it never turned on again :( .  I trimmed not a single hair. I gave it two stars because all the parts were there and unbroken - kind of a low bar I know.&lt;br /&gt;I have sent it back (gotta love Amazon&#x27;s ease of return) and requested a replacement.  When that comes I will write a new review which hopefully will be better.</li>
            <li> Great for the price - been using it several times now and has held up well. Hope to get a few years out of it.</li>
            <li> Just right. Could be a little lower on the decibels.</li>
            <li> The best trimmer, very nice and works perfect</li>
            <li> I could of gone with a more expensive model, but i went with the Conair because i had one before that lasted me i would say at least 6 years.  You can not beat this machine at this price.  Granted, its all plastic.  That just means don&#x27;t slam it down, in other words, use common sense.  I use this daily to actually shave the majority of my face, and to trim my goatee and mustache.  I can not use a standard razor on my face, because of the thickness of the hair.  It is quite course and stiff.  So i use the trimmer to get it down to the &amp;#34;five o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; stage, and then shave from there normally.  The attachments that come with it are all you will ever need to trim just about anything you have.  I also use this to shave my head.  No attachment, bare blades on my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t cut or get hot enough to burn.  It is a great little trimmer, no matter the price.</li>
            <li> Good product for trimming your nose/ear hair, bread not so much!!  Had a problem with (ear/nose trimmer)....Amazon was &amp;#34;excellent&#x27;! Sent me a New Conair complete with a pre-paid return mailing label.  I love the products they offer, but their customer service ( gives me the assurance) to always come back!!</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer that I have ever used and the price is more right.</li>
            <li> works well for the price</li>
            <li> bought this for my min pin (dog) paws. He&#x27;s old and does walk much so the hair grows under his paws. this works great for him.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my 20 year old Conair trimmer. Actually I bought in to replace the Remington trimmer my wife go me about 10 years ago. I had asked for a new trimmer back then and she got me the Remington. I have always hated it but had to use it anyway. I kept the old Conair all this time and would still use it when she wasn&#x27;t looking. Even old and dull it did a better job than the Remington. Anyway, I took the old Conair out of its hiding place last week and the batteries had leaked everywhere. After alot of searching I figured this one was as close as I could get to my old favorite. Obviously it doesn&#x27;t look exactly the same but it appeared to have the same basic stuff to it. I have been pleasantly surprised. It works great and does exactly what I want it to do. I usually only trim ny mustache and goatee once a week. I&#x27;ve been doing it every other day this week just because I am so happy with it. I am holding on to my old attachments as others have pointed out in their reviews. The new guides do not seem as sturdy as they used to be.</li>
            <li> Worked for about two days then the motor died..</li>
            <li> Not as good as the norelco for what we needed it for. Like that it runs on a battery though.</li>
            <li> Nice product that works well. Easy to use and has a small draw string bag to keep all the parts together.</li>
            <li> Quite decent overall but you must make sure you have some quality batteries on hand as you will breeze through them depending, of course, on frequency of use.</li>
            <li> Great for $10. Tends to pinch if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of this type of trimmer over the last 3 years.  This one is by far the best of the lot.  The battery life is fantastic and the performance is strong enough to trim my stubborn parts of my head.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  ...And NO CORDS or worthless rechargeable batteries that die in a year.</li>
            <li> As soon as it came in and it was used on the same day.(Brand new.)It was worth the wait.And a lot cheaper at the other places I went to here in Las Vegas,NV.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is way better than I expected</li>
            <li> this little machine trims my mustache and beard just fine.  I like it.  so does my wife, lol.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this to trim my hair since the price of hair cuts has gone up! No problems at all it does the job it was designed for and trims my hair. P.S&amp;#62; I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair to trim though--------just to let you know</li>
            <li> This is a decent trimmer however in order to use the nose/ear hair trimmer attachment you have to take the cutter apart which is difficult to do to say the least. I mainly use it for trimming my mustache. It gets the job done</li>
            <li> It works as expected and I would give it 5 Stars but nothing is perfect.</li>
            <li> awesome for the price !!!!  works well</li>
            <li> This is our 2nd Conair Battery Trimmer!  My husband and I love them.  The 1st one lasted forever and just needed to be retired.  We are just as happy with this one. Great product for price.</li>
            <li> non-rechargeable battery. But works well</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> My first Conair All in One Battery Operated trimmer functioned for 4 years.  I sought a replacement and found the this Conair product, which was the same trimmer, only new.  It works perfectly and has the correct number of attachments.  Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Sharp and works very well.</li>
            <li> good price does what it should</li>
            <li> I really like this one - smaller than a wahl - less noisy</li>
            <li> Much better than my previous Conair and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Lightweight.  Second one I&#x27;ve own. Would buy another. Just pop in AA batteries when they run down, so you&#x27;re never without.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is much quieter than the Weil unit it replaced.  The  Weil unit I had was sufficiently noisey that it might harm hearing acuity with long term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Conair cutter is somewhat fragile, but it should last if I am careful.</li>
            <li> For the money this is the bomb.  Works well what more can I ask,</li>
            <li> The trimmer arrived in a confusing package with a hazmat label, despite it having no batteries (as was advertised and known), let alone the supposed lithium ion battery stated on the caution sticker.  The trimmer looked like a bargain until I inserted the two new AA batteries of my own and discovered it wouldn&#x27;t work.  I have returned the unit under Amazon&#x27;s return policy; and have asked for a replacement.</li>
            <li> This is product satisfies its purpose exactly: a beard and mustache trimmer. For $12, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to make their beard/mustache look a little neater. I am sure it is not the best out there, but I do not see how anyone could complain about the price compared to the results.</li>
            <li> I got this because it is battery operated for extended traveling overseas. However, I do not like the way it trims my beard. Compared to my Remington MB4040 it&#x27;s very rough; a hack job.</li>
            <li> I have used the 170 model for about 7 years and totally gave up blades altogether beings I enjoy the shadow look.. Finally decided was time for new because heads were worn after lots of torture.. Tried 2 different Wahl Brands because they were rechargeable and 1 did do ok but wasn&#x27;t happy.. Found this model and now back to happy.. Razor cuts some smooth &amp; the smallest comb gives me the perfect look with out hassle.. Highly Recommend even though batteries needed!!!  Remove batteries &amp; keep in your fridge in a ziplock bag when not in use and you will get lots of shaves or trims depending how you use..  :)</li>
            <li> This is the second time we have purchased this brand. The first one lasted over 4 yrs! That&#x27;s proof enough for me that this is a product worth buying again. Works perfectly, rarely hanging up in thick hairs.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. Not exactly a sturdy product but mine still works months later. Even if it conks out soon, I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gizmo that would easily trim my beard, get rid of that pesky nasal hair without pain (or tickling), and the old geezer ear hair. There were lots of products that cost much more than this one, but given the astounding price of this Conair model I thought I&#x27;d give it a try; if I didn&#x27;t like it I wouldn&#x27;t be out of too much cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I really like this! It works as advertised, and it seems to be well built (but read further). Haven&#x27;t used it all that much yet, but so far the motor doesn&#x27;t slow down as some older trimmers I&#x27;ve used do. Running at full speed is essential for easy and PAINLESS trimming, since a slow motor yanks and pulls on hair, and that isn&#x27;t fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the smallish bag that comes with the trimmer. It holds not only the trimmer but also the various little attachments (and lubricating oil and a cleaning brush) that otherwise would get scrambled or lost in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few gripes: (1) This comes in one of those &amp;#34;hard to open&amp;#34; clamshell plastic units. Don&#x27;t like them. (2) The instructions provided aren&#x27;t all that clear. For example, the instructions for removing the main blade in order to attach the nose/ear trimmer isn&#x27;t very helpful. One has to do some things that you&#x27;re quite certain will break the trimmer to get the blade off, but that&#x27;s precisely what has to happen to remove the blade. (3) Getting the battery cover off takes lots of finesse too... so much so that I initially started looking for a place to insert a screwdriver to pry it off. Once again, some finesse does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, however, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive but well functioning trimmer for the beard, mustache, and nose and ear.</li>
            <li> It works, not to loud.</li>
            <li> Just discarded a Conair All-in-One and purchased a replacement thru Amazon.  Replacement was inferior and blade no way near as sharp as the one i discarded.</li>
            <li> This version is sharp and powerful.  Does a quick, good job of trimming my beard.  Uses only 2 batteries instead of the three in my old trimmer, but still equal to the job.</li>
            <li> This product replaced an almost identical one that had a rechargable battery and stand.  It does everything that one did except it can be put away in a drawer when not in use.  Still using the original batteries after 6 months.</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t break immediately like the last beard trimmer i purchased but it is battery powered which is unfortunate</li>
            <li> Does the job for small trim jobs.  But I&#x27;m really disappointed in the battery life.  I only use it two times a week for trimming my beard and mustache.  It runs for no more than 2 minutes at a time.  After maybe 10 uses, I have to replace the batteries!  When the batteries fade, the trimmer weakens causing it to pull your hair!  Ouch!</li>
            <li> I like this unit so much that I purchased a second unit for my travel kit. Works as expected. A great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great and my son is very happy with it. I would recommend this product to anyone and so would he.</li>
            <li> Nice little gadget that does exactly what I wanted. Trim my beard, and nostril hairs...nice power from batteries.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to cut a nice thin line when trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li> This beard &amp; moustache trimmer works great!  It&#x27;s simple to use and almost impossible to make a mistake with it when using the proper trim guard.  It&#x27;s small and easy to handle and very fast.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I am sitting here with a half shaven beard as we speak, looking horrendous. It broke on me half way during my first time, it started going sluggish for a bit, then just completely died. I changed the batteries, still no luck. Cant think of any reason why it broke so suddenly. Save yourself the trouble, dont buy this or youll end up like me, with half a beard. You have been warned.</li>
            <li> Had an old rechargeable Norelco.  Used it for years, then I got rid of the goatee, put Norelco aside. Regrew goatee years later, it still worked fine.  Powerful, did the job each time, then rechargeable battery died, could not find replacement.  Bought this cheap piece of junk.  Uses AA batteries. Battery life is shorter than a fruit fly&#x27;s (measures in days I believe).  As battery dies, so does power and it sounds pathetic and barely cuts hair.  Save yourself grief - pay more. get a quality rechargeable battery that sits in a cradle and is always fully charged.  Nuff said!</li>
            <li> Amazing, especially at this price!  I use with standard AA size, non-disposable, &amp;#34;low self-discharge&amp;#34; rechargeable batteries, which stay powerful for many uses with this trimmer.  It is well built and strong.  Does a great job trimming my beard.  I still use a regular razor to clean the beard outline and to shave the rest of my face.  Be sure to brush and oil the blade regularly (this is easy and takes me one minute or less).  It took me a bit of experimenting with all the attachments at first.  Once I discovered what works for me, it is easy to use and gives great results.</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with this trimmer. It&#x27;s the perfect size and the guards they include are great for trimming eyebrows and sideburns. It&#x27;s plenty powerful and I&#x27;m still on the first set of batteries after a month (rechageables). A great price too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> A super little beard trimmer. I keep my beard short and for nearly 40 years have done so using small scissors. A task that typically takes about a half hour once per week. This trimmer has replaced my scissors at less than 1/2 the cost. It is quick and bullet proof so I am now inclined to trim up every couple of days instead of once a week. My biggest issue is that I wish it would cut just a little bit shorter. I suspect that as I experiment with it, I will find a combination that will do just that.</li>
            <li> Great price!  Light weight. Handy bag for all attachments. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I liked this so much I bought a back up.  I only use one attachment in order to trim my goatie and it works great for that job.  It is small and light weight so it&#x27;s easy to use.  Definitely keep it oiled because it can start to bind up over time, just like any battery operated trimmer.  Personally, I don&#x27;t bother with the nose trimmer attachment because it doesn&#x27;t work all that well - I highly recommend the Wahl 5545-400 for that job.</li>
            <li> not as good as my first conair beard and mustache trimmer since it doesn&#x27;t trim my beard as well.  It leaves some long hairs in my beard.  but it is adaquate.</li>
            <li> I bought this March 2014 because as I age I am sick of using tweezers to pull out the rogue nose hair as apparently while I slept my nose has decided to rent out space to a very tiny monkey. I am not a particularly hairy guy generally and have gotten by using simple blade razors so beardy fellas reading this review ought to take that fact into account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So being my blessedly light beard is never going to break ANY shaver, the GMT175R works great especially the painless and fast nose trimmer, which for me will likely be it&#x27;s sole function (the luck of some tools to be stuck up a person&#x27;s nose every day). The fact GMT175R runs on plain old AA batteries is also pretty great in my mind, no charger or adapter to keep up with or fail, no proprietary batteries to find and replace in future, just a bag for the trimmer and it&#x27;s various attachments, pretty sweet as I bought it at a crazy good sale price too (less than $10). Simple economical solution, tough to beat that.</li>
            <li> powerful enough to trim my beard ;-)  I really like that it works of AA batteries (I bought rechargeable &amp;#34;iGogreen&amp;#34;).  The adjustable attachment has all the settings I need.  I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Works great, but I wish it had a little longer trimmer, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Cheap, doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I bought another Conair very similar to this at Target about 10 years ago.  It had adjustable blade depth and more accessories. The tips of the old one&#x27;s blades were smooth. It finally gave up so I ordered this.  I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is no where nearly as good, with no fine blade adjustments, few accessories, no carry bag, and a very sharp/rough uncomfortable feel.</li>
            <li> 2nd one I bought first was 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> This little guy is WAY superior to the Conair rechargeable I had! Just buy one of these instead!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an almost-identical Conair trimmer (model GMT170B) I bought 10 years ago.  The old one had finally become dull.  Do yourself a favor and forget the rechargeable models...AA battery-operated trimmers are the way to go.  This trimmer works as well as the old one.  It is slightly noisier, but not bothersome.  The beard trimming head snaps off and a nose/ear trimming blade easily snaps on (my old model did not do noses).  Both implements function very well.  Complaint:  The adjustable blade guard fits **VERY** tight.  It is a real struggle to move it it.  It feels like you are going to break it.  IT IS WAY TOO TIGHT!  If you break the guard, you will be out of business.  Can&#x27;t beat the price...if it lasts three years I will get my money&#x27;s worth.  UPDATE 3-29-207 It&#x27;s still going after three years. Got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> shiping so fast  .very nice stuff  love item</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the nose hair trimmer.  The circular ones Work much better</li>
            <li> It works as great as the old version I have had for years! Don&#x27;t use a lot of parts, but a lot less tug and pull than the girly trimmers!</li>
            <li> Great for trimming moustache and goatee.  Has great power despite being battery operated, so no cords to mess with.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I bought this for trimming my sideburns to keep them nice and even. It really works fine and very well priced.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a bad trimmer because I used  the batteries it came with and it ran slowly. Then I popped some new batteries in in and it worked great. Feel like it should cost 30$ instead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a rechargeable I have used for ten years. This trimmer is seriously underpowered. It drains batteries quickly (and I use the copper topped brand). Keep shopping.</li>
            <li> Nice little trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product and price!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this trimmer. Great for travel and daily use. Huge plus that this is battery operated. I have been using the same batteries for a while now and it runs the same as day one.</li>
            <li> Bought mine about two years ago.  Got it out today and it didn&#x27;t work.  Haven&#x27;t used it very much, so I assumed the batteries were dead.  Put in new batteries and it still doesn&#x27;t work.  Still have all the parts in a zip lock bag, so I can conveniently take it all out to the dumpster.  Haven&#x27;t used it more than a few times.  It was stored in a dry place.  Well, they made some money off of me, but I won&#x27;t ever buy another Conair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These online reviews have helped me so much in recent years, really saved me from making some big mistakes.  I thought I owed it to the community to tell my experience too.  So I held off throwing it away until I could put my experience online.</li>
            <li> I had a more expensive Braun trimmer that conked out and my Wife bought me this as a replacement. I was initially disappointed  but this has proven to be a real work horse and has lasted for years. Admittedly I do not have a heavy beard. Mine is a somewhat older model and I notice that the nose hair trimming cutter is different. It has a narrower head so should work even better than the one I have, which has worked fine. I use rechargeable batteries and always have spares handy so the fact that it is battery powered doesn&#x27;t bother me and the fact that there is no cord makes it easier to use than a cord one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to believe that the price is so low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Son is now looking for a trimmer and we&#x27;re getting one for him.</li>
            <li> Operates as anticipated.  Quiet and comfortable in use.  Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> good product. it is not re-chargeable - it uses replace-able alkaline batteries. many attachments</li>
            <li> Works good, hubby pleased</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer.  Not as solid and heavy as the one I bought about 10 years ago.  But then again, what is the same as 10 years ago? Overall, very good product.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. a good cheap beard trimmer</li>
            <li> It works well, and meets all grooming needs for both of us.</li>
            <li> Great and worked as stated</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times and so far have found that it works well for my needs.  It seems to be a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through far too many such devices in my lifetime and appreciate that this one does the job, so well.</li>
            <li> not great for thick breads. Uses up batteries quickly. But was really cheap. the price reflected the product.</li>
            <li> Tired of those &amp;#34;rechargeable&amp;#34; shavers, that lose their capacity to hold a charge, no matter how carefully you recharge them? So was I. Went back to the &amp;#34;stone age&amp;#34; of alkalines, which will always give you a predictable amount of power output.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i bough this trimmer. It is solid and is not loud like one other trimmer i purchased.</li>
            <li> Been working great... seems to work as good as my old rechargeable one</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my brother.  So far he loves it.</li>
            <li> This Conair was pretty inexpensive. So it is no surprise to discover that it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as other models in terms of its cutting edge. I have a goatee. So the fact that I have to go over the same spots several times is a little disappointing. If you have a thick beard then I suggest you try another option.</li>
            <li> I bought the same model about 10 years ago and it finally wore down...I think because I rinsed it with water all the time without drying it, and a spring eventually got rusty and weak. So to clean it off I&#x27;d recommend using the brush that comes with it. Even though it&#x27;s technically the same model, the clip-on length adjusters actually clip on now which is nice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it more for body trimming but sometimes on the face and it works fine for me. Ridiculous value...$1/year for 10 years?</li>
            <li> So great! Best investment ever, especially if you&#x27;re not too keen on grooming your mane.</li>
            <li> It does not have the re chargeable batteries inside, so you will have to pay an additional 10-11 $ on the batteries.</li>
            <li> Excellent Quality for the price. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more..</li>
            <li> Seems to be an excellent product I had a Remington that only lasted about 6 months and didn&#x27;t work as good as the Conair.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.</li>
            <li> One attachment won&#x27;t fit on the main shaft.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible, does not cut facial hair properly. It skips every other hair causing you to go over &amp; over the same spot. By the time you finish your face it is raw from all the multiple passes. I have taken it apart 3 times to make sure every thing is working right. There is no fixing a faulty designed product. The nose trimmer is just as bad, I am fearful to put this thing close to my nose or ears. I know for a fact that these great reviews you see here were bought by Conair. No one that ever actually used this would ever give it a decent review. It&#x27;s one of the worst purchases I&#x27;ve ever had. I truely hope this prevents anyone else from believing these other reviews, THEY ARE LIES.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for me!</li>
            <li> i had an old conair beard and mustache trimmer that lasted me about 7 years or so. i&#x27;ve had many in the past and found that battery operated is much better than those rechargeable ones, simply because the rechargeables tend to lose charge capacity over time. the old ones still had sharp blades and all, but the spring that holds the negative pole on the battery got corroded and fell off on my old ones. so time to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t make that model of conair anymore... this is the replacement. however, i find this one not as good. the old one *never* jammed and tugged on my beard. this one did on the first try. ouch. i don&#x27;t know if the blades are dull or that it takes two AA batteries as opposed to three in my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one improvement from the old version is that the attachments for doing your goatee, for instance, has a clip on the back so that it clips onto the head. the old one simple hugged it from the two sides. many times it fell off during my trimming, and i proceeded to trim a bald patch into my goatee. not an attractive look. think \\&quot;jackass\\&quot; prank but on your face... self-inflicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i guess you get what you pay for... it was cheap.</li>
            <li> It just may be me but the cutting just did not seem to have any power so went back to my old one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. The quality is great. The ease of use is great. I would love it even more if it was rechargeable or electric. However, for the money, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer!!</li>
            <li> This is all anyone needs for a beard and nose hair mower. I prefer these to the rechargeable types, personally.</li>
            <li> got it works great...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price!  My husband had one of these for years.  When it died I didn&#x27;t think I would find an exact replacement but there it was - on Amazon, of course!  The new one works great, just like the old one,  Good product.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer. Light, durable, cuts well enough, great for travelling.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace 10 year old Conair trimmer.  One of many good things, this one takes 2 batteries versus the old one 3.  The new one, probably because new, runs much stronger.  Has a variety of attachments, most of which i lost over the years...  The price, with Amazon prime, was less than I would have paid at the big blue box retailer in town.  Trimmed the &#x27;stache very easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brand before, works well and is moderately priced. Easy to maintain and use. Guards can be broken, so don&#x27;t drop to floor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this trimmer is a piece of junk. It cuts poorly, and the plastic internal mechanism stopped working properly after only a few months of moderate use. The Wahl beard trimmer, similarly priced, is much better made.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t shaved since Oct 2014. People want to know where the bearded man went. Haa ha! Like the fact batteries are replacable by regular 2 AA&#x27;s, can change them whenever I want fresh power.</li>
            <li> Very good product n great battery working.</li>
            <li> seems to work well....</li>
            <li> Great trimmers. This beats all trimmers of the  electric  trimmer/shaver combos that I have used before. I power this bad boy with some rechargeable AA batteries which last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Have had several different razors like this, and for the money it seems to be as good as some of the more expensive models I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works great with NiMH rechargeable batteries (eneloop).&lt;br /&gt;Vibrates very fast, seems high power.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another Conair Beard Trimmer which just stopped working after about 10 years. This one works OK, but it only uses 2 AA batteries whereas the old one used 3. This one doesn&#x27;t seem quite as powerful, probably due to htat. The old one had a plastic stand that held the unit and all of the accessories. The new one only came with a bag to hold all the things. The new one doesn&#x27;t fit in the stand as well as the old one did, but i can use the stand by putting the new one in it backwards, which is OK.</li>
            <li> Very smooth on the skin. I bought a Conair over 20 years ago and it lasted until recently. This one seems to be of even higher quality. And for the price, it&#x27;s a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for, but quick refund.</li>
            <li> Powerful, effective. I usually use it to trim my beard</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and well-made...what else can you ask for?</li>
            <li> A good product that works well.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, No issues, good purchase.</li>
            <li> Could not work for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> Works very well, I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect...light, simple and inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Sucks please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Appears to be a quality product where it counts: the cutting head. The body of the trimmer is cheap plastic similar to other products manufactured in China. Time will tell whether or not this trimmer is worth the money. For now, it does the job as well as expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent.. works well great battery life.. Nice trimmer..</li>
            <li> After 15 years my Maverick up and died so I have been on the hunt for a new trimmer. After a lot of looking and comparing I went with the Conair. After using it for a week or so I can give it the highest rating that Amazon has. Are there better trimmers on the market? Of course. Do I miss the adjustable head on the Maverick? Yes dearly. Are the attachments on the Conair somewhat confusing and take a bit of skill to use properly? Absolutely! How can I give it 5 stars? Easy, two words- eleven bucks. Yep, eleven little dollars for this puppy. It feels good in my hand, the batteries last twice as long as they did in the Maverick, and it cuts like a dream. You can&#x27;t even buy lunch for for what this costs. I cannot stand our increasingly throwaway society and I am always willing to pay a fair price for a quality product that will last, if I can find it. I expected a sketchy product when I ordered this and was thoroughly pleased when this nice quality trimmer showed up.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer. Has very sharp blade and cuts straight in seconds without any pull at all. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really love this. I would tell others about how good it works.. Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers because I owned a pair similar to them except it held 3 batteries  This one holds 2. If anyone complain about having to put batteries to often in it they need to buy good batteries for it. Don&#x27;t blame it on the clippers that does a great job!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied from the transaction and the materials received</li>
