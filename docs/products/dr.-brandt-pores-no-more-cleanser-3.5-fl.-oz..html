            <li>I love it as a daily cleanser because of how hydrating and nourishing it is.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Cleans my pores very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>very drying, helps reduce pore size but my picky combination skin was not a fan.</li>

            <li>My face is soft and pores appear much smaller.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t an imitation, it was the real thing.</li>
            <li>Before this, the only product that barely helped reduce my blackheads was the Biore ULTRA deep cleansing strips (regular Biore strips do nothing on me).   </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this face wash, this is the second one I buy already.  It cleans the skin deeply, leaving no oil.  It is a little sticky, takes a bit of extra time to rub on and wash off, so I use it mostly in the shower.  I also alternate with L´Occitane´s face foam wash, which comes off very easily but doesn´t feel as thorough as this one.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the Pores No More Pore Refiner this summer when I was experimenting with ways to cover the blackheads on my nose. After about 1 month of using this I was surprised to see that my pores became significantly smaller AND I had much fewer blackheads!! Before this, the only product that barely helped reduce my blackheads was the Biore ULTRA deep cleansing strips (regular Biore strips do nothing on me).   I used the Pores No More Pore Refiner with makeup to cover my blackheads because I had a summer job. I&#x27;m a full time student the rest of the year and normally don&#x27;t wear make up, so when I stopped using the Pore Refiner I saw that my blackheads and pores reappeared.  Because this product worked so well, I got excited and tried the Pores No More vacuum cleaner (2x/week) and Pores No More CLEANSER (every other day) for about a month, but sadly those did not remove my blackheads. They did make my pores slightly smaller though, which doesn&#x27;t mean much to me because dirt is still trapped inside.</li>
            <li> Great stuff but not as healthy for skin. Along these lines, I recently discovered [[ASIN: B00WB864Q8 Ageless Organic Cleansing Foam]], and found it is not only all-natural, but it actually improves my skin.  The apricot kernel oil smells great, and has kept my skin feeling soft, smooth, and breakout free. I love it as a daily cleanser because of how hydrating and nourishing it is. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have large pores in some areas of my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many products, but this one seems to do the best job without overdrying my skin.  My face is soft and pores appear much smaller.  I use it in conjunction with the pore vacuum cleaner and together they seem to work wonders.  I use a Clarisonic to massage this cleanser into my skin twice daily.  So far, the best results ever.  Skin appears more refined, tighter and clearer.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Works great. After about 3 days of using this product (it says use twice daily, which I did), I had noticeably clear skin. I&#x27;m fair skinned, sensitive skinned and I get very lightly oily. I do however get terrible blackheads on my nose. After a few days of using this as directed, and focusing on scrubbing it into my nose where the blackheads are, I have noticeably clearer skin. However, there are still some tiny blackheads and dirt still clogged if I look closely and it&#x27;s been about 2 months of using it. It&#x27;s better than most face washes however. Also note, I use this with Olay anti-aging detox face wash too. In combination my face looks really good. I like this product and plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> Pores No more? Try Pores Galore! This did absolutely nothing to clear my skin, it only caused more problems! And you know what? Dr. Brandt is not even  a doctor, it is a marketing scheme to make him sound distinguished. Research it! Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Love  this  product. You  will  notice  some  whiteheads  when  you  start  using  as it  is  cleaning  out  the  pores,  after a  week  your  skin  will  feel  amazing  and  it  is  not  drying  at  all. I  have  combination  skin.  I  use a cleansing  brush  in  the  shower similar  to a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a week ago and, remarkably, can already tell a difference in my skin.  I&#x27;m always a bit skeptical about claims made by cosmetic corporations, but figured since I&#x27;ve tried so many other products why not give this one a shot.  I purchased this as a set which included the PNM microdermabrasion, vacuum cleaner, and a sample of the matte lotion.  I should also say that I have tried so many high end cleansers....everything from Philosophy to Clarins to Hauschka to Clinique to Kiehls...and I really like this one the best so far.  I&#x27;m not one to typically write reviews only after a week&#x27;s worth of use, but this product has absolutely impressed me and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love the Dr. Brandt product line. The facial cleansers are great and non-drying. I hate the feeling of tightness after washing my face and you don&#x27;t get that with the Pores No More Cleanser. My pores are less noticeable. This product is great for my oily skin. I normally don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on facial products but this one is definitely worth it. Will be cleaning my face with Dr. Brandt products only from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked. Won&#x27;t ever use another product.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans my pores very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Love the way my skin feels after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes...Ouch!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed. Ulta stopped carrying this product and I was afraid I was s.o.l. but it wasn&#x27;t an imitation, it was the real thing. Also it was a little less expensive than shopping for it elsewhere. I was skeptical ordering online, but I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!!!  I have been using this for a few months now and my skin looks great.  It must be the tea tree oil!!  My face does not feel like it has a film on it and it does not feel greasy.  It just feels and looks wonderful.  Definitely a must try, must buy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only use this for about a month I really like it a lot. I definitely notice a difference.</li>
            <li> very drying, helps reduce pore size but my picky combination skin was not a fan. Back to using charcoal cleanser/sugar scrubs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several skin products as I&#x27;m now 40yrs. old. I have to say that this did nothing more than a neutrogena product, actually neutrogena was probably better.. and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old. I randomly started breaking out and went to the dermatologist multiple times. I was beginning to get so frustrated.. I&#x27;m not supposed to be breaking out at this age. My friend gave me a sample of Pores no More and I have been buying it ever since. My skin has never been more clear and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out like most cleansers do to me skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years now and I will recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use too much of it for it has a nice texture and is smooth on your face.</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time.  The container is in a tube form and not as shown on the picture.  It also odd not come Ina box.  Extremely disappointed by the packaging of this item.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this wondeful product and have reccommended it to many friends</li>
            <li> Keeps me from breakouts. But don&#x27;t get it in your eyes it will burn like hell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many things to try to get my skin clear up and this works the best! I absolutely love it.</li>
