            <li>Great choices.</li>
            <li>They are great design&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Pleased !</li>
            <li>I advise using a top coat to kind of seal them on.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of putting them on they are fabulous!</li>
            <li>Over all I’m happy and would buy them again… but don’t expect too much of them.  </li>
            <li>Love the color combo/design.</li>
            <li>I really like the bright colors, the patterns, and</li>
            <li>They were easy to use and stayed on well.  </li>
            <li>how easy they are to apply.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made..</li>
            <li>(the clear crystals patter for example could use a bottom coat of some kind of color to really pop… which kind of negates the point).  </li>
            <li>Some are really cool</li>
            <li>my daughter loved the patterns but they only lasted one day before peeling off</li>
            <li>the price is not bad either.</li>
            <li>I really love these and might buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>My girls and I are Jamberry users, so we thought this would be fun.</li>
            <li>but some are kind of childish or require extra work to make then look good</li>
            <li>it is an easy/fast way to get pretty nails.</li>
            <li>Also use a clear top coat if you want them to last longer.</li>
            <li>They worked better than I had expected, but they still only lasted for about two days.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use, go on quickly and last at least two weeks.</li>
            <li>You must put a base coat on first and make sure it is still tacky otherwise these come right off.</li>
            <li>However, for me that is normal because I am really hard on my nails (work with my hand a lot, play high impact sports, etc).  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not what my girlfriend expected.</li>
            <li> These did not even stay on one day. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My girls and I are Jamberry users, so we thought this would be fun. We were wrong. The of the nails came off while she slept and the rest came during school. It was embarrassing for her. These nails need some serious work.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t stay on well</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of putting them on they are fabulous!</li>
            <li> Product was as expected ! Pleased !</li>
            <li> I sent these to my daughter and she loves them. She doesn&#x27;t have the time or money to get manicures, being busy with two little boys. These are easy to use, go on quickly and last at least two weeks. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Great choices. Daughter loves them! Going on day 4 and just a little off the tops of nails.</li>
            <li> You must put a base coat on first and make sure it is still tacky otherwise these come right off. The Sally Hansons dont require that.</li>
            <li> They were easy to use and stayed on well.  I would say that they lasted about a week though by the end they were chipped.  However, for me that is normal because I am really hard on my nails (work with my hand a lot, play high impact sports, etc).  I am not the biggest fan of all of the patterns.  Some are really cool but some are kind of childish or require extra work to make then look good (the clear crystals patter for example could use a bottom coat of some kind of color to really pop… which kind of negates the point).  Over all I’m happy and would buy them again… but don’t expect too much of them.  Also use a clear top coat if you want them to last longer.</li>
            <li> They worked better than I had expected, but they still only lasted for about two days. (One came off within a matter of minutes.)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even last 24 hours before peeling and coming off my nail.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stick well.  I bought these for my daughter and within an hour, one of them already tore off.  I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Love the color combo/design. it is an easy/fast way to get pretty nails. the price is not bad either.</li>
            <li> my daughter loved the patterns but they only lasted one day before peeling off</li>
            <li> These are horrible!! Don&#x27;t waste your money. Cheaply made..</li>
            <li> For the price these aren&#x27;t bad. They are great design&#x27;s. They only lasted about 3-4 days but I had tried a really expensive brand and they didn&#x27;t even last 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I really love these and might buy more in the future. I really like the bright colors, the patterns, and how easy they are to apply. I advise using a top coat to kind of seal them on.</li>
