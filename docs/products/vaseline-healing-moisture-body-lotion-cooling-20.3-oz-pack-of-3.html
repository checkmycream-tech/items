            <li>but the fragrance is too strong.</li>
            <li>Basically I think there is no need for cologne when using this, which I dislike since I have a strong nose</li>
            <li>So the lotion is fine.  </li>
            <li>That for me is like getting one for free.</li>
            <li>I found on Amazon with this sweet deal 3 full sized  bottles for 16 bucks.</li>
            <li>it calms down after about 10 minutes and leaves a very nice, light cologne scent..</li>
            <li>a mild to medium burning sensation in the eyeballs.</li>

            <li>I am currently on my high school&#x27;s basketball team, and since i am one of the tallest in our league, i play mostly the whole game.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something unexpected and I worry that the ingredients to the scent will cause an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>All man no fluff.</li>
            <li>One of the main active ingredients is Menthol which will cause your dickhole to feel like it&#x27;s on fire.  </li>

            <li> Living in a dry desert environment it seems like my skin is always dry</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin and this lotion was a mistake.  </li>
            <li> It has a great aroma, but falls on the worst lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Greasier then i expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing bad, smells clean, but if you are looking for something unscented this may bother you.</li>
            <li> All deodorants I have tried with the same scent have caused a serious inflammation.    </li>
            <li> I am not sure how to explain it exactly or what to compare it to, sorry.</li>
            <li> The lotion does carry a little bit of fragrance, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Hydration\\&quot; is very hard to find in my local area and that gets very frustrating especially when you like the cent of the lotion.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I learned the hard way.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I had a real bad sunburn a long time ago and thought that the tingling was left over from that sunburn.  </li>
            <li> but he&#x27;s been unable to find it since.  </li>
            <li> so I knew we couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Greasier then i expected. I work with alcohol all day so i use alot of this during work hours.  After more then one application it starts to feel heavy. I think i would buy another type of the vaseline mens lotion since its the only brand i use.</li>
            <li> The Men&#x27;s Lotion for Men is Great. Since I am a teen I don&#x27;t have a problem with the scent like another reviewer does. I am currently on my high school&#x27;s basketball team, and since i am one of the tallest in our league, i play mostly the whole game. Before this, my arms and face felt so overheated, and since i am on jv, i have to wait for varsity to be done on away games. This lotion cools your skin very quickly. A little bit is safe for the face. Like the reviewer said it does have a cologne smell to it, but the ingredients do say that it contains fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: this lotion is very good but I am starting to have a problem with the scent. It works well but the fragrance is too strong. DO NOT APPLY to the face unless you would like a mild to medium burning sensation in the eyeballs. this is caused by the smell. Imagine the Vicks Vapor rub sensation you get in the nose but in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with this lotion.  It has a nice cooling effect and soaks into your skin quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Even though I am a woman of 46 years, I sometimes purchase men&#x27;s products because sometimes I tend to think that they receive better skin care than us women do.  Just my own way of thinking, I guess.  Well, I bought this product at my local department store because I had this tingling on the right side of my lower jawline.  Every product that I would try would just take it away temporarily.  What caught my eye about this product was that it said it was for overheated skin.  Anyway, I had a real bad sunburn a long time ago and thought that the tingling was left over from that sunburn.  A bottle of this lotion was left open on the store shelf so I tried a sample on my jaw where it was tingling.  It stopped immediately.  I felt so much better to the extent that I actually bought a bottle.  I have been using it ever since and the tingling is gone on my jaw with this product.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has a similar problem like I had.  Also, when it is applied to the skin, it feels like it pulls the heat from your skin to the surface and cools it.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with this lotion... not a greasy feeling and absorbs quickly. Nice manly scent to it as well...</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion. Vaseline is a good good brand and it does what it says it will do keep my skin moisturized. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> So the lotion is fine.  I like it alot though its more of a lotion than I expected.  I was expecting a thicker petroleum jelly like substance but that was foolish.    My problem is the smell.  It has a very strong cologne smell in it.  Basically I think there is no need for cologne when using this, which I dislike since I have a strong nose and the scent is not what I would use anyway.  It&#x27;s something unexpected and I worry that the ingredients to the scent will cause an allergic reaction.  All deodorants I have tried with the same scent have caused a serious inflammation.    Also.  To any men who use lotion for recreational use, DO NOT BUY THIS.  I used it successfully during some southerly grooming(honest it was just grooming), for which it is effective.  However, the cooling sensation is akin to aftershave, which is why I think it has such a strong odor.  It&#x27;s the universal odor of aftershave.</li>
            <li> it came in a package of 3, but I am forwarding 2 as part of a gift basket...I did keep one for my son, which I opened. the scent is very strong when u first apply it, but don&#x27;t worry! it calms down after about 10 minutes and leaves a very nice, light cologne scent..I will purchase again :)</li>
            <li> This lotion works great and really hydrates the skin. It also smells amazing sometimes I forget to put on cologne and it just smells magnificant. Combined with Cologne seems even better no matter what cologne you use. Smell good and keep your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had ranted and raved about this lotion since he first purchased a bottle several months ago,  but he&#x27;s been unable to find it since.  I found on Amazon with this sweet deal 3 full sized  bottles for 16 bucks. He&#x27;s very happy and just loves that cooling feeling that this lotion provides.&lt;br /&gt;I have been tempted to see what it feels like but....I don&#x27;t want to smell like a dude. So,  he will have to enjoy it for both of us!</li>
            <li> It was everything I had hoped for,  It is a great lotion for young boys and men of all ages.</li>
            <li> have not used yet but i am planning on using this a lot, plenty of product for the price, thanks.</li>
            <li> The lotion works fine but leaves my hands kind of greasy which I don&#x27;t like.  Anyone who is thinking about using this product as a lubricant for his private parts must NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.  One of the main active ingredients is Menthol which will cause your dickhole to feel like it&#x27;s on fire.  Trust me, I learned the hard way.  Hope this helped.</li>
            <li> Vaseline makes a good product so I knew we couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion. It is very cool when applied so I think my husband will like using it during warmer months.</li>
            <li> I recently started using body lotion, and tried this brand at a friends house. I instantly fell in love with this stuff! Great cooling feeling when 1st applied, I also think the consistency is is perfect, with a little going a long way. The lotion does carry a little bit of fragrance, but not overpowering. All and all, a light, cooling lotion to get your day going!</li>
            <li> i like it. It has a nice effect on the skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this three pack of Vaseline Men&#x27;s Cooling Hydration Body Lotion 20.3 ounce each. I have to tell you the Blue labeled \\&quot;Cooling Hydration\\&quot; is very hard to find in my local area and that gets very frustrating especially when you like the cent of the lotion. As always I was able to find it listed on Amazon and it was in a pack of three for the price of two in my local grocery store. That for me is like getting one for free. In todays economy, that is a deal by any ones standards! It is a real good deal.</li>
            <li> Men also need something to keep their skin from falling off.  It&#x27;s nice to have something that will do that but not leave you smelling like a fruit salad!</li>
            <li> Like the title says. All man no fluff. Does what a man need no extra gimmicks. Especially efficient after you apply it right after a hot shower or washing your hands with warm water.</li>
            <li> The Vaseline body lotion is one of my all time favorites now. Living in a dry desert environment it seems like my skin is always dry so lotions are mandatory. The only thing I would warn you of is that the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; version of the lotion does have a scent. I am not sure how to explain it exactly or what to compare it to, sorry. It&#x27;s nothing bad, smells clean, but if you are looking for something unscented this may bother you. Otherwise its a great body lotion and along with the rest of the Vaseline lotion lineup - one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Good value.</li>
            <li> It would be preferable the 33 OZ bottles. it is the best moisturizer for men that I have ever tried</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin and this lotion was a mistake.  It has a great aroma, but falls on the worst lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  I do hope they change their ingredient for next generations on this product.</li>
            <li> The cooling isn&#x27;t too powerful on the hands, but on the rest of the body it feels great.  For the package of 3 of them you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprise!  It also smells freakin amazing!</li>
