            <li>Highlights are perfect,  easy to wear and care for only problem</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice and full.</li>
            <li>Since my cancer surgery I have ordered this wig several times and find it to be comfortable and attractive, in fact nobody knows it&#x27;s a wig!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this in the mail as I am not to happy about my own short hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to play with it more.</li>
            <li>This is a beautifully made wig, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>beautiful central part.  </li>
            <li>this is not how I would have liked to started out with my first one.</li>
            <li>They couldn&#x27;t believe it was so inexpensive and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The color was very close to my own hair.</li>
            <li>Fantastic quality.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, with slight exception of stitching around the part in the top.</li>
            <li>Ultra soft, highlights are amazing.</li>
            <li>It is not for cool winter coloring.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than the real thing.</li>
            <li>so much I may just wear it for the heck of it!!</li>
            <li>The little hilights are great.</li>
            <li>fit my head very well.</li>
            <li>The price is good, infact I have been able to purchasse several for I initiallypaid and a local store.  </li>
            <li>it took 3 weeks to arrive, but so worth the wait.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>everyone loved the hair so much and the high lights really helped make it look real.</li>
            <li>I ended up wearing it to work just for fun and did not get hot in it</li>
            <li>Thick and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Very nice wig for the price if you don&#x27;t mind the part, and only short layers showing in the front.</li>
            <li>It looks very real.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experiment buying a wig</li>
            <li>This  is my first wig ever</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Enjoy this wig, I do, certaintly until my hair grows back.  </li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>I did not receive the free wig cap as it has caption in the description box above.</li>
            <li>No one but an analyst could tell this is fiber and not the real thing.</li>
            <li>overall still fabulous.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to wear and light as far as weight considering there is so much hair...very thick.</li>
            <li>So in conclusion, I would not recommend this particular wig to anyone who has never owned one,  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>Nothing I have done really has been able to get past that con of the wig.</li>
            <li>This wig may be okay with a hat but is very fake looking other wise.</li>
            <li>I bought this to wear for a costume party as a 2nd choice, and I was surprised to see how real this wig is.</li>
            <li>so you can clearly tell it&#x27;s a wig.  </li>
            <li>I will recommend this to anyone who wants to look classy lady the only problem wasthe hair l received is way lighter than what was anticipating for in the picture...</li>
            <li>when I wear it, it totally looks real.</li>
            <li>The only thing is,  I highly recommend that you order wig clips that u can sew  on inside to keep it idle and not move around on your head.  </li>
            <li>This wig was much nicer than expected.  </li>
            <li>On an average size person, it is much shorter than it appears on the mannequin.</li>
            <li>#4, last complaint,  the hair line in the front completely gives it away and in no way does it look natural &amp; real.</li>

            <li> unfortunately it a litthe to thick of fabric</li>
            <li> it was extremely thick and poofy &amp; looked way to fake because of it.</li>
            <li> but I am afraid that may make it look worse.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on how to adjust and fix wigs,  after cutting, removing some of the tracks and tons of sewing,  </li>
            <li> I thought about cutting bangs</li>
            <li> As others have said, the part is very fake looking.</li>
            <li> It is very fake looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve warn this unit out twice and felt very uncomfortable in it</li>

            <li> I agree with the other review. I just received this wig and it look good with a hat . But it look ugly and super fake by itself. I also comes with a ugly zigzag line in the middle of wig!</li>
            <li> This is a beautifully made wig, especially for the price. I love how well it fits and stays on without any clips. I wore it to work today and received raving reviews from my coworkers! They couldn&#x27;t believe it was so inexpensive and comfortable. I&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing more!</li>
            <li> This was my first experiment buying a wig and I love it! It has a very real feel, very nice and I&#x27;m excited to play with it more.</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear for a costume party as a 2nd choice, and I was surprised to see how real this wig is. Ultra soft, highlights are amazing. Perfect lenght &amp; shade of blonde. I ended up wearing this instead. I am not an expert on this, But i have to say this hair is definitely a Pro. No Cons. Thank you.</li>
            <li> What a beautiful wig! It arrived on time as well. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Since my cancer surgery I have ordered this wig several times and find it to be comfortable and attractive, in fact nobody knows it&#x27;s a wig! It is too long for me so I do cut it shorter, and can cut it to make bangs.  The hair feels very nice and I like the color, it&#x27;s not so brown, it has a combo of a flaxen shade. The price is good, infact I have been able to purchasse several for I initiallypaid and a local store.  I would recommend this for those that need an affordable and nice looking head of hair.  (my only problem is mine but I have tried what others suggested to prevent frizz after a while to no avail.  If anyone has a good idea let me know).  Enjoy this wig, I do, certaintly until my hair grows back.  It sure is easier than to fix your own hair everyday!&lt;br /&gt;glenda Kottsick</li>
            <li> This wig was much nicer than expected.  I used for costume and received many compliments.  The color was very close to my own hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig. Even MORE gorgeous than the photo. Highlights are perfect,  easy to wear and care for only problem I  think is that the front is parted way to tight, limiting the possible numbers of styles.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the part is very fake looking. The color is beautiful, but for a fall or spring skin color. It is not for cool winter coloring. The cut is nice. On an average size person, it is much shorter than it appears on the mannequin. Also, notice that all the hair is combed from the back to the front for the picture. This is definitely a shag haircut. Very nice wig for the price if you don&#x27;t mind the part, and only short layers showing in the front. If you purchase you will constantly be asked for a review of the product.</li>
            <li> Did not meet expectations. I was deeply disappointed at the color shading and it looks cheap...you get what you pay for I guess...</li>
            <li> wow, this is an amazing wig!!!! it&#x27;s nice and full. color is gorgeous, highlights so well done! the texture is perfect, not too fine or vise versa. when I wear it, it totally looks real. and the part is zigzag, totally cute. it took 3 weeks to arrive, but so worth the wait.</li>
            <li> it takes time to get it delivered but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  beautiful central part.  fit my head very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to give it a 5 because I am not happy with the hair line at the forhead. unfortunately it a litthe to thick of fabric so you can clearly tell it&#x27;s a wig.  other than that though I love it. there was very little shedding and the hair was much fuller than the pictures.  everyone loved the hair so much and the high lights really helped make it look real. although my heads a little smaller than the cap of the wig so there was a bit of space in between my head the wig. but no one can no one can notice that so I was not worried. it is adjustable too so you can make it tighter or looser if needed. also it breathes really well I ended up wearing it to work just for fun and did not get hot in it</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this in the mail as I am not to happy about my own short hair. This  is my first wig ever and here&#x27;s how it went.  #1 I did not receive the free wig cap as it has caption in the description box above. #2 it was extremely thick and poofy &amp; looked way to fake because of it. #3 the wig itself was like 3 sizes to big for my head. #4, last complaint,  the hair line in the front completely gives it away and in no way does it look natural &amp; real. So after getting so discouraged and not wanting to give up because I love the length &amp;  highlights  I did a lot of research on how to adjust and fix wigs,  after cutting, removing some of the tracks and tons of sewing,  I think I have finally got it wearable.  The only thing is,  I highly recommend that you order wig clips that u can sew  on inside to keep it idle and not move around on your head.  It would literally fall off mine every time I would look up. So in conclusion, I would not recommend this particular wig to anyone who has never owned one,  this is not how I would have liked to started out with my first one.</li>
            <li> I think the wig is excellent.  It looks very real.  My kids didn&#x27;t even notice.</li>
            <li> Awesome and beautiful wig</li>
            <li> Love this wig!! Bought for a halloween costume but I like it so much I may just wear it for the heck of it!!</li>
            <li> Love the cut of this unit, the color is beautiful. It is very comfortable to wear and light as far as weight considering there is so much hair...very thick. The only down side to this week is the hairline. It is very fake looking. It lookes good with a cute hat or a scarf. Nothing I have done really has been able to get past that con of the wig. I thought about cutting bangs but I am afraid that may make it look worse. I&#x27;ve warn this unit out twice and felt very uncomfortable in it so I washed it and put it up. Maybe someone else would have better luck with it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my granddaughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Got it today n love it. The little hilights are great. Fits great look great. One of the better synthetic wigs I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present. It was a hit.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality. Thick and beautiful. No one but an analyst could tell this is fiber and not the real thing. I think it&#x27;s better than the real thing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. Feels amazing . This stays on,very comfortable, looks just like mY own hair. Thank you so much for this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;It did not come with a cap but that is OK I ordered a different one and it came with one.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product . Thank you again.</li>
            <li> This wig may be okay with a hat but is very fake looking other wise.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, with slight exception of stitching around the part in the top.</li>
            <li> Very elegant and stylish...I will recommend this to anyone who wants to look classy lady the only problem wasthe hair l received is way lighter than what was anticipating for in the picture...overall still fabulous.</li>
