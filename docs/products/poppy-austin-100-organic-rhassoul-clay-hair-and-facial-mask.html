            <li>My skin has never felt so clean!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff..makes my skin feel clean and soft..just dont keep it on for more than the instructions say.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for a good result here</li>
            <li>This really is a good product, but frankly, I like the clay masks that are ready to apply without all the fuss.</li>
            <li>It washes out of your hair easily and from your skin with ease.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything,  and hands down this is the best!  </li>
            <li>This clay is smooth and easy to mix.</li>
            <li>I use the 100% pure Poppy Austin Rose Water instead of water.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial mask.</li>
            <li>I want to start off by saying, I have not been paid nor did I receive this product for free.</li>
            <li>They mix smoothly together and do not drip like some preparations.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a mask that applied evenly and smoothly; this product doesn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li>The most amazing part to me was being able to look in the mirror and actually SEEING OIL AND SEBUM PULLED OUT OF MY PORES.</li>
            <li>It is the best mask I have ever used, and makes my skin feel firm and radiant.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been great, but recently the texture, clarity, and firmness of it</li>
            <li>Very nice for facial and even body mask.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel clean and smooth without drying it out.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin which turns lobster red with almost all products, but inflammation is gone with this mask - wonderful.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel nice after use, but I was hoping for more, especially for this price tag.</li>
            <li>Best thing to use when you just want to keep it natural and simple.  </li>
            <li>I would not buy again just because I need to mix it before use it, and need to clean up after.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week, and when ever going out for something special.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years young &amp; loving my journey.</li>
            <li>I LOVE what it does to my skin so much that i can get over the difficulty of applying/taking it off.</li>
            <li>This exquisite all natural and organic detoxifying clay is unique in its composition, quality and purity; It is meticulously selected from ancient mineral-rich deposits, found deep within the fertile Atlas Mountains, and contains 100% pure Rhassoul; NEVER tested on animals and free from parabens, fragrances, additives and alcohol&lt;</li>
            <li>This mask makes your skin feel so soft, and it&#x27;s great to know it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>I love natural, but I&#x27;d rather have a smooth, cooling, calming type face mask</li>
            <li>My new favorite -</li>
            <li>(On face and neck) Goes on very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, the packaging was secure, and the shipping was timely.</li>
            <li>I try different natural products and I feel natural is the best way to go.</li>
            <li>The mask is helping to reduce and clear pores for more refined nourished skin.  </li>
            <li>but I figured with amazons generous return policy it would be worth the risk.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with the rose water.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It definitely pulls out all the impurities and I mix it with the rose water for an even healthier glow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used biore facial mask before and liked the price and the results.</li>
            <li>STUNNING RESULTS - You can expect a buttery soft, smooth and toned skin complexion, free from dryness, blemishes, blackheads and blocked pores; Your hair will feel light, manageable and conditioned, with curls defined and frizz controlled; Eczema, psoriasis, and acne are treated and calmed without stripping your skin of essential natural oils</li>
            <li>After the first application I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>THanks!</li>
            <li>I just used this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Applying it every night is my favorite part of the entire day.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, moisturized, and smooth after each use.</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, even after using prescription skin treatments, I wake up in the morning</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than this tiny criticism, I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 40s with the fabulous combination of acne prone, oily T-zone, and aging skin.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly as described.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I am not using it right, but the whole process of application to taking it off is a pain in the</li>
            <li>night I mixed this product with my rose oil toner to make a mask and WOW!</li>
            <li>Once it comes off, my skin is soft, glowing, clean, etc.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft and clean.</li>
            <li>mother used to show me how to put on masks and other moisture products but this product is far superior.</li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft and smooth from the very first time I used it as a face mask, and actually soothed and purified my skin instead of causing it to freak out!  </li>
            <li>It is an amazing product and the only facial clay I use now.</li>
            <li>and I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>It really pulls out dirt and tightens your pores.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this mask made my face feel.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel much difference after</li>
            <li>Will absolutely purchase this product again from this vendor.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my daugther and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>The clay is so soothing, gentle, and calming.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, I use just under a tsp and add water until I like the consistency.  </li>
            <li>Nothing I had tried really worked until I tried this product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I don&#x27;t enjoy putting it on.  </li>
            <li>have issues with a itchy, flaky scalp and this has really helped.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Really tightened my pores.</li>
            <li>It finally formed a smooth mask.</li>
            <li>but it tightened my pores and really reduced my impurities.</li>
            <li>I only recently found Poppy Rose brand.</li>
            <li>The second time I tried it, I mixed it with the Poppy Austin Rose Water.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just not crazy about clay masks in general though (first time to try one).  </li>
            <li>Then I came upon this Rhassoul Clay which I used as a facial, and after one treatment, it was obvious that this clay has superior minerals and actual power to clean, extract, and mke your facial skin alive, glowing healthy, plumper, and younger.</li>
            <li>Well, when I first used it and was honestly amazed when I put it on and the feeling of the clay slowly drying and pulling on my pores and skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s excellent quality and seems to be having the same clearing and brightening effect on my skin as the other much more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>For me the less chemicals the better.</li>
            <li>It removed a lot of dry dead skin and made my face clear and moist and made me more handsome.  </li>
            <li>They had just cleverly changed the spelling to rasul</li>
            <li>Enjoy using natural products especially when they work.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest using both products.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product 100%.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Mizfit</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>✔ PURE AND NATURAL -</li>
            <li>big difference even after the first use!  </li>
            <li>My complexion has definitely improved (soft, even skin tone, clean pores).</li>
            <li>My clogged pores are becoming less and less the more I use it.</li>
            <li>It is most definitely harsh on sensitive skin and very drying.</li>
            <li>Then I apply it to my clean skin and let it dry into a mask for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and it made styling my hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is most definitely Not for older women or for people with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li>I mix it with about an equal amount of water and add a little splash of rose water</li>
            <li>like trying new products and</li>
            <li>so I had to  abandon the face care regiment I&#x27;d had for years and figure out how to address my new issues.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended to those have mature skin texture</li>
            <li>Our Spa grade Rhassoul Clay is a versatile and multi-purpose daily cleanser that can also be used as a detoxifying face mask, skin conditioner and hair restoration treatment; It delivers one of the world&#x27;s most powerful deep pore facials WITHOUT harsh chemicals, and can be applied daily to even the most dry, flaky and sensitive skin&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Never irritates my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>They are what they say they are, natural!</li>
            <li>I have rosacea prone and dry skin but not so much anymore!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was any different in quality than the brand I previously used</li>
            <li>Not only were most of my black heads disappearing</li>
            <li>after 40+ years the large pores in my nose have finally disappeared!!!!</li>
            <li>I really like this product doe, This product is a little pricey ,its worth its price its expiration.</li>
            <li>- Simply mix with a little water to create a smooth creamy texture, then glide effortlessly over your face, neck and hair as desired; Within seconds, you will feel a gentle tightening, as the intense detoxification begins to absorb impurities and harmful substances, cleansing deep into your pores to restore firmness and elasticity&lt;</li>
            <li>I have 4a natural hair and using just this</li>
            <li>✔ FAST ACTING</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t return to a soft mixture.</li>
            <li>So far I have used this as a face mask twice and will be adding this to my regimen when I do my hair treatment.</li>
            <li>My nine year old even noticed</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t take much of this Rhassoul clay to make the facial with a bit of the rosewater.  </li>
            <li>until I know how it reacts with my sensitive</li>
            <li>The skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>I use it in my natural hair care regimen.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin clear, soft and smells delish with the Rosé Water from Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li>The tiniest change in my skin care regimen could make my skin completely freak out (hives, rash, breakouts, burning,</li>
            <li>Rhassoul clay is a natural anti-inflammatory, so redness and swelling are completely gone after use.</li>
            <li>When I go to wash it off, I can&#x27;t wash it off fast enough, it&#x27;s so itchy.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise and delight, WOW.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this a few times, however I love it.</li>
            <li>On my face, it definitely cleans my pores and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth but not tight or dried out.</li>
            <li>Their giving back to the less fortunate through every order has me sold for life.</li>
            <li>It goes on gritty and not smooth, has a subtle dirt smell (which I guess is to be expected), not the prettiest color, when it dries I feel the tightening which is awesome</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and it absorbed the oil leaving my skin less shiney.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin soft, and my pores are actually smaller!</li>
            <li>The mask tingles and pulls really tight when it&#x27;s in the final drying stage which freaked me out the first time, but now I look forward to it!</li>
            <li>First time I tried the hair mask, 75% less frizz and barely any tangles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it as a facial mask so far</li>
            <li>A little expensive for body, but it really softens and kind of tones that skin up too.  </li>
            <li>You only need a little bit of water to create a lot of mask, so this product will definitely last a while and is worth the price.</li>
            <li>After my first few times I can tell you</li>
            <li>Instead, it separates into little mud-chunks that make a HUGE MESS in your sink.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve discovered that you&#x27;ve made too much, I don&#x27;t recommend trying to apply a little extra to your face, I would try to store it in an airtight container or just throw it</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of adding a little too much water to the clay but will start with a smaller amount of water next time.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My skin has never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff..makes my skin feel clean and soft..just dont keep it on for more than the instructions say.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a good result here</li>
            <li> This really is a good product, but frankly, I like the clay masks that are ready to apply without all the fuss.</li>
            <li> It washes out of your hair easily and from your skin with ease.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything,  and hands down this is the best!  </li>
            <li> This clay is smooth and easy to mix.</li>
            <li> I use the 100% pure Poppy Austin Rose Water instead of water.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial mask.</li>
            <li> I want to start off by saying, I have not been paid nor did I receive this product for free.</li>
            <li> They mix smoothly together and do not drip like some preparations.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a mask that applied evenly and smoothly; this product doesn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> The most amazing part to me was being able to look in the mirror and actually SEEING OIL AND SEBUM PULLED OUT OF MY PORES.</li>
            <li> It is the best mask I have ever used, and makes my skin feel firm and radiant.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been great, but recently the texture, clarity, and firmness of it</li>
            <li> Very nice for facial and even body mask.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel clean and smooth without drying it out.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin which turns lobster red with almost all products, but inflammation is gone with this mask - wonderful.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel nice after use, but I was hoping for more, especially for this price tag.</li>
            <li> Best thing to use when you just want to keep it natural and simple.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy again just because I need to mix it before use it, and need to clean up after.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week, and when ever going out for something special.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years young &amp; loving my journey.</li>
            <li> I LOVE what it does to my skin so much that i can get over the difficulty of applying/taking it off.</li>

            <li> I try different natural products and I feel natural is the best way to go.</li>
            <li> The mask is helping to reduce and clear pores for more refined nourished skin.  </li>
            <li> but I figured with amazons generous return policy it would be worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with the rose water.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It definitely pulls out all the impurities and I mix it with the rose water for an even healthier glow.  </li>

            <li> THanks!</li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Applying it every night is my favorite part of the entire day.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, moisturized, and smooth after each use.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, even after using prescription skin treatments, I wake up in the morning</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than this tiny criticism, I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s with the fabulous combination of acne prone, oily T-zone, and aging skin.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly as described.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I am not using it right, but the whole process of application to taking it off is a pain in the</li>
            <li> night I mixed this product with my rose oil toner to make a mask and WOW!</li>
            <li> Once it comes off, my skin is soft, glowing, clean, etc.</li>
            <li> It made my hair really soft and clean.</li>
            <li> mother used to show me how to put on masks and other moisture products but this product is far superior.</li>
            <li> It made my skin so soft and smooth from the very first time I used it as a face mask, and actually soothed and purified my skin instead of causing it to freak out!  </li>
            <li> It is an amazing product and the only facial clay I use now.</li>
            <li> and I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> It really pulls out dirt and tightens your pores.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this mask made my face feel.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel much difference after</li>
            <li> Will absolutely purchase this product again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daugther and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> The clay is so soothing, gentle, and calming.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, I use just under a tsp and add water until I like the consistency.  </li>
            <li> Nothing I had tried really worked until I tried this product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I don&#x27;t enjoy putting it on.  </li>
            <li> have issues with a itchy, flaky scalp and this has really helped.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Really tightened my pores.</li>
            <li> It finally formed a smooth mask.</li>
            <li> but it tightened my pores and really reduced my impurities.</li>
            <li> I only recently found Poppy Rose brand.</li>
            <li> The second time I tried it, I mixed it with the Poppy Austin Rose Water.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not crazy about clay masks in general though (first time to try one).  </li>
            <li> Then I came upon this Rhassoul Clay which I used as a facial, and after one treatment, it was obvious that this clay has superior minerals and actual power to clean, extract, and mke your facial skin alive, glowing healthy, plumper, and younger.</li>
            <li> Well, when I first used it and was honestly amazed when I put it on and the feeling of the clay slowly drying and pulling on my pores and skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s excellent quality and seems to be having the same clearing and brightening effect on my skin as the other much more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> For me the less chemicals the better.</li>
            <li> It removed a lot of dry dead skin and made my face clear and moist and made me more handsome.  </li>
            <li> They had just cleverly changed the spelling to rasul</li>
            <li> Enjoy using natural products especially when they work.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest using both products.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product 100%.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Mizfit</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ✔ PURE AND NATURAL -</li>
            <li> big difference even after the first use!  </li>
            <li> My complexion has definitely improved (soft, even skin tone, clean pores).</li>
            <li> My clogged pores are becoming less and less the more I use it.</li>
            <li> It is most definitely harsh on sensitive skin and very drying.</li>
            <li> Then I apply it to my clean skin and let it dry into a mask for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and it made styling my hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is most definitely Not for older women or for people with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> I mix it with about an equal amount of water and add a little splash of rose water</li>
            <li> like trying new products and</li>
            <li> so I had to  abandon the face care regiment I&#x27;d had for years and figure out how to address my new issues.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended to those have mature skin texture</li>
            <li> Our Spa grade Rhassoul Clay is a versatile and multi-purpose daily cleanser that can also be used as a detoxifying face mask, skin conditioner and hair restoration treatment; It delivers one of the world&#x27;s most powerful deep pore facials WITHOUT harsh chemicals, and can be applied daily to even the most dry, flaky and sensitive skin&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Never irritates my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> They are what they say they are, natural!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea prone and dry skin but not so much anymore!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was any different in quality than the brand I previously used</li>
            <li> Not only were most of my black heads disappearing</li>
            <li> after 40+ years the large pores in my nose have finally disappeared!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product doe, This product is a little pricey ,its worth its price its expiration.</li>
            <li> - Simply mix with a little water to create a smooth creamy texture, then glide effortlessly over your face, neck and hair as desired; Within seconds, you will feel a gentle tightening, as the intense detoxification begins to absorb impurities and harmful substances, cleansing deep into your pores to restore firmness and elasticity&lt;</li>
            <li> I have 4a natural hair and using just this</li>
            <li> ✔ FAST ACTING</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t return to a soft mixture.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this as a face mask twice and will be adding this to my regimen when I do my hair treatment.</li>
            <li> My nine year old even noticed</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t take much of this Rhassoul clay to make the facial with a bit of the rosewater.  </li>
            <li> until I know how it reacts with my sensitive</li>
            <li> The skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> I use it in my natural hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin clear, soft and smells delish with the Rosé Water from Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li> The tiniest change in my skin care regimen could make my skin completely freak out (hives, rash, breakouts, burning,</li>
            <li> Rhassoul clay is a natural anti-inflammatory, so redness and swelling are completely gone after use.</li>
            <li> When I go to wash it off, I can&#x27;t wash it off fast enough, it&#x27;s so itchy.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise and delight, WOW.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times, however I love it.</li>
            <li> On my face, it definitely cleans my pores and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth but not tight or dried out.</li>
            <li> Their giving back to the less fortunate through every order has me sold for life.</li>
            <li> It goes on gritty and not smooth, has a subtle dirt smell (which I guess is to be expected), not the prettiest color, when it dries I feel the tightening which is awesome</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and it absorbed the oil leaving my skin less shiney.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin soft, and my pores are actually smaller!</li>
            <li> The mask tingles and pulls really tight when it&#x27;s in the final drying stage which freaked me out the first time, but now I look forward to it!</li>
            <li> First time I tried the hair mask, 75% less frizz and barely any tangles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it as a facial mask so far</li>
            <li> A little expensive for body, but it really softens and kind of tones that skin up too.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little bit of water to create a lot of mask, so this product will definitely last a while and is worth the price.</li>
            <li> After my first few times I can tell you</li>
            <li> Instead, it separates into little mud-chunks that make a HUGE MESS in your sink.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve discovered that you&#x27;ve made too much, I don&#x27;t recommend trying to apply a little extra to your face, I would try to store it in an airtight container or just throw it</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of adding a little too much water to the clay but will start with a smaller amount of water next time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Rhassoul Clay is a little pricier than the other clay I saw on Amazon, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem possible, but due to the natural electromagnetic charge of the mineral-rich clay, the positively-charged toxins in my skin were actually being pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> FULLY GUARANTEED - Try Poppy Austin&#x27;s 100% pure Rhassoul Clay for 3 months; If you&#x27;re not completely in love with the product, we&#x27;ll refund your money under our ★ 90 day money back manufacturer&#x27;s guarantee ★</li>
            <li> know that may sound dramatic, but after feeling like my face was being burned off every time I applied my prescriptions, it was like a miracle cure to put the rhassoul clay on my face and have it FEEL</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, less red around my cystic acne, several bumps have diminished, it is soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I had such a bad reaction to both products and was completely hopeless about ever having smooth, clear</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve lived in the tropics the last 30 years and had dry skin</li>
            <li> mix a teaspoon of the clay with a splash of water in a bowl (enough to form a loose paste).</li>
            <li> After buying another brand of mask for several years that was double the cost of this and about half the size I found out that rhassoul clay and water were its only ingredients!</li>
            <li> I recommend that you wash it off before it is totally dry especially if you have dry skin and moisturize after you wash.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it leave my oily breakout pone skin glowing, it also healed my dry cracking hands (from the dry winter)!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is extremely sensitive, and I typically used to wake up every single morning with breakouts.</li>
            <li> When it dried it tightened up my pores and made my skin incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> I have been having a problem with blackheads for a long time.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time to dry on your face.</li>
            <li> also tried using it as a hair masque, it did nothing but make my hair extreamly dry.</li>
            <li> Then I wash it off and pat my skin dry.</li>
            <li> the clay begins to dry, you can feel your skin tingling and tightening.</li>
            <li> and I do not have a single breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes a mess in the shower when you take it off but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I also like how this mask left my pore tight.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with a few ayurvedic powders, conditioner, and oils.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no idea where to start looking and</li>
            <li> Then, wiped it off with a wet towel and was amazed at the smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Just too rough for me, maybe....</li>
            <li> I had and still do have a difficult time getting it to the right consistency to put on my face rather than to crumble into the sink, without wasting it.  </li>
            <li> One last point is that 1 application uses very little of the product</li>
            <li> I use it every other day &amp; it has helped me with the never ending fight of pores.  </li>
            <li> It made my face brighter and no more red spots.</li>
            <li> and so I don&#x27;t usually use a lot of facial products or enhancements.  </li>
            <li> Threw away all my other hair products.  </li>
            <li> You only need a very little (less than a teaspoon) each day.</li>
            <li> times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Google, I researched and researched and finally bought this clay hoping for okay but expecting the worst.  </li>
            <li> It became a mess of stains and clumps.</li>
            <li> had previously been using harsh chemicals on my face to combat acne.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my skin is smoother.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of paying almost $50 for a tiny tube</li>
            <li> , once you get it on and it hardens, it is a MESS to take off!</li>
            <li> Extremely costly and completely messy and very hard to wash off.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, but I was very disappointed that it had no mixing instructions at all.</li>
            <li> It is hard to rinse off however.  </li>
            <li> The environment is so hard on our faces.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my biggest complaint.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After spending $500 on prescription skin treatments and having the worst reactions along with scary side effects, this small but mighty jar of clay is my miracle cure.</li>
            <li> At least that is what my wife said..!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying to have to mix it up with water yourself, and at the beginning I wasted a LOT of product.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> almost everything causes my face to erupt angrily.  </li>
            <li> Did not enjoy using it but hate returning items.</li>
            <li> Having never used this type product it is very difficult to fugure out what measurements you use!</li>

            <li> I did not care for this clay. #1) It is a powder so you have to mix it with water yourself. #2) It took a very long time to dry on your face. #3) It did nothing for any blackheads I had around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using it as a hair masque, it did nothing but make my hair extreamly dry. I was really hoping for a good result here but it was not the case!</li>
            <li> Excellent on tightening the skin.  Even better if you use Rose Water to form to paste then apply on yr face.  I use Organic Bulgarian Rose Water to mix.  After I applied the mask on my face,  I felt it began tighten immediately.  Highly recommended to those have mature skin texture</li>
            <li> This is a great facial mask. My skin has never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> I like this product and would order it again.  I like being able to mix it myself and my skin felt marvelous after I used it.  I have not tried it on my hair yet.</li>

There are so many conflicting claims, I should have known better. This stuff is most definitely Not for older women or for people with dry skin or eczema. It is most definitely harsh on sensitive skin and very drying. I bought this because of the claims, buyer beware</li>
            <li> Best mask ever!  Cleans my pores like nothing else. Works great with my Rose Water!!!</li>
            <li> This product cleans my hair nicely and conditions it as well. Who knew clay. I like variety, so I try different natural products and I feel natural is the best way to go. For me the less chemicals the better. Yes I would recommend!</li>
            <li> So happy with this product,it leaves my skin so clean and I can really see the difference.My skin looks better.</li>
            <li> This product makes your face feel good.  It is hard to rinse off however.  I use it everyday and my skin is smoother.  You only need a very little (less than a teaspoon) each day.</li>
            <li> I love this clay for a scrub and for a mask</li>
            <li> Very nice for facial and even body mask. Pulls out impurities without overdrying my skin. On my face, it definitely cleans my pores and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth but not tight or dried out. A little expensive for body, but it really softens and kind of tones that skin up too.  Haven&#x27;t used it on my hair, so I can&#x27; rate it for that.</li>
            <li> This is the best face mask I have ever used. It heals blemishes, polishes and tightens skin revealing beautiful glow. Will be buying again....and again...and :)</li>
            <li> This is a great natural product and really makes your skin look great! Great for exfoliation! Never irritates my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Great product! It really pulls out dirt and tightens your pores.</li>
            <li> excellent for sensitive dry skin, awesome quality ,i stop using soaps to wash my face i am using this mask as a cleanser weekly 2 times lot of improvement  in my skin ,i am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying to have to mix it up with water yourself, and at the beginning I wasted a LOT of product.&lt;br /&gt;Then, once you get it on and it hardens, it is a MESS to take off! It doesn&#x27;t return to a soft mixture. Instead, it separates into little mud-chunks that make a HUGE MESS in your sink.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am not using it right, but the whole process of application to taking it off is a pain in the butt.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER. Once it comes off, my skin is soft, glowing, clean, etc. I LOVE what it does to my skin so much that i can get over the difficulty of applying/taking it off.</li>
            <li> I have hair loss issues and was reading about using this clay 3 x&#x27;s a week along with Argan Oil to help correct scalp issues and hopefully regrow my hair. I have tried Rogaine for women and men, taken various vitamins, biotin, all per my doctor recommendations along with laser treatments. It did nothing to help my hair regrow. It has only been two weeks but my hair and scalp feel so much better and my scalp is no longer shiny which is a sign of clogged hair follicles and I think a build up of DHT. So far I have used this as a face mask twice and will be adding this to my regimen when I do my hair treatment. My face looks brighter and cleaner and feels softer.  Fingers crossed that my hair will grow back but even if it does not I will continue to use this product. So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I want to start off by saying, I have not been paid nor did I receive this product for free. I read a ton of Amazon reviews and I feel that happens a lot.  I find myself not trusting any of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;In all my days of trying beauty products, I have never seen results after one application, until now. I am 31 and for the first time in my life I am suffering from acne as well as my usual dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Last night I mixed this product with my rose oil toner to make a mask and WOW! My skin is brighter, less red around my cystic acne, several bumps have diminished, it is soft and moisturized.  I&#x27;m amazed one product can do all that!  My nine year old even noticed this morning!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product on a whim and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;I would like to know how often the mask treatment is recommended. Anybody?</li>
            <li> My skin looked great after using Rhassoul Clay.  i loved it..!!</li>
            <li> Can no longer see the blackheads on my nose and chin.  I will use it on my husband next if he will let me.</li>
            <li> Amazing products by Poppy Austin and customer service. Their giving back to the less fortunate through every order has me sold for life. Love also their Arogan oil and vitamin c oils.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this mask made my face feel.  When it dried it tightened up my pores and made my skin incredibly soft.  I made the mistake of adding a little too much water to the clay but will start with a smaller amount of water next time.  I am looking forward to using it on my scalp as well!</li>
            <li> Love this mask. It made my face brighter and no more red spots. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with blackheads, and after using this on my face; my blackheads shrunk :)  I have acne marks, after pregnancy, and now my face is getting brighter and lighter finally. The best thing it doesn&#x27;t make me break out:) it leaves my skin really soft. After the mask I also put on some Argan oil by poppy Austin as well.</li>
            <li> Amazing clay and i mix it with my rose water to make the most moisturizing face mask ever!! I have rosacea prone and dry skin but not so much anymore!!</li>
            <li> It doesn’t take much of this Rhassoul clay to make the facial with a bit of the rosewater.  They mix smoothly together and do not drip like some preparations.  Using this several times a week along with the rosehip oil (evening) and argan (morning) you have the ability to vary what your skin needs from day to day.  The mask is helping to reduce and clear pores for more refined nourished skin.  I have extremely sensitive skin which turns lobster red with almost all products, but inflammation is gone with this mask - wonderful.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these products!! They are what they say they are, natural! I will def be reordering from Poppy Austin</li>
            <li> After buying another brand of mask for several years that was double the cost of this and about half the size I found out that rhassoul clay and water were its only ingredients! They had just cleverly changed the spelling to rasul so It took me awhile to find a replacement brand. I was tired of paying almost $50 for a tiny tube so I started searching online and came across the generous jar of poppy Austin rhassoul clay on Amazon. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was any different in quality than the brand I previously used but I figured with amazons generous return policy it would be worth the risk. After my first few times I can tell you it&#x27;s excellent quality and seems to be having the same clearing and brightening effect on my skin as the other much more expensive brand. Looking forward to buying this again</li>
            <li> love, love...gave a jar to my son and he loves it too. Enjoy using natural products especially when they work. THanks!</li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time today. (On face and neck) Goes on very smooth and soft. I only left it on for about 8mins not the suggested 10-15min until I know how it reacts with my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a mess in the shower when you take it off but not a big deal. My face was red after removal and I put on some lotion... Didn&#x27;t feel much difference after but I will see how it goes over the next couple of days.</li>
            <li> I love the clay on my face. I mixed it with the rose water. It left my skin feeling like silk. I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my hair. The Poppy Austin line is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> Can you imagine a Macho guy who succumbed to the luxurious after feel of the morrocan clay... Now he asks for his weekly mask because he loves the improved look days after the mask, not to mention amazing it feels when u rinse the mask off😄amazing stuff !</li>
            <li> This product makes my 65-year-old hypersensitive skin fairly glow. The price is reasonable, the packaging was secure, and the shipping was timely. The fact that the vendor donates a percentage of sales towards women&#x27;s co-operatives in Morocco is a definite plus. Will absolutely purchase this product again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cleansed my face with it and also used it as mask. The results are truly very, very nice. The skin feels soft. I haven&#x27;t used it on my hair yet but I will soon be trying it as well. I will report on the results for that after I try it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a mask that applied evenly and smoothly; this product doesn&#x27;t do that.  My skin does feel nice after use, but I was hoping for more, especially for this price tag.</li>
            <li> I have used the Rhassoul Clay as a Facial Mask, but not as a Hair Mask.  I had and still do have a difficult time getting it to the right consistency to put on my face rather than to crumble into the sink, without wasting it.  I love how if feels when  it&#x27;s on and my face after it&#x27;s done. It was suggested that I try using it with the Rose Water but, for me, I felt like I was overusing or wasting the Rose Water, so I just use water.  I do wish they would develop a wonderful product for washing my face, one that moisturizes as it cleans.  Maybe soon??</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> I like the mask but it kinda overdrys my skin so I use just once a week everybody skin is different so you just have to try it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. I use it in my natural hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff..makes my skin feel clean and soft..just dont keep it on for more than the instructions say.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daugther and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> This mask makes your skin feel so soft, and it&#x27;s great to know it&#x27;s all natural.  I would definitely recommend this mask to all.  There&#x27;s no fragrance, so that&#x27;s a plus, too.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin clear, soft and smells delish with the Rosé Water from Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li> I love this clay mask. You only need a little bit of water to create a lot of mask, so this product will definitely last a while and is worth the price. It feels great and a portion of the sales get donated so it is an all-around great product. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> this mask is great. after using it just once I can see the difference in my skin. It was brighter, cleaner and fresher looking.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and this company is great!</li>
            <li> I love the Rhassoul clay!  I use it on my face and to cleanse my hair!  I would recommend the product because you will definitely notice a difference in your skin and how your hair responds!  This is a product that has become a must have in my beauty regimen. Best thing to use when you just want to keep it natural and simple.  It washes out of your hair easily and from your skin with ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard rave reviews on the Rhassoul Clay so I wanted to give it a try and used it as a hair mask 😢 next time I&#x27;ll with my Bentonite Clay.</li>
            <li> This product is GOLD. I have combination skin that is extremely sensitive, and I typically used to wake up every single morning with breakouts. The tiniest change in my skin care regimen could make my skin completely freak out (hives, rash, breakouts, burning, blotchiness...I&#x27;ve experienced it all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously been using harsh chemicals on my face to combat acne. I was prescribed benzaclin and tretinoin by my dermatologist. I had such a bad reaction to both products and was completely hopeless about ever having smooth, clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found out about rhassoul clay. And it changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that may sound dramatic, but after feeling like my face was being burned off every time I applied my prescriptions, it was like a miracle cure to put the rhassoul clay on my face and have it FEEL GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix a teaspoon of the clay with a splash of water in a bowl (enough to form a loose paste). Then I apply it to my clean skin and let it dry into a mask for about 15-20 minutes. Then I wash it off and pat my skin dry. The clay is so soothing, gentle, and calming. Applying it every night is my favorite part of the entire day. I feel like I&#x27;m at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the clay begins to dry, you can feel your skin tingling and tightening. The most amazing part to me was being able to look in the mirror and actually SEEING OIL AND SEBUM PULLED OUT OF MY PORES. It didn&#x27;t seem possible, but due to the natural electromagnetic charge of the mineral-rich clay, the positively-charged toxins in my skin were actually being pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing the clay off, the appearance of my skin is immediately improved. Rhassoul clay is a natural anti-inflammatory, so redness and swelling are completely gone after use. My skin is soft, moisturized, and smooth after each use. For the first time in years, even after using prescription skin treatments, I wake up in the morning and I do not have a single breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending $500 on prescription skin treatments and having the worst reactions along with scary side effects, this small but mighty jar of clay is my miracle cure. I will never let anything else touch my skin, and I can tell you that I will be finishing each day with a rhassoul clay mask for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I am a male and so I don&#x27;t usually use a lot of facial products or enhancements.  Anyway, I&#x27;ve lived in the tropics the last 30 years and had dry skin and so I decided to try the Rhassoul Clay Facial Mask.  Well, when I first used it and was honestly amazed when I put it on and the feeling of the clay slowly drying and pulling on my pores and skin.  It removed a lot of dry dead skin and made my face clear and moist and made me more handsome.  At least that is what my wife said..!  Growing up my step mother used to show me how to put on masks and other moisture products but this product is far superior. One last point is that 1 application uses very little of the product and I can see getting maybe 30 or more applications. I would recommend this product wholeheartedly to men and women and I am thoroughly satisfied and glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> This clay is smooth and easy to mix. My skin looks smoother and clearer after using it. I would recommend mixing it with an essential oil like eucalyptus for a body mask.</li>
            <li> I used this on my face and hair.  As a face mask, it made my face brighter and clearer without drying my face.  I have natural hair and it made styling my hair so much easier.  First time I tried the hair mask, 75% less frizz and barely any tangles. I am a 4c. Threw away all my other hair products.  This product does what it claims. Product is a keeper.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this product is that it did not have a recommended amount for clay to water ratio. I had to toy with the amount of clay to use, and in doing so, I have found that about 1/2 tsp of clay to 1 tsp of rose water is just about perfect. If you&#x27;ve discovered that you&#x27;ve made too much, I don&#x27;t recommend trying to apply a little extra to your face, I would try to store it in an airtight container or just throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this tiny criticism, I absolutely love this product. My skin looks younger and feels younger. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Revitalizing, rejuvenating for face. I use the 100% pure Poppy Austin Rose Water instead of water. Your face will thank you. I only recently found Poppy Rose brand. My new favorite - and I have tried them ALL. I also use the Rose Water as a toner. Am on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do as well as promised,  my noxema made my face deplore refreshed than this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  It works.  My acne is better then it has been since i went off my medicine 6 months ago,  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I like this mask!  It definitely pulls out all the impurities and I mix it with the rose water for an even healthier glow.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this mask&lt;br /&gt;This is great product&lt;br /&gt;Buying more .</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, I use just under a tsp and add water until I like the consistency.  I recommend that you wash it off before it is totally dry especially if you have dry skin and moisturize after you wash.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have been having a problem with blackheads for a long time. Nothing I had tried really worked until I tried this product. After the first application I noticed a difference right away. Not only were most of my black heads disappearing but my face felt very smooth. The second time I tried it, I mixed it with the Poppy Austin Rose Water. This is supposed to have more anti-inflammatory benefits. I did notice that some of the irritated red spots on my face lighten w/i one application. I highly suggest using both products. The environment is so hard on our faces. You will love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for my face yet, just my hair. It made my hair really soft and clean. I mixed it with a few ayurvedic powders, conditioner, and oils. I will prob buy it again. And I will eventually use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product is excellent  in quality and with Amazon as distributor excellent service.</li>
            <li> Did not like this.  Maybe I&#x27;m just not crazy about clay masks in general though (first time to try one).  Here are my issues:  You have to mix it, so I constantly keep a bowl and spoon on my countertop, which just creates clutter in my bathroom.  It goes on gritty and not smooth, has a subtle dirt smell (which I guess is to be expected), not the prettiest color, when it dries I feel the tightening which is awesome BUT it soon creates the ITCHIEST feeling ever, especially if you actually move your face and the mask cracks.  When I go to wash it off, I can&#x27;t wash it off fast enough, it&#x27;s so itchy.  That&#x27;s my biggest complaint.  I love natural, but I&#x27;d rather have a smooth, cooling, calming type face mask - this clay mask doesn&#x27;t do any of that.  Overall, I don&#x27;t enjoy putting it on.  It&#x27;s more of a chore - just trying to get through this $20 jar.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Rhassoul Clay after viewing someone using it on youtube, I was curious.&lt;br /&gt;I like trying new products and this stuff is amazing. I use it as a cleanser in my hair &amp; I give myself a facial with it.&lt;br /&gt;Rhassoul Clay is a little pricier than the other clay I saw on Amazon, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product 100%.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Mizfit</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for both my hair/scalp and skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using as a mask for my hair and my scalp is reaping the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with a itchy, flaky scalp and this has really helped.&lt;br /&gt;When used on my face, my skin glows.</li>
            <li> You need to mix it by yourself. Only used once so cannot say if it works or not. I would not buy again just because I need to mix it before use it, and need to clean up after.</li>
            <li> This clay is fantastic!!! Not only did it leave my oily breakout pone skin glowing, it also healed my dry cracking hands (from the dry winter)!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin soft, and my pores are actually smaller! I mix about a teaspoon of the clay in a bowl and I add water until it forms a paste, then I apply and wait until it dries. It is the best mask I have ever used, and makes my skin feel firm and radiant. I highly recommend this product. It is calming, soothing, moisturizing, and detoxes your skin!!</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who research, purchase and use products that aid in skin health, especially the face. I often make up y own combinations from the best products. Over the years, I have tried dozens of clays, and many of them were very good. Then I came upon this Rhassoul Clay which I used as a facial, and after one treatment, it was obvious that this clay has superior minerals and actual power to clean, extract, and mke your facial skin alive, glowing healthy, plumper, and younger. I use it twice a week, and when ever going out for something special. It is an amazing product and the only facial clay I use now.</li>
            <li> Love the clay... With the right consistency of water it makes a great moisturizer for my hair and an excellent exfoliate for my skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after using</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic!  I&#x27;m in my early 40s with the fabulous combination of acne prone, oily T-zone, and aging skin.  My skin has never been great, but recently the texture, clarity, and firmness of it took a nosedive so I had to  abandon the face care regiment I&#x27;d had for years and figure out how to address my new issues.  I had absolutely no idea where to start looking and almost everything causes my face to erupt angrily.  Good times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Google, I researched and researched and finally bought this clay hoping for okay but expecting the worst.  To my surprise and delight, WOW.  It made my skin so soft and smooth from the very first time I used it as a face mask, and actually soothed and purified my skin instead of causing it to freak out!  I mix it with about an equal amount of water and add a little splash of rose water and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  The mask tingles and pulls really tight when it&#x27;s in the final drying stage which freaked me out the first time, but now I look forward to it!</li>
            <li> Love this mask! Really tightened my pores.</li>
            <li> I really like this product doe, This product is a little pricey ,its worth its price its expiration. Last like three years. I also like how this mask left my pore tight.</li>
            <li> Have not used product yet as am finishing another product.  Am impressed with your kindness toward the women of Morocco.</li>
            <li> I added the product (1 teaspoon) to some water in my palm. It became a mess of stains and clumps. I tried again, this time with a bowl of water and stirring it in thoroughly. It finally formed a smooth mask. I applied it to my face, left on 10 minutes. I could feel the tightening effect at once. Then, wiped it off with a wet towel and was amazed at the smoothness of my skin. I applied a moisturizer, then foundation. This really is a good product, but frankly, I like the clay masks that are ready to apply without all the fuss.</li>
            <li> Extremely costly and completely messy and very hard to wash off.  Did not enjoy using it but hate returning items.</li>
            <li> Feels fantastic! ....However I am worried about what the clay will do to my plumbing &amp; pipes when I wash it off...</li>
            <li> this stuff is magic.... after 40+ years the large pores in my nose have finally disappeared!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the product, but I was very disappointed that it had no mixing instructions at all. Having never used this type product it is very difficult to fugure out what measurements you use!</li>
            <li> mixes very smooth.  best clay I have used!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have definitely noticed a change in my skin in just two weeks</li>
            <li> Not what I had hoped for. My skin actually feels greasier than before I was using the product. Just too rough for me, maybe....</li>
            <li> This stuff smoothed my skin. I have oily skin and it absorbed the oil leaving my skin less shiney. I would recommend it. I&#x27;ve used biore facial mask before and liked the price and the results. This works better but it is pricey and I can&#x27;t find it in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything,  and hands down this is the best!  I never leave reviews but just had to with this!  Since having a hysterectomy I&#x27;ve had some acne,  big difference even after the first use!  Now my face is clear, glowing and feels great!</li>
            <li> Loved this product!! Have shared with all my friends. I&#x27;ve only used it as a facial mask so far but it tightened my pores and really reduced my impurities.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really nice. It does exactly as described. Makes my skin feel clean and smooth without drying it out. My clogged pores are becoming less and less the more I use it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times, however I love it. My complexion has definitely improved (soft, even skin tone, clean pores).</li>
