            <li>a bit greasy when applying (I add a a bit of water so that I can spread it more easily).</li>
            <li>Very overwhelming smell at first.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit too strong for me-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked at variety of different spas, I always get a nice discount on professional products, so why not use the best?  </li>

            <li>My favorite daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>If you have more mature/dry skin, I would recommend this with the Eminence Bamboo retinol alternative firming fluid.</li>
            <li>I love it, but it does give a little mild burn.</li>
            <li>but I always come back to Eminence, at full price when I can get other lines for a nice discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Once again, thank you Emminence. One of the VERY FEW companies where trying a new product&lt;br /&gt;is not an expensive risk, they always deliver!</li>
            <li> Love Eminence products, I have never been disappointed. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The jar is a decent size, and I learned very quickly that a little goes a long way.  The scent is a bit too strong for me- it reminds me of apricots.  I&#x27;m starting to get used to it, but I wish it was a little lighter on the scent side. I use this after cleansing with Eminence Stone Crop Gel wash, and then I use an all-natural rose water toner.  I just need a few little dabs of this guava bamboo moisturizer on each side of my face- once it begins to dry I feel a slight tightening of the skin, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;When I first converted to Eminence from my regular moisturizer, my skin went through a little revolt.  I also switched to using an all-natural cleanser and toner, and ditched my usual department store brands, so some skin outbreaks were totally expected. I&#x27;m in the last half of my 30&#x27;s, and I suffer from bouts of rosacea that flares with my allergies, and the occasional battles with adult acne (combination skin).&lt;br /&gt;So, along with the change in skin care regimen came a few spots of acne and redness here and there, but it has been a week and that has subsided and a co-worker actually complimented that my skin looked better today. It feels smoother too...I&#x27;m going to keep using this and monitor progress.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone very disappointed and will not order again I am an esthetician and have used many skincare products over the years this would not be one I would order for my clients.</li>
            <li> luxurious cream and smells delicious</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now and my face doesn&#x27;t agree with anything else.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and how lightweight the product goes on your face.  I mainly purchased it for use during the dry winter months.  I feel as though combining it with the Neroli Hydrating Mist is the best use for this product.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love all the eminence products but this guava and bamboo moisturizer is the best.  My skin looks 10 years younger</li>
            <li> I got this cream for my husband. he loves it, it&#x27;s his favorite. H says it&#x27;s not too thick, not to thin, creamy and moisturizes well.  smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Eminence products are the best. They really work and the fact they are organic is fabulous. My skin is no longer dry but silky. I&#x27;ve used  Eminence for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Package was completely open</li>
            <li> Not only does this moisturizer smell unbelievable, but it&#x27;s consistency is perfect.  It gives you just enough hydration without feeling too heavy.</li>
            <li> not greasy and smells wonderful with great results, I also love the bamboo moisturizer. Eminence has great products, I use several.</li>
            <li> Nice texture like all of the eminence products but the smell is a bit stronger than I like.  There are other moisturizers in their line I like better.</li>
            <li> Just start using it so I don&#x27;t know yet but natural and no chemical make me feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> Eminence is the best skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used. Recommended by my dermatologist. Great product; smells so good!</li>
            <li> At 63 I need all the hydration I can get.  I live in a hot climate and work outside everyday, Guava/Bamboo works wonders for my skin.  I am sensitive to many products they bother my eyes, but this one works all day long without any irritation.  I&#x27;ve used this product for 5 years.</li>
            <li> This feels like heaven on my skin! Everyone remarks how good my skin looks. This and the cleanser are the only things I use on my skin. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I add a drops of water to the lotion to thin it out which is great because it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I just love this product!  I have used Eminence Organic products for the last 10 years and have loved every product I have tried. You can&#x27;t go wrong with any of them. So nice and creamy yet not oily. My favorite daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As with all Eminence products, this is high quality and all natural--great product!</li>
            <li> Items came sooner than I had thought! Excellent products! Eminence Guave and Bamboo Age-Defying Moisturizer is fantastic!  A little bit goes a long way, my skin feels so smooth and soft. Makeup goes on very well, I plan on buying more of Eminence products. The Coconut Firming Body Lotion feels great and is a lot cheaper than the spa&#x27;s! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love it, but it does give a little mild burn. However, it is anti aging so maybe its related to that.</li>
            <li> Great heavy duty moisturizer for very dry skin</li>
            <li> Smells sooooooo yummy</li>
            <li> I work in the spa industry.  I&#x27;ve worked at variety of different spas, I always get a nice discount on professional products, so why not use the best?  I&#x27;ve used many lines of great professional grade product...but I always come back to Eminence, at full price when I can get other lines for a nice discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I love about Eminence?  After I put it on, it sinks into my skin...doesn&#x27;t sit on the surface...and my husband who wouldn&#x27;t notice a Mack truck parked in the living room said &amp;#34;Your skin looks really nice&amp;#34; after I started using it..and it does...noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Great cream I love this line and their products.</li>
            <li> Very overwhelming smell at first. a bit greasy when applying (I add a a bit of water so that I can spread it more easily). I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this moisturizer. I finally got my mom to get a trial kit from this company and she loves it too! I love that is it organic (which is a must for me) and I not only loving how well it works but also love the smell!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for dry skin types looking to add more hydration to their skin care regimen. I was feeling very dry this spring and my winter moisturizer wasn&#x27;t quite doing the trick so I decided to try this one. I have used the Eminence Naseberry in the past and remember really loving it... but since I love Eminence so much I wanted to try a new product.

If you have more mature/dry skin, I would recommend this with the Eminence Bamboo retinol alternative firming fluid. Those two together with a gentle cream cleanser would be a fabulous skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> In my mid 40&#x27;s and was tired of spending SO much money on skin care only to be disappointed.  A facialist had me bring in all my skin care purchases and pointed out all the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in those products that were drying, yucky chemicals that should not be on my skin.  They all went in the (now very expensive) trash can.  The Eminence line is reasonably priced and I get compliments all the time on my skin.  I get this moisturizer and the pink one that has SPF in it and use both every day.</li>
