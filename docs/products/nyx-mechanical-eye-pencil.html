            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this and it lasts!</li>
            <li>and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a good pencil if you want to brighten the corners of your eyes although I think a thicker pencil might be better.</li>
            <li>This is a great quality product, perfect for the inner liner and corner of your eyes...</li>
            <li>No skipping or tugging and it stayed on my waterline for 12 hours WITHOUT any kind of primer.</li>
            <li>This one is very pigmented and shows up perfectly.</li>
            <li>VERY easily would clump in the lower lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s old or not made of the best material.</li>
            <li>It is not irritating and it goes on so smooth and perfect!</li>
            <li>It is really an amazing pencil, I love it, I never use white pencil, because the pencils that I bought always irrigated around the eyes, but this one is excellent</li>
            <li>perfect white eyeliner</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Best white eyeliner out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall i&#x27;m okay with this eye liner, but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>if I could smudge it more I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li>, all you have to do is twist the top.</li>
            <li>Great color really makes my eyes look bigger and stays on the waterline flawlessly!!</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>It works great for this purpose (waterline) and is very waterproof.  </li>
            <li>but you can build up if you feel you need more color intensity.  </li>
            <li>The perfect creamy white eyeliner to make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for lining your lower lashline with to make your eyes seem bigger.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love NYX products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I guess if I cry I won&#x27;t have any problems with it :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this....</li>
            <li>this was so amazing and worth your money !</li>
            <li>It appears to make them look bigger, saw the ideal on pinterest.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, at a price I love!</li>
            <li>I love that Amazon has such a great selection from NYX.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to apply, meaning that it does not scratch your eye</li>
            <li>This white eye pencil is a great product and can be used for so many things.</li>
            <li>My daughter needed it for dancing performances and finds it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Applies easily and stays.</li>
            <li>The pencil also crumbles and breaks easily while in use.</li>
            <li>I now use it to highlight my nose and chin which works fine.</li>
            <li>A tad on the soft side which feels good and makes it glide easily, but it also let&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive and the color is actually nice; I&#x27;ve worn it since.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and the retractable pencil means no need for sharpening.</li>
            <li>This is a great brand, and I&#x27;ve been waiting for them to come out with a comp to the Benefit white pencil.</li>
            <li>It is water proof and smudge free.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and precisely.  </li>
            <li>and also it stuck very well on my upper inner-lid :-D</li>
            <li>Super easy twist up design with a fine point.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would still recommend this product because when it first goes on it is lovely, but don&#x27;t be fooled by the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; label.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and the color is bold.</li>
            <li>The pigment depends on how many times you run it along the water line pretty much :3</li>
            <li>Love it, last all day , goes on great, have no complaints what so ever, will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li>The product is super soft and I love that I don&#x27;t need to sharpen it when I want to use it!  </li>
            <li>Has been pretty neat, works great,  and not having to sharpen the white pencil is always a plus.</li>
            <li>recommend it to girls that are looking for a good white eye pencil.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s true to what you see color.  </li>
            <li>I love how gentle this eye pen is on my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is very versatile and can truly be used in so many ways to enhance your every day look.</li>
            <li>I think this was a lucky find</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is perfect for giving me that open eyed, awake look, but only downside is that it irritates my contact lenses.</li>
            <li>If you get it on your lashes it won&#x27;t come off quick</li>
            <li>The product shipped quickly and in tact, as promised.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to try to use on my waterline and it was super waxy and flaky.</li>
            <li>I love these nyx mechanical eye pencils in general because they are easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smudge or run on your skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best eye liner I ever had so far, and I tried many different brands with different colors!</li>
            <li>The formula is very pigmented and slides on easily.</li>
            <li>This pencils EXACTLY what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Nice &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; white color.</li>
            <li>thats not a pencil liner so I don&#x27;t have to sharpen it and its very easy to apply the texture is nice and long lasting</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to add natural brightness to the inner corner of my eye and bottom lid, this is way too potent for that and is better used as stage makeup.</li>
            <li>Soft easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the price and quality of this eyeliner and would recommend the white for waterline usage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and you can build the color up instead of getting super white right off the bat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is extremely soft and smooth to use - no tugging or skipping.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite white eyeliner of all time, I use it on my waterline and it&#x27;s opaque, glides on and stays on</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and it is my favorite white eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Wooden pencils also seem to irritate my eyes most times.  </li>
            <li>Love to underline my eye with this white eyeliner; it helps the eye look brighter.</li>
            <li>When I line my water line with this, my eyes look bigger, fuller, and I look much more awake.</li>
            <li>Every pencil I bought was hard, hurt my eye lids and didn&#x27;t look very nice.</li>
            <li>I use this white liner on my waterline and it really gives me a beautiful Asian eye look when I pair it with black winged liner on the top lid and white eye shadow :3</li>
            <li>But hey, for $5, this thing is great and seriously does the job.</li>
            <li>This is a good basic white eyeliner for brightening up my eyes.</li>
            <li>Really good long lasting and really cream easy to use not mess</li>
            <li>The white is soft enough for comfortable and effective waterline application.</li>
            <li>This goes on much more smoothly than the old pencil I was using, which is important for the delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li>Finally a white eyeliner that is easy to apply on the waterline.</li>
            <li>However, I certainly would not call it waterproof.</li>
            <li>loved it , especially because it stayed on for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Very nice,I already used it and it stays on,easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Some white liners are crappy and junk up your eyelashes because they don&#x27;t go on smooth - this one does.</li>
            <li>It really highlights those areas, and pulls the attention to my eyes.</li>
            <li>I got this for my Daughter , she really likes it.</li>
            <li>This product came in the mail fast, approx 3 days or so.</li>
            <li>Works well, doesn&#x27;t transfer and is very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I absolutely did not like this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>The color is clear and very visible with just one apply!</li>
            <li>Definitely makes me appear more awake, and gives eyes a larger effect.</li>
            <li>I love this white eyeliner, I use it to highlight my lower waterline to make my eyes appear larger.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need a second coat unlike most eye liners I have to go over it again a second time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product, but maybe not this seller</li>
            <li>Yet It does not always wants to stay on my waterline and by the end of the day, its completely gone.</li>
            <li>I apply the white liner on my waterline, and it makes my eyes appear bigger, but apply lightly if you put too much on</li>
            <li>so when I saw this mechanical eye pencil in white, I had to buy it right away.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Application is a little flaky/chunky when applying to waterline, but easily cleaned up with a damp cotton swab.</li>
            <li>If you draw on the DRY skin portion of your eye, for example the upper lid above the lashes, then sure it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Very opaque, the twisty mechanism is a bit irritating, but otherwise a great eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;I got the white color, and it actually was white, not some clearish thingamabob</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I am currently looking at different colors from same company but White is my favorite</li>
            <li>I use it to line the inner part of my eyelid when I do a mod like of a look.</li>
            <li>The makeup itself does not feel heavy or cakey, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>It is soft &amp;amp; visible when highlighting around my eyes.</li>
            <li>though it is soft on the eye, it does not smear, or come off during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Application was smooth and it didn&#x27;t go on too heavy</li>
            <li>It was far too pigmented and made me eyes look clownish</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s only waste of customer mony but the color is ok</li>
            <li>This product does provide a nice thin line for application around areas you are wanting to highlight.  </li>
            <li>Waterproof, twist up so no little wood pencil shavings in my eye, looks &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; on my bottom water line or in the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty opaque which is finally what I&#x27;ve been looking for in a white liner.</li>
            <li>Some white eye liners don&#x27;t show up very well, especially on a water line.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that my eyes are mega sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful not to get it on my lower lashes---it really STAYS.</li>
            <li>unlike most of the mechanical eye pencils I&#x27;ve come across this one actually lays down color in one pass verses having to go over the same area three or four times to get it to lay down</li>
            <li>It has a soft small tip suitable for small details.</li>
            <li>I needed a white eyeliner because my old one was running low.</li>
            <li>Smudges and wears off within the first few hours.</li>
            <li>I use this in the inner corners to brighten my eyes, and it really confirms that little makeup trick.  </li>
            <li>I got this for that little white corner of your eye and drag makeup to do for fun</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It goes on smooth and the color is bold.</li>
            <li> The pigment depends on how many times you run it along the water line pretty much :3</li>
            <li> Love it, last all day , goes on great, have no complaints what so ever, will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li> The product is super soft and I love that I don&#x27;t need to sharpen it when I want to use it!  </li>
            <li> Has been pretty neat, works great,  and not having to sharpen the white pencil is always a plus.</li>
            <li> recommend it to girls that are looking for a good white eye pencil.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s true to what you see color.  </li>
            <li> I love how gentle this eye pen is on my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is very versatile and can truly be used in so many ways to enhance your every day look.</li>
            <li> I think this was a lucky find</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is perfect for giving me that open eyed, awake look, but only downside is that it irritates my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> If you get it on your lashes it won&#x27;t come off quick</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly and in tact, as promised.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to try to use on my waterline and it was super waxy and flaky.</li>
            <li> I love these nyx mechanical eye pencils in general because they are easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smudge or run on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye liner I ever had so far, and I tried many different brands with different colors!</li>
            <li> The formula is very pigmented and slides on easily.</li>
            <li> This pencils EXACTLY what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Nice &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; white color.</li>
            <li> thats not a pencil liner so I don&#x27;t have to sharpen it and its very easy to apply the texture is nice and long lasting</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to add natural brightness to the inner corner of my eye and bottom lid, this is way too potent for that and is better used as stage makeup.</li>
            <li> Soft easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the price and quality of this eyeliner and would recommend the white for waterline usage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and you can build the color up instead of getting super white right off the bat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is extremely soft and smooth to use - no tugging or skipping.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite white eyeliner of all time, I use it on my waterline and it&#x27;s opaque, glides on and stays on</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and it is my favorite white eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Wooden pencils also seem to irritate my eyes most times.  </li>
            <li> Love to underline my eye with this white eyeliner; it helps the eye look brighter.</li>
            <li> When I line my water line with this, my eyes look bigger, fuller, and I look much more awake.</li>
            <li> Every pencil I bought was hard, hurt my eye lids and didn&#x27;t look very nice.</li>
            <li> I use this white liner on my waterline and it really gives me a beautiful Asian eye look when I pair it with black winged liner on the top lid and white eye shadow :3</li>
            <li> But hey, for $5, this thing is great and seriously does the job.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic white eyeliner for brightening up my eyes.</li>
            <li> Really good long lasting and really cream easy to use not mess</li>
            <li> The white is soft enough for comfortable and effective waterline application.</li>
            <li> This goes on much more smoothly than the old pencil I was using, which is important for the delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li> Finally a white eyeliner that is easy to apply on the waterline.</li>
            <li> However, I certainly would not call it waterproof.</li>
            <li> loved it , especially because it stayed on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Very nice,I already used it and it stays on,easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Some white liners are crappy and junk up your eyelashes because they don&#x27;t go on smooth - this one does.</li>
            <li> It really highlights those areas, and pulls the attention to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Daughter , she really likes it.</li>
            <li> This product came in the mail fast, approx 3 days or so.</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t transfer and is very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I absolutely did not like this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> The color is clear and very visible with just one apply!</li>
            <li> Definitely makes me appear more awake, and gives eyes a larger effect.</li>
            <li> I love this white eyeliner, I use it to highlight my lower waterline to make my eyes appear larger.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need a second coat unlike most eye liners I have to go over it again a second time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product, but maybe not this seller</li>
            <li> Yet It does not always wants to stay on my waterline and by the end of the day, its completely gone.</li>
            <li> I apply the white liner on my waterline, and it makes my eyes appear bigger, but apply lightly if you put too much on</li>
            <li> so when I saw this mechanical eye pencil in white, I had to buy it right away.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Application is a little flaky/chunky when applying to waterline, but easily cleaned up with a damp cotton swab.</li>
            <li> If you draw on the DRY skin portion of your eye, for example the upper lid above the lashes, then sure it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Very opaque, the twisty mechanism is a bit irritating, but otherwise a great eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;I got the white color, and it actually was white, not some clearish thingamabob</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I am currently looking at different colors from same company but White is my favorite</li>
            <li> I use it to line the inner part of my eyelid when I do a mod like of a look.</li>
            <li> The makeup itself does not feel heavy or cakey, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> It is soft &amp;amp; visible when highlighting around my eyes.</li>
            <li> though it is soft on the eye, it does not smear, or come off during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Application was smooth and it didn&#x27;t go on too heavy</li>
            <li> It was far too pigmented and made me eyes look clownish</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s only waste of customer mony but the color is ok</li>
            <li> This product does provide a nice thin line for application around areas you are wanting to highlight.  </li>
            <li> Waterproof, twist up so no little wood pencil shavings in my eye, looks &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; on my bottom water line or in the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty opaque which is finally what I&#x27;ve been looking for in a white liner.</li>
            <li> Some white eye liners don&#x27;t show up very well, especially on a water line.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that my eyes are mega sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to get it on my lower lashes---it really STAYS.</li>
            <li> unlike most of the mechanical eye pencils I&#x27;ve come across this one actually lays down color in one pass verses having to go over the same area three or four times to get it to lay down</li>
            <li> It has a soft small tip suitable for small details.</li>
            <li> I needed a white eyeliner because my old one was running low.</li>
            <li> Smudges and wears off within the first few hours.</li>
            <li> I use this in the inner corners to brighten my eyes, and it really confirms that little makeup trick.  </li>
            <li> I got this for that little white corner of your eye and drag makeup to do for fun</li>
            <li> I do not like wooden pencils that must be sharpened as they are so uncomfortable to apply and do not glide on quickly or easily.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it on long enough yet to rate</li>
            <li> lasts a long time even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on as smooooothly as I would like and it not quite as long lasting either.</li>
            <li> Pigment is very white, not like those silvery grey looking eyeliners I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> It is very long lasting</li>
            <li> It stays for up to 2 days and no mess like other eye liners!</li>
            <li> Lasts long,it&#x27;s very smooth,but as some people noticed,it&#x27;s really hard to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I had such a hard time finding a soft creamy white eye liner.</li>
            <li> but just be careful and maybe start your make up routine with this instead of using this last...</li>
            <li> (A make-up trick I learned from a Beauty Advisor, a long time ago.)</li>
            <li> I can not recommend the other colors as I have not tried them, but I plan to in the future.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t leave my eyes neither dry or itchy.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every single day.</li>
            <li> will definitely order it in black for water lines as  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stay on the water line that long like other reviewers claim.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> Works well and just as expected.</li>
            <li> (which was a con for me, as it&#x27;s a tad too stark white for my taste)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are looking for a quality eye pencil, invest the extra dollar in yourself, and don&#x27;t waste your money on another pencil that you will end up throwing away.</li>
            <li> Waste of time only....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because these are really great eyeliners, and I&#x27;m disappointed overall.</li>
            <li> It arrived so dry and as a result it&#x27;s been hidden in a drawer</li>
            <li> so have to line the other side of lashes, not any closer or it</li>
            <li> and I will be purchasing other colors.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any of the other eyeliner colors as I was just looking for something to use on my waterline.  </li>
            <li> but I have no idea how the other reviewers found this &amp;#34;hard to take off&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;lasting all day&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The product was a little harder than I would have preferred.</li>
            <li> Not worth the couple of bucks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very smooth.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> : it lays down color in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;con:</li>
            <li> I have black eyelashes</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing it in black to use as an eyeliner.</li>
            <li> that being said if you rub it or scrape it with your hands it will mess up your line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pro</li>
            <li> Does the job but can be a little cakey</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim since I was looking for green makeup for St. Paddy&#x27;s day (lime green).</li>
            <li> However, it is incredibly difficult to blend, unless you like looking like an actor from the musical Cats.  </li>
            <li> I might buy this again because I like the type of way it looks over a pencil (pencils are hard) .</li>
            <li> (for me), I like to blend eyeliners so they don&#x27;t have a hard line.  </li>
            <li> This is SO hard to use.</li>
            <li> I like it but its rather opaque and thick.</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> I never used it and it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> I put in on the squishy side of my lower eyelid and it stays of for maybe 5 minutes before dissipating into thin air.</li>
            <li> seriously!</li>
            <li> Before, I had Covergirl&#x27;s Flame Out (in white) and it was terrible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing something wrong</li>
            <li> and it was extremely difficult to remove it.</li>
            <li> it makes it look creepy!</li>
            <li> Unusable for my purpose :(</li>
            <li> and this stuff is awful to get off if I accidentally get on them.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very smooth. it dragged a bit on my eye. Nice color, though! It may work well on the waterline.</li>
            <li> It is really an amazing pencil, I love it, I never use white pencil, because the pencils that I bought always irrigated around the eyes, but this one is excellent</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this on your eyelashes or it won&#x27;t come off....I have black eyelashes and this stuff is awful to get off if I accidentally get on them.  Does wonders for finishing touches on your makeup...but just be careful and maybe start your make up routine with this instead of using this last...</li>
            <li> Soft easy to apply. I have sensitive eyes and this does not irritate them.</li>
            <li> This goes on like a crayon.......messy and does not last, you have to reapply every hr. Not worth the couple of bucks</li>
            <li> Application is a little flaky/chunky when applying to waterline, but easily cleaned up with a damp cotton swab.</li>
            <li> This goes on much more smoothly than the old pencil I was using, which is important for the delicate eye area.  I use this in the inner corners to brighten my eyes, and it really confirms that little makeup trick.  I work 13-hour shifts and it looks the same when I leave work.  I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> perfect white eyeliner I like thats not a pencil liner so I don&#x27;t have to sharpen it and its very easy to apply the texture is nice and long lasting</li>
            <li> The white is soft enough for comfortable and effective waterline application. It is not irritating and it goes on so smooth and perfect!</li>
            <li> The product was a little harder than I would have preferred.</li>
            <li> Very nice,I already used it and it stays on,easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye liner I ever had so far, and I tried many different brands with different colors! The color is clear and very visible with just one apply! It stays for up to 2 days and no mess like other eye liners! I am currently looking at different colors from same company but White is my favorite and it&#x27;s simply glowing!!!</li>
            <li> This works exactly as expected.  I got the white one to put on my waterline.  It stays fairly well and is very easy to apply.  The product is super soft and I love that I don&#x27;t need to sharpen it when I want to use it!  Will probably buy again!!</li>
            <li> Some white liners are crappy and junk up your eyelashes because they don&#x27;t go on smooth - this one does. It&#x27;s smooth and you can build the color up instead of getting super white right off the bat.</li>
            <li> This is a good pencil if you want to brighten the corners of your eyes although I think a thicker pencil might be better. This is more&lt;br /&gt;to be used as an eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I use it to line the inner part of my eyelid when I do a mod like of a look. I dig it. It goes on smooth and the color is bold.</li>
            <li> I use a dot on the skin between my nose and inner eyes. It really highlights those areas, and pulls the attention to my eyes. I love it. I can even use it as a liner. The only downside is that my eyes are mega sensitive. So I have to keep this liner (and all eye products) away from my inner eyes so have to line the other side of lashes, not any closer or it burns.&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely soft and smooth to use - no tugging or skipping. You can also apply as liner or shadow and blend with a finger and it looks amazing. Enjoy! Can&#x27;t&#x27; beat the price!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim since I was looking for green makeup for St. Paddy&#x27;s day (lime green). It&#x27;s very inexpensive and the color is actually nice; I&#x27;ve worn it since. It is WP and stays put all day unlike others I have (JK, Almay, Maybelline), no smudging and smearing in my crease. It goes on smoothly and the retractable pencil means no need for sharpening. I think this was a lucky find and I will be purchasing other colors.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Daughter , she really likes it. I love that Amazon has such a great selection from NYX.</li>
            <li> I never used it and it&#x27;s broken. I might buy this again because I like the type of way it looks over a pencil (pencils are hard) .</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is perfect for giving me that open eyed, awake look, but only downside is that it irritates my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, at a price I love! This is a great brand, and I&#x27;ve been waiting for them to come out with a comp to the Benefit white pencil. Haven&#x27;t had it on long enough yet to rate it&#x27;s long-wearing ability, but I&#x27;m not too worried about it.</li>
            <li> Really good long lasting and really cream easy to use not mess&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to girls that are looking for a good white eye pencil.</li>
            <li> Best white eyeliner out there. Hands down.</li>
            <li> Love it, last all day , goes on great, have no complaints what so ever, will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li> This is my favorite white eyeliner of all time, I use it on my waterline and it&#x27;s opaque, glides on and stays on</li>
            <li> I bought this white eyeliner to wear as a brightening accent for my lower waterline. The formula is very pigmented and slides on easily.However, I certainly would not call it waterproof. After a couple hours of wear I find myself needing to touch it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend this product because when it first goes on it is lovely, but don&#x27;t be fooled by the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; label.</li>
            <li> I love these nyx mechanical eye pencils in general because they are easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smudge or run on your skin. But this doesn&#x27;t last on my waterline</li>
            <li> I use this white liner on my waterline and it really gives me a beautiful Asian eye look when I pair it with black winged liner on the top lid and white eye shadow :3 Totally the look I&#x27;ve been working toward</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to add natural brightness to the inner corner of my eye and bottom lid, this is way too potent for that and is better used as stage makeup. Very thick.</li>
            <li> Nice product great price. will definitely order it in black for water lines as  It is water proof and smudge free.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Works well and just as expected.</li>
            <li> I use this to line my waterline, and the inner corner. Definitely makes me appear more awake, and gives eyes a larger effect.</li>
            <li> Has been pretty neat, works great,  and not having to sharpen the white pencil is always a plus. Would get again.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I use it all the time and it is my favorite white eyeliner. I have recommended this product to friends and they love it too!</li>
            <li> It went on easily and was very bright. Then it burned for hours and my eyes cried it off. I think I cannot use it for my water line but can still use of like a cat eye type of thing.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because it works and I was having a heck of a time finding white liners.&lt;br /&gt;And unlike most of the mechanical eye pencils I&#x27;ve come across this one actually lays down color in one pass verses having to go over the same area three or four times to get it to lay down the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:  it&#x27;s waterproof.  seriously!! I do underwater modeling and it was still on after 6 hours of being underwater.&lt;br /&gt;con:  that being said if you rub it or scrape it with your hands it will mess up your line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pro: it lays down color in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;con: (for me), I like to blend eyeliners so they don&#x27;t have a hard line.  But this one you can&#x27;t do that, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;smudge&amp;#34; if you try to smudge it, it will just remove that section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pro: it&#x27;s true to what you see color.  It&#x27;s white.  (which was a con for me, as it&#x27;s a tad too stark white for my taste)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i&#x27;m okay with this eye liner, but I don&#x27;t love it.  I think it&#x27;s a fair product.  if I could smudge it more I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li> this was so amazing and worth your money ! I was impressed on how well it stayed on all day . I got this for that little white corner of your eye and drag makeup to do for fun and I love it ! would buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Does the job but can be a little cakey</li>
            <li> I love this white eyeliner, I use it to highlight my lower waterline to make my eyes appear larger. Its great that it is not like a pencil, where you have to sharpen it, nope, all you have to do is twist the top. This product came in the mail fast, approx 3 days or so. Also, I love the smoothness and texture of it when applied! Would recommend this product, it is good quality, and great for highlighting eyes!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Perfect for waterline. Does not smear.</li>
            <li> Wow! Finally a white eyeliner that is easy to apply on the waterline. I&#x27;ve tried so many and this one is the best! Stays on all day.  Would buy this again!</li>
            <li> I like how smoothly it glides and its really thin and you dont need to sharpen it, wonderful! Yet It does not always wants to stay on my waterline and by the end of the day, its completely gone. It can chip and chunks of it stay.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner last year, and never got it. I also ordered the brown one and did receive it, but the white never came. It&#x27;s unfortunate because these are really great eyeliners, and I&#x27;m disappointed overall. I highly recommend the product, but maybe not this seller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a white eye pencil that would have cost you $30 from Estee Lauder. But hey, for $5, this thing is great and seriously does the job. It lasts for about 8 hours before you should reapply. The makeup itself does not feel heavy or cakey, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> I like it but its rather opaque and thick. If you get it on your lashes it won&#x27;t come off quick</li>
            <li> I love how gentle this eye pen is on my eyes. It is soft &amp;amp; visible when highlighting around my eyes. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a good basic white eyeliner for brightening up my eyes. The only downside is that it can be a bit chalky.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in white, so I can put them around my lips and rub it in. It appears to make them look bigger, saw the ideal on pinterest. You do have to apply some pressure when using the pencil. I plan on purchasing it in black to use as an eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Great color really makes my eyes look bigger and stays on the waterline flawlessly!!</li>
            <li> Before, I had Covergirl&#x27;s Flame Out (in white) and it was terrible. However, buying NYX&#x27;s Mechanical Eye Pencil is the best makeup choice I have ever made!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply, meaning that it does not scratch your eye out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is soft on the eye, it does not smear, or come off during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my bottom waterline, and it works perfectly. It has a soft small tip suitable for small details. It doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes, and stays on completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a quality eye pencil, invest the extra dollar in yourself, and don&#x27;t waste your money on another pencil that you will end up throwing away.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT MAKES MY COLORS POP</li>
            <li> Very opaque, the twisty mechanism is a bit irritating, but otherwise a great eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;I got the white color, and it actually was white, not some clearish thingamabob</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t transfer and is very pigmented. Love this</li>
            <li> I had such a hard time finding a soft creamy white eye liner. Every pencil I bought was hard, hurt my eye lids and didn&#x27;t look very nice. This stuff did the job and looks great.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005G9E98O NYX Mechanical Eye Pencil, White]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product specifically for my lower waterline and inner corners of my eyes.  I do not like wooden pencils that must be sharpened as they are so uncomfortable to apply and do not glide on quickly or easily.  Wooden pencils also seem to irritate my eyes most times.  The product shipped quickly and in tact, as promised.  It works great for this purpose (waterline) and is very waterproof.  Application was smooth and it didn&#x27;t go on too heavy but you can build up if you feel you need more color intensity.  There is no caky feeling and it did not irritate my eyes.  Eye makeup remover is needed to take it off.  I have not tried any of the other eyeliner colors as I was just looking for something to use on my waterline.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the price and quality of this eyeliner and would recommend the white for waterline usage.  I can not recommend the other colors as I have not tried them, but I plan to in the future.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love the color, i order the white to do highlighting on my eye</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing something wrong but I have no idea how the other reviewers found this &amp;#34;hard to take off&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;lasting all day&amp;#34;. I put in on the squishy side of my lower eyelid and it stays of for maybe 5 minutes before dissipating into thin air. If you draw on the DRY skin portion of your eye, for example the upper lid above the lashes, then sure it stays on all day. But the purpose of the white pencil is to make eyes appear wider by drawing underneath on the squishy part, no?</li>
            <li> I just got this item today and I tried it on... I like it ^_^ The pigment depends on how many times you run it along the water line pretty much :3 This is a MUST-BUY product :D</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to use on my waterline and it was super waxy and flaky. Unusable for my purpose :(</li>
            <li> Good eyeliner. It&#x27;s pretty opaque which is finally what I&#x27;ve been looking for in a white liner.</li>
            <li> This white eye pencil is a great product and can be used for so many things. It can be put in wrinkles to reduce their visibility, as well as in under eye circles to lighten them. It is very versatile and can truly be used in so many ways to enhance your every day look.</li>
            <li> Smudges and wears off within the first few hours. I now use it to highlight my nose and chin which works fine.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and precisely.  My daughter needed it for dancing performances and finds it easy to use.  Nice &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; white color.</li>
            <li> loved it , especially because it stayed on for a very long time. and it didn&#x27;t leave my eyes neither dry or itchy. and also it stuck very well on my upper inner-lid :-D</li>
            <li> This is a great quality product, perfect for the inner liner and corner of your eyes...just makes your eyes pop like doll eyes. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> great and an affordable product- a must have for daily use. love the thin tip, makes it easier to glide!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on as smooooothly as I would like and it not quite as long lasting either. It&#x27;ll do. I guess. I don&#x27;t even know what I did with the one I bought I just cant be bothered to care.</li>
            <li> Great product. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li> The perfect creamy white eyeliner to make your eyes pop. Super easy twist up design with a fine point. This is perfect for lining your lower lashline with to make your eyes seem bigger. No skipping or tugging and it stayed on my waterline for 12 hours WITHOUT any kind of primer. That makes it a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> Waste of time only.... I received but when it comes out its not going inside again so it&#x27;s only waste of customer mony but the color is ok</li>
            <li> A tad on the soft side which feels good and makes it glide easily, but it also let&#x27;s it break off if you extend it out too far, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Bought this to do my makeup for a costume party.  Applies easily and stays.</li>
            <li> This pencil does what its suppose to, but its on the cakey side. The pencil also crumbles and breaks easily while in use. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Waterproof, twist up so no little wood pencil shavings in my eye, looks &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; on my bottom water line or in the corners of my eyes. I have to be careful not to get it on my lower lashes---it really STAYS. But happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This product does provide a nice thin line for application around areas you are wanting to highlight.  However, it is incredibly difficult to blend, unless you like looking like an actor from the musical Cats.  I&#x27;ve used it for stage and night make up and end up rubbing it with a foam tipped make up brush for extended periods of time to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s old or not made of the best material.</li>
            <li> I apply the white liner on my waterline, and it makes my eyes appear bigger, but apply lightly if you put too much on it makes it look creepy!</li>
            <li> This is only my personal experience and opinion. I absolutely did not like this product. It was far too pigmented and made me eyes look clownish I guess and it was extremely difficult to remove it. I have the Lancome Bifacil makeup remover which I think is wonderful and it took a lot of effort to remove it. I will never use it again!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  I was looking for a white eyeliner to put on my lower water line. This pencils EXACTLY what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This is SO hard to use. It arrived so dry and as a result it&#x27;s been hidden in a drawer</li>
            <li> Pigment is very white, not like those silvery grey looking eyeliners I&#x27;ve gotten. Don&#x27;t drop it though, it will break the pencil inside</li>
            <li> LOVE!!! This pencil stays on all day, I put it on my water line.</li>
            <li> I use the white on my waterline and inner corners of my eyes. It makes them pop!!! It goes on very smooth! I don&#x27;t even need a second coat unlike most eye liners I have to go over it again a second time. It makes my blue eyes stand out. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this and it lasts!</li>
            <li> Love to underline my eye with this white eyeliner; it helps the eye look brighter. (A make-up trick I learned from a Beauty Advisor, a long time ago.) Easy-slide application, that seems a bit waterproof (no running that I can tell).  It lasts well throughout the day/evening.  AMAZON price point was great!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I needed and goes on effortlessly! No sharpener needed</li>
            <li> I needed a white eyeliner because my old one was running low. I love NYX products so when I saw this mechanical eye pencil in white, I had to buy it right away. I&#x27;m glad I did. I use this almost every single day. When I line my water line with this, my eyes look bigger, fuller, and I look much more awake. Some white eye liners don&#x27;t show up very well, especially on a water line. This one is very pigmented and shows up perfectly. It is very long lasting and I usually only have to reapply once during a 12 hour day. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product and it will be a product that I continue to repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah&lt;br /&gt;hustlababy09.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> I Bought this pencil to use as a gift and have no complaints about the product. I do not use this product myself.</li>
            <li> Purchased to use in water line for under eye brightness. VERY easily would clump in the lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Lasts long,it&#x27;s very smooth,but as some people noticed,it&#x27;s really hard to wash it off.I guess if I cry I won&#x27;t have any problems with it :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this....it doesn&#x27;t stay on the water line that long like other reviewers claim. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
