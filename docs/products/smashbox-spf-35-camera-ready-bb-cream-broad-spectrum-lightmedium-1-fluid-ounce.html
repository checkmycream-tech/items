            <li>Best coverage.</li>
            <li>It is the best foundation/moisturizer, and</li>
            <li>Gives me a flawless complexion.</li>
            <li>Yet, it is considered one of the best BECAUSE it covers almost as well as a foundation.  </li>
            <li>even water ski-ed, and it did not all wash off, so I still looked great in photos after wiping out while skiing!  </li>
            <li>My face is flawless.</li>
            <li>It just perfect.</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a perfect finish, I will recommend tinted moisturizer!!!!!</li>
            <li>Best BB Cream/foundation out there!  </li>

            <li>Arrived nice consistency - worried it would be gloppy from the heat.</li>
            <li>Excellent foundation at reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best bb cream out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells good (like a good sunscreen) very beachy&lt;br /&gt;Has SPF 35 which will help protect your face&lt;</li>
            <li>Which is ok, because once summer gets here it will match up perfectly)&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>She must love it because I keep having to order it for her.  </li>
            <li>Love that it does not feel caked on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great over the Photo Finish Primer, and I can really tell a difference in the look.  </li>
            <li>The light/medium is great since I have been in the sun a lot and have developed a nice tan.</li>
            <li>so much more all wrapped up in one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it but haven&#x27;t found anything unlike better.  </li>
            <li>Always love this.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this cream is, no one can tell that I am wearing anything.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s supposed to match skin tones better.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s way more silky</li>
            <li>and they offer more product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love BB cream and thus is tinted.</li>
            <li>it have a nice coverage, perfect for everyday usage.</li>
            <li>but covers all the spots and, is  light makes your skin breath and lasts for more than 8 hours</li>
            <li>it seems in terms of shade, and it does a great job in keeping your skin looking natural and matte.</li>
            <li>went through it very quickly.</li>
            <li>Smooth application, and hides blemishes,</li>
            <li>I can use it alone as light coverage</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light medium during the winter.</li>
            <li>I would not consider this light to medium.  </li>
            <li>light skinned, pass.  </li>
            <li>light was available, then I might give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li>Color match was good for a medium toned Asian girl.</li>
            <li>smashbox is probably great if you have oily skin but for those of us with regular-dry skin, this stuff doesn&#x27;t compare to other formulas out there.  </li>
            <li>This brush in particular is great with offering a very sheer look.</li>
            <li>dry, use a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried a lot of korean bb creams and so far i think this one works better than them all.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many BB creams before, for my sensitive oily skin combi, but none worked so far, I came across this one in ulta, tried it , fell in love with it since then</li>
            <li>, my face stays fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I spent an hour at sephora sampling the different brands and this has the best coverage since it&#x27;s buildable.</li>
            <li>I own several shades depending on the season.</li>
            <li>This product is very good, but I need to warn you, the light medium color is a little too dark, looks more like a just medium tone.</li>
            <li>Gives a fresh finish which is very desirable to me!</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use thanks to SpF.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first BB cream I have used</li>
            <li>Love this product, especially living at the beach.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and I notice a difference in control when using this item, along with the Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Primer and Halo Hydrating Powder, versus many other items I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Smashbox makes great products, this was just not a good fit for my mature skin.</li>
            <li>At first the product seems greasy but it sets very well.</li>
            <li>Love how it has such a high SPF too.</li>
            <li>first&lt;br /&gt;You need to work fast when you</li>
            <li>I like the light coverage it provides but only during the day.  </li>
            <li>but I mix it into my daily moisturizer and the result is fabulous.</li>
            <li>have VERY oily skin, so, NO foundation has ever given me a matte look that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I like it enough to buy the light color one and probably will have to mix both.</li>
            <li>This product really delivers.</li>
            <li>This cream is very flexible</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>This item is pricier than other cosmetics I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a tan-ish, cool toned chinese girl with oily skin (and large pores) and bb creams are often too light and grey.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this product again but may experiment with a different shade because sometimes the medium seems too orange without my foundation on top.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading all of the wonderful things about BB, no big deal and expensive.</li>
            <li>The price seems a but high.</li>
            <li>For me it was okay to sacrifice a little bit of color matching for the moisturizing and sun protection effects.</li>
            <li>Got to my house, and because it was warm during shipping, it had already started leaking everywhere and was a gross mess.  </li>
            <li>Since I live at the beach</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Laura Mercier&#x27;s tinted moisturizer and I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural alone</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I have found that ANY foundation makes my skin break out.  </li>
            <li>When first applied it looks yellow and</li>
            <li>so far no irritations or acne breakouts so 5 stars!</li>
            <li>so far I like this cream!</li>
            <li>This was my first bb cream, I saw a commercial and was sold.</li>
            <li>This has the coverage of a light foundation, and makes my skin look very matte and dull.  </li>
            <li>, you still get a natural shine and it looks like you are wearing no makeup at all.</li>
            <li>I tried Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream recently in a trial size and was amazed at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>I do not need to blot as early or as often.  </li>
            <li>Like and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I have unusually sensitive skin - it still caused me to break out.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and I am constantly in and out of the sun.</li>

            <li> I have very oily skin, and I am constantly in and out of the sun.</li>
            <li> Same as Loreal-no better-defintiely not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty expensive for only 1 oz!</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter uses this everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with acne and oily skin due to hormonal imbalance.</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> And so in the summer, with sweat, and the heat, it does become greasy and gets on anything that touches my face, unless I absorb my oil/grease with powder or other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m latina, with a medium complexion and during the summer I get dark and this color fits me all throughout the year.</li>
            <li> This is dark, for a light/medium it is on the dark side.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little too thick for my personal liking</li>
            <li> It casts a slightly brown/yellow-toned glow without increasing blemish coverage.</li>
            <li> A little drying in the winter</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little cheaper</li>
            <li> This product feels too heavy.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t do heavy makeup, just bb cream and compact, I pair bb cream with Tarte powder, its a clay based powder, so it absorbs the oil on my face</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> I do not use any other foundation nor primer with this, this is truly the all in one product and it lasts!!!</li>
            <li> price is a little bit crazy, but a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I am a male with BAD acne scars.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> SOOO expensive!  </li>

            <li> I used this for the first time today &amp; I&#x27;ll list pros and cons based on my personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells good (like a good sunscreen) very beachy&lt;br /&gt;Has SPF 35 which will help protect your face&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for the summer&lt;br /&gt;Great color (even though I accidentally picked up a shade a tiny bit darker than my skin tone.. Which is ok, because once summer gets here it will match up perfectly)&lt;br /&gt;Can be worn AS your foundation for a sunny/pool day&lt;br /&gt;Lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very dry, use a good moisturizer and/or primer first&lt;br /&gt;You need to work fast when you apply!&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little bit crazy, but a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I need to pick up a good moisturizer until the summer heat kicks in and I&#x27;ll be loving this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product feels too heavy. When first applied it looks yellow and after only 30 min it leaves a shine on my skin which makes it appear I am sweaty. It&#x27;s gross.</li>
            <li> Best coverage. Good product</li>
            <li> LOVE SMASHBOX PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li> Smooth application, and hides blemishes, well.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with acne and oily skin due to hormonal imbalance. At first the product seems greasy but it sets very well. I can use it alone as light coverage but it does not totally cover acne scars. It works best with my Mark Kay medium coverage foundation on top. Since I live at the beach and it&#x27;s hot I like the light coverage it provides but only during the day.  It looks very natural alone, you still get a natural shine and it looks like you are wearing no makeup at all. It&#x27;s the first BB cream I have used and I love it. I am spanish/olive toned and use the medium shade. I would definitely buy this product again but may experiment with a different shade because sometimes the medium seems too orange without my foundation on top.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter uses this everyday.  She must love it because I keep having to order it for her.  It does a great job of matching her skin tone, blends nicely and doesn&#x27;t make her break out.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a lot of korean bb creams and so far i think this one works better than them all. It does feel a little too thick for my personal liking but I mix it into my daily moisturizer and the result is fabulous. so far no irritations or acne breakouts so 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It casts a slightly brown/yellow-toned glow without increasing blemish coverage. Will do for my purposes when I don&#x27;t mind looking a tad darker. Feels great. Don&#x27;t need to re-apply. Just not &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; cosmetically. I&#x27;m Asian and medium toned. Suggest trying in store first if you&#x27;re not sure. For me it was okay to sacrifice a little bit of color matching for the moisturizing and sun protection effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m latina, with a medium complexion and during the summer I get dark and this color fits me all throughout the year. Love that it does not feel caked on my face.</li>
            <li> SOOO expensive!  Got to my house, and because it was warm during shipping, it had already started leaking everywhere and was a gross mess.  No thanks!</li>
            <li> I tried Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream recently in a trial size and was amazed at how well it worked.  It&#x27;s great over the Photo Finish Primer, and I can really tell a difference in the look.  I have very oily skin, and I notice a difference in control when using this item, along with the Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Primer and Halo Hydrating Powder, versus many other items I have tried.  I do not need to blot as early or as often.  This item is pricier than other cosmetics I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;be been using it since almost two years .. it have a nice coverage, perfect for everyday usage.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many BB creams before, for my sensitive oily skin combi, but none worked so far, I came across this one in ulta, tried it , fell in love with it since then, it is a bit shiny yes, but covers all the spots and, is  light makes your skin breath and lasts for more than 8 hours, I don&#x27;t do heavy makeup, just bb cream and compact, I pair bb cream with Tarte powder, its a clay based powder, so it absorbs the oil on my face , my face stays fresh all day.</li>
            <li> The light/medium is great since I have been in the sun a lot and have developed a nice tan.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it. It is the best foundation/moisturizer, and so much more all wrapped up in one. Gives me a flawless complexion.</li>
            <li> My savior in the morning! Easy to apply and looks great! You are sure to be picture perfect when you wear this</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I have found that ANY foundation makes my skin break out.  This is NOT a foundation, it&#x27;s a BB cream.  Yet, it is considered one of the best BECAUSE it covers almost as well as a foundation.  I got a sample from Sephora, tried it for several weeks to verify that it would not make me break out, and have been using it for years since with no issue, EVERY DAY, ALL DAY.  So, I do NOT know what people are talking about that this makes your skin break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY oily skin, so, NO foundation has ever given me a matte look that lasts all day.  And so in the summer, with sweat, and the heat, it does become greasy and gets on anything that touches my face, unless I absorb my oil/grease with powder or other means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have swam with it, even water ski-ed, and it did not all wash off, so I still looked great in photos after wiping out while skiing!  HA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line:  TRY it for yourself!</li>
            <li> so far I like this cream!</li>
            <li> Love how my skin looks and feels when I use this product! Like and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have unusually sensitive skin - it still caused me to break out.  Color match was good for a medium toned Asian girl.</li>
            <li> A little drying in the winter</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  I don&#x27;t love it but haven&#x27;t found anything unlike better.  The price seems a but high.</li>
            <li> Smashbox makes great products, this was just not a good fit for my mature skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all of the wonderful things about BB, no big deal and expensive. Don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat Momn</li>
            <li> This product is very good, but I need to warn you, the light medium color is a little too dark, looks more like a just medium tone. I like it enough to buy the light color one and probably will have to mix both. It doesn&#x27;t control oil too good but skin looks so freaking beautiful, healthy and glowy, huge deference!!! Try it</li>
            <li> Because has all the ingredients that I like.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it arrived on time and well pack.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make my face oily.&lt;br /&gt;It matches with my completion.&lt;br /&gt;Sun block</li>
            <li> Always love this. Arrived nice consistency - worried it would be gloppy from the heat.</li>
            <li> Good but I seems darker then what I remembered buying in store same color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tan-ish, cool toned chinese girl with oily skin (and large pores) and bb creams are often too light and grey. I spent an hour at sephora sampling the different brands and this has the best coverage since it&#x27;s buildable. I&#x27;m a light medium during the winter. It&#x27;s not greasy and goes on matte.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Laura Mercier&#x27;s tinted moisturizer and I wanted to try something new. This product really delivers. My face is flawless. No breakouts. It just perfect. However, if you are looking for a perfect finish, I will recommend tinted moisturizer!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, especially living at the beach. One step process of moisturizer, sunscreen, and foundation is a great time saver. Gives a fresh finish which is very desirable to me!</li>
            <li> Same as Loreal-no better-defintiely not worth the price.  Would have bought Lancome had I known.  Won&#x27;t purchase this again.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> I am a male with BAD acne scars. I have no shame in admitting that I use this to cover them up because I&#x27;d rather have people not focusing on the spots on my face, yes I have insecurities so this is my solution. My favorite thing about this cream is, no one can tell that I am wearing anything. Not to mention this has SPF in it, offering some protection from the sun. I have very oily skin, and I am constantly in and out of the sun. This cream is very flexible it seems in terms of shade, and it does a great job in keeping your skin looking natural and matte. I apply this with the Sephora Stippling Brush #44. This brush in particular is great with offering a very sheer look. So if you are a male and don&#x27;t want people to see that you&#x27;re wearing make up, I suggest you get this brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but it&#x27;s pretty expensive for only 1 oz! I think I&#x27;m going to try dr. brandt bb cream next time....it&#x27;s a little cheaper and it&#x27;s supposed to match skin tones better. We&#x27;ll see....</li>
            <li> Best BB Cream/foundation out there!  Love how it has such a high SPF too.</li>
            <li> I would not consider this light to medium.  It is definitely medium, so if you&lt;br /&gt;are light skinned, pass.  I have to use another bb cream formula to tone it down.&lt;br /&gt;If light was available, then I might give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> This is dark, for a light/medium it is on the dark side.</li>
            <li> So happy I discovered this!!! This is by far the best bb cream out there. I have combination skin and it does make me break out and has buildable coverage if u choose to use it as a foundation coverage! Does a great job!! I own several shades depending on the season. I do not use any other foundation nor primer with this, this is truly the all in one product and it lasts!!! Beautiful results and easy to blend with a sponge, brush, or your fingers!</li>
            <li> This was my first bb cream, I saw a commercial and was sold. I used to think this stuff was great.  I used it all the time..UNTIL I got a sample of the stila illuminator bb cream.  Then I realized maybe it isn&#x27;t the best thing..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smashbox is probably great if you have oily skin but for those of us with regular-dry skin, this stuff doesn&#x27;t compare to other formulas out there.  Stila and TooFaced both make a BB cream that&#x27;s way more silky, they let your skin breath and they offer more product.  This one tends to dry/flake, especially if you don&#x27;t put on moisturizer underneath.  The coverage is also something of a bother.  Being younger I like my skin to show through, which is why I chose a BB cream vs foundation.  This has the coverage of a light foundation, and makes my skin look very matte and dull.  I get complements on my skin without this on, rather than with.  So, eventually I found Stila&#x27;s BB cream and that&#x27;s a 10 for me.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to primer/ foundation again. I love this product. I read about it and decided to give it a try. I will recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> this one last longer just need to be mix with the lighter one for my complextion</li>
            <li> Love BB cream and thus is tinted. Great for everyday use thanks to SpF.</li>
            <li> went through it very quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent foundation at reasonable cost.</li>
