            <li> A big plus is when your nails grow it&#x27;s not very noticeable (vs red or any darker colors).</li>
            <li> Very pale color, almost clear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit sheer, so I can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I usually coat with base, then one coat of this nail polish and a top coat.</li>
            <li> I could see a slight pink tint if I looked hard, but that was it.</li>
            <li> One of my nails is a little discolored from an accident with a door years ago.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I ordered, had the same name on the sticker but was the wrong color in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I can&#x27;t wear this until this strange discoloration grows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes they can get a little thick and goopy as they age, but that happens with any polish!</li>
            <li> I hate pink</li>
            <li> so sad!</li>

            <li> If you are looking a for natural color buy it! I usually coat with base, then one coat of this nail polish and a top coat. Lasts for a week (and I do dishes, cooking, cleaning etc.) without chipping. Brings very natural and clean look. A big plus is when your nails grow it&#x27;s not very noticeable (vs red or any darker colors).</li>
            <li> My mother loves this color. I got it for her for Christmas. Its a great &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; color which can be used as a staple.</li>
            <li> Better color in the bottle as it&#x27;s almost colorless on the nail .  Three costs should give your nails a pinky blush.</li>
            <li> i have been using this same make and color for years, its excellent and goes on very sheer and way less pink than in the bottle almost nude in color</li>
            <li> Very pale color, almost clear.  Great consistency and stays on several days.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this as the color on the outside was perfect but i put 3 coats on and it was still only like off white.  so sad!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but was so upset with the color I had to post about it. Sugar Daddy seemed like a cute light color for Spring, but after 3 coats I could not tell that I had painted my nails. I could see a slight pink tint if I looked hard, but that was it. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color for bare nails. It is basically the color used under most french manicures. Great value for Essie polish.</li>
            <li> Love this polish, perfect shade of light creamy pink</li>
            <li> Pretty! I am wearing this nail polish during nursing school. It lasts about 2 weeks with no chipping and I get alot of compliments on the color.</li>
            <li> This gives the look of nails that have just had a french manicure. It is that clearish pinkish look that looks natural and pretty. I hate pink but this is beautiful if you like the natural look. It also does not chip for a week or longer which is a must for all nail polish.</li>
            <li> Beautiful natural color. Two coats and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This polish is very pretty. It&#x27;s a little bit sheer, so I can&#x27;t wear it. One of my nails is a little discolored from an accident with a door years ago. Because this polish is a bit sheet, you can see she discoloration through it, so draws attention to the nail. I wear polish to cover this nail. Sadly, I can&#x27;t wear this until this strange discoloration grows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have perfect nails, and you like a somewhat sheer coat, try this.</li>
            <li> My fav neutral. PERFECR under a French mani!</li>
            <li> Typically love Essie polishes. Sometimes they can get a little thick and goopy as they age, but that happens with any polish! I didn&#x27;t love the color Sugar Daddy. I didn&#x27;t realize that this was a sheer polish. You can apply several coats (3-4) and you can still see through it.</li>
