            <li>A favorite of mine for 13 years.  </li>
            <li>Favorite shampoo and conditioner set</li>
            <li>Using just the oil with a different set of shampoo and conditioner works wonderfully, though.</li>
            <li>was delivered super quick.... great price...</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone;it works great on all hair types.</li>
            <li>All three of these products have improved the feel of my hair, they smell absolutely wonderful, and now my hair is much healthier... plus, the price has gone down to about $20... GREAT BARGAIN.  </li>
            <li>The silk therapy, however, is pretty nice...</li>
            <li>I decided to try it, and now I am hooked (not annoying).</li>
            <li>Just for the Silk Therapy, it&#x27;s more than worth the $28.  </li>
            <li>This product immediately put a silky quality to what originally felt like straw.  </li>
            <li>THE SMELL IS TREMENDOUS TOO.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product for grey or silver hair.</li>

            <li>and she really likes that.</li>
            <li>the shampoo &amp; conditioner feel about like most other shampoo &amp; conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I know that this is typically $15-$20 in most salon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This product works great for dry hair ,and the silk therapy alone usually costs about $20.00 .</li>
            <li>Out of all the CHI products I&#x27;ve tried, these were the least effective as far as the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are fine but the silk drops have been watered down.</li>
            <li>These \\&quot;drops\\&quot; poured into my hand like water and even the scent was light as though it were watered down.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone except someone with limp fine hair.  </li>

            <li> My main reason for using these products is due to the Bio Silk Therapy.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s far less for that product and the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair is a little dry, but oily since I workout everyday and hence have to clean it everyday.  </li>
            <li> after rinsing it out my hair felt dry.      </li>
            <li> For a bottle that large, I would have to pay at least $40 here at home!  </li>
            <li> I used to use Loreal shampoo and conditioner for curly hair but since they have f-ed up the formula a few years back it also f-ed up my hair.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> She has naturally wavy hair and was raving about this product daily until I was tired of hearing about it.</li>
            <li> ANY OTHER STORE CHARGES AN ARM AND A LEG</li>
            <li> Large bottles of BioSilk serum are expensive</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> (because im use to paying $12 for a very small bottle of serum only....) I will be buying from here from now on!!!!!</li>
            <li> I agree it leaves it a little tangly, but if you can get over that</li>
            <li> She said it dried out her hair &amp; the serum made her hair look oily.</li>
            <li> AND THE PRICE IS UNBELIEVABLE!</li>
            <li> the conditioner was very poor - it felt like it had no slip agent for detangling.  </li>
            <li> Either way, my long hair gets tangled and is horrible to brush through until the Silk Therapy is added.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my wife &amp; she really hated it.</li>

            <li> I first purchased the Silk Therapy at a salon, as suggested by the hair stylist, for my dry damaged bleached hair.  This product immediately put a silky quality to what originally felt like straw.  I saw this 3 pack (shampoo, conditioner and silk therapy) for about $33 on Amazon...and thought I was getting a bargain, since the smaller therapy at the salon was over $20.  All three of these products have improved the feel of my hair, they smell absolutely wonderful, and now my hair is much healthier... plus, the price has gone down to about $20... GREAT BARGAIN.  I would recommend this product to anyone except someone with limp fine hair.  It is great to protect the hair against blowdrying and curling iron damage as well.</li>
            <li> I have thick,curly hair, and Biosilk works great on it.It keeps it soft and shiny,and just beautiful.this product can be pricey,but for all three,Amazon&#x27;s price cannot be beat.I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone;it works great on all hair types.</li>
            <li> If your looking for BioSilk in a decent sized bottle for a good price, this is it! Large bottles of BioSilk serum are expensive so your basicaly getting 3 products for the price of one! The shampoo and conditioner worked alright, I didn&#x27;t notice an amazing difference in my hair moisture but the serum works great, I use it all the time and it will last. Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> My main reason for using these products is due to the Bio Silk Therapy.  The Silk Therapy is great for many reason, but my main reason is to un tangle my hair after a ride on our Harley or my horses!  Either way, my long hair gets tangled and is horrible to brush through until the Silk Therapy is added.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it would help my hair after it had been fried by a stylist. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t detangle, and the \\&quot;shine serum\\&quot; leaves your hair feeling greasy enough to fry food in it. Biggest waste of money I have ever spent. Wouldn&#x27;t bother with it again for free!</li>
            <li> OMG!!! THIS IS A MUST HAVE AND THE PRICE IS UNBELIEVABLE! ANY OTHER STORE CHARGES AN ARM AND A LEG JUST FOR THE SILK THERAPY ALONE. I LOVE THIS AND IF I SEEN THIS OFFER AGAIN I WOULD BUY IT W.NO HESITATION. THIS PRODUCT MAKES YOUR HAIR SO SOFT AND FULL OF BODY AND BOUNCE. THE SILK THEARPY ISN&#x27;T ONLY FOR YOUR HAIR, YOU CAN USE IT AS A OIL FOR YOUR SKIN. THE SMELL IS TREMENDOUS TOO.</li>
            <li> the shampoo &amp; conditioner feel about like most other shampoo &amp; conditioners.  the serum works good in very small doses &amp; not used everyday, my hair felt very oily.  it smells very good though.  overall, I would not spend the money again for these products, next time I will get pantene, it makes my hair feel softer.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife &amp; she really hated it. She used it for about a month &amp; had to stop. She said it dried out her hair &amp; the serum made her hair look oily. It also never hid the fly aways which is why I got this for her in the first place. I ended up buying her the Nexxus damage control and she really likes that.</li>
            <li> Biosilk is awesome.  Very good for my hair.  It is good if you want smooth hair.  I use it before I straighten my hair to protect it from damage.  I intend to buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have used these BIO SILK products for may years, and......they are still the best products to buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MDR</li>
            <li> I used to use Loreal shampoo and conditioner for curly hair but since they have f-ed up the formula a few years back it also f-ed up my hair. One of my friends told me about this product. She has naturally wavy hair and was raving about this product daily until I was tired of hearing about it. I decided to try it, and now I am hooked (not annoying). If you have curly hair give it a go. It can be a bit expensive but well worth it. Trust me :)</li>
            <li> Excellent value !! This product works great for dry hair ,and the silk therapy alone usually costs about $20.00 .</li>
            <li> the conditioner was very poor - it felt like it had no slip agent for detangling.  after rinsing it out my hair felt dry.      the main product, a hair serum, is excellent however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good shampoo for a while.  My hair is a little dry, but oily since I workout everyday and hence have to clean it everyday.  This shampoo and conditioner works great on my hair.  I agree it leaves it a little tangly, but if you can get over that it works awesome.  BTW this is the first product I was so happy about that I wanted to review</li>
            <li> i was so happy n couldnt wait for this product to arrive n once i got it.i applied the silk theraphy to my to hair right away but i noticed  right away that this biosilk suck because its not really the same from the one i bought from the salon.this might be a little cheaper but its not 100 percent pure n silky.its watery,sticky n oily.i wouldnt order it again.</li>
            <li> was delivered super quick.... great price... (because im use to paying $12 for a very small bottle of serum only....) I will be buying from here from now on!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this trio pack from a Target store. The shampoo and conditioner are fine but the silk drops have been watered down. I buy the silk drops regularly and they have an oily consistency. These \\&quot;drops\\&quot; poured into my hand like water and even the scent was light as though it were watered down. I can&#x27;t speak for ordering online but I can assure you that when shopping for this product, you should be sure it&#x27;s sealed and not tampered with.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product for grey or silver hair. Makes it sparkle.</li>
            <li> Out of all the CHI products I&#x27;ve tried, these were the least effective as far as the shampoo and conditioner. The silk therapy, however, is pretty nice...I&#x27;ve actually seen people use it on their hair as a finishing product and even on the skin.</li>
            <li> Just for the Silk Therapy, it&#x27;s more than worth the $28.  For a bottle that large, I would have to pay at least $40 here at home!  So it&#x27;s far less for that product and the shampoo and conditioner are an incredible bonus and very good products.</li>
            <li> Great product at awesome price!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my sister and she is in love!  I might get one for me!</li>
            <li> A favorite of mine for 13 years.  Smells wonderful and keeps my long hair in good shape.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT A GREAT BARGAIN</li>
            <li> I have used the silk therapy in the past and loved it.I saw the conditioner in the store on clearance for $5.00 so I didn&#x27;t hesitate and grabbed it.  I know that this is typically $15-$20 in most salon&#x27;s. After going home and trying the conditioner I definitely will buy this trio!!</li>
            <li> Favorite shampoo and conditioner set</li>
            <li> Obviously, different hair and skin types will react differently to hair products, but the shampoo and conditioner made my hair oily. Even without using any other products or the oil and washing every day or every other day, it was too rich for my hair with consistent use. Using just the oil with a different set of shampoo and conditioner works wonderfully, though.</li>
