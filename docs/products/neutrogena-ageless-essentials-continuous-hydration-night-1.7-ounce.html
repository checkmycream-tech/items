            <li>I think it&#x27;s nice hydration cream.</li>

            <li>I tried to buy many band name for night cream, i want to find good one just like for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice fragrance.</li>

            <li>Nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>when i wake up in the morning my skin feels so nice.</li>
            <li>This cream is super light, smells wonderful, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Though, truth be told,</li>
            <li>Not thick and greasy, perfect for my skin!</li>
            <li>It smelled good and felt fine going on</li>
            <li>I expect Neutrogena products to be fragrance free and good for one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy putting on a good moisturizer at night and</li>
            <li>, the light night cream is a superior product.</li>

            <li>It feels great going on, smells nice and really moisturizers my skin.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, goes on nice and smooth without any grease.</li>
            <li>the weather warms, I find this cream is most suitable for summer weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent.</li>

            <li>This product seems to be priced accordingly &amp; keeps my skin looking great, I&#x27;ll certainly be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s for your face, I use it mostly on my hands</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light smell that didn&#x27;t bother me or my boyfriend once in bed.</li>

            <li>I really love it and have used up 2 bottles already.</li>
            <li>It does seem OK for day wear though, or under make up.  </li>

            <li>My skin does feel and look better in the morning with it.</li>
            <li>One of the biggest problems with many creams is the odor, but that&#x27;s a problem with Ageless Essentials.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;While the nighttime use seemed to help, I think this product is better suited for daytime use.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Subscribe &amp; Save program.</li>
            <li>Also, the texture seems more suited for a pump; I worry that if the jar were tipped or dropped, product would spill everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this night cream for at night or on days when I&#x27;m giving my skin a break from makeup.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I have a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li>In the morning I find my face looks healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels more youthful now.  </li>

            <li>It is nice amd smooth.</li>
            <li>I love anything from Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>Glad I listened to my gut.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way my skin feels every morning I love wearing this my husband loves smelling my face too ^.^</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of use, however, it was as if my skin got used to the lotion and was able to reap</li>
            <li>The stinging went away and the lotion did a much better job at combatting itchy skin and flaking.  </li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>Used this product many years.  </li>
            <li>It is an ok moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been many, many months.  </li>
            <li>Still Love the product, but now it&#x27;snot prime.  </li>
            <li>I love this night cream.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>at night and feel water on your skin .i love it</li>
            <li>Never tried a night creams before but my skin is feeling so much better.</li>
            <li>Giving if more time.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m looking for something I like better.</li>
            <li>For the lasting effect it does a good job, doing an excellent job or moisturizing and leaving a clean, smooth feel.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice night time moisturizer, with a very soothing scent.  </li>
            <li>This night cream is light and the mild scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>When I applied the goo it went on effortlessly and smelled pretty good.</li>
            <li>EspeciAlly good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Good overall cream, good addition to the Neutrogena line.</li>
            <li>Very light, smooth to go on, no fragrance smell.   </li>
            <li>It feels very nice, and my skin feels nice the next morning as well!</li>
            <li>My skin gets very dry in spots, but is greasy in others, and this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>It is truly fragrance free and absorbs better.</li>
            <li>I have not been a good , faithful proponent of any product because I could not see much difference in them, in texture or effect.</li>
            <li>There is a strong perfume.  </li>
            <li>Just seemed too strong and it bothered me.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered very fast and it has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with combination skin who&#x27;s been having issues with finding a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it is light and clean feeling!</li>
            <li>but this product is very nice if you&#x27;re just looking for something light for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried this Neutrogena product and really liked this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Cool, refreshing and it works.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say per se if it improves wrinkles, mostly because I don&#x27;t have many (but then, that may well be because I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena my whole life!)     </li>
            <li>However, because I already have fine lines around my mouth and along my forehead</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m still not convinced of its &#x27;fine line reducing claims.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Even though my fine lines are still noticable</li>
            <li>This one is not too strong (important for a night creme).  </li>
            <li>THe Ageless Essentials has a wonderful texture to it, not greasy but very soothing and it disappears into my skin leaving it feeling plump and not dry in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product, it is very light for a night time moisturizer, i used it in morning also,it absorbs quickly and makes my face feel smooth and fresh...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a medium viscosity creamy feel and really smells nice and light.</li>
            <li>This product does not irritate my acne at all, which is a huge plus, along with its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so creamy and light that you will love it, especially when you notice good results, which come immediately when you start using it.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been trying to find that \\&quot;just right\\&quot; daytime moisturizer that will make my skin smooth for makeup, stay hydrated during the day, but not be greasy or cause breakouts or irritation.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on smoothly...</li>
            <li>NOT fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s light purple.</li>
            <li>But it sure doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s being absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>The texture is light, I don&#x27;&#x27;t like that greasy feeling which does not have.</li>
            <li>every since I began using this after my nightly face wash routine, my skin feels softer, it&#x27;s blemish free</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and within 2 days</li>
            <li>the morning I rinse it off and have smooth skin and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Palm Desert, California to be precise.</li>
            <li>I experienced some stinging, especially when using this after an exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li>We like how smooth the lotion is when you apply it onto to your face and as you spread it around.</li>
            <li>I wish Neutrogena would make fragrance free</li>
            <li>This cream is light and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin nice and soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Tones up skin and keeps skin soft does not burn or gives any sensation what so ever, a good  cream, mywife says so you can try it .</li>
            <li>the price the quantity is good, compared to others that are good, but give you very little for the price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anybody who is looking for an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving how soft this leaves my skin and how easy it makes applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the product it sure looked liquid-y.</li>
            <li>, the price is not bad, and the product is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The price is great, I only paid about $11, also liked the soft smell.</li>
            <li>It is not a heavy, cakey moisturizer; on the contrary it is easily absorbed, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t get oily during the sleep cycle.</li>
            <li>no matter how clean your hands are you never know what is growing inside the jar.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is that after giving my skin some time to get used to this product it did a great job of moisturizing my dry and flakey skin.  </li>
            <li>works great and keeps my skin moist some products tend to break out my skin or leave dry patches this seems to help with both.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy and it keep my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Bought many times and will continue to !</li>
            <li>The biggest plus for me, though, is that this product is easy to find and priced right.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and works great on very dry and somewhat wrinkled skin.</li>
            <li>On the bright side I did find my daily morning moisturizer!!</li>
            <li>I really think my skin looks and feels much better, the tone and the texture has improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a light, fresh scent, but a scent nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>like the quality and price, good simply night cream for my skin.</li>
            <li>When I used to see an old wrinkled lower face, now I see a nice looking woman.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full benefits.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite face cream: light, smooth texture; pleasant, subtle odor.</li>
            <li>An older person would probably want something more suited to their needs.</li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>I like it very much, feels so comfortable, maybe that&#x27;s why they increase the price.</li>
            <li>It hits in the 100&#x27;s most days during the summer months and this place, with its high winds can make a man look like leather faster than you can say &#x27;Michael Caine&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I kid you not, the VERY next morning my skin was already better!</li>
            <li>I have used this every night ever since I first tried this product!  </li>
            <li>My face used to get dry after washing my makeup off at night, especially around my eyes, and this cream keeps my skin perfectly hydrated.</li>
            <li>I always try to buy products with a very light scent or no scent at all, otherwise I would get a headache, and this cream clearly wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s Continuous Hydration Ageless Essentials formula is very soothing and light.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some similar products she has used, this cream had no adverse odor, went on nicely</li>
            <li>I use this cream every night, just to help moisturize my skin and keep it soft and looking healthy, and it works.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, disappears almost instantly, and provides a continuous, energetic lift to the skin.    </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 71 years old &amp; have been using this for many years.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The cracked skin from the night before had fresh nonstinging skin in its place.</li>
            <li>and i love it so far.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice and light feel and spreads easily, however, it did not moisturize as well as my other facial moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I tried numerous lotions from neutrogena and other makers but this one was the best.</li>
            <li>Because it soaks right in, you can apply powder almost immediately.</li>
            <li>This cream has a pleasing scent and the right price.</li>
            <li>one right here changed my mind.</li>
            <li>It soaks in right away and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>, it also soaks into smoothly right away</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light without being full of air, and sucks right into your skin and leaves it feeling supple &amp; hydrated all day, but still feeling really nice and clean.</li>
            <li>many different facial products, trying to find a good combination for my very mixed-type skin.</li>
            <li>I was using the Neutrogena Light Night Cream for years, but started having too many dry patches.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to smell, and this product has a light pleasing fragrance that disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>At first I was not crazy about this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Non greasy &amp; it&#x27;s very cooling when I apply it at night, absorbing quick too!</li>
            <li>It not only goes on smooth and light</li>
            <li>, the coverage is good and it is also  grease less.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>but after it soaked into my skin (which was very fast) it didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li>This product does not have an odor and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>So this is probably a fine product for anyone who is not too sensitive to the richer skin care products.  </li>
            <li>So I was excited to have the opportunity to try this new</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful night cream than, unlikely many other products, goes on with a light, silky feel.  </li>
            <li>It is silky, non-greasy at all, very easy to absorb, keep my skin soft and young.</li>
            <li>This face cream is actually quite lovely.</li>
            <li>When I first used it I was concerned that it felt a bit greasy</li>
            <li>So as a lifelong Neutrogena babe, I can say this is a nice cream.</li>
            <li>I happen to love it, and I even use that cream for the back of my hands (never too soon to start working on the anti-aging all over!)    </li>
            <li>Seems to smooth my skin and keep it looking young.  </li>
            <li>Yes it is a nice LIGHT feeling moisturizer, HOWEVER I also had a few pimples develop!</li>
            <li>As a basic night cream, I thought this was ok.</li>
            <li>This would be an ok night cream for someone younger without a lot of aging issues.........</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>is, now if I could get rid of my double chin, I would be in heaven!   :)</li>
            <li>Love this cream it goes with the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion Holiday Bonus Pack purchased at the same time.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Neutrogena!</li>
            <li>Before purchasing it I read several reviews and many people indicated that they used it not just at night but during the day too.  </li>
            <li>First, let me just tell you that my wife just shook her head at me and said I was vain, but I soldiered on regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it gets to summer every year as I get pretty</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell funny or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it is not greasy and my skin just drinks it in!</li>
            <li>This is the first I have tested out this night cream from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>The size is bigger than most creams on the market.</li>
            <li>I love it, and use it daily, after cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li>Love Neutrogena but wish they would bring back the moisturizer with copper.  </li>
            <li>In just a few words, she \\&quot;loved it\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Loved it at first, but small breakout occurred, not sure if this cream caused it, but I am giving it more time to be sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really moisturizing and make my skin soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>With this Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration cream, my face feels smooth and soft, and I only need light powder and blush.  </li>
            <li>I will stick with Neutrogena  as long as it is available!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily with a faint and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, have been using it for a long time and find it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily and leaves no residue, and feels really nice on my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Conintuous Hydration Night Moisturizer (whew, I think I got a few more wrinkles and gray hairs in the time it took to type that ridiculously long product name) is not quite Botox in a bottle, but it is a light, greaseless moisturizer that leaves the skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice on the skin, maybe a little light/quick absorbing for a night cream.</li>
            <li>It is light enough to use throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel or much shine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Non-greasy and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>hydrates really well</li>
            <li>and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>This really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really have to worry about clogged pores or feeling oily.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for two years and it really makes the lines disappear.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>But, after using this for a couple weeks, I now don&#x27;t mind the scent as much.  </li>
            <li>I use this both day and night; it&#x27;s plenty light enough to wear during the day under makeup.</li>
            <li>I discovered this at a drug store several years ago and was distressed to find it no longer available there.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating and doesnt make my face oily.</li>
            <li>This one is so gentle</li>
            <li>I think this product is not oily and hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I just really wish it was unscented.</li>
            <li>This really does as it implies, making your face feel hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Very efffective at providing moisture and continuing into the morning when it can be applied for the day also.  </li>
            <li>Lovely, affordable night cream that is not too heavy or greasy and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>to much fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and gentle.</li>
            <li>It has a light feel and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin problems even with regular use.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel much firmer</li>
            <li>My skin is very picky about the cream I put on it.</li>
            <li>I have tried at least seven other products that did not work for my skin, but this one did and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Irritation free, long wearing lightweight moisture .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not oily, very light, fast absorbing and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>This night cream is a pretty decent product, but it has a fragrance, which isn&#x27;t what sensitive skin needs.  </li>
            <li>Other reviews called it a \\&quot;light, fresh scent\\&quot;, but to me it smells like old lady Avon products.</li>
            <li>There is a slight scent to the cream, which probably won&#x27;t bother most people, but I do have allergies to scents, so I don&#x27;t use it every night.</li>
            <li>My shipment arrived, I used it that night and now my skin is back to feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this product really absorbs into my skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Not dry or oily, just right.</li>
            <li>I would look at something with a little more moisturizing power.  </li>
            <li>That seems to be a little more drastic series of products</li>
            <li>I guess if I was 20 years old, it would help me a lot!!</li>
            <li>After a little over a month of usage I didn&#x27;t see any notable differences.  </li>
            <li>Having an extremely sensitive sniffer, the fragrance of this cream is a too much for me to tolerate.  </li>
            <li>She normally uses Ponds.  </li>
            <li>I also had white heads on my nose in the morning that has gotten better, and although it&#x27;s still too early, I think my pores are getting smaller.</li>
            <li>I have not seem any noticeable improvements to skin, fine lines or any other benefits from using this product for 5 mos.</li>
            <li>You put it at night, wake up the next day, you feel like your skin has built a new fresh layer of skin over your face.</li>
            <li>I will update this review and add to it about other neutrogena products as becomes relevant.</li>
            <li>so I can live with it.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert.</li>
            <li>She wakes up with very soft and supple skin every time she used at night.i</li>
            <li>In general, I really like Neutrogena</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin and not just anything works, but this leaves my skin looking so young, and soft, very calming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am currently looking for a day time product in this line with an SPF higher than 15...</li>
            <li>I have tried many and much more expensive but this one is my BFF!</li>
            <li>keeps skin new and soft and diminishes wrinkles.</li>
            <li>her skin, providing a refreshing deep down softness.  </li>
            <li>originally thought the price was high, but after 3 weeks I still have at least half a jar and better skin</li>
            <li>I bought it long long ago and used it up very quickly.</li>
            <li>The wind, sun, sand, salt water, etc. tend to dry my face out even more, but this lotion has always been able to work wonderfully, no matter how bad/dry my skin has gotten by the time I start using it.</li>
            <li>I think it has really helped the skin over my cheekbones and neck where the fine lines are very apparent usually.</li>
            <li>A little sticky until it absorbs, but it&#x27;s light and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>: Use as little as you can, to the point where it is actually invisible after applying, then you will be ok to go.</li>
            <li>I started using Bio-Oil before any other facial products, and since it has been working slowly but surely to minimize my neck wrinkle (the only point of comparison I&#x27;ve remembered to consistently measure its effectiveness by), and it is cheap</li>
            <li>Jice and moist and clear.</li>
            <li>Gret for keeping your skin clear.</li>
            <li>I like how it makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>I think this cream is for people without sensitive skin</li>
            <li>In the morning my face feels soft, not oily</li>
            <li>I will buy this and the daily moisturizer with sunscreen because I really like the results.</li>
            <li>I was using a very pricey night cream before this, and I feel that this has the same results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken nearly two weeks of using hypoallergenic cleansers &amp; moisturizers (CeraVe, Cetophil, etc) to help clear it up.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she&#x27;s in her early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old, dryish skin, non smoker, non drinker, NOT a sun worshipper etc etc..</li>
            <li>When I opened the 1st jar, I instantly knew I wouldn&#x27;t like it so much, because of the smell.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or cakey</li>
            <li>I like waking in the morning and feeling how soft my skin</li>
            <li>they reply I don&#x27;t look that old.</li>
            <li>As a frequent Neutrogena customer, this product maintains their reputation.</li>
            <li>It is so soft for the skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like the product</li>
            <li>/&gt;I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, not too light.</li>
            <li>This night lotion does make your face feel soft and moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft in the mornings.</li>
            <li>My current favorite Neutrogena line is the Visibly Firm with Copper line.</li>
            <li>You can tell that the cream is not as thick as most moisturizers, so it can be applied evenly.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it smells too good</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I got a little too excited and ordered 3 of these.</li>
            <li>At this price on Amazon it is a nice cheap base facial moisturizer that I would recommend to people with normal or oily sensitive skin, but if you have super dry skin like me</li>
            <li>The product may seem pricey, but it only takes a little bit, and it feels amazing as it is soaked up by dry skin.  </li>
            <li>And for me, I have to say I have noticed a higher degree of softness, especially on the back of her hands.  </li>
            <li>I get about a fingertip full, this covers my face, neck and a little bit of my chest.  </li>
            <li>becoming hard to find.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, faint scent and left no residue on my sheets or pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I did have to stop using it; too bad because it is the best moisturizer I have found for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>My face after only 2 days is so soft and no outbreaks!</li>
            <li>While I thought the price was a bit high, I think the jar will last me 1.5-2 months of daily use on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I have acne and with all the topical medicines I use I just needed a basic, highly moisturizing cream</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old and noticed some wrinkles starting to appear along with drying skin.</li>
            <li>This is the only cream that has worked so far.  </li>
            <li>Did wonders for deep marked wrinkles on my forehead, eye and mouth areas.</li>
            <li>I had read this somewhere else, but was still surprised that my jar night cream had a big pocket of air in it.</li>
            <li>I barely use daytime lotion because 100% of them contains sun screen now</li>
            <li>My dry patches have pretty much disappeared, and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with breakouts at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 45 year old woman with sensitive, dry skin, and I also still get breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have terribly sensitive skin, and I switched to this product when even face washes and moisturizers for sensitive skin were leaving me dry</li>
            <li>A little bit of this cream goes a long way so it should last a long time. :)</li>
            <li>The wrinkles are here to stay without some more serious solutions!</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and spend lots of time outdoors.</li>
            <li>As a follow up: I&#x27;m using this product again and my skin is back to being smooth, soft, and subtle.  </li>
            <li>B001OMI93S Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night Moisturizer, 1.7-Ounce Jars]] for about 3 weeks now and it has really turned my skin around from being rough and overly dry to feeling soft again.</li>
            <li>had a little problem with the scent at first.  </li>
            <li>I first put the cream on, it stung a little bit on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>You need only a very small amount because it spreads so smoothly and</li>
            <li>Other than that, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my sensitive and dry skin on my face</li>
            <li>but I quickly developed rashes and dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the science behind moisturizing before bed, since the first thing I do when I wake up is wash my face and moisturize, but I have noticed that my skin is a bit softer.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a tremendous change in my skin with using it, but at least it has not caused breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is thick, but not greasy and for a night cream, disappears into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I am not usually a fan of serum like moisturizers because never really felt like they were doing anything.  </li>
            <li>I had to reapply the lotion several times throughout the day to maintain the moisture, but I was getting results much closer to lotions I had previously used.    </li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Non-sticky and use morning and night - doesn&#x27;t take very much either so this little jar will last a long time.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I would recommend it if your skin already perfect.</li>
            <li> This lotion is one of the best night creams I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Awesome.</li>
            <li> Excellent.</li>

            <li> I think it&#x27;s nice hydration cream.</li>

            <li> It smelled good and felt fine going on</li>

            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light smell that didn&#x27;t bother me or my boyfriend once in bed.</li>

            <li> I really love it and have used up 2 bottles already.</li>
            <li> It does seem OK for day wear though, or under make up.  </li>

            <li> My skin does feel and look better in the morning with it.</li>
            <li> One of the biggest problems with many creams is the odor, but that&#x27;s a problem with Ageless Essentials.  </li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Subscribe &amp; Save program.</li>

            <li> and I have a more even skin tone.</li>

            <li> I love anything from Neutrogena.  </li>

            <li> Love the smell and the way my skin feels every morning I love wearing this my husband loves smelling my face too ^.^</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of use, however, it was as if my skin got used to the lotion and was able to reap</li>
            <li> The stinging went away and the lotion did a much better job at combatting itchy skin and flaking.  </li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> Used this product many years.  </li>
            <li> It is an ok moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been many, many months.  </li>
            <li> Still Love the product, but now it&#x27;snot prime.  </li>
            <li> I love this night cream.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> at night and feel water on your skin .i love it</li>
            <li> Never tried a night creams before but my skin is feeling so much better.</li>
            <li> Giving if more time.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m looking for something I like better.</li>
            <li> For the lasting effect it does a good job, doing an excellent job or moisturizing and leaving a clean, smooth feel.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice night time moisturizer, with a very soothing scent.  </li>
            <li> This night cream is light and the mild scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> When I applied the goo it went on effortlessly and smelled pretty good.</li>
            <li> EspeciAlly good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Good overall cream, good addition to the Neutrogena line.</li>
            <li> Very light, smooth to go on, no fragrance smell.   </li>
            <li> It feels very nice, and my skin feels nice the next morning as well!</li>
            <li> My skin gets very dry in spots, but is greasy in others, and this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> It is truly fragrance free and absorbs better.</li>
            <li> I have not been a good , faithful proponent of any product because I could not see much difference in them, in texture or effect.</li>
            <li> There is a strong perfume.  </li>
            <li> Just seemed too strong and it bothered me.  </li>
            <li> It was delivered very fast and it has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with combination skin who&#x27;s been having issues with finding a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it is light and clean feeling!</li>
            <li> but this product is very nice if you&#x27;re just looking for something light for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried this Neutrogena product and really liked this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Cool, refreshing and it works.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say per se if it improves wrinkles, mostly because I don&#x27;t have many (but then, that may well be because I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena my whole life!)     </li>
            <li> However, because I already have fine lines around my mouth and along my forehead</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m still not convinced of its &#x27;fine line reducing claims.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Even though my fine lines are still noticable</li>
            <li> This one is not too strong (important for a night creme).  </li>
            <li> THe Ageless Essentials has a wonderful texture to it, not greasy but very soothing and it disappears into my skin leaving it feeling plump and not dry in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product, it is very light for a night time moisturizer, i used it in morning also,it absorbs quickly and makes my face feel smooth and fresh...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a medium viscosity creamy feel and really smells nice and light.</li>
            <li> This product does not irritate my acne at all, which is a huge plus, along with its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so creamy and light that you will love it, especially when you notice good results, which come immediately when you start using it.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been trying to find that \\&quot;just right\\&quot; daytime moisturizer that will make my skin smooth for makeup, stay hydrated during the day, but not be greasy or cause breakouts or irritation.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on smoothly...</li>
            <li> NOT fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s light purple.</li>
            <li> But it sure doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s being absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> The texture is light, I don&#x27;&#x27;t like that greasy feeling which does not have.</li>
            <li> every since I began using this after my nightly face wash routine, my skin feels softer, it&#x27;s blemish free</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and within 2 days</li>
            <li> the morning I rinse it off and have smooth skin and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Palm Desert, California to be precise.</li>
            <li> I experienced some stinging, especially when using this after an exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li> We like how smooth the lotion is when you apply it onto to your face and as you spread it around.</li>
            <li> I wish Neutrogena would make fragrance free</li>
            <li> This cream is light and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin nice and soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Tones up skin and keeps skin soft does not burn or gives any sensation what so ever, a good  cream, mywife says so you can try it .</li>
            <li> the price the quantity is good, compared to others that are good, but give you very little for the price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anybody who is looking for an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving how soft this leaves my skin and how easy it makes applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the product it sure looked liquid-y.</li>
            <li> , the price is not bad, and the product is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The price is great, I only paid about $11, also liked the soft smell.</li>
            <li> It is not a heavy, cakey moisturizer; on the contrary it is easily absorbed, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t get oily during the sleep cycle.</li>
            <li> no matter how clean your hands are you never know what is growing inside the jar.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line is that after giving my skin some time to get used to this product it did a great job of moisturizing my dry and flakey skin.  </li>
            <li> works great and keeps my skin moist some products tend to break out my skin or leave dry patches this seems to help with both.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy and it keep my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Bought many times and will continue to !</li>
            <li> The biggest plus for me, though, is that this product is easy to find and priced right.</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and works great on very dry and somewhat wrinkled skin.</li>
            <li> On the bright side I did find my daily morning moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I really think my skin looks and feels much better, the tone and the texture has improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a light, fresh scent, but a scent nonetheless.  </li>
            <li> like the quality and price, good simply night cream for my skin.</li>
            <li> When I used to see an old wrinkled lower face, now I see a nice looking woman.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full benefits.  </li>
            <li> It is my favorite face cream: light, smooth texture; pleasant, subtle odor.</li>
            <li> An older person would probably want something more suited to their needs.</li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> I like it very much, feels so comfortable, maybe that&#x27;s why they increase the price.</li>
            <li> It hits in the 100&#x27;s most days during the summer months and this place, with its high winds can make a man look like leather faster than you can say &#x27;Michael Caine&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I kid you not, the VERY next morning my skin was already better!</li>
            <li> I have used this every night ever since I first tried this product!  </li>
            <li> My face used to get dry after washing my makeup off at night, especially around my eyes, and this cream keeps my skin perfectly hydrated.</li>
            <li> I always try to buy products with a very light scent or no scent at all, otherwise I would get a headache, and this cream clearly wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Continuous Hydration Ageless Essentials formula is very soothing and light.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some similar products she has used, this cream had no adverse odor, went on nicely</li>
            <li> I use this cream every night, just to help moisturize my skin and keep it soft and looking healthy, and it works.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, disappears almost instantly, and provides a continuous, energetic lift to the skin.    </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin so soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71 years old &amp; have been using this for many years.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The cracked skin from the night before had fresh nonstinging skin in its place.</li>
            <li> and i love it so far.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice and light feel and spreads easily, however, it did not moisturize as well as my other facial moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I tried numerous lotions from neutrogena and other makers but this one was the best.</li>
            <li> Because it soaks right in, you can apply powder almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This cream has a pleasing scent and the right price.</li>
            <li> one right here changed my mind.</li>
            <li> It soaks in right away and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> , it also soaks into smoothly right away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light without being full of air, and sucks right into your skin and leaves it feeling supple &amp; hydrated all day, but still feeling really nice and clean.</li>
            <li> many different facial products, trying to find a good combination for my very mixed-type skin.</li>
            <li> I was using the Neutrogena Light Night Cream for years, but started having too many dry patches.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to smell, and this product has a light pleasing fragrance that disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> At first I was not crazy about this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Non greasy &amp; it&#x27;s very cooling when I apply it at night, absorbing quick too!</li>
            <li> It not only goes on smooth and light</li>
            <li> , the coverage is good and it is also  grease less.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> but after it soaked into my skin (which was very fast) it didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li> This product does not have an odor and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> So this is probably a fine product for anyone who is not too sensitive to the richer skin care products.  </li>
            <li> So I was excited to have the opportunity to try this new</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful night cream than, unlikely many other products, goes on with a light, silky feel.  </li>
            <li> It is silky, non-greasy at all, very easy to absorb, keep my skin soft and young.</li>
            <li> This face cream is actually quite lovely.</li>
            <li> When I first used it I was concerned that it felt a bit greasy</li>
            <li> So as a lifelong Neutrogena babe, I can say this is a nice cream.</li>
            <li> I happen to love it, and I even use that cream for the back of my hands (never too soon to start working on the anti-aging all over!)    </li>
            <li> Seems to smooth my skin and keep it looking young.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is a nice LIGHT feeling moisturizer, HOWEVER I also had a few pimples develop!</li>
            <li> As a basic night cream, I thought this was ok.</li>
            <li> This would be an ok night cream for someone younger without a lot of aging issues.........</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> is, now if I could get rid of my double chin, I would be in heaven!   :)</li>
            <li> Love this cream it goes with the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion Holiday Bonus Pack purchased at the same time.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> Before purchasing it I read several reviews and many people indicated that they used it not just at night but during the day too.  </li>
            <li> First, let me just tell you that my wife just shook her head at me and said I was vain, but I soldiered on regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it gets to summer every year as I get pretty</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell funny or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it is not greasy and my skin just drinks it in!</li>
            <li> This is the first I have tested out this night cream from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> The size is bigger than most creams on the market.</li>
            <li> I love it, and use it daily, after cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li> Love Neutrogena but wish they would bring back the moisturizer with copper.  </li>
            <li> In just a few words, she \\&quot;loved it\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> Loved it at first, but small breakout occurred, not sure if this cream caused it, but I am giving it more time to be sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really moisturizing and make my skin soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> With this Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration cream, my face feels smooth and soft, and I only need light powder and blush.  </li>
            <li> I will stick with Neutrogena  as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> It goes on easily with a faint and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, have been using it for a long time and find it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily and leaves no residue, and feels really nice on my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Conintuous Hydration Night Moisturizer (whew, I think I got a few more wrinkles and gray hairs in the time it took to type that ridiculously long product name) is not quite Botox in a bottle, but it is a light, greaseless moisturizer that leaves the skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It feels nice on the skin, maybe a little light/quick absorbing for a night cream.</li>
            <li> It is light enough to use throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel or much shine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> hydrates really well</li>
            <li> and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> This really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really have to worry about clogged pores or feeling oily.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for two years and it really makes the lines disappear.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> But, after using this for a couple weeks, I now don&#x27;t mind the scent as much.  </li>
            <li> I use this both day and night; it&#x27;s plenty light enough to wear during the day under makeup.</li>
            <li> I discovered this at a drug store several years ago and was distressed to find it no longer available there.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and doesnt make my face oily.</li>
            <li> This one is so gentle</li>
            <li> I think this product is not oily and hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I just really wish it was unscented.</li>
            <li> This really does as it implies, making your face feel hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Very efffective at providing moisture and continuing into the morning when it can be applied for the day also.  </li>
            <li> Lovely, affordable night cream that is not too heavy or greasy and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> to much fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and gentle.</li>
            <li> It has a light feel and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin problems even with regular use.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel much firmer</li>
            <li> My skin is very picky about the cream I put on it.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least seven other products that did not work for my skin, but this one did and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Irritation free, long wearing lightweight moisture .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not oily, very light, fast absorbing and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> This night cream is a pretty decent product, but it has a fragrance, which isn&#x27;t what sensitive skin needs.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews called it a \\&quot;light, fresh scent\\&quot;, but to me it smells like old lady Avon products.</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent to the cream, which probably won&#x27;t bother most people, but I do have allergies to scents, so I don&#x27;t use it every night.</li>
            <li> My shipment arrived, I used it that night and now my skin is back to feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this product really absorbs into my skin</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not dry or oily, just right.</li>
            <li> I would look at something with a little more moisturizing power.  </li>
            <li> That seems to be a little more drastic series of products</li>
            <li> I guess if I was 20 years old, it would help me a lot!!</li>
            <li> After a little over a month of usage I didn&#x27;t see any notable differences.  </li>
            <li> Having an extremely sensitive sniffer, the fragrance of this cream is a too much for me to tolerate.  </li>
            <li> She normally uses Ponds.  </li>
            <li> I also had white heads on my nose in the morning that has gotten better, and although it&#x27;s still too early, I think my pores are getting smaller.</li>
            <li> I have not seem any noticeable improvements to skin, fine lines or any other benefits from using this product for 5 mos.</li>
            <li> You put it at night, wake up the next day, you feel like your skin has built a new fresh layer of skin over your face.</li>
            <li> I will update this review and add to it about other neutrogena products as becomes relevant.</li>
            <li> so I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert.</li>
            <li> She wakes up with very soft and supple skin every time she used at night.i</li>
            <li> In general, I really like Neutrogena</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin and not just anything works, but this leaves my skin looking so young, and soft, very calming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am currently looking for a day time product in this line with an SPF higher than 15...</li>
            <li> I have tried many and much more expensive but this one is my BFF!</li>
            <li> keeps skin new and soft and diminishes wrinkles.</li>
            <li> her skin, providing a refreshing deep down softness.  </li>
            <li> originally thought the price was high, but after 3 weeks I still have at least half a jar and better skin</li>
            <li> I bought it long long ago and used it up very quickly.</li>
            <li> The wind, sun, sand, salt water, etc. tend to dry my face out even more, but this lotion has always been able to work wonderfully, no matter how bad/dry my skin has gotten by the time I start using it.</li>
            <li> I think it has really helped the skin over my cheekbones and neck where the fine lines are very apparent usually.</li>
            <li> A little sticky until it absorbs, but it&#x27;s light and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> : Use as little as you can, to the point where it is actually invisible after applying, then you will be ok to go.</li>
            <li> I started using Bio-Oil before any other facial products, and since it has been working slowly but surely to minimize my neck wrinkle (the only point of comparison I&#x27;ve remembered to consistently measure its effectiveness by), and it is cheap</li>
            <li> Jice and moist and clear.</li>
            <li> Gret for keeping your skin clear.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> I think this cream is for people without sensitive skin</li>
            <li> In the morning my face feels soft, not oily</li>
            <li> I will buy this and the daily moisturizer with sunscreen because I really like the results.</li>
            <li> I was using a very pricey night cream before this, and I feel that this has the same results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken nearly two weeks of using hypoallergenic cleansers &amp; moisturizers (CeraVe, Cetophil, etc) to help clear it up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she&#x27;s in her early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old, dryish skin, non smoker, non drinker, NOT a sun worshipper etc etc..</li>
            <li> When I opened the 1st jar, I instantly knew I wouldn&#x27;t like it so much, because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Not heavy or cakey</li>
            <li> I like waking in the morning and feeling how soft my skin</li>
            <li> they reply I don&#x27;t look that old.</li>
            <li> As a frequent Neutrogena customer, this product maintains their reputation.</li>
            <li> It is so soft for the skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like the product</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, not too light.</li>
            <li> This night lotion does make your face feel soft and moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft in the mornings.</li>
            <li> My current favorite Neutrogena line is the Visibly Firm with Copper line.</li>
            <li> You can tell that the cream is not as thick as most moisturizers, so it can be applied evenly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it smells too good</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I got a little too excited and ordered 3 of these.</li>
            <li> At this price on Amazon it is a nice cheap base facial moisturizer that I would recommend to people with normal or oily sensitive skin, but if you have super dry skin like me</li>
            <li> The product may seem pricey, but it only takes a little bit, and it feels amazing as it is soaked up by dry skin.  </li>
            <li> And for me, I have to say I have noticed a higher degree of softness, especially on the back of her hands.  </li>
            <li> I get about a fingertip full, this covers my face, neck and a little bit of my chest.  </li>
            <li> becoming hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, faint scent and left no residue on my sheets or pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I did have to stop using it; too bad because it is the best moisturizer I have found for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My face after only 2 days is so soft and no outbreaks!</li>
            <li> While I thought the price was a bit high, I think the jar will last me 1.5-2 months of daily use on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have acne and with all the topical medicines I use I just needed a basic, highly moisturizing cream</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and noticed some wrinkles starting to appear along with drying skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that has worked so far.  </li>
            <li> Did wonders for deep marked wrinkles on my forehead, eye and mouth areas.</li>
            <li> I had read this somewhere else, but was still surprised that my jar night cream had a big pocket of air in it.</li>
            <li> I barely use daytime lotion because 100% of them contains sun screen now</li>
            <li> My dry patches have pretty much disappeared, and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with breakouts at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 45 year old woman with sensitive, dry skin, and I also still get breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have terribly sensitive skin, and I switched to this product when even face washes and moisturizers for sensitive skin were leaving me dry</li>
            <li> A little bit of this cream goes a long way so it should last a long time. :)</li>
            <li> The wrinkles are here to stay without some more serious solutions!</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin and spend lots of time outdoors.</li>
            <li> As a follow up: I&#x27;m using this product again and my skin is back to being smooth, soft, and subtle.  </li>
            <li> B001OMI93S Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night Moisturizer, 1.7-Ounce Jars]] for about 3 weeks now and it has really turned my skin around from being rough and overly dry to feeling soft again.</li>
            <li> had a little problem with the scent at first.  </li>
            <li> I first put the cream on, it stung a little bit on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> You need only a very small amount because it spreads so smoothly and</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sensitive and dry skin on my face</li>
            <li> but I quickly developed rashes and dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the science behind moisturizing before bed, since the first thing I do when I wake up is wash my face and moisturize, but I have noticed that my skin is a bit softer.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a tremendous change in my skin with using it, but at least it has not caused breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is thick, but not greasy and for a night cream, disappears into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I am not usually a fan of serum like moisturizers because never really felt like they were doing anything.  </li>
            <li> I had to reapply the lotion several times throughout the day to maintain the moisture, but I was getting results much closer to lotions I had previously used.    </li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Non-sticky and use morning and night - doesn&#x27;t take very much either so this little jar will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is nice and think, but not so thick that it feels heavy, and I prefer this over any other face moisturizer I have come across yet.</li>
            <li> Very nice product that does the job but does not clog my pores or produce any other bad effect in my skin.</li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t have dimethicone in it, but it&#x27;s far enough down the list</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it&#x27;s ridiculous to keep searching for the right product that will help my skin</li>
            <li> Not sure how they accomplished that,</li>
            <li> Long story short try it.</li>
            <li> I have used other Neutrogena products before such as their various facial wash and daytime facial</li>
            <li> But since it is oily and does not soak in quickly, I&#x27;ve had a hard time incorporating it into a routine with other products.</li>
            <li> Also there are no major pour clogging ingredients in it, so I can use it with my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Although being in the northwest you&#x27;d think we would have plenty of moisture to prevent dry skin, but every winter I face the same problem.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely helped hydrated my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not greasy and was absorbed really quickly, or at least it felt like it.</li>
            <li> After about 30 minutes, my skin went back to being dry, and the next morning it was VERY dry</li>
            <li> By February I have small dry patches on my face that really bother me and quite often slathering on lotion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, but I have dry skin, so I really need to moisturize if I want to wear that mineral stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than I typically think of a night cream, but I&#x27;ve found I prefer a quick-absorbing cream to the typical greasy night cream.</li>
            <li> WRONG my face feels smooth and does not look or feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It has been my contention for a long time that when a woman reaches fifty years of age, a fifty five gallon drum of moisturizer should be delivered.</li>
            <li> it lives up to its claims in the long run, I dont know.</li>
            <li> It does&#x27;t sting!It has lasted a long time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I commute long distances each day in the desert and have been trying to find a night cream and day products for my skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended either by itself or in combination (rotated) with other products.</li>
            <li> If you are using other topical creams, there&#x27;s nothing in it to irritate skin.</li>
            <li> It is oilier than the other Neutrogena product I currently use.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I suppose using this cream would be a benefit over using nothing at all, but due to the fragrance, I&#x27;m passing on any future use.</li>
            <li> The reason why I give it 3 stars is because it gives me 2-3 white heads the next morning if I accidentally apply a little bit &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34; on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and you can tell it is moisturizing all night long!  </li>
            <li> I havent used it very long</li>
            <li> My skin is dry on cheeks and oily at T-zone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dewy, but it doesn&#x27;t feel dry either</li>
            <li> They have been problematically dry for some time.  </li>
            <li> and I battled with retinol+ greasy formulas and as soon as they were washed off, my skin was still dry.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works well on my wife&#x27;s dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Living in a region with dry air, my skin needs a moisturizer and this has helped.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any dry skin or pimples.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t seen any dry spots since I started using it, and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and a lot of allergies.</li>
            <li> Foundation makes my face feel &#x27;smothered&#x27; and tends to dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I needed a moisturizer that I could mix with my retinol cream to minimize the dry patches.  </li>
            <li> Have dry skin</li>
            <li> I even switched to another product my esthetician gave me for awhile, and my skin became so dry once again.</li>
            <li> I also rely on my lotion to minimize the itching associated with dry skin and was worried that this lotion would not combat this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely keep it in mind when the company inevitably discontinues the Visibly Firm products (that always happens to me -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase this product if I saw it on the shelf and smelled the fragrance, thinking it would not work with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties and have very sensitive, dry and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I bought it on a whim, in an emergency when my skin got to be so dry around my nostril that it cracked!</li>
            <li> My skin was rough and felt dry and all out of whack from not using it.</li>
            <li> Now after 30 days my face is noticeable smoother and also less wrinkled, especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> but my skin at night was usally very dry</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin &amp; some rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to folks who have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have a few small areas on my face that are hyper sensitive to some creams and makeup, leaving red blotches of irritation ...</li>
            <li> After just one application, my face turned red, burnt tremendously, to the point that I had to wash it off with cold water.</li>
            <li> She applied the cream to her face but each night she rubbed a little on the back of her hands and on her elbows.  </li>
            <li> The cream is not greasy or heavy at all, I just have to use a little bit each time and cover my skin completely.</li>
            <li> Please be careful with products that contains this harmful chemical......</li>
            <li> The hydration actually seems to improve after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and sometimes my cat tries to eat my face when I wear it.</li>
            <li> It was not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is not a great one--rather than absorbing</li>
            <li> I tried the night cream from their new line which I found to be more expensive, too thick, not good with moisturizing</li>
            <li> I had a few dry patches to clear up from wintertime, and after a couple weeks of using this every night they were no better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin feels less rough and dry since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a lot less dry all day than it has been.</li>
            <li> Other creams make my T-zone oily within in couple hours after I put them on.</li>
            <li> I let my girlfriend use this as I am not particularly interested in night moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This stuff irritated my skin like none other.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Nutrogena products, so I was anxious to try this product.</li>
            <li> Mainly during the cold months I suffer from waking up to dry flaky skin and peeling especially around my nose.</li>
            <li> it works just about like any other.  </li>
            <li> All my other products were not helping at all.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is on the liquidy side, which is a plus compared to some other creams on the market.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but they make by face break out like a teenagers.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very light, and not too heavily scented and has not caused any bad reactions to my skin.  </li>
            <li> definitely is a nighttime moisturizer; I think it would be a little too heavy and too slippery to wear under makeup, and it also doesn&#x27;t have an SPF, as a daytime moisturizer should</li>
            <li> This item was 1 day late in delivery and then Amazon changed the delivery date after the item missed the initial delivery date.</li>
            <li> I expected a really heavy, greasy cream</li>
            <li> Not so gloopy that makeup will melt off in the heat, not so thin that your skin feels dry at the end of a day of central heating.</li>
            <li> The compliments on my skin must be, in part, due to this!</li>
            <li> I purchased it about a month ago and after about a week I have no more dry, flaky skin the morning.</li>
            <li> My facial skin is pretty dry due to the brutal winter here in the Midwest, and the Neutrogena Agelesss Essentails Continuous Hydration didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Essentials has a slight botanical aroma.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They should package it in an all black container and market it to men, it would succeed.</li>
            <li> Somehow this keeps me from waking up an oily mess</li>
            <li> and I will say that there is a noticeable difference in the &#x27;texture&#x27; or &#x27;sheen&#x27; of my skin, which usually feels ... rough.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight when I use it</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that I had immediate results, but I have been using it for about a month now and my skin feel softer and with less uneven color.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> Because it is little oily, I would not recommend it using during the day time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bothersome and after a little while you almost forget it&#x27;s on your face.    </li>
            <li> It helps a little, but not that well for me.  </li>
            <li> Very average, the smell is somewhat bothersome, will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> What a difference not using it for those few days made on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin has dried out over the years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lightweight moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy when you apply it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also heavier than their all-purpose moisturizer, which I use everyday.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> It caused my forehead to break out in some weird reddish bumps, and acne-like pustules on my cheeks and near my mouth.</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for a heavy night cream this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have always avoided face &amp;#34;creams.&amp;#34; I felt they were too heavy</li>
            <li> I do not feel anything heavy and my face breathes just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already missing the hydrated skin I had while using this product.    </li>
            <li> My skin is oily and I had trouble finding a moisturizer that did not make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> It is a everyday must for me.</li>
            <li> and my wrinkles seem to stand out less!</li>
            <li> My face had been suffering from dryness due to the frequent exposure to cold wind.</li>
            <li> After I wash my face at night, it usually has a tight feeling.</li>
            <li> I have utterly baffling skin -- crazy oily in some parts, irritatingly dry in others.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> After cleansing, my face usually begins to tighten and I need to moisturize at once.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite these small drawbacks, I did like it and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what improvements I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and night!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure why I bought this.</li>
            <li> I wait until 1/2 hour to hour before bed and apply a small amount of this over my face.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was because of another lotion on my face or not.</li>
            <li> My background is that I&#x27;m a 50 year old, running, biking Black Man who has suffered a life-time dealing w bad skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe it stopped the dry spots from getting worse, at least.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this nightly hydration moisturizer for approximately a month just about every other night</li>
            <li> (some people have complained of issues with the copper reacting with their skin.)</li>
            <li> the delicate skin on the tops.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always running late, so</li>
            <li> and it is not sticky or thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what caused the allergic reaction (probably the fragrance), but after using this product for just a few nights my previously clear skin broke out in an awful rash on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> and whenever I applied it, it made my skin feels stiff and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that tends to get enlarged pores, a very difficult type to moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I usually like fragrance-free products for face, but the scent was so faint as to be unobtrusive, so I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it.</li>
            <li> It was irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> The science behind it is misleading</li>
            <li> I have NEVER experienced this with a moisturizer product before, even with cheaper brands like Olay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a thin coat as a moisturizer under my make up</li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never noticed any dramatic results with any of them.  </li>
            <li> In conclusion, this product moisturizes well, but don&#x27;t expect dramatic wrinkle minimization.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to gauge since I put my face through a crazy regimen of exfoliating/cleansing/toning/moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry to see it discontinued.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with anything Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical of whether it would be up to the job.</li>
            <li> sometimes the work that&#x27;s needed is just too difficult for any mere cream to achieve.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after using it for a couple of weeks, it made my skin break out.  </li>
            <li> However, when I tried expensive department store moisturizers, they made me break out, too.  </li>
            <li> No need to buy expensive cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been riding my bike to work almost every day during this cold winter.</li>
            <li> so I was very skeptical in receiving this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I received the product in bad shape and the bottle didn&#x27;t have a seal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that they are discontinuing this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I just hate dipping my hands into a jar</li>
            <li> With nothing bad to say about a moisturizer that works well, I guess this is a 5-star product!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like how it makes my skin soft and you don&#x27;t feel it. I think it&#x27;s nice hydration cream. I would recommend it if your skin already perfect. If you have problem skin look for something else.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sensitive and dry skin on my face and whenever I applied it, it made my skin feels stiff and uncomfortable. It was irritating my skin. I think this cream is for people without sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use it every night.I see alot of difference.It makes my face looks clearer and glowy.. Will buy again soon</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It moisturizes my face well without being greasy.  It also makes a great morning or night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Conintuous Hydration Night Moisturizer (whew, I think I got a few more wrinkles and gray hairs in the time it took to type that ridiculously long product name) is not quite Botox in a bottle, but it is a light, greaseless moisturizer that leaves the skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  It has a pleasant, faint scent and left no residue on my sheets or pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as an inexpensive alternative to more expensive anti-wrinkle moisturizers, like Estee Lauder or Lancome.</li>
            <li> This lotion is one of the best night creams I&#x27;ve ever used. It not only goes on smooth and light, my skin loves the way it feels the next day. I ran out of this and was using another cream until this mine arrived (I have it auto-shipped). What a difference not using it for those few days made on my face. My skin was rough and felt dry and all out of whack from not using it. My shipment arrived, I used it that night and now my skin is back to feeling soft and smooth. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very average, the smell is somewhat bothersome, will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This cream is super light, smells wonderful, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Though, truth be told, even though it&#x27;s for your face, I use it mostly on my hands&lt;br /&gt;(which I wash a lot given that I have dogs and am allergic to said dogs), and my feet --&lt;br /&gt;two areas which require a lot of moisturizing. This product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on at night, put socks on my feet after moisturizing, and I wake up with soft&lt;br /&gt;hands and feet. Awesome. It&#x27;s truly the best, for a great price.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is terrific. It hydrates my skin all night, I look younger and fresher in the morning. It has a very light scent. I really think my skin looks and feels much better, the tone and the texture has improved.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked.I just love it.</li>
            <li> My skin has dried out over the years. What used to work on my skin does not anymore. I have been searching for a night cream and tried Neutrogena Ageless Essentials and it works great. Non-greasy and moisturizes very well. My skin is a lot less dry all day than it has been. The jar lasts for several weeks. The price is very good as well.I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Neutrogena loyalist. I use their face wash, toner, moisturizer, lip gloss, sesame body oil...I could go on. So I was excited to have the opportunity to try this new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night moisturizer has a very light scent. I usually like fragrance-free products for face, but the scent was so faint as to be unobtrusive, so I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it. It&#x27;s a lightweight moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy when you apply it. I don&#x27;t really understand the science behind moisturizing before bed, since the first thing I do when I wake up is wash my face and moisturize, but I have noticed that my skin is a bit softer. The biggest plus for me, though, is that this product is easy to find and priced right. For that reason alone I&#x27;d continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B001OMI93S Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night Moisturizer, 1.7-Ounce Jars]] for about 3 weeks now and it has really turned my skin around from being rough and overly dry to feeling soft again. Although being in the northwest you&#x27;d think we would have plenty of moisture to prevent dry skin, but every winter I face the same problem. By February I have small dry patches on my face that really bother me and quite often slathering on lotion just causes my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stated using this product after washing my face at night and just applying enough to cover without excess. It has a nice light smell that didn&#x27;t bother me or my boyfriend once in bed. In the morning my face feels soft, not oily which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally thought the price was high, but after 3 weeks I still have at least half a jar and better skin so I&#x27;d say the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I like Neutrogena products and use a lot of them. This night cream is a pretty decent product, but it has a fragrance, which isn&#x27;t what sensitive skin needs.  It is a light, fresh scent, but a scent nonetheless.  However, most things I use on my forehead make me break out, and this didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s also heavier than their all-purpose moisturizer, which I use everyday. I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase this product if I saw it on the shelf and smelled the fragrance, thinking it would not work with my sensitive skin. I have not noticed a tremendous change in my skin with using it, but at least it has not caused breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, an accceptable night cream but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin and spend lots of time outdoors. The wind, sun, sand, salt water, etc. tend to dry my face out even more, but this lotion has always been able to work wonderfully, no matter how bad/dry my skin has gotten by the time I start using it. It is very light, which I love because it does not feel like it will clog up your pores. I often put it on during the day as well as at night before going to be. I would highly recommend this for anybody who is looking for an effective moisturizer. The consistency is nice and think, but not so thick that it feels heavy, and I prefer this over any other face moisturizer I have come across yet.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Hydrates well. Does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> I received the product in bad shape and the bottle didn&#x27;t have a seal. I wanted to give this to my mom as a gift, now I have to return it.</li>
            <li> It was delivered very fast and it has a nice smell. I do not feel oily on my face. Totally speaking, it worths!</li>
            <li> It is so creamy and light that you will love it, especially when you notice good results, which come immediately when you start using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 45 year old woman with sensitive, dry skin, and I also still get breakouts. So, I&#x27;ve been trying to find that \\&quot;just right\\&quot; daytime moisturizer that will make my skin smooth for makeup, stay hydrated during the day, but not be greasy or cause breakouts or irritation. Sort of the holy grail! I&#x27;m in Houston, so humidity is an issue in the summer, and dryness from heating systems in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff just works. It&#x27;s called night moisturizer, but I use thicker stuff at night. This is great under makeup for the daytime. Not so gloopy that makeup will melt off in the heat, not so thin that your skin feels dry at the end of a day of central heating.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  I expect Neutrogena products to be fragrance free and good for one&#x27;s face.  This product reeks of perfume and irritated my face.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Looking for a night cream and like Neutrogena products.  This cream goes on smoothly...hydrates really well and the price is reasonable.  I would recommend this night cream.</li>
            <li> I use this for day time. It&#x27;s really moisturizing and make my skin soft and comfortable. My skin is dry on cheeks and oily at T-zone. Other creams make my T-zone oily within in couple hours after I put them on. This one won&#x27;t. I really love it and have used up 2 bottles already.</li>
            <li> This contains parabens, everyone! Please be careful with products that contains this harmful chemical...... Even if it works, don&#x27;t risk having parabens in your products.</li>
            <li> I let my girlfriend use this as I am not particularly interested in night moisturizers. It is not a heavy, cakey moisturizer; on the contrary it is easily absorbed, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t get oily during the sleep cycle. I recommend it if you feel a need for hydrating lotions while you are sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin.  This moisturizer is very light, and not too heavily scented and has not caused any bad reactions to my skin.  It has a very nice and light feel and spreads easily, however, it did not moisturize as well as my other facial moisturizers.  At this price on Amazon it is a nice cheap base facial moisturizer that I would recommend to people with normal or oily sensitive skin, but if you have super dry skin like me I would look at something with a little more moisturizing power.  I use L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code but this product is very nice if you&#x27;re just looking for something light for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> While this is called a night cream, it doesn&#x27;t have what I need for night moisture.  It does seem OK for day wear though, or under make up.  They seem to add sunscreen in all day moisturizers now and those products irritate my skin so this is perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dewy, but it doesn&#x27;t feel dry either so I guess that&#x27;s good. It leaves a nice smooth feeling from the glycerin though, which is nice.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Sorry to see it discontinued.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. I prefer using CeraVe or Philosophy brands.</li>
            <li> As you might guess, Donnie Darko doesn&#x27;t use moisturizer cream... but my wife does, so I have to rely upon her comments about this product.  In just a few words, she \\&quot;loved it\\&quot;... she found that it wasn&#x27;t greasy to wear and best of all it worked very well for her.  Unlike some similar products she has used, this cream had no adverse odor, went on nicely and she could feel it \\&quot;in\\&quot; her skin, providing a refreshing deep down softness.  Neutrogena is a name she trusts and has used many of their products over the years, so when I saw this I thought it would be something she would like. She did, and I&#x27;m a hero in her eyes and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about.  And for me, I have to say I have noticed a higher degree of softness, especially on the back of her hands.  They have been problematically dry for some time.  She applied the cream to her face but each night she rubbed a little on the back of her hands and on her elbows.  Within just a week the change was noticable, not only to her, but to me as well.  Now, she says she won&#x27;t use anything else... when you find something that works as well as this you don&#x27;t have to look for anything else.  A very good product and it gets a very big \\&quot;thumbs up\\&quot; for both of us.</li>
            <li> works good at night. Because it is little oily, I would not recommend it using during the day time. My skin does feel and look better in the morning with it.</li>
            <li> I have utterly baffling skin -- crazy oily in some parts, irritatingly dry in others. So I&#x27;m always in search of a nice moisturizer that won&#x27;t make me break out. The Neutrogena Ageless Essentials has been working great for me. My dry patches have pretty much disappeared, and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with breakouts at all. I highly recommend it to anyone with combination skin who&#x27;s been having issues with finding a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definitely is a nighttime moisturizer; I think it would be a little too heavy and too slippery to wear under makeup, and it also doesn&#x27;t have an SPF, as a daytime moisturizer should</li>
            <li> Use it daily. It is truly awesome!  Not too greasy and it keep my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Bought many times and will continue to !</li>
            <li> This really worked for me.  I have been having dryness in the mornings and this has helped.  I am really happy with this product.  I plan to get it again when I use this up.</li>
            <li> I use this cream every night, just to help moisturize my skin and keep it soft and looking healthy, and it works. The cream is not greasy or heavy at all, I just have to use a little bit each time and cover my skin completely. Very nice product that does the job but does not clog my pores or produce any other bad effect in my skin.</li>
            <li> This face cream is actually quite lovely. When I first used it I was concerned that it felt a bit greasy but after it soaked into my skin (which was very fast) it didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. Not sure how they accomplished that, but I was happy about it. There is a slight scent to the cream, which probably won&#x27;t bother most people, but I do have allergies to scents, so I don&#x27;t use it every night. Other than that, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It has been my contention for a long time that when a woman reaches fifty years of age, a fifty five gallon drum of moisturizer should be delivered. I have not been a good , faithful proponent of any product because I could not see much difference in them, in texture or effect. After washing my face every night, I applied this. My skin takes a beating, being outside in the elements year around and I have been a fan of some  daily moisturizers with sunscreen but my skin at night was usally very dry and I battled with retinol+ greasy formulas and as soon as they were washed off, my skin was still dry. THe Ageless Essentials has a wonderful texture to it, not greasy but very soothing and it disappears into my skin leaving it feeling plump and not dry in the morning. I think it has really helped the skin over my cheekbones and neck where the fine lines are very apparent usually. I used this under makeup when going out because the moisture is consistant. I will buy this and the daily moisturizer with sunscreen because I really like the results.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Continuous Hydration Ageless Essentials formula is very soothing and light.  It&#x27;s not greasy and does a good job of moisturizing.  One of the biggest problems with many creams is the odor, but that&#x27;s a problem with Ageless Essentials.  It&#x27;s not bothersome and after a little while you almost forget it&#x27;s on your face.    For the lasting effect it does a good job, doing an excellent job or moisturizing and leaving a clean, smooth feel.  You don&#x27;t really have to worry about clogged pores or feeling oily.  Definitely recommended either by itself or in combination (rotated) with other products.</li>
            <li> I put this on at night after washing and toning my face, and every morning when I wake up my face looks great. Jice and moist and clear.</li>
            <li> I apply this product to my face each night before bedtime and find my facial skin remains smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> This stuff irritated my skin like none other. It smelled good and felt fine going on but I quickly developed rashes and dry, itchy skin. No thank you.</li>
            <li> like the quality and price, good simply night cream for my skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works well on my wife&#x27;s dry skin.  She uses it nightly and it is not sticky or thick.  It goes on easily with a faint and pleasant scent.  With nothing bad to say about a moisturizer that works well, I guess this is a 5-star product!</li>
            <li> I use this cream for both my night &amp; day uses. In the daytime I use this cream with a sunscreen from Clinique. This is the only cream that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out or greasy. At the same time it hydrates my skin perfectly. I tried numerous lotions from neutrogena and other makers but this one was the best.</li>
            <li> Great night creme for healthy skin.  A little sticky until it absorbs, but it&#x27;s light and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and noticed some wrinkles starting to appear along with drying skin. I started using this cream and could see a difference in one week. It feels great going on, smells nice and really moisturizers my skin. I use it at night.  I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, have been using it for a long time and find it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Nice product, anyway. I bought it long long ago and used it up very quickly. The only problem is it may not fit me so much.</li>
            <li> Using this for the past 8 months and after the first couple weeks, i could tell a difference. Love it and will not try another.</li>
            <li> I use this as an out of the shower lotion because it&#x27;s non-comodogenic and not greasy. You don&#x27;t need to use very much. Yes, it has parabens, but don&#x27;t believe the organic hype. Organic products are great, but it&#x27;s also a business ploy. The science behind it is misleading</li>
            <li> Do not recommend this night cream. After just one application, my face turned red, burnt tremendously, to the point that I had to wash it off with cold water. Save your money and get a different night cream.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that they are discontinuing this moisturizer. I have been using this for two years and it really makes the lines disappear. Why take away something that works. Oh Well !</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just no getting away from it - I love Neutrogena products, and almost anything from their skincare line. The stuff has a marvelous texture, a great scent, and it just works with no issues.    So as a lifelong Neutrogena babe, I can say this is a nice cream. It goes on smoothly, disappears almost instantly, and provides a continuous, energetic lift to the skin.    I can&#x27;t say per se if it improves wrinkles, mostly because I don&#x27;t have many (but then, that may well be because I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena my whole life!)     My current favorite Neutrogena line is the Visibly Firm with Copper line. That seems to be a little more drastic series of products (some people have complained of issues with the copper reacting with their skin.) I happen to love it, and I even use that cream for the back of my hands (never too soon to start working on the anti-aging all over!)    I tried this cream for that, and it works wonderfully well for moisturing the hands, part. the delicate skin on the tops.     Good overall cream, good addition to the Neutrogena line. I&#x27;ll definitely keep it in mind when the company inevitably discontinues the Visibly Firm products (that always happens to me - I love a product, it disappears from the shelves.)    You just can&#x27;t go wrong with anything Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Nutrogena products, so I was anxious to try this product. Have had it for about a week now and I love the feel of my skin in the morning. The only problem I have with it is that it makes my skin a tad oily. It actually may not be the product itself but may just be my skin type. I enjoy putting on a good moisturizer at night and when this jar is gone I will probably order more. This is definately a brand I trust.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful night cream than, unlikely many other products, goes on with a light, silky feel.  My  skin feels wonderful after using it!!  It also give skin a wonderfully resilient feeling and appearance.</li>
            <li> Does it work, I don&#x27;t know. I have been very satisfied with it. Living in a region with dry air, my skin needs a moisturizer and this has helped.</li>
            <li> After I wash my face at night, it usually has a tight feeling. Then I put this on, and my skin feels great. It&#x27;s not too oily, and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. I was using a very pricey night cream before this, and I feel that this has the same results. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now and I still have some left. I will be purchasing again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Non-sticky and use morning and night - doesn&#x27;t take very much either so this little jar will last a long time.  I also have the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System which I use now about once or twice a week but apply the Hydration cream daily.  Keeps my skin nice and soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> My biggest concern, as with any night time moisturizer, is that this would cause pimples. It didn&#x27;t, and for that I am dearly grateful. It does a good job of moisturizing, soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product. It&#x27;s much lighter than I typically think of a night cream, but I&#x27;ve found I prefer a quick-absorbing cream to the typical greasy night cream. I use it by day as well (though would probably switch to something in their line intended for day, w/ SPF, for summer). It&#x27;s light without being full of air, and sucks right into your skin and leaves it feeling supple &amp; hydrated all day, but still feeling really nice and clean. Because it soaks right in, you can apply powder almost immediately. I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, but I have dry skin, so I really need to moisturize if I want to wear that mineral stuff. I&#x27;m always running late, so I like that I don&#x27;t have to wait around (which I did with the moisturizer that actually came with the makeup) if I want to wear makeup. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what caused the allergic reaction (probably the fragrance), but after using this product for just a few nights my previously clear skin broke out in an awful rash on my face and neck. I have NEVER experienced this with a moisturizer product before, even with cheaper brands like Olay. It caused my forehead to break out in some weird reddish bumps, and acne-like pustules on my cheeks and near my mouth. It&#x27;s taken nearly two weeks of using hypoallergenic cleansers &amp; moisturizers (CeraVe, Cetophil, etc) to help clear it up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she&#x27;s in her early 30&#x27;s. She has combination skin. She wakes up with very soft and supple skin every time she used at night.i just give this 3 stars, the price have gone up. I used to buy this at $11 at Amazon,now is $18.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a guy and i&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer about 4 weeks now, and it&#x27;s definitely helped hydrated my dry skin.  on days when i don&#x27;t go outside or won&#x27;t be in the sun, i use it during the daytime!</li>
            <li> This cream is great!  It leaves your skin so soft and smooth!  it smells nice as well with out being over powering!</li>
            <li> NOT fragrance free.  There is a strong perfume.  Why, oh why.  Also, it&#x27;s light purple. Why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMHO, the light night cream is a superior product. It is truly fragrance free and absorbs better. And it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> Yes, it moisturizes.  It&#x27;s okay.  But it sure doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s being absorbed into my skin.  Sometimes my lips feel like I&#x27;ve just smeared movie theater popcorn butter across my face.  So I am continuing on my search to find a moisturizer/wrinkle reducer to replace Avon&#x27;s Ageless Results which has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I use it every night.  Will buy more. Seems to smooth my skin and keep it looking young.  I use it with the anti&#x3D;age cream</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that tends to get enlarged pores, a very difficult type to moisturize.  I&#x27;m using this night cream as my day cream now and my skin is looking great.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Irritation free, long wearing lightweight moisture . This is the perfect night cream - from a brand you trust for a price that makes you comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have combinational skin, and I use this on both my T zone and U zone and I haven&#x27;t had any dry skin or pimples. One star off as I&#x27;m using this 2 times a day as day cream instead of at night.</li>
            <li> Let me start off with the facts, so you can ascertain if this review is relevant for YOU!  I am 51 years old, dryish skin, non smoker, non drinker, NOT a sun worshipper etc etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not seem to stand out from the \\&quot;crowd\\&quot; in any way. Yes it is a nice LIGHT feeling moisturizer, HOWEVER I also had a few pimples develop! Something that I have NEVER had a problem with in my life! IF you have oily skin or problems with skin creams/lotions causing breakouts, I would not recommend this for you! However it does have good ingredients &amp; has a proven \\&quot;Name\\&quot; in the skin care industry, so maybe I am a \\&quot;fluke\\&quot;! IF you have always known this brand to work for you I would say give it a try! As for me....not so good a \\&quot;match\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been riding my bike to work almost every day during this cold winter. My face had been suffering from dryness due to the frequent exposure to cold wind. After using the Neutrogena Night Moisturizer for 2 nights, I noticed a big reduction in dryness and flaky skin, especially on my nose and cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the nighttime use seemed to help, I think this product is better suited for daytime use. It is light enough to use throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel or much shine. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores. It&#x27;s also unscented. While I thought the price was a bit high, I think the jar will last me 1.5-2 months of daily use on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> As a basic night cream, I thought this was ok. Seemed to do a good job of hydrating. Weather it lives up to its claims in the long run, I dont know. An older person would probably want something more suited to their needs. This would be an ok night cream for someone younger without a lot of aging issues.........Is well priced for the amount you receive.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year now and. Love it. the price is great and it does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I got a little too excited and ordered 3 of these. When I opened the 1st jar, I instantly knew I wouldn&#x27;t like it so much, because of the smell. I always try to buy products with a very light scent or no scent at all, otherwise I would get a headache, and this cream clearly wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. Anyways, I still gave it a try. My facial skin is pretty dry due to the brutal winter here in the Midwest, and the Neutrogena Agelesss Essentails Continuous Hydration didn&#x27;t cut it. I did feel that my skin was softer, but not the way I hoped for. After about 30 minutes, my skin went back to being dry, and the next morning it was VERY dry (I have to mention that I drink a lot of water, from 2.5 to 3 quarts a day). Maybe you can use this as a day cream if you like the smell, but it is definitely not a night cream, and I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, it is light and clean feeling! The quality is is great, you don&#x27;t need a $50 night cream. I love the Subscribe &amp; Save program.</li>
            <li> my wife is using this product.  She normally uses Ponds.  the fragrance for this one is nice (I like it over Pond&#x27;s smell).  This one is not too strong (important for a night creme).  it&#x27;s not oily, very light, fast absorbing and long lasting.  it makes my wife skin shine even until morning.  Like it states, it continuously hydrate the skin through the night.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This feels very nice on my skin.  Not heavy or cakey and it makes my skin feel very smooth.  I like waking in the morning and feeling how soft my skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a little problem with the scent at first.  Just seemed too strong and it bothered me.  But, after using this for a couple weeks, I now don&#x27;t mind the scent as much.  If this had a lighter scent, this would be a 5 star product for me.</li>
            <li> This arrived just as I was beginning to phase out my heavier winter cream. After cleansing, my face usually begins to tighten and I need to moisturize at once. Upon opening the jar of this moisturizer, I noticed the texture seemed rather runny and I was skeptical of whether it would be up to the job. But yes! The hydration actually seems to improve after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the weather warms, I find this cream is most suitable for summer weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may object to the fragrance of the product. Fragrances are not an issue for me, but may be for others. Just a note of caution. Also, the texture seems more suited for a pump; I worry that if the jar were tipped or dropped, product would spill everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these small drawbacks, I did like it and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any improvement in my skin when using this product, so would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Buy this stuff by the gallon if you can find it. I have been using this for about a month now.  I get about a fingertip full, this covers my face, neck and a little bit of my chest.  When I wake in the morning my face feels so hydrated and refreshed.  The smell, if there is one, is very light.  All around great feeling when I wake.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, feels so comfortable, maybe that&#x27;s why they increase the price.</li>
            <li> good moisturizer.  it feel silky on the skin</li>
            <li> Love this night cream for at night or on days when I&#x27;m giving my skin a break from makeup. Somehow this keeps me from waking up an oily mess and I love it. I like this better than the Clinique night cream I was using before.</li>
            <li> Non greasy &amp; it&#x27;s very cooling when I apply it at night, absorbing quick too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71 years old &amp; have been using this for many years.  I do not have any wrinkles.  I use it at night on my face to moisturize the skin then during the day I use a different cream on my face.  I receive compliments on my face &amp; even when I say I&#x27;m 71 they reply I don&#x27;t look that old.</li>
            <li> Does cause my skin to be more hydrated.  Noticeably more hydrated.  Eliminated flaking .  I have super sensitive skin and this does not break my skin out.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer and I can no longer find it in stores (I assume it has been discontinued). It&#x27;s not oily and leaves no residue, and feels really nice on my dry, sensitive skin. However, if you are looking for a heavy night cream this is NOT the product for you. I use this both day and night; it&#x27;s plenty light enough to wear during the day under makeup.</li>
            <li> I discovered this at a drug store several years ago and was distressed to find it no longer available there. Found it on Amazon and am delighted. It is my favorite face cream: light, smooth texture; pleasant, subtle odor. You need only a very small amount because it spreads so smoothly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll know how much I love this product when I tell you that, before finding it again online, I&#x27;d kept the box it came in for 3 years, hoping I could get it again!</li>
            <li> It was good, but I have found something even better-- this one is in a jar and I just hate dipping my hands into a jar cause no matter how clean your hands are you never know what is growing inside the jar.  I prefer the pumper style dispenser.  I would recommend it but think there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> I use this both day and night. Great feel when applied, not greasy. Love this cream...hope it never gets discontinued!</li>
            <li> This is a very simple moisturizing night cream. If you are using other topical creams, there&#x27;s nothing in it to irritate skin.</li>
            <li> I think that this product is best used as a day cream under makeup as well as a night cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased Neutrogena Ageless Essential Hydration Night cream about one month ago.  I like it because you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, the coverage is good and it is also  grease less. I will purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used for years because of severe allergies to everything else in the world, and was so happy to find it on amazon at the best price anywhere.  thanks!</li>
            <li> This cream is great for hydration .</li>
            <li> I was using the Neutrogena Light Night Cream for years, but started having too many dry patches.  I figured it was a sign of aging so I decided to try this product.  I have very sensitive skin, and this product really absorbs into my skin, I haven&#x27;t seen any dry spots since I started using it, and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Husband has used this product for about 6 years, as always we are very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> It works well and is good value.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and doesnt make my face oily. Use every night and skin feels amazing when i wake up.</li>
            <li> My background is that I&#x27;m a 50 year old, running, biking Black Man who has suffered a life-time dealing w bad skin. My wife thinks it&#x27;s ridiculous to keep searching for the right product that will help my skin, men aren&#x27;t suppose to care about their skin! Mainly during the cold months I suffer from waking up to dry flaky skin and peeling especially around my nose. I was reading a \\&quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness\\&quot; magazine and saw this product. It talked about how it helps balance the skins hydration over night. I purchased it about a month ago and after about a week I have no more dry, flaky skin the morning. I also had white heads on my nose in the morning that has gotten better, and although it&#x27;s still too early, I think my pores are getting smaller. The texture is light, I don&#x27;&#x27;t like that greasy feeling which does not have. Neutrogena products don&#x27;t work for everyone, Hence the above background info., But it appear to be helping me. I would recommend this product and Lab Series.</li>
            <li> Night cream that has a great fragrance, and it works just about like any other.  It helps a little, but not that well for me.  I guess if I was 20 years old, it would help me a lot!!</li>
            <li> becoming hard to find.  used it for years and a wonderful product.  keeps skin new and soft and diminishes wrinkles.</li>
            <li> She only wishes that it could have been a larger container. She uses this cream as a ritual. Can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Great seller.</li>
            <li> This night cream was just what I was looking for!  Very light, smooth to go on, no fragrance smell.   It is wonderful.  I think it plumpted up the lines around my mouth.  When I used to see an old wrinkled lower face, now I see a nice looking woman.  This is perfect for me!   If you are looking for a light feeling and working cream, this is the one!  I am so happy with is, now if I could get rid of my double chin, I would be in heaven!   :)</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin &amp; some rosacea.  I actually use this during the day.  My skin feels great.  Not oily or greasy.  Would recommend to folks who have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, its great and works fantastic! I have been using it for years, it is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product . EspeciAlly good for dry skin. Definitely recommend it.   Does not clog pores, does not leave skin oily.</li>
            <li> As a frequent Neutrogena customer, this product maintains their reputation. I have dry skin and a lot of allergies. This cream has a pleasing scent and the right price.</li>
            <li> Amazing moisturizer. Well worth the money.  I mix it with 20% vitamin C serums to make the amazing combination of a collagen producer and moisturizer to plump up those lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Seemed like it was doing some good but sometimes the work that&#x27;s needed is just too difficult for any mere cream to achieve.</li>
            <li> Not thick and greasy, perfect for my skin!</li>
            <li> I love it. It is so soft for the skin.</li>
            <li> This is very good moisturizing cream. I now use it night and day</li>
            <li> I have tried several facial lotions/creams, including oil of olay, neutrogena, etc.  This has the best feel, leaving the skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price the quantity is good, compared to others that are good, but give you very little for the price.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the product it sure looked liquid-y. (I know it&#x27;s not a word) So, I had my doubts. When I applied the goo it went on effortlessly and smelled pretty good. Essentials has a slight botanical aroma.&lt;br /&gt;I even think it helped me fall asleep. I awoke with softer skin.</li>
            <li> This has been a wonderful overnight moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling caked up or greasy, goes on smooth and silky. I have a few small areas on my face that are hyper sensitive to some creams and makeup, leaving red blotches of irritation ... This one is so gentle I can&#x27;t even tell that I&#x27;ve put it on. This product seems to be priced accordingly &amp; keeps my skin looking great, I&#x27;ll certainly be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to smell, and this product has a light pleasing fragrance that disappears quickly. This product is thick, but not greasy and for a night cream, disappears into the skin quickly. I&#x27;ve been using a thin coat as a moisturizer under my make up and it&#x27;s been allowing my foundation to set nicely. Used on it&#x27;s own, it leaves me face feeling very smooth. Been using it for several weeks, and I can&#x27;t necessarily say that I notice any visible diminishing of lines or wrinkles.  But then again, perhaps I&#x27;m in denial that I have any.  Overall, I really like the product, think it&#x27;s a great value for the money, and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It feels good going on your face. It does&#x27;t sting!It has lasted a long time!&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would order over the internet!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried this Neutrogena product and really liked this moisturizer. Unfortunately, my skin is very sensitive and I did have to stop using it; too bad because it is the best moisturizer I have found for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a Great product! every since I began using this after my nightly face wash routine, my skin feels softer, it&#x27;s blemish free and I have a more even skin tone. My face used to get dry after washing my makeup off at night, especially around my eyes, and this cream keeps my skin perfectly hydrated. Not dry or oily, just right.</li>
            <li> Love this cream it goes with the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion Holiday Bonus Pack purchased at the same time. The creme makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li> This is a great summer moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy so it&#x27;s great for under makeup.  I wish it didn&#x27;t have dimethicone in it, but it&#x27;s far enough down the list so I can live with it.</li>
            <li> This is now my all time favourite night cream. It smells amazing, goes on nice and smooth without any grease. In the morning I find my face looks healthy and glowing. A little bit of this cream goes a long way so it should last a long time. :)</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream because it moisturizes my skin, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin feels less rough and dry since I started using this product.  I know it&#x27;s called a night cream, but I use it as my regular daily cream as well.  I use powder instead of foundation for my makeup, and this cream doesn&#x27;t interfere with its application.  Foundation makes my face feel &#x27;smothered&#x27; and tends to dry my skin.  With this Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration cream, my face feels smooth and soft, and I only need light powder and blush.  My skin looks and feels more youthful now.  Thanks, Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> I tried to buy many band name for night cream, i want to find good one just like for my skin.  Neutrogena night cream is not greasy for someone like cream not greasy but I like night cream greasy for my face this why I give 4 stars</li>
            <li> Save  your money. After a month I can see no discernible difference. The wrinkles are here to stay without some more serious solutions!</li>
            <li> I used to apply lotion on my face before going to bed, but that lotion was too oily. I think this product is not oily and hydrates my skin very well. It is completely fit for night! Recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I needed a moisturizer that I could mix with my retinol cream to minimize the dry patches.  This is the only cream that has worked so far.  I took away one star because I wish it were in a squeeze tube for convenience.  The best part is that the cream is lightweight.  I expected a really heavy, greasy cream - it was not like that at all.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. Tried the Neutrogena Lift &amp; Strengthen before but I like this one much better. Did wonders for deep marked wrinkles on my forehead, eye and mouth areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what improvements I&#x27;ve had but it hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse. It&#x27;s hard to gauge since I put my face through a crazy regimen of exfoliating/cleansing/toning/moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a medium viscosity creamy feel and really smells nice and light. Lasted me quite a while as well.</li>
            <li> I am using it for some weks and I really feel my face sking great, hydratation is what I was looking for and I got that with this cream</li>
            <li> After just one night my skin looked and felt awesome! It&#x27;s really not greasy and was absorbed really quickly, or at least it felt like it. I&#x27;m very happy with it, and will probably order again.</li>
            <li> Have dry skin so this is perfect for hydration</li>
            <li> It works just like Mary Kay without the cost! My face after only 2 days is so soft and no outbreaks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti Wrinkle Cream for years.  So, I thought this Neutrogena product would be even better.  Unfortunately after using it for a couple of weeks, it made my skin break out.  It is oilier than the other Neutrogena product I currently use.  However, when I tried expensive department store moisturizers, they made me break out, too.  So this is probably a fine product for anyone who is not too sensitive to the richer skin care products.  In general, I really like Neutrogena but this one is not for me.</li>
            <li> This product is so underrated, in my opinion. I have a sensitive skin and not just anything works, but this leaves my skin looking so young, and soft, very calming. You put it at night, wake up the next day, you feel like your skin has built a new fresh layer of skin over your face. It&#x27;s lightweight. Your skin just drinks it up. I&#x27;ve gone through 2-3 tubs. I&#x27;ll still continue to use it whenever I run out. It&#x27;s an awesome product, definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product, it is very light for a night time moisturizer, i used it in morning also,it absorbs quickly and makes my face feel smooth and fresh... I havent used it very long but so fa so good</li>
            <li> Cool, refreshing and it works.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore, but here it is. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and night! I bought it on a whim, in an emergency when my skin got to be so dry around my nostril that it cracked! All my other products were not helping at all. At first glance after opening the jar I was disappointed thinking, &amp;#34;thise cream is too light! How could this help?&amp;#34; But I kid you not, the VERY next morning my skin was already better! The cracked skin from the night before had fresh nonstinging skin in its place. So amazing. I even switched to another product my esthetician gave me for awhile, and my skin became so dry once again. I LOVE LOVE this product, the price is not bad, and the product is fabulous. Also there are no major pour clogging ingredients in it, so I can use it with my acne prone skin. HOORAY!</li>
            <li> I love using this night cream. You can tell that the cream is not as thick as most moisturizers, so it can be applied evenly. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I had immediate results, but I have been using it for about a month now and my skin feel softer and with less uneven color. It also has a nice fragrance. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Other reviews called it a \\&quot;light, fresh scent\\&quot;, but to me it smells like old lady Avon products. Way perfumey, I can&#x27;t stand it. It feels nice on the skin, maybe a little light/quick absorbing for a night cream. I just really wish it was unscented. I&#x27;m going back to Olay regenerist.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and I alternate it with Rapid Wrinkle Repair Nigh Cream.  I have never used Neutrogena products before and am very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I had read this somewhere else, but was still surprised that my jar night cream had a big pocket of air in it. I wrote to the customer service department of the company, but have not heard back at all. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome! Before purchasing it I read several reviews and many people indicated that they used it not just at night but during the day too.  I am now one of those people.  I used to swear by olay regenerist but I think this product blows that one away.  I am not usually a fan of serum like moisturizers because never really felt like they were doing anything.  Putting serum on my skin is like putting hair gel on my skin.  This product is not like that at all.  It goes on smooth and within 2 days I could see a difference in &amp;#34;fine lines&amp;#34; on my face. Also if you use foundation it is easier to apply over this than traditional creams.  Long story short try it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this cream.  I use this in between the Roc products.  I like the texture of this cream.  It is nice amd smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer! I use it every night!</li>
            <li> I love anything from Neutrogena.  This really does as it implies, making your face feel hydrated.  A little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> creamy but absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave greasy feel.  would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have always avoided face &amp;#34;creams.&amp;#34; I felt they were too heavy and my face couldn&#x27;t breathe. I mistakenly believed they would make my already patchy oily face oilier. WRONG my face feels smooth and does not look or feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;This one right here changed my mind. I&#x27;m not exactly sure why I bought this. Glad I listened to my gut.&lt;br /&gt;After my nightly face washing and moisturizer I wait until 1/2 hour to hour before bed and apply a small amount of this over my face. I do not feel anything heavy and my face breathes just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I have not found any stains on my pillow so I don&#x27;t believe this wipes off onto my bedding at night. I&#x27;ve been using it for months now.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning I rinse it off and have smooth skin and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 50&#x27;s. so younger women start using it now! I wish I had of.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way my skin feels every morning I love wearing this my husband loves smelling my face too ^.^</li>
            <li> This is a very nice night time moisturizer, with a very soothing scent.  It feels very nice, and my skin feels nice the next morning as well!</li>
            <li> First, let me just tell you that my wife just shook her head at me and said I was vain, but I soldiered on regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fair complected. Irish descent. Close to forty. Getting closer every day. I live in the desert. Palm Desert, California to be precise. It hits in the 100&#x27;s most days during the summer months and this place, with its high winds can make a man look like leather faster than you can say &#x27;Michael Caine&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this nightly hydration moisturizer for approximately a month just about every other night and I will say that there is a noticeable difference in the &#x27;texture&#x27; or &#x27;sheen&#x27; of my skin, which usually feels ... rough. Now after 30 days my face is noticeable smoother and also less wrinkled, especially around the eyes. I&#x27;ll be honest and just tell you that I have a tendency to get a bit leathery the closer it gets to summer every year as I get pretty dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t experience any blemishes or breakouts or oily residue. It doesn&#x27;t smell funny or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad product. They should package it in an all black container and market it to men, it would succeed. I&#x27;ve already repurchased another bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various creams, night &amp; day, for quite some time.  I&#x27;ve never noticed any dramatic results with any of them.  This one is no different.  Having an extremely sensitive sniffer, the fragrance of this cream is a too much for me to tolerate.  The cream itself is on the liquidy side, which is a plus compared to some other creams on the market.  All in all, I suppose using this cream would be a benefit over using nothing at all, but due to the fragrance, I&#x27;m passing on any future use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties and have very sensitive, dry and acne prone skin so I was very skeptical in receiving this lotion.  I was worried that it would irritate my skin or would cause breakouts.  I also rely on my lotion to minimize the itching associated with dry skin and was worried that this lotion would not combat this.  However, because I already have fine lines around my mouth and along my forehead I was hopeful this product would help minimize these imperfections.    At first I was not crazy about this lotion.  I experienced some stinging, especially when using this after an exfoliating scrub.  I also noticed that the lotion wasn&#x27;t hydrating enough to eliminate my persistently itchy skin, especially around the sides of my nose and hairline.    After a couple of weeks of use, however, it was as if my skin got used to the lotion and was able to reap it&#x27;s full benefits.  The stinging went away and the lotion did a much better job at combatting itchy skin and flaking.  I had to reapply the lotion several times throughout the day to maintain the moisture, but I was getting results much closer to lotions I had previously used.    I think the biggest change I have noticed was when I ran out of the lotion and had to switch to something else.  Instantly my skin started looking duller and returned to being flakey and itchy.  I&#x27;m already missing the hydrated skin I had while using this product.    The bottom line is that after giving my skin some time to get used to this product it did a great job of moisturizing my dry and flakey skin.  However, I&#x27;m still not convinced of its &#x27;fine line reducing claims.&#x27;  After a little over a month of usage I didn&#x27;t see any notable differences.  However, given how well it moisturized it&#x27;s possible I would have noticed something after several months of use.  In conclusion, this product moisturizes well, but don&#x27;t expect dramatic wrinkle minimization.    As a follow up: I&#x27;m using this product again and my skin is back to being smooth, soft, and subtle.  Even though my fine lines are still noticable I&#x27;m loving how soft this leaves my skin and how easy it makes applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of testing (and reviewing) many different facial products, trying to find a good combination for my very mixed-type skin. I am 28 and have moderate acne. I commute long distances each day in the desert and have been trying to find a night cream and day products for my skin. I also use Rx Retin-A at night so I have been trying to avoid products with extra Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product alot. It soaks in right away and is non-greasy. It seems to make a difference in my skin for the duration of the day, even though I only use it at night and have not changed my day routine for awhile. The Estee Lauder lady I see for make-up made a comment about it one day when I forgot to use it the night before; she could see the difference from the last time I had come in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like this product because it helps me blend in Bio-Oil, another product I like to use. I started using Bio-Oil before any other facial products, and since it has been working slowly but surely to minimize my neck wrinkle (the only point of comparison I&#x27;ve remembered to consistently measure its effectiveness by), and it is cheap, I am loathe to stop using it. But since it is oily and does not soak in quickly, I&#x27;ve had a hard time incorporating it into a routine with other products. If I put this Neutrogena product on *over* the Bio-Oil (which I put over the Retin-A), it also soaks into smoothly right away and I see a wonderful difference in the morning in terms of smooth skin, reduced blemishes, and moisture retention. This product does not irritate my acne at all, which is a huge plus, along with its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently looking for a day time product in this line with an SPF higher than 15...I will update this review and add to it about other neutrogena products as becomes relevant.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products.  I&#x27;ve used them for years - the moistuirzers, liquid soap and lip balm.  Gret for keeping your skin clear.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it is not greasy and my skin just drinks it in! My skin is oily and I had trouble finding a moisturizer that did not make my skin break out. My skin is much softer and smoother and the reddish tone that I disliked is just about gone after only four weeks. This product does not have an odor and is very reasonably priced. I will continue to use this product and I plan to purchase the daytime moisturizer, too. I have tried at least seven other products that did not work for my skin, but this one did and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to night cream for years. It also works great under foundation. I have never had any break-outs from using this product. I use it with Retin-A at night and it protects my skin from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it appears the company no longer produces this cream. I tried the night cream from their new line which I found to be more expensive, too thick, not good with moisturizing and it caused a massive break-out.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought I would try it; however, I have combination skin, use it at night and it does not give me enough hydration or moisture. I have not seem any noticeable improvements to skin, fine lines or any other benefits from using this product for 5 mos.</li>
            <li> I like the moisture on my face at night along with my nightly anti acne regimen.  Not too heavy, not too light.</li>
            <li> This item was 1 day late in delivery and then Amazon changed the delivery date after the item missed the initial delivery date. This has never happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put the cream on, it stung a little bit on my cheeks. Not sure if it was because of another lotion on my face or not. The sensation lasted only for about a second or two then disappeared. No redness or swelling.  Will see tomorrow morning.  This is the first I have tested out this night cream from Neutrogena. I have used other Neutrogena products before such as their various facial wash and daytime facial lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update a week later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/27/2013:&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband and I have been using the lotion for over a week now.  We like how smooth the lotion is when you apply it onto to your face and as you spread it around. This night lotion does make your face feel soft and moisturized afterwards. We will definitely buy this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> works great and keeps my skin moist some products tend to break out my skin or leave dry patches this seems to help with both.</li>
            <li> After turning 26 I decided to start looking for a night moisturizer. After researching, I decided to try this product because of the great reviews. I was not disappointed. This night cream is light and the mild scent is pleasant. Leaves my skin soft in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Tones up skin and keeps skin soft does not burn or gives any sensation what so ever, a good  cream, mywife says so you can try it . The seller is excelent, packs good and dilivers on time, sogo for it....why not?</li>
            <li> Used this product many years.  It is non greasy and works great on very dry and somewhat wrinkled skin. Super</li>
            <li> For me this is not meant for a night cream. On the bright side I did find my daily morning moisturizer!! And that I am happy for. This moisturizer is not greasy and is very light. So perfect to wear under makeup.</li>
            <li> Very efffective at providing moisture and continuing into the morning when it can be applied for the day also.  I have used this lotion/cream for over 25 years</li>
            <li> It is an ok moisturizer. The reason why I give it 3 stars is because it gives me 2-3 white heads the next morning if I accidentally apply a little bit &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34; on my face. Advice: Use as little as you can, to the point where it is actually invisible after applying, then you will be ok to go.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer. Smells good and feels good. Unfortunately it smells too good and sometimes my cat tries to eat my face when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Lovely, affordable night cream that is not too heavy or greasy and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used this every night ever since I first tried this product!  It&#x27;s been many, many months.  It&#x27;s not greasy and you can tell it is moisturizing all night long!  Edit 5/21/13 Still Love the product, but now it&#x27;snot prime.  They took away prime and raised the price about 7.00!  I bought from target!!</li>
            <li> to much fragrance. I wish Neutrogena would make fragrance free</li>
            <li> Like it!  My face does, too.  Not greasy and gentle.</li>
            <li> This is my go to cream for day or night moisturizing.  It has a light feel and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin problems even with regular use.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this night cream. The size is bigger than most creams on the market. The price is great, I only paid about $11, also liked the soft smell.</li>
            <li> I have terribly sensitive skin, and I switched to this product when even face washes and moisturizers for sensitive skin were leaving me dry and/or breaking me out.  The product may seem pricey, but it only takes a little bit, and it feels amazing as it is soaked up by dry skin.  It smells great, too.  I&#x27;m actually using it twice a day, and I will be trying the cleanser from the same product line next.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> It was not very moisturizing. I had a few dry patches to clear up from wintertime, and after a couple weeks of using this every night they were no better. Maybe it stopped the dry spots from getting worse, at least.</li>
            <li> My favourite night cream!! I love it. I have tried many and much more expensive but this one is my BFF!</li>
            <li> This cream is light and not greasy.  I love it, and use it daily, after cleansing my face.  I will buy it again, and again.</li>
            <li> As always it works great...!</li>
            <li> I have used and loved this for years. The compliments on my skin must be, in part, due to this!</li>
            <li> I use this nightly and sometimes in the morning. I have tried other brands but they make by face break out like a teenagers. I will stick with Neutrogena  as long as it is available! It makes my face feel much firmer and my wrinkles seem to stand out less!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is my go to face products.  This is not a great one--rather than absorbing it feels like it settles on my skin like a mask.  Try one of the night serums instead.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisture replenishing cream.  Just started using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent nighttime moisturizer. No need to buy expensive cream. This is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have acne and with all the topical medicines I use I just needed a basic, highly moisturizing cream that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;do\\&quot; anything besides moisturize. My skin gets very dry in spots, but is greasy in others, and this stuff is awesome. My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight when I use it but it&#x27;s also not greasy either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this night cream for, i don&#x27;t know, 5-6 yrs. It is a everyday must for me. My skin is very picky about the cream I put on it. If it doesn&#x27;t like it, it would shed or breakout. I barely use daytime lotion because 100% of them contains sun screen now and my skin hates it. It breaks out all the time. this night cream I use it as daytime lotion. It is silky, non-greasy at all, very easy to absorb, keep my skin soft and young.</li>
            <li> bought it again .it does a wonderful stuff .using at night and feel water on your skin .i love it</li>
            <li> Never tried a night creams before but my skin is feeling so much better. I&#x27;m only 19 but i feel like i should just try anti-aging product and i love it so far. when i wake up in the morning my skin feels so nice.</li>
            <li> Love it feels great on my face</li>
            <li> This is the best!!! And it smells so nice!!!  Can&#x27;t believe it is being discontinued.  Boo Hiss!!!</li>
            <li> Giving if more time.  Loved it at first, but small breakout occurred, not sure if this cream caused it, but I am giving it more time to be sure.</li>
            <li> Love Neutrogena but wish they would bring back the moisturizer with copper.  That, this is a good moisturizer but I&#x27;m looking for something I like better.</li>
    </ol>
