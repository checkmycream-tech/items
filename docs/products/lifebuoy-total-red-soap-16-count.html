            <li>old)</li>
            <li>and this product is no way near what I been accustomed  using.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used Lifebouy soap since childhood (I&#x27;m 67 years old) and was veryl dissapointed when it was taken off the shelves in this country.  </li>
            <li>that the bars were a little larger.&lt;br /&gt;Chose this item because of memory of the original Lifebouy.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li>It is missing an ingredient that was in the original formula.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not return it is because she said she could live with smell which grew on her and rated one star for that.</li>
            <li>Watch the ads carefully this one did not clearly say bar size; buyer be aware.  </li>

            <li> Great soap.  Prompt delivery. These are really small bars,  about the size of a good hotel&#x27;s free bath bar. I love the soap from my youth. World&#x27;s first deodorant soap.</li>
            <li> I was expecting typical bath size (120 g) bar which is what is shown in the pictures, however, what I received was 16 hotel size (59G) bars with different packaging.  The soap is Lifebouy which I wanted.  Watch the ads carefully this one did not clearly say bar size; buyer be aware.  16 bars for that price; I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I was not overly pleased it took a week to ship and the size of the bars is not clear either these are in no way the size of a normal bar of soap - so far I believe the person we gave them to are enjoying them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Debbie</li>
            <li> This a a great basic soap. Not the most flowery of scents, but if you want to be clean...I mean squeaky clean...then buy this soap!</li>
            <li> Not the same lifebuoy soap from years ago.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my dad. He feels this is the only soap worth buying. He has used it for over 70 years but it&#x27;s harder to find.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SOAP....BUT ITS TRAVEL SIZE....TOO SMALL FOR PRICE.SHIPPED FAST...AND I LIKE THE SOAP....VERY LITTLE CLEANING BAR CLEANS EVERYTHING REAL GOOD</li>
            <li> The formula has somehow changed and the smell is not the same.  These small bars are just slightly larger than hotel bars.  Very disappointed.  I buy this soap in the Caribbean and it is made by Unilever in Trinidad and Tobago.  However, this soap I recently purchased is made in India and a different soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap big bars lasted a long time</li>
            <li> I have been using Lifebuoy Soap since I was a little boy (I am now 73 yrs. old) and this product is no way near what I been accustomed  using.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the other Lifebuoy soap which is being sold by Amazon ( UK Brand) and this is the Lifebuoy I am accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally disappointed and dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I wash, shampoo, and shave with my bath soap.  I have used Lifebouy soap since childhood (I&#x27;m 67 years old) and was veryl dissapointed when it was taken off the shelves in this country.  I have used a previous blend made in India, and it was favorable.  What I received in my last purchase is not as good!!  I was very displeased with the &amp;#34;bar size&amp;#34;...16 oz. is WAY TOO SMALL.</li>
            <li> Have been using  Lifebuoy for sometime and is excellent.  Wish you made soap in larger sizes.  Will continue  to order. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Purchased this soap because my old school disabled mother-in-law wanted it in the worst way, could not find it stores, swore it was the only soap that got her super clean and the smell was the best. To say the least, she was very unhappy with this fake formula that claims to be the original which she said not only was the soap the size of larger samples, but there also should be a rough grainy feel to the soap and the smell was not the same. The only reason I did not return it is because she said she could live with smell which grew on her and rated one star for that. I think she just wanted to be nice for my effort. Once it runs out I do not intend on buying again and still looking for the real thing!</li>
            <li> Would liked to have known the exact size of the bars, thought I was getting bath size bars, not the small ones they sent. If I had known this I would have never ordered this product. Lifebuoy bar soap.</li>
            <li> It is missing an ingredient that was in the original formula. Haven´t had time to check out its purpose, otherwise I like the fact that it is germicidal and does not contain anti-biotics.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this soap on Amazon.  It arrived in a timely manner and made a nice stocking stuffer for Christmas.  My family all told me that it brought back lots of &amp;#34;memories&amp;#34; from our childhood.  Smells good.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Years ago,I used lifeduoy soap.I was very pleased to use it again.</li>
            <li> This Lifebuoy Soap was purchased as a gift for someone who had nostalgic thoughts about this old product. The Seller was far more reasonable in cost than another, more well-advertised distributor who charges double!</li>
            <li> Great soap for getting the tough dirt out and feeling really clean. This soap is hard to find at a good price.</li>
