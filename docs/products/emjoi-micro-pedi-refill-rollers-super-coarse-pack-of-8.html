            <li>it&#x27;s ok-</li>
            <li>I love this system.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable, good quality.</li>
            <li>This machine is the best way to smooth out callouses from heels and the side of your big toe, but you are a slave to buying the refills.  </li>
            <li>just fine make my feet feel better than before</li>
            <li>I have smooth, elegant feet now</li>
            <li>They are for the really rough feet-a very good buy!</li>
            <li>These are not where as good as the  REAL Emjoi refills.  </li>
            <li>Better than the roller that came on the Emjoi originally..</li>
            <li>much better (for me) than the rollers that were on my original Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for slight calluses on heels and toes....</li>
            <li>So happy I found the Emjoi device and really glad to have these super coarse rollers</li>
            <li>fit great and last and came on time</li>
            <li>These rollers are much more effective on guys gnarly calloused feet not for soft girly feet</li>
            <li>These are great but could last longer...</li>
            <li>The compatible roller fit &amp; performed perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>available which I would consider when I need to reorder again just to have a comparison.</li>
            <li>This product actually works so happy that I went ahead and brought the item.  </li>
            <li>After you use the pedi  it would be good to put foot cream on and put socks on to let the cream soak into your feet while they are soft.  </li>
            <li>There was no difference between this one and the original.</li>
            <li>Nice improvement over the basic rollers and much more affordable.</li>
            <li>Nothing special here.  </li>
            <li>These are the best for hard peeling skin.  </li>
            <li>Really helps to keep my feet feeling smooth!</li>
            <li>This is MUCH more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so glad it is reasonably priced to do so.</li>
            <li>This was the answer for my super callused heels.</li>
            <li>much cheaper than buying through the manufacturer, but same great quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased I tried this &amp;#34;super coarse strength&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>They do NOTHING for the bottoms of my heels, but they do help keep the sides of my feet smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li>This was a great value too and have recommended to other people!</li>
            <li>These are very good if you are just looking for something with a little more power than the original blue ones.  </li>
            <li>Hooray for pretty feet at home!</li>
            <li>I love my micropedi and am SO glad they are finally selling these refills at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The green extra super course rollers are the best.</li>
            <li>love the super coarse ones</li>
            <li>Improvement came after the first use &amp; after the second use it looks like new skin &amp; feels soft which I haven&#x27;t experienced in years.</li>
            <li>so well I&#x27;ve been able to element a diabetic foot check each month &amp; keeping my feet in proper shape</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECCOMMEND!!</li>
            <li>I love these coarse rollers!</li>
            <li>Exactly as offered.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more gritty than the ones the emjoi came with</li>
            <li>8 rollers for under 25 dollars, good value, work just fine, these are better than the blue emjoi rollers but not quite as coarse as the green rollers,  however the green are 2 for 20 dollars, so these are fine by me.  </li>
            <li>It should be noted that these are not actual refills from the Emjoi Company; however, they do fit my Emjoi Micro-Pedi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You should be very cautious using any products on your feet unless you have the approval of your physician.</li>
            <li>Made it so much easier and quicker  </li>
            <li>These really take care of business.  </li>
            <li>Fast deliver.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it were okay but didn&#x27;t have the ability to get through rough calluses like these do!</li>
            <li>Even if you go to get a professional pedicure, the less time they have to spend on yoru callouses is more time to massage and do your legs and feet!  </li>
            <li>to get the results of smoother feet particularly stubborn heels.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend any of these emjoi rollers for your machine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;â€¢Blue: extra-coarse for normal calluses&lt;</li>
            <li>Did not feel like brand new...</li>
            <li>Helps tremendously with my severe dry skin from my diabetes.  </li>
            <li>These coarse rollers work very well, much quicker results.</li>
            <li>Works really well on my feet, takes the rough skin right off</li>
            <li>These extra course Emjoi refill rollers really work!  </li>
            <li>Definitely a terrific way to keep my feet pretty.</li>
            <li>I first purchased the regular ones like the one&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW Thank you!</li>
            <li>No need for a professional pedicure when you use this often.</li>
            <li>I expected the rollers to be a little more coarse since they were listed as &amp;#34;super coarse&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>No more cracks in my feet and using them regularly keeps my feet smooth.</li>
            <li>They barely work thru one treatment.</li>
            <li>These are good replacements, exactly as described and less expensive than other vendors.</li>

            <li> These are good replacements, exactly as described and less expensive than other vendors.</li>
            <li> we live in a very dry climate and I go barefoot alot all year long</li>
            <li> Always helps to put in new batteries when it starts to feel like it is slowing down.  </li>
            <li> Well they work...but don&#x27;t last too long, maybe 2-3 uses and you have to change them out.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last as long or work as well.  </li>
            <li> I can go a few weeks between having to do it again to make them soft again</li>
            <li> extreme coarse for the toughest of calluses and hardest of skin</li>
            <li> had extremely dry callused heels &amp; thought nothing would help them.</li>
            <li> and I use them on our rough dry feet  </li>
            <li> They work well to take of heavy callouses and seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> In my view, these should be coarse enough that you could use each roller over and over again at least a dozen or so times.</li>
            <li> Use the green before the blue.</li>
            <li> Got the product as promised &amp; is everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to over do it</li>
            <li> I have extremely rough feet</li>
            <li> They do not really work.  </li>
            <li> The price is basically right, in terms of being far less expensive than the Emjoi brand rollers, but these are still fairly expensive and STILL not coarse enough.</li>
            <li> My feet get very dry and rough during the winter months and these refills take care of that problem in much less time than the one that came</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than some other places.</li>
            <li> I will still use my machine due to the convenience and effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> is so much easier than having to do an expensive pedicure.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it being too rough.</li>
            <li> After all, you&#x27;re smoothing callouses, not filing down wood furniture.</li>
            <li> Coarse enough for my tough callouses!</li>
            <li> calluses are slight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having complained above, however, I will say that these rollers are terrific at smoothing callouses that are not too bad.</li>
            <li> They go dull even before you are done.</li>
            <li> and before I knew it the roller was all dull.</li>
            <li> My feet aren&#x27;t too bad for an old lady (74)</li>
            <li> I ordered late Wednesday night and it shipped Thursday morning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please start slowly and work your way up, depending upon the condition of your feet.  </li>
            <li> Theses work well with your emojoi micro pedi foot scrubber for removing thick and deadened skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;â€¢Black: super-coarse for tough calluses and hard skin</li>
            <li> They do not fit properly, poorly made, and useless.  </li>
            <li> but I was not happy.</li>
            <li> I am going to try the grey because I have horrifying heels</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> and I could&#x27;ve saved some money. :(</li>
            <li> ...very disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you order these!</li>
            <li> Just what I need for my nasty heels.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Better than the roller that came on the Emjoi originally..</li>
            <li> thanks&lt;br /&gt;very good material</li>
            <li> I love the Micro-Pedi and these are a must</li>
            <li> Coarse enough for my tough callouses!</li>
            <li> Helps tremendously with my severe dry skin from my diabetes.  These work so well I&#x27;ve been able to element a diabetic foot check each month &amp; keeping my feet in proper shape is so much easier than having to do an expensive pedicure.</li>
            <li> Great quality!! Will purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> Wife loves them so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Well they work...but don&#x27;t last too long, maybe 2-3 uses and you have to change them out.</li>
            <li> These are very good if you are just looking for something with a little more power than the original blue ones.  Always helps to put in new batteries when it starts to feel like it is slowing down.  Hooray for pretty feet at home!</li>
            <li> Love these with my Emjoi!!!</li>
            <li> fit great and last and came on time</li>
            <li> GLAD I FOUND THESE. THESE ARE GREAT FOR THE FEET THAT ARE NEGLECTED.</li>
            <li> love my emjoi micro pedi  and these refills work perfectly  both my husband and I use them on our rough dry feet  its like going for a pedicure it gets rid of all the rough skin and makes your heels so soft.  I can go a few weeks between having to do it again to make them soft again we live in a very dry climate and I go barefoot alot all year long so that doesnt help.  After you use the pedi  it would be good to put foot cream on and put socks on to let the cream soak into your feet while they are soft.  I highly recommend any of these emjoi rollers for your machine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best! Works well!</li>
            <li> These are great but could last longer...</li>
            <li> love the super coarse ones</li>
            <li> works very well and priced attractively.</li>
            <li> Work great on my micropedi at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> These are not where as good as the  REAL Emjoi refills.  They don&#x27;t last as long or work as well.  Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It should be noted that these are not actual refills from the Emjoi Company; however, they do fit my Emjoi Micro-Pedi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These rollers are awesome ... much better (for me) than the rollers that were on my original Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  My feet get very dry and rough during the winter months and these refills take care of that problem in much less time than the one that came factory installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 levels of grit for the Emjoi Micro-Pedi:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Blue: extra-coarse for normal calluses&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Black: super-coarse for tough calluses and hard skin&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Green: extreme coarse for the toughest of calluses and hardest of skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please start slowly and work your way up, depending upon the condition of your feet.  Individuals with Diabetes:  You should be very cautious using any products on your feet unless you have the approval of your physician.</li>
            <li> Use the green before the blue. I am going to try the grey because I have horrifying heels</li>
            <li> Did not feel like brand new...they were not wrapped individually and did not feel like original&lt;br /&gt;...very disappointed! I will never buy this again!</li>
            <li> Got the product as promised &amp; is everything I expected. Will definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> These rollers are much more effective on guys gnarly calloused feet not for soft girly feet</li>
            <li> The rollers are perfect for my use they do the job just fine make my feet feel better than before</li>
            <li> These extra course Emjoi refill rollers really work!  They also seem to last over several uses. I would definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> This was the answer for my super callused heels. I already had the emjoi device w/ the extra coarse strength roller refills that came with it. I did not realize the rollers came in varying degrees of strength until I went to order refills on Amazon.  I&#x27;m very pleased I tried this &amp;#34;super coarse strength&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed. Made it so much easier and quicker  to get the results of smoother feet particularly stubborn heels. The compatible roller fit &amp; performed perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I had extremely dry callused heels &amp; thought nothing would help them. Now I look at them all the time in amazement. Improvement came after the first use &amp; after the second use it looks like new skin &amp; feels soft which I haven&#x27;t experienced in years. So grateful to have found this product. There is an &amp;#34;Xtreme coarse&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;strength available which I would consider when I need to reorder again just to have a comparison.</li>
            <li> Theses work well with your emojoi micro pedi foot scrubber for removing thick and deadened skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> Works really well on my feet, takes the rough skin right off</li>
            <li> They barely work thru one treatment. They go dull even before you are done. I tried smoothing out the back of my heal and before I knew it the roller was all dull. Sorry but I was not happy.</li>
            <li> The price is basically right, in terms of being far less expensive than the Emjoi brand rollers, but these are still fairly expensive and STILL not coarse enough. In my view, these should be coarse enough that you could use each roller over and over again at least a dozen or so times. After all, you&#x27;re smoothing callouses, not filing down wood furniture. It makes me wonder if the folks who designed these had ANY sense of what callouses are actually like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having complained above, however, I will say that these rollers are terrific at smoothing callouses that are not too bad. They do NOTHING for the bottoms of my heels, but they do help keep the sides of my feet smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li> My feet aren&#x27;t too bad for an old lady (74) but I have a couple spots that get calluses that seem to never go away - now I can control them! So happy I found the Emjoi device and really glad to have these super coarse rollers</li>
            <li> These are a great addition to my Emjoi pedi ritual for a quick refresh.</li>
            <li> Really helps to keep my feet feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> These really take care of business.  Definitely a terrific way to keep my feet pretty.</li>
            <li> These fit my emoji perfectly and make my feet very smooth</li>
            <li> Nice improvement over the basic rollers and much more affordable. These are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Perfect for slight calluses on heels and toes.... I first purchased the regular ones like the one&lt;br /&gt;that comes with the corded Emjoi.... they were great but it took longer to use even though&lt;br /&gt;my calluses are slight.  These do the job perfect in no time...Just be careful not to over do it&lt;br /&gt;because they could cause soreness or irritation if you over do it....HIGHLY RECCOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> They work well to take of heavy callouses and seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love these coarse rollers! I had purchased my micro pedi from QVC and the rollers that came with it were okay but didn&#x27;t have the ability to get through rough calluses like these do! I will never order the others again. This was a great value too and have recommended to other people! You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you order these!</li>
            <li> Fast deliver.  These work great.  A lot cheaper than some other places.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase great quality Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love my micropedi and am SO glad they are finally selling these refills at a reasonable price.  This machine is the best way to smooth out callouses from heels and the side of your big toe, but you are a slave to buying the refills.  I can&#x27;t find them in a &amp;#34;brick and mortar&amp;#34; store.  The refills don&#x27;t last any longer than say a regular foot file or nail file, and they used to come in packs of 3 or maybe 4 for 20 dollars.  This is MUCH more reasonable.  I will still use my machine due to the convenience and effectiveness.  I&#x27;m just so glad it is reasonably priced to do so.</li>
            <li> There was no difference between this one and the original. The green extra super course rollers are the best.</li>
            <li> Fully helpful and service</li>
            <li> Exactly as offered.  Good deal.</li>
            <li> Great price and product.</li>
            <li> Man &amp;#34;O&amp;#34; Man talk about a woman going through rollers, She loves to take care of her feet. To keep her happy I will never let her run out of them.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just what I needed.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> No need to purchase anywhere else.  Great product and received in just a couple days.</li>
            <li> These rollers are great. I will be ordering them again when the time comes. Thank you. :-)</li>
            <li> Great price on refills.</li>
            <li> These work great thanks!</li>
            <li> Very reasonable, good quality.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than buying through the manufacturer, but same great quality.</li>
            <li> This product actually works so happy that I went ahead and brought the item.  Very pleased with my purchase.  I have and will continue to recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> 8 rollers for under 25 dollars, good value, work just fine, these are better than the blue emjoi rollers but not quite as coarse as the green rollers,  however the green are 2 for 20 dollars, so these are fine by me.  Love my emjoi</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok-but it&#x27;s not really extra coarse. Plus these are can be purchased in a store and I could&#x27;ve saved some money. :(</li>
            <li> Works great for removing callus from ones feet. No need for a professional pedicure when you use this often.</li>
            <li> gets the job done nicely</li>
            <li> The rollers that came with the Emjoi Pedi were fine and while effective I felt like I had to spend a great deal of time on my feet. These coarse rollers work very well, much quicker results. No more cracks in my feet and using them regularly keeps my feet smooth.</li>
            <li> I have extremely rough feet and these work the best</li>
            <li> Came in when stated and works well.</li>
            <li> Do not buy.  They do not fit properly, poorly made, and useless.  They do not really work.  Do not buy</li>
            <li> My feet never looked so good and thats  saying alot.  They are great.</li>
            <li> These are great.  They fit the Emjoi Pedi tool and do a great job removing callouses on the feet.  It&#x27;s a bit more gritty than the ones the emjoi came with so it does the job quicker.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it being too rough.</li>
            <li> These fit my Emjoi and work great.  I ordered late Wednesday night and it shipped Thursday morning.  Most amazing is I received it on Friday, from KY to CA. WOW Thank you!</li>
            <li> These are the best for hard peeling skin.  But you need the xtreme course and medium also</li>
            <li> I like these the best of all the rollers. I love this system. It is easy to use and gets the job done.  I plan on using until it dies.</li>
            <li> works great. I have smooth, elegant feet now</li>
            <li> Received on time. What a great price for 8 rollers! I hope the price stays the same. Will definitely reorder. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Work well . came on time.</li>
            <li> These are good replacements, exactly as described and less expensive than other vendors.</li>
            <li> Do It yourself!  Think about it.  Even if you go to get a professional pedicure, the less time they have to spend on yoru callouses is more time to massage and do your legs and feet!  This tool and these refills are a must have!</li>
            <li> Just what I need for my nasty heels.</li>
            <li> works great.  good value</li>
            <li> Nothing special here.  Wish they were stronger and lasted longer.</li>
            <li> They are for the really rough feet-a very good buy!</li>
            <li> I expected the rollers to be a little more coarse since they were listed as &amp;#34;super coarse&amp;#34;.  The next order will be a grade up.</li>
