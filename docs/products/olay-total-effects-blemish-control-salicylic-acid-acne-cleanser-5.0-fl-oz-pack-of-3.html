            <li>THIS blemish control cleanser is a nice one although I DO prefer some lather when washing..</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for oily skin as it is kind of oily/moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This face wash is clean - and works great.  </li>
            <li>but I love, love, love it now; somewhat of a change but a GOOD</li>
            <li>The texture of this product is like a creamy hair conditioner with very fine exfoliating particles.  </li>
            <li>What I really love about this product: No stanky smell, perfect amount of exfoliation, gentle, moisturizing and keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice smell &amp; not overpowering or too strong.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been a faithful user of this product for a year and love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena Naturals seemed to work better than this, for me.</li>
            <li>okay product but mostly paying for the name have found and made a better with more of a scrub to it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff &amp; won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still pleased with this</li>
            <li>sure is better then proactiv</li>
            <li>i would say buyyyyy :)</li>
            <li>wonderful daily cleaner</li>
            <li>My skin responds beautifully and I always get compliments on how young I look.  </li>
            <li>where can I fine the product that contain micro beads on the product?</li>
            <li>so I was anxious and nervous about how my skin would react to this product but it really, really wonderful and let me tell you I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see where this does anything for fine lines</li>
            <li>i was very surprized to see how much there was for the price i would order again in a year when i need it lol</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild &amp; gentle, keeps my acne away!!!</li>
            <li>will save my money and continue to make my own natural scrub.</li>
            <li>, I bought this for my mild acne and acne marks on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not the super product for me like everyone raved about.  </li>
            <li>I was wondering why my supply always seemed to &amp;#34;dwindle&amp;#34; so quickly.</li>
            <li>I think its best at healing current acne rather than stopping future breakouts</li>
            <li>I bought a pack of three online and within a week, my skin went back to normal, zit-free and happy.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin allergic to alot of bar soap and most clothing soaps makes me break out in hives  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much I am trying out more products from the Olay Total Effects line.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching to a more mild product, just as a precaution, after seeing the documentary &amp;#34;Chemerical!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Excellent Value compared to the retail stores, just starting using this product, make skins soft however, not enough ingredients for acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I began using this product over the summer and it was working ok since it did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>but i reported the product but keep it anyway to work with it because i don&#x60;t time to waste money My skin has look cleaner and better that what i am the most happiest about that</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]].</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different face washes throughout my years, and let me tell you...</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t even do a good job of cleaning my face.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a waste of money, but still 2 stars because it does smell pretty..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really been liking Olay products!</li>
            <li>this was my first time</li>
            <li>She noticed results after first use.</li>
            <li>I started using it about 6 months ago and it has consistently worked for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, different anti-acne face washes (Noxema, Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, Aveeno, and a couple others) with no luck</li>
            <li>I have used cleansers from Clinique, Estee Lauder, Neutrogena, St. Ives and even Clean &amp; Clear.  </li>
            <li>My face has a glow after the exfoliation, but the exfoliation is gentle enough not to irritate my skin into a breakout like the famous \\&quot;Apricot</li>
            <li>I am 100% sure I was broke out because of this face wash because my face was very normal prior to using it</li>
            <li>- so I was really worried when I first saw the consistency of this product</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne-prone skin with some fine lines around and underneath my eyes and expression lines on my forehead (no actual \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and I bought this mainly for the anti blemish properties and in that area it excels!</li>
            <li>I find it really helps to reduce my blemish outbreaks.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s done absolutely nothing for my skin</li>
            <li>This stuff has cleared my face up so much</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather much, but it takes all my makeup off and the exfoliation is pleasantly gentle.</li>
            <li>My skin was very dirty/greasy by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Let me first start by saying I have suffered with mild to moderate acne since I was a teenager, I&#x27;m now 35.</li>
            <li>It has enough moisture to balance the salicylic acid and its cleared up my skin significantly.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly in the morning/afternoon &amp; my other washes in the evening..</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;ll work for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth a try if you have adult acne and wanna try something new.</li>
            <li>I get them usually a day or two before my last one runs out and again for me keeps my face zit free, blemish free, oil free, and never makes my face feel super dry.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have older skin</li>
            <li>My main skin concerns are acne scars, redness, and mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>My face does feel clean after use &amp; not greasy or even dry..</li>
            <li>was making sure i wash it off my face completely and it cause my face to breakout because i would only use it for 2 days and then stop and start back again</li>
            <li>May work for someone with normal skin but not problem skin.</li>
            <li>While my skin is constantly changing because of &amp;#34;raging hormones&amp;#34; from menopause--or slower hormones, this blemish control wash from OLAY really helps calm and soothe my face, by far, better than other products made for the same issues.</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman of dark complexion with a bright hue/undertone so</li>
            <li>I will not try a new cleanser unless they stop making this one.  </li>
            <li>My adult son has been sneaking use of the tube because he finds that it gets rid of a lot of the oils on his skin before he shaves!  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m 21, but I do have some lines on my forehead from past sunburns and my parentheses lines are prominent for my age.</li>
            <li>My son has noticed how smooth and less irritated my skin has turned out--so he trusted my instinct.</li>
            <li>I switched to Smart Essentials Pore purifying facial wash and that seems to be clearing it up.</li>
            <li>Ive been on a search for products that will keep my skin clear and not irratate my skin</li>
            <li>... has never been as clear or as soft.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even though this product helps fight blemishes while cleaning, it&#x27;s not harsh on my face.</li>
            <li>I just made 56yrs old on the 15th of Aug</li>
            <li>All Day UV Moisturizer with SPF 15 for Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>Ever since i was little(now adult)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old and started experiencing dryness in the winter.</li>
            <li>So far nothing I have tried has worked but ever since I got the Olay Blemish control cream cleanser and Acne fighting face wash, I have noticed a difference and will continue to use it for as long as the results remain positive.</li>
            <li>and I never had acne as a teen, but it waited until I was an adult.</li>
            <li>I currently use this cleanser and the Olay Complete</li>
            <li>You only need about a dime sized portion to clean your face -- a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>sometimes it&#x27;s completely oily and sometimes it is completely dry.</li>

            <li> and I never had acne as a teen, but it waited until I was an adult.</li>
            <li> I currently use this cleanser and the Olay Complete</li>
            <li> You only need about a dime sized portion to clean your face -- a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> sometimes it&#x27;s completely oily and sometimes it is completely dry.</li>
            <li> it feels soft but has a low to medium smell to it not to harsh the only issues i had with it</li>
            <li> And I only get hormonal Acne, so it&#x27;s not like I had a ton of it to dry up but just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> yet but typical 30 year old skin aging signs).</li>
            <li> This stuff clears your skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li> the Neutrogena with Salicylic Acid was drying me out, This one didn&#x27;t do that, but it didn&#x27;t dry up my acne at all.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this for anyone who has a history of acne and who may be experiencing aging or dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> I recently switched from Clinique and prefer these hands down.</li>
            <li> After using this, I have to use at least 3-5 cotton balls with toner soaked in the to take off my makeup when usually my makeup never showed up on the first wipe!</li>
            <li> I recently moved from Manhattan NYC to Central Florida and the hard water has been making me break out.</li>
            <li> and I (used to) get an occasional breakout a few times a month.  </li>
            <li> You must try I use for only few months now..</li>
            <li> and I found very little difference than say regular Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> However, my friend who recommended this product to me has not encountered this problem - it may react differently on other people.</li>
            <li> Have to use with other skin regimens for acne.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this would be too drying for twice a day but its really not!</li>
            <li> I thought I would try Olay Total Effects instead of my usual acne medication.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s due to using this in combination with Dickinson&#x27;s Oil Controlling Astringent and a moisturizer with BHA and/or AHA&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li> , now I&#x27;m only 25 with combination skin, but I have a couple small lines on my forehead and around my mouth and a couple dark spots from the sun on my cheeks, but that&#x27;s not why I bought this</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and suffer from an occasional breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 4 Olay cleansers &amp; the  facial cleansing cloths..  </li>
            <li> It all depends on what works for you, but this face wash makes my skin look stellar, the mark up in stores is crazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this if it stops working for me, but until then, i&#x27;m not gonna mess with what&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I was out of it for a week &amp; broke out a little.</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun, even had to get laser treatments when it was at its worst which cleared me up for awhile but left some light scarring).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a pimple after using this product for approximately 7 months now.  </li>
            <li> They were small but all over my face.  </li>
            <li> not sure</li>
            <li> so i am not sure</li>
            <li> Anything in the past that has worked for me stopped working after awhile</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not nearly as many (maybe one or two around that time of the month).</li>
            <li> Overall, my skin is 90% clearer (even now in the warmer, humid months when my skin usually goes crazy with breakouts)</li>
            <li> I have weird skin--</li>
            <li> I tried everything from spa products to expensive acne cleansers to Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> ... has never been as clear or as soft.  This stuff clears your skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  It is a miracle!</li>
            <li> I feel it works great and I bought it for my granddaughter and she is 15.  She loves it too!</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for over a year.  I love it.  I find it really helps to reduce my blemish outbreaks.</li>
            <li> I recently moved from Manhattan NYC to Central Florida and the hard water has been making me break out. So far nothing I have tried has worked but ever since I got the Olay Blemish control cream cleanser and Acne fighting face wash, I have noticed a difference and will continue to use it for as long as the results remain positive. I am an African American woman of dark complexion with a bright hue/undertone so when I find a product that works, I utilize it. KEEP MAKING THIS OLAY!</li>
            <li> Yes, this face wash broke me out, it made my face oily and sticky! Don&#x27;t buy.     I am 100% sure I was broke out because of this face wash because my face was very normal prior to using it</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to someone who has problems with clogged pores and acne. However, my friend who recommended this product to me has not encountered this problem - it may react differently on other people.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and am in my 40&#x27;s.  I was breaking out last summer just after nursing my daughter and nothing would touch the blemishes.  They were small but all over my face.  I saw an ad for this cleanser and thought \\&quot;why not\\&quot;.  I have really sensitive skin so I was a bit worried that a daily scrub would irritate my skin but I have to say, I have been a faithful user of this product for a year and love, love, love it.  My skin responds beautifully and I always get compliments on how young I look.  Now whether that&#x27;s good genes or Olay... not sure but this product is great.</li>
            <li> Excellent Value compared to the retail stores, just starting using this product, make skins soft however, not enough ingredients for acne prone skin.  Have to use with other skin regimens for acne.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin allergic to alot of bar soap and most clothing soaps makes me break out in hives  but this face cleanser is great!  Ive been on a search for products that will keep my skin clear and not irratate my skin and i finally found one!</li>
            <li> I began using this product over the summer and it was working ok since it did not dry out my skin. Two months ago I bought  [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]. The two products together made a difference my husband noticed after five days! I also use Clinique Anti-Blemish makeup. The three products made a difference in my complextion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s, I have combination skin and I (used to) get an occasional breakout a few times a month.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a pimple after using this product for approximately 7 months now.  I have used cleansers from Clinique, Estee Lauder, Neutrogena, St. Ives and even Clean &amp; Clear.  No product has won me over like this one.  I will not try a new cleanser unless they stop making this one.  The texture of this product is like a creamy hair conditioner with very fine exfoliating particles.  You only need about a dime sized portion to clean your face -- a little goes a long way.  My face has a glow after the exfoliation, but the exfoliation is gentle enough not to irritate my skin into a breakout like the famous \\&quot;Apricot Scrub\\&quot; a lot of people use from St. Ives.  I love this product so much I am trying out more products from the Olay Total Effects line.  Wonderful product, and a surprisingly reasonable price.  Thank you Olay and Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!  I have weird skin-- sometimes it&#x27;s completely oily and sometimes it is completely dry. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and suffer from an occasional breakout. This cleanser is the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different face washes throughout my years, and let me tell you... This has to be the worst one. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin it give or make it red, but it did not wash my face at all! After using this, I have to use at least 3-5 cotton balls with toner soaked in the to take off my makeup when usually my makeup never showed up on the first wipe! Face wash should wash your face, this product did not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, different anti-acne face washes (Noxema, Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, Aveeno, and a couple others) with no luck and I stumbled on this one day, now I&#x27;m only 25 with combination skin, but I have a couple small lines on my forehead and around my mouth and a couple dark spots from the sun on my cheeks, but that&#x27;s not why I bought this, I bought this for my mild acne and acne marks on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this about a month ago, twice a day and it&#x27;s done absolutely nothing for my skin, the acne/acne marks still remains, the lines, the spots...all still the same, it doesn&#x27;t even do a good job of cleaning my face.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a waste of money, but still 2 stars because it does smell pretty..</li>
            <li> Not the super product for me like everyone raved about.  I still get acne, still have the same problems overall.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or the products but nothing seems to work.  I tried Avons system which also got good ratings and I found very little difference than say regular Neutrogena products.  Neutrogena Naturals seemed to work better than this, for me.</li>
            <li> okay product but mostly paying for the name have found and made a better with more of a scrub to it. will save my money and continue to make my own natural scrub.</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying I have suffered with mild to moderate acne since I was a teenager, I&#x27;m now 35. This stuff has cleared my face up so much I don&#x27;t have one pimple. I was out of it for a week &amp; broke out a little. I love this stuff &amp; won&#x27;t use anything else. It&#x27;s mild &amp; gentle, keeps my acne away!!!</li>
            <li> This face wash is clean - and works great.  Sometimes facewash seems to leave a film on my skin, but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The best thing about about this cleanser is that it contains salicylic acid. Even though this product helps fight blemishes while cleaning, it&#x27;s not harsh on my face. And you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s deal!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works for my face or my back. I just made 56yrs old on the 15th of Aug and I never had acne as a teen, but it waited until I was an adult. Thank you for carrying this product all the stores don&#x27;t carry this any longer.</li>
            <li> yes, I&#x27;ve looked everwhere for this product with the micro beads, but the updated Olay cleansers do not show micro beads in the discriptions. where can I fine the product that contain micro beads on the product?</li>
            <li> While my skin is constantly changing because of &amp;#34;raging hormones&amp;#34; from menopause--or slower hormones, this blemish control wash from OLAY really helps calm and soothe my face, by far, better than other products made for the same issues. I can actually feel the lightness of the effectiveness with Olay Total Effects Blemish Control Salicylic Face Wash. My adult son has been sneaking use of the tube because he finds that it gets rid of a lot of the oils on his skin before he shaves!  Who knew? I was wondering why my supply always seemed to &amp;#34;dwindle&amp;#34; so quickly. For some reason he believes that Olay products were only for women--maybe because his Grandmother used it as well as his Mother. My son has noticed how smooth and less irritated my skin has turned out--so he trusted my instinct. The products arrived without incident and well packaged. From now on, David will be ordering for the BOTH of us!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really been liking Olay products! I recently switched from Clinique and prefer these hands down. I currently use this cleanser and the Olay Complete All Day UV Moisturizer with SPF 15 for Sensitive Skin and thats all! Sometimes I&#x27;ll use another brand spot stick, but not often. I was using the Olay Acne Control Face Wash and didn&#x27;t have any complaints, but after switching to this cleanser I can say this one is a lot better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have older skin, I&#x27;m 21, but I do have some lines on my forehead from past sunburns and my parentheses lines are prominent for my age. My main skin concerns are acne scars, redness, and mild to moderate acne. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week, 2 times a day. I was worried that this would be too drying for twice a day but its really not! It has enough moisture to balance the salicylic acid and its cleared up my skin significantly. I think its best at healing current acne rather than stopping future breakouts but I&#x27;m still pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed anything concerning lines, but its only been a week and I bought this mainly for the anti blemish properties and in that area it excels! Doesn&#x27;t lather much, but it takes all my makeup off and the exfoliation is pleasantly gentle. I like the smell too! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I thought this product might have been a foaming cleanser but it&#x27;s a cream.  I am 41 and have had oily skin all my life and have gotten used to using foaming products for my oily skin - instead of cream - so I was really worried when I first saw the consistency of this product but I love, love, love it now; somewhat of a change but a GOOD change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this together with the Daily Moisturizer online after doing an Olay skin analysis online so I was anxious and nervous about how my skin would react to this product but it really, really wonderful and let me tell you I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years.  I think I&#x27;ve finally found my &amp;#34;brand for life&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Olay.</li>
            <li> It is truly works!! You must try I use for only few months now..I already see the improvements in affordable price..</li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients are known to be carcinogens. I&#x27;m switching to a more mild product, just as a precaution, after seeing the documentary &amp;#34;Chemerical!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Ever since i was little(now adult) i been dealing with acne A headache right so i was goggling was the best acne product seen this so decided to buy I never use Olay in my life this was my first time so i put this on my face it feels soft but has a low to medium smell to it not to harsh the only issues i had with it was making sure i wash it off my face completely and it cause my face to breakout because i would only use it for 2 days and then stop and start back again i have low acne so i am not sure lf that the reason why my face was breaking out but i reported the product but keep it anyway to work with it because i don&#x60;t time to waste money My skin has look cleaner and better that what i am the most happiest about that my honest review and sure is better then proactiv i would say buyyyyy :)</li>
            <li> Even my teenager likes it. She noticed results after first use.</li>
            <li> I purchased for the use in Africa when traveling in the dirt/dust and multiple applications of Sunscreen every day.  My skin was very dirty/greasy by the end of the day.  It washed everything off,  I did not break out once during the 2 week trip.</li>
            <li> I tried this b/c the Neutrogena with Salicylic Acid was drying me out, This one didn&#x27;t do that, but it didn&#x27;t dry up my acne at all. And I only get hormonal Acne, so it&#x27;s not like I had a ton of it to dry up but just didn&#x27;t work for me. Plus I noticed it gave me blackheads around my nose and chin. So stopped using it. May work for someone with normal skin but not problem skin.</li>
            <li> Well I decided to use this product and it broke out my skin.I think it might be the salicylic acid.I don&#x27;t have acne but I was checking out different face wash and this broke out my skin. I switched to Smart Essentials Pore purifying facial wash and that seems to be clearing it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34; on the Olay line for a while now &amp; when I found this cleanser was being discontinued I knew that I had to try it..  I&#x27;ve tried at least 4 Olay cleansers &amp; the  facial cleansing cloths..  THIS blemish control cleanser is a nice one although I DO prefer some lather when washing.. (Olay revitalizing cleanser is same as this one but w/o salicylic)  This blemish cleanser  feels  like your spreading/cleaning your face with lotion or cold cream.  My face does feel clean after use &amp; not greasy or even dry.. (have oily skin)  I use this mostly in the morning/afternoon &amp; my other washes in the evening.. Nice smell &amp; not overpowering or too strong.  I thought I would like this cleanser so I got a couple bottles..  All Olay is great stuff!  :)</li>
            <li> It all depends on what works for you, but this face wash makes my skin look stellar, the mark up in stores is crazy so i buy them in a 3 pack and have it auto-reorder every 3 months. I get them usually a day or two before my last one runs out and again for me keeps my face zit free, blemish free, oil free, and never makes my face feel super dry. I&#x27;ve used it over a year and I actually feel it has helped maintain me looking younger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and started experiencing dryness in the winter. I thought I would try Olay Total Effects instead of my usual acne medication. I have to say after 2 weeks my skin is noticeably smoother. It had my husband asking me if I was wearing makeup. I would suggest this for anyone who has a history of acne and who may be experiencing aging or dry skin as well. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for oily skin as it is kind of oily/moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have had nary a zit. When local stores stopped selling it, my skin went into freakout mode. I tried everything from spa products to expensive acne cleansers to Burt&#x27;s Bees. Nothing stopped the influx of pimples on my face. I felt like I was 17 again. Defeated and covered in acne scars, I Googled Olay in hopes of finding a stash online. I bought a pack of three online and within a week, my skin went back to normal, zit-free and happy. I recommend buying from Ulta, because $36 is grossly overpriced for a product that costs just over $5 a bottle. What I really love about this product: No stanky smell, perfect amount of exfoliation, gentle, moisturizing and keeps my skin smooth. What a relief to have it back in my life. NEVER DISCONTINUE THIS, PLEASE. I&#x27;ll just die.</li>
            <li> Works great. I will keep this in my bathroom. The salicylic acid helps with my break outs. I like this for the price</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin with some fine lines around and underneath my eyes and expression lines on my forehead (no actual \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot; yet but typical 30 year old skin aging signs). I don&#x27;t see where this does anything for fine lines but I keep coming back to it because of what I feel it has done for my acne (i&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun, even had to get laser treatments when it was at its worst which cleared me up for awhile but left some light scarring). Anything in the past that has worked for me stopped working after awhile (Yes to Tomatos acne cleanser and masque being the best product until this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff, however, has been a Godsend. I started using it about 6 months ago and it has consistently worked for me. I do still get zits here and there, but I find they go away much faster (within a few days instead of having the same ones for months) and there&#x27;s not nearly as many (maybe one or two around that time of the month). Overall, my skin is 90% clearer (even now in the warmer, humid months when my skin usually goes crazy with breakouts) and i&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s due to using this in combination with Dickinson&#x27;s Oil Controlling Astringent and a moisturizer with BHA and/or AHA&#x27;s in it. Can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;ll work for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth a try if you have adult acne and wanna try something new. I&#x27;ll update this if it stops working for me, but until then, i&#x27;m not gonna mess with what&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> wonderful daily cleaner</li>
            <li> i was very surprized to see how much there was for the price i would order again in a year when i need it lol</li>
