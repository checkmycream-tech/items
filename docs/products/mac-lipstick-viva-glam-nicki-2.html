            <li>A 4/5 :)</li>

            <li>I am really satisfied with my shipment and lipstick</li>
            <li>My Daughter Loves it need to order more....</li>
            <li>I love wearing this alone or under a peachy gloss.</li>

            <li>I wanted it I refuse to pay more than 16</li>
            <li>II absolutely Love this lipstick i ordered it and received it</li>
            <li>Love this color from Mac</li>
            <li>Over all beautiful color and great to mix it with other lipstick shades!</li>
            <li>and I mix it with another color from Mac to create a unique color!</li>
            <li>the price Mac should keep this color instead of having to pay 4 times the original price for it!</li>
            <li>i loved it so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try it with more looks.</li>
            <li>So for now this is fine with me.</li>
            <li>However, I use this color with other color lipsticks to create a unique but beautiful color!</li>
            <li>Creamy &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>This was a great deal actually.</li>
            <li>but I went on a great long search</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a pink/lavender lipstick kind of girl...</li>
            <li>true casing and everything.</li>
            <li>The price i believe was $20 not bad for viva glam nicki</li>
            <li>with much resentment &amp; decided in the end, that no matter how much I loved the color, next time I should move on and find something else that I love as much!</li>
            <li>I recently bought this lipstick and im in love with it!......</li>
            <li>i just ordered another one and i will be ordering another next week too thanks so much for your great service</li>
            <li>but so worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the quick delivery, I received mine 2 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy, long lasting, bright, and surprisingly looks fantastic with my pale skin.</li>
            <li>This color is so pretty</li>
            <li>thank you so much Pam treasurers you rock!</li>
            <li>I WAS SO PRETTY AND BROUGHT COLOR TO HUE.  </li>
            <li>IDK IF ITS MY COMPLEXION OR WHAT!IT GOT OLD PRETTY QUICK</li>
            <li>great on my skin tone, not fair but light/medium.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and smooth and the tube will last a while</li>
            <li>I did find it on Amazon; however, the price was really gauged &amp; I did spend the money for this lipstick, but</li>
            <li>Love wearing this with all black.</li>
            <li>i will definitely be buying more in the future !!</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>Upon arrival the packaging was the normal MAC box</li>
            <li>I like this lipstick and color too, but it is much more pale than I was expecting</li>
            <li>and if it comes back into stock, it will be sold out just as fast.</li>
            <li>If you go on other sites for this particular color and brand they charge a lot or send you a fake one, I am very pleased with my order and how fast it came.</li>
            <li>with the shipping and everything it is double the price of the lipstick if you got it from mac cosmetics directly.</li>
            <li>This particular color was limited edition.  </li>

            <li> This particular color was limited edition.  </li>
            <li> and this last so long!</li>
            <li> but it was also placed in a pink mesh bag for an extra touch.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t limited edition.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend using a dark purple liner to tone it down.</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t wait could have gotten it for third of price in Debanams glasgow if only I knew</li>
            <li> 2 days later i was so shocked how fast i received it</li>
            <li> Too bad it was a limited edition and the cost is so high now.</li>
            <li> I found it for half this price on line but looks like I&#x27;ll have to stock up!</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but that&#x27;s what i get for waiting for this to retire to try it out!</li>
            <li> The lipstick is so hard to find none of the MAC counters have it</li>
            <li> This lipstick is so hard to find in the Mac store.</li>
            <li> but enough about my bad habits here.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to look horrible since only dark skinned women were swatching it-</li>
            <li> SO ILL RATE</li>
            <li> Eghh sorry</li>
            <li> however I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with</li>

            <li> This color is so pretty but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> very good quality will buy again love this nice color nice! would recommend this to a friend!  costly but so worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I got this. with the shipping and everything it is double the price of the lipstick if you got it from mac cosmetics directly. However, it&#x27;s been sold out forever and I have a feeling when and if it comes back into stock, it will be sold out just as fast. So for now this is fine with me. true casing and everything. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did forget to say.. I order this Wednesday night, regular shipping, and I got it Saturday morning.  Way before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE COLOR JUST NOT ON ME IDK IF ITS MY COMPLEXION OR WHAT!IT GOT OLD PRETTY QUICK BUT I LOVE NICKIS LIPSTICKS!!! SO ILL RATE IT A 4/5 :)</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t wait could have gotten it for third of price in Debanams glasgow if only I knew</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on July 30th and received way ahead of time. The lipstick is so hard to find none of the MAC counters have it and they said they won&#x27;t be selling it anymore but I had to have it. Upon arrival the packaging was the normal MAC box but it was also placed in a pink mesh bag for an extra touch. Product is perfect! Not a scam...will do business with them again</li>
            <li> I recently bought this lipstick and im in love with it!...... The price i believe was $20 not bad for viva glam nicki 2&lt;br /&gt;the packaging was ok....... I would definitely recommend this lipstick , and i think im gonna have to go back and buy me another one before they are gonna ..... if this lipstick is not for you check out the seller they have great product and good pricing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy, long lasting, bright, and surprisingly looks fantastic with my pale skin. It even makes my teeth look whiter! I&#x27;m not usually a pink/lavender lipstick kind of girl...I&#x27;m all for reds and nudes...but this color is now my favorite! I wish it wasn&#x27;t limited edition. Only downside to this product.</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick and color too, but it is much more pale than I was expecting so it looks a bit washed out on my complexion. However, I use this color with other color lipsticks to create a unique but beautiful color!</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but that&#x27;s what i get for waiting for this to retire to try it out! fast shipping was very nice! This color is awesome - its the lavender equivalent to Gaga&#x27;s first Viva color! Love wearing this with all black. POWER LIPS!</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with my shipment and lipstick this color is so beautiful I wish Mac could sell this lipstick by nicki minaj forever but I went on a great long search and I came upon this great seller with the real deal for a great price thank you so much Pam treasurers you rock!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful lippie I&#x27;m a darker tone woman and I would recommend using a dark purple liner to tone it down. But it was the color is beautiful and the seller is awesome!</li>
            <li> My Daughter Loves it need to order more....</li>
            <li> I love this color, its so feminine, beautiful, exotic and it lasts.</li>
            <li> Get yer 60&#x27;s on here! I love wearing this alone or under a peachy gloss. Still a lavender, but totally wearable. Creamy &amp; smooth. Staying power is about a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. A solid 8 if I ever quit smoking*...but enough about my bad habits here. Hope this is in MAC&#x27;s permanent collection before the price gets totally out of control. Will buy again if, for some reason, I use this all up. Might just sit in my sea of lipsticks after the Spring.&lt;br /&gt;*I quit smoking....and this last so long! Too bad it was a limited edition and the cost is so high now.</li>
            <li> Wow!! Thank you so much for the quick delivery, I received mine 2 days after I ordered it. The color does come out lighter in pictures rather than in person. But it is sooooo cute and a must have. This lipstick is so hard to find in the Mac store. Once again Thank Youuuu! I&#x27;m so happy!!</li>
            <li> I wanted it I refuse to pay more than 16$ that&#x27;s it&#x27;s worth. Eghh sorry</li>
            <li> I NEEDED THIS LIPSTICK AND THE MAC STORE NO LONGER CARRIED THIS COLOR.  I WAS THRILLED TO FIND IT.  SHOULD ORDER MORE !</li>
            <li> II absolutely Love this lipstick i ordered it and received it 2 days later i was so shocked how fast i received it i loved it so much i just ordered another one and i will be ordering another next week too thanks so much for your great service i will definitely be buying more in the future !! P.s. i loved the bag you put lipstick in</li>
            <li> Love this color from Mac I use it every day and I mix it with another color from Mac to create a unique color! It&#x27;s very creamy and smooth and the tube will last a while however I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the price Mac should keep this color instead of having to pay 4 times the original price for it! I found it for half this price on line but looks like I&#x27;ll have to stock up! Over all beautiful color and great to mix it with other lipstick shades! Please Mac bring it back!!!!!</li>
            <li> This particular color was limited edition.  I did find it on Amazon; however, the price was really gauged &amp; I did spend the money for this lipstick, but with much resentment &amp; decided in the end, that no matter how much I loved the color, next time I should move on and find something else that I love as much!</li>
            <li> This was a great deal actually. If you go on other sites for this particular color and brand they charge a lot or send you a fake one, I am very pleased with my order and how fast it came. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> On camera it comes off way lighter than in person. great on my skin tone, not fair but light/medium.  from photos I thought it was going to look horrible since only dark skinned women were swatching it- BUT its amazing!  I&#x27;m excited to try it with more looks.</li>
            <li> I CHOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE IT MET MY QUALIFICATIONS.  I WAS SO PRETTY AND BROUGHT COLOR TO HUE.  iI WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS.</li>
