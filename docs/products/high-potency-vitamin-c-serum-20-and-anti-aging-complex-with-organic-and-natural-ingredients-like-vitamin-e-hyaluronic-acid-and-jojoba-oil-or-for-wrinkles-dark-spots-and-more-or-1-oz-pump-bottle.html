            <li> I did have issues with a slight sticky feel to it before it completely dried.  </li>
            <li> Other Vitamin C serums that I have tried in the past had droppers to apply the serum and it gets messy using them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries within a few minutes</li>
            <li> I have seen slight changes in my skin&#x27;s appearance so that is encouraging!</li>
            <li> Not exactly thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> Some are very thin, and some a bit thicker.  </li>

            <li> Fast shipping. Item as described. Arrived in perfect condition. Serum seems to be improving my fine lines and dark spots on my face. It also has a nice texture and absorbs quickly. Although I have only been using it for about ten days it does seem to be helping. That&#x27;s all you can really hope for is a product to help and this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I have received this product for free or at a promotional price to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Just received this and I&#x27;m excited to use it and see what it&#x27;s about. Update...after a couple of weeks of using this product, it seem to be ok.</li>
            <li> Bonapeil Vitamin C Serum is amazing it makes my skin feel so soft. With the change of seasons my face has seemed very dry and I noticed this stated it helped with hydration so decided to get it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face now is no longer dry and I am enjoying the other benefits to such as firmness. This serum has quite a few fine qualities but my favorite is it boosts collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to stay looking young as long as possible. This serum will help me do that and it will last for a long time since I only need to use a little for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries within a few minutes and I can move on with the rest of my daily routines!! Glad I had a chance to review this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item in exchange of my honest unbiased review. All reviews are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum has become a Holy Grail, can&#x27;t live without it skincare item for me.  I have been loving this one that Bonapiel recently sent me to test out and review for them.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, if you are not using Vitamin C Serum yet you really need to start NOW!  I have even convinced several of my girlfriends and my own mother to start using Vitamin C Serum as part of their everyday skincare routines and they LOVE the stuff as much as I do.  Why?  Because, it works!&lt;br /&gt;The Bonapiel Vitamin C Facial Serum has the perfect ingredients for reducing fine lines &amp; wrinkles, fading hyperpigmentation, shrinking pores and even clearing up acne.  Not only is it loaded with Vitamin C but it also has Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Moisturizing Exotic Jojoba Oil!&lt;br /&gt;I apply my Vitamin C Serum to my face, neck, decollete and even my shoulders as part of both my morning and evening skincare routines.  The serum is lightweight and absorbs really quickly so it can easily be worn under makeup. LOVE.THIS.STUFF!</li>
            <li> light weight and my skin loves it</li>
            <li> First of all I was really impressed with this serum because of the pump activator. Other Vitamin C serums that I have tried in the past had droppers to apply the serum and it gets messy using them. With the Bonapiel there is no mess or dripping.&lt;br /&gt;The Bonapiel Serum is a light gel-like product that goes on really smoothly. There is no sticky residue feeling afterwards and absorbs in seconds. It is also fragrance free which is nice in that there is no flowery overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Bonapiel Vitamin C Facial Serum for a short time and love how it is making my skin more healthy and better looking already! I received free product in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> You have such gave it to his parents that you like a figure that products.</li>
            <li> Great serum. Workd well with my skin&lt;br /&gt;Brightens my skin&lt;br /&gt;Im satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> This serum is one of the best to boost skin tone and looks.  I will not be without it!  It is one of the greatest products.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, My wife loves it</li>
            <li> Not exactly thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, high quality serum, and a very good value. It has the right amount of vitamin C, and it is in a stable form. Vitamin C serum is staple of my skin care routine. I&#x27;m 42, and most people think I am in my 20s.</li>
            <li> The viscosity is proper, it make skin moist~! you can feel your skin is getting younger.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It&#x27;s just the right amount of texture. Not really light but not heavy at all. I put it on in the morning and wear it under my makeup and sometimes I will use it also at night. This gives me a double dose of a great product. I have noticed my face is super soft and smooth. I also noticed that it gives my face a healthy glow. I have used viatamin C serums before and with my skin being sensitive they have given me breakouts. Not with this product at all. I really love this product and will be buying more. Also wanted to include that the Customer Service is excellent with this company they really care if your satified with your purchase. To me that means alot since I order alot from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product! After one week, I noticed my skin had a glow that it never has had before, and my skin was smoother. Fine lines seem to have been reduced as well.</li>
            <li> People noticed significant difference in my appearance</li>
            <li> And is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Okay, but watery.  Prefer other serums.</li>
            <li> Very good. Nice Product</li>
            <li> If you do choose to to use a Vitamin C Facial Serum, this is a good one. Applying it is simple, especially using the small pump bottle - perfect for on the go as well! While the bottle appears small, a little goes a long way and this stuff only need about 2 pumps to cover my whole face. It dries quickly leaving no sticky residue. In fact, my face feels more like I just washed and cleaned it after each use. Since trying the product my face is more moisturized and hydrated so if anything that&#x27;s a plus! A great product to have added to my regular skin care routine!</li>
            <li> No improvement noticed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this very long to say I love it but I do like it.  It does feel great, not heavy. I have seen slight changes in my skin&#x27;s appearance so that is encouraging!</li>
            <li> had the chance to try out the Vitamin C Facial serum and thought that it was great. I love the bottle that it came in and thought that it would make a great gift to buy and give to someone that love facial products. The facial serum made my face nice and soft, but also kept the skin feeling nice and firm as well. My skin looked great each day that I used it and my sister in law asked if I was using something new on my face and if so she wanted to know what the product was.&lt;br /&gt;It really is a great product to use. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> Good price, good performance</li>
            <li> Great. It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. This is one of the best vitamin c serums that I used yet</li>
            <li> Really good product. I like it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This came earlier than I expect. Item was described just as the seller said and packaging was good!&lt;br /&gt;Light and non-sticky is one of my favorites point of this serum. Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Is an excellent product. Fits my skin and soft  I can feel that the skin is healing. Thanks!</li>
            <li> good.&lt;br /&gt;before i go to bed, i always use this, and when i get up next day.. i feel my face is very good.</li>
            <li> So far I really can tell a difference.  My skin feels better and is softer</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful vitamin C serum.  Some are very thin, and some a bit thicker.  This one has just enough &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; to it, to not run right off of your face.  It absorbs quickly, and leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying i have very sensitive skin and experience breakouts with about 90% of anything i put on my face.  I have used this for about two months and i have had no breakouts other than my normal.  I have dry-normal type skin and this hydrates my skin very well, i can tell a huge difference in hydration on the days i use it in the morning and days i do not.  To me that&#x27;s a win-win and a product i will continue to use!!</li>
            <li> I love it I really works!</li>
            <li> First, thank you for the opportunity to use this great product . It is perfect in every way .</li>
            <li> This is really great serum. It works well and makes your skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> The formula of this is very light weight. The serum goes on very easily underneath my daily moisturizer and makes my skin feel wonderful. It contains therapeutic-grade Vitamin C and E-Hyaluronic Acid and is non-GMO - something I always try to look for in my beauty products! I have had a great experience using this serum and I&#x27;m really happy that Bonapiel sent it to me for review.</li>
            <li> very nice!! thank u so much</li>
            <li> This one is unscented and comes out of the bottle easily.  I did have issues with a slight sticky feel to it before it completely dried.  It works well on the lip and eye areas, I have seen some softening of the lines.  The packaging is easy to read and easy to open.</li>
            <li> Love this product, feels great on my face and makes your skin so soft!</li>
