            <li>and it is a ittle too dark for my tone but perfect in the summer when i go darker.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with this shade and the price was right</li>
            <li>During hot periods I can just dab my face with a hand towel and my makeup is as good as new.</li>
            <li>so it is a super find to see that you have it.</li>
            <li>Super stay is super.</li>
            <li>AND I WAS LUCKY TO GET IT.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, it&#x27;s too light and orange.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect color for me and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>do not need to much to look fabulous</li>
            <li>But i am in love with this product so far, but we will see how my journey goes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing for women of rich color who want to cover blemishes or dark spots.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it suppose to do.  </li>
            <li>I open the product as soon as I go it and used my fingers to apply some on my cheeks where I experience most of my blemishes.</li>
            <li>This Item arrived fast and just as described!</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Thanks Again!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and this is my first time using foundation</li>
            <li>Skin looks smooth and natural.</li>
            <li>I still look good when I get home no matter how hard my day is.</li>
            <li>This foundation doesn&#x27;t do much for people with oily skin</li>
            <li>Thanks to whomever</li>
            <li>I really like the make up.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new staple.</li>
            <li>Brand new.</li>
            <li>Still looks natural and works wonders!</li>
            <li>Really nice, a little goes a long way with this one.</li>
            <li>Cocoa is like my exact shade and doesn&#x27;t give me an ashy or grey undertone that their cocoa age rewind foundation does, which used to be my staple.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I want to thank you sooooo much for having this makeup and especially in her color!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again soon for her.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for the cocoa color.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it spreads and blends easily.</li>
            <li>This is the only makeup that blends with my complexion and looks natural.</li>
            <li>The amount actually lasts a pretty long time; I would say  2-4 months depending on if you wear foundation everyday and how much.</li>
            <li>I am new to the foundation scene and never actually own a foundation in my 21 years of life, i know sad lol.</li>

            <li> I love this product,unfortunately it cannot be found in Miami.You are a life_saver for me.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it suppose to do.  24hr stay.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! It&#x27;s my new staple. Cocoa is like my exact shade and doesn&#x27;t give me an ashy or grey undertone that their cocoa age rewind foundation does, which used to be my staple. It sucks that the color selection is so limited. If your not as dark as me, I would suggest blending two shades to match your skin tone. I can never find the cocoa shade in my local drugstore so I always have to buy it online. It always delivered on time. The amount actually lasts a pretty long time; I would say  2-4 months depending on if you wear foundation everyday and how much. You don&#x27;t need a lot at all. A little goes a long way and it spreads and blends easily. This foundation doesn&#x27;t do much for people with oily skin so I would definitely set it with a powder.</li>
            <li> Really nice, a little goes a long way with this one.</li>
            <li> Great color I can&#x27;t wait to use this product!</li>
            <li> Favorite foundation! Great for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color for me and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> Luv, luv, luv the silky look &amp; feel of this makeup</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS PERFECT FOR MY COMPLEXION, THE 3 STARS IS FOR THE DELIVERY. BOTH TIMES I RECEIVED A DELIVERY 1 BOTTLE IS FULLY DRAINED OUT INTO THE PACKAGE, THIS FROM A BOTTLE TOP THAT IS SCREWED ON.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for the cocoa color. No one seems to sell it anymore. The cocoa color is perfect for my skin tone. When i say i have been to every drug store, walmart, and ulta, i mean it.  They dont even have it on the maybelline website. Is it discontinued or something. Thanks to whomever im buying this from, cause indont wanna switch to any other product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product for several reasons. Firstly, it&#x27;s too light and orange. It was too orange for me to use as a highlight color and I could&#x27;t even use it under my eyebrows. If its not blended out fully, it looks like dirt smeared across the face and it&#x27;s a mess.</li>
            <li> I love it ..it blends in very well with my skin Am happy with this and will be ordering more</li>
            <li> The product was shipped to me within 3 days of order and came in one piece. It was well packaged. I am new to the foundation scene and never actually own a foundation in my 21 years of life, i know sad lol. The only time I have ever had foundation on my face was for my senior prom, but enough babbling and back to the product. I open the product as soon as I go it and used my fingers to apply some on my cheeks where I experience most of my blemishes. I was scared that the cocoa would have been to dark for my complex but it is actually lighter than the picture makes  it out to be. The foundation went on smoothly and it covered up my blemishes nicely. I just got my stipple brush today so I am actually going to experiment and put it on my entire face. But i am in love with this product so far, but we will see how my journey goes.</li>
            <li> It worked well and its sweat proof the only problem was its to dark for my skin tone</li>
            <li> I love this product. So glad I could order it online. The ease of application is wonderful. The shade is perfect for me. I don&#x27;t have to mix or blend with anything else. It lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Love it works well gives you a soft look with just a small amount do not need to much to look fabulous</li>
            <li> good product. Gemey Maybelline never disapoint when it comes to foundation. Gives a nice warmth to the skin tone. Perfect coverage, a imperfections are erased. I am a NW45 by mac and it is a ittle too dark for my tone but perfect in the summer when i go darker. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s amazing for women of rich color who want to cover blemishes or dark spots.</li>
            <li> This i my goto foundation of choice when I don&#x27;t use my MAC foundation.  This Item arrived fast and just as described!</li>
            <li> Love this foundation it is literally flawless with my skin</li>
            <li> I really like the make up. It stays on you face and not your collar or shirt. I can no longer find it in stores so it is a super find to see that you have it.</li>
            <li> love it!!!! saved me $4</li>
            <li> Product arrived safely, correct color, not expired.  I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this product and would buy it again if I run out.</li>
            <li> This is the best long wearing all day makeup for the summer...especially for women of color. Too bad Maybelline has decided to discontinue it. thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I got the wrong shade...</li>
            <li> Great quality and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Just wonderful. Will shop again!</li>
            <li> Matches my skin perfectly and so much cheaper than the stores.</li>
            <li> I live in a country where the average daily temperature is approximately 83 degrees F. I have sweated in this makeup, worked 12hr shifts in this product. It does not move and looks FLAWLESS! Still looks natural and works wonders! Even after a 1hr jog and a 45 minute gym workout! I constantly need to keep this product in stock. I have tried other brands. This is the best.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time,  just what I&#x27;d ordered. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Oh yeah i love this and it last all day  and no break outs trust me I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Perfect stay on makeup. It last all day for me. I still look good when I get home no matter how hard my day is. Super stay is super.</li>
            <li> This is the only makeup that blends with my complexion and looks natural. Too bad it&#x27;s discontinued. Keep selling it</li>

            <li> My mom fell in love with this Maybelline foundation. It gave her a full coverage with a nice glow and for a reasonable price! When she found out they discontinued her color(cocoa) she was seriously heartbroken. We search every where but came up with nothing. I want to thank you sooooo much for having this makeup and especially in her color! Shipping was fast and I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again soon for her. Thanks Again! ;)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation like forever. i use to buy it in stores but it got expensive so i buy it on Amazon now.  Perfect for super oily skin.</li>
            <li> Foundation is amazing , it blends well with my skin and this is my first time using foundation and I love it</li>
            <li> Meh, I&#x27;l keep looking...might be good for someone else, though.</li>
            <li> Gives great coverage!  Hope you never run out because the color cocoa is not found in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Frist Time Using This and I love the way it goes on. It blends really good and I got the perfect shade. I&#x27;m glad I went with this shade and the price was right</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Brand new. I am happy!!!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Stays on and does not rub off easily.  Love the color. Skin looks smooth and natural. Can adjust the color when mixed with a lighter one.</li>
