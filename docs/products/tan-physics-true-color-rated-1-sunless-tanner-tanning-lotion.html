            <li>You want a self tanner,you can buy the best one at walmart for a heck of allot less money and get the same,if not a little better results.</li>
            <li>Great as expected.</li>
            <li>Will be returning the item for a full refund.</li>
            <li>Quick Tan was all I knew.</li>
            <li>It tanned quick, been then if you didn&#x27;t keep using it wiped off</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain too much because most tanners do that to me because of the medications I have to take.</li>
            <li>They were right...</li>
            <li>Second year I have tried it and love it.  </li>
            <li>Very streaky!</li>
            <li>Looks like a real tan!</li>
            <li>I went for a pedi first</li>
            <li>Really like this self-tanner.  </li>
            <li>Does not streak.&lt;br /&gt;Dries fast.</li>
            <li>The Tan Physics is good for my upper body but down on my legs</li>
            <li>I receive compliments asking if that is my natural color as it looks very real.</li>
            <li>a little orange after a few applications but smells good and soaks right in.</li>
            <li>This was ok but not really better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>The  Color is pretty,  it last&#x27;s for a week.  </li>
            <li>Nothing new as far as tanning products go.</li>
            <li>For the same old self tanner.</li>
            <li>Sorry to report that this product did not live up to its claim to give you a most natural color.</li>

            <li> I would not recommend this product and the price is much too expensive and no results to justify the high price!</li>
            <li> good base coat</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I agree with M Homer,Used self tanners before in the past, this product is no different,turns you orange even after multiple applications,I would NOT recommend this to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> I have some moles and brown spots and then turn to a dark orange/brown.</li>
            <li> Really not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER use any other self-tanner!  </li>
            <li> I havent tried self tanners since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> Orange,streaky, comes off in a few days.  </li>
            <li> Sorry this is far from #1.</li>
            <li> This showed 0 results and in the process dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is VERY moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t smell bad after a few hours!</li>
            <li> Thought this one might be different, but alas (sigh)!</li>
            <li> I am very pale and it&#x27;s hard to find a self tanner that doesn&#x27;t turn me orange</li>
            <li> Wasted $35.00!!!</li>
            <li> The price is outrageous.</li>
            <li> Terrible stuff.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible!</li>
            <li> The lotion had a terrible odor.</li>

            <li> I am loving this  self tanner.  I am very pale and it&#x27;s hard to find a self tanner that doesn&#x27;t turn me orange but this is the perfect color for my pale skin. It lasts about 4 days.  Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in years.</li>

            <li> For me, Tan Physics applies with beautiful results.  One has to be caring as how it is applied.  You&#x27;re not just puttin on stuff.  I will order more for the summer.  This product gets 4 stars because the tube sure could hold a lot more.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER use any other self-tanner!  This product is VERY moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t smell bad after a few hours!</li>

            <li> The Tan Physics is good for my upper body but down on my legs it is splotchy, why is it different on my legs?</li>

            <li> The  Color is pretty,  it last&#x27;s for a week.  Does not streak.&lt;br /&gt;Dries fast.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I purchased worked great, my new one does not tan my skin at all.  Will be returning the item for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Not only did it make me itch, it turned me orange. I can&#x27;t really complain too much because most tanners do that to me because of the medications I have to take. Thought this one might be different, but alas (sigh)!</li>
            <li> love this stuff best sunless tanner ever very natural looking</li>
            <li> I agree with M Homer,Used self tanners before in the past, this product is no different,turns you orange even after multiple applications,I would NOT recommend this to anyone I know.However they did refund my money as they said they would.You want a self tanner,you can buy the best one at walmart for a heck of allot less money and get the same,if not a little better results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything on my skin !!! I have bought tanning lotions at the store that work better than this, for the price I thought it would be good.... Golden Goddess is better !</li>
            <li> Sorry to report that this product did not live up to its claim to give you a most natural color. I used it for about 2 weeks and I did not see one bit of difference in the skin color. I would not recommend this product and the price is much too expensive and no results to justify the high price!</li>
            <li> Love it closest look to a real tan !!</li>
            <li> its a cream and it DOESNT WORK</li>
            <li> As a very fair blonde this product still made my legs orange.  I went for a pedi first and it still did not work.  Maybe product does not work as well as for olive skinned coloring.</li>
            <li> By far the BEST Sunless Tanner I have ever found or used. Nominated by the Mayo Clinic and also by ME, a faithful user. I receive compliments asking if that is my natural color as it looks very real.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great color! Citrus smell! Will def buy again and again!</li>
            <li> The lotion had a terrible odor. It lottery stunk.</li>
            <li> Sorry this is far from #1. Estee Lauder sunless tan, or Clarians is superior to this. They may cost a &amp;#34;little more&amp;#34;, but they deliver. This showed 0 results and in the process dried out my skin.</li>
