            <li>I was expecting a luxurious, creamy amazing smelling body butter considering the price for this product.</li>
            <li>Would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li>The body butter has a light orange scent to it, very nice.</li>
            <li>Most is goopy, oily and leaves a sheen over whatever you touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I will buy this again as it does a better job than my Shea butter lotion.</li>
            <li>This is now her favorite skin cream.  </li>
            <li>so I was pleased with that as well.</li>
            <li>I do not like most of the body butter</li>
            <li>Love love love.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel and aroma of this product.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely citrus smell which is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, soothing, stays on the skin, I love all their products.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes your skin smooth and silky and even better it has a beautiful scent of orange ...</li>
            <li>It also easily absorbs into the skin, leaving a silky feeling on the hands.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and does nor overwhelm which is also a plus for me.</li>
            <li>Fabulous......just fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product work, and smells great.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion/body butter I have ever been able to say that about.  </li>
            <li>Seen a difference right away!</li>
            <li>I first tried this cream at a health spa in Tucson, and loved it so much that when I finished the first jar I scoured the internet looking for another.  </li>
            <li>Nice natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t absorb too quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy white, moisturizing without being greasy, and has a lovely light citrus scent.</li>
            <li>Three weeks ago, I had carpal tunnel surgery on my right hand.</li>
            <li>The delivery was right on schedule</li>
            <li>It smells good and rich but too thick to apply on your body.</li>
            <li>I used my first container of it in a week</li>
            <li>Received my first jar as a gift.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty largecontainer.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and is gentle enough for sensitive skin- even for children&#x27;s sensitive</li>
            <li>It is fabulous and I love the slight orange scent!  </li>
            <li>the bazillions of lotions &amp; potions I&#x27;ve bought over the years for my dry skin, this is in the top 3.</li>
            <li>I have used them for years and love every single one I have tried.</li>
            <li>Pre De Provence Argan Body Butter, 6.76 Fluid Ounce is accurate in its Amazon description, while the product arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft and silky with no hint of greasiness at all and is easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The smell is citrusy fresh, and your skin is soft for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>This product is very moisterizing and lasts from morning to evening.  </li>
            <li>Adds a touch of elegance to routine skin care at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>very creamy..</li>
            <li>So if you want a quick shower and apply the body cream quickly I have to use other lotion to get the job done.</li>
            <li>but I loved that it wasn&#x27;t thick!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and all the products of this company.  </li>
            <li>Within a week, most of the dead skin is off the incision.</li>
            <li>Rich, thick lotion is indulgent and absorbs fairly quickly-</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Natural and NOT tested on animals</li>
            <li>It keeps my hands and feet moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- its good.</li>
            <li>very creamy not really a fragrance to this,</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle smell and luxurious feel of this lotion!  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized without the greasiness that most other lotions/body butters leave behind.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and if I put this on my skin it lasts all day long.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve compared other Argan Body Butters and this one</li>

            <li> Its definitely a quality product, but I&#x27;m not too crazy about the orangey scent.</li>
            <li> Try it you will not be sorry.</li>

            <li> I do not use- bought for my wife-- but my wife says it is the best lotion cream she has ever used!</li>
            <li> Excellent for skin care.</li>
            <li> Three weeks ago, I had carpal tunnel surgery on my right hand. As part of the recuperation/rehab process, I was instructed to massage the incision area with lotion. This both prevents scarring and lessens a \\&quot;button\\&quot; of scar tissue beneath the incision which feels like your hand is resting on a foreign object.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easier said than done. I&#x27;m not a big fan of hand lotion for a lot of reasons. Most is goopy, oily and leaves a sheen over whatever you touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, I need a lotion that was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Emollient to moisturize the dry skin around the incision&lt;br /&gt;2. Didn&#x27;t absorb too quickly so I could massage my incision&lt;br /&gt;3. Didn&#x27;t smell too flowery and disgusting&lt;br /&gt;4. Didn&#x27;t leave a nasty sheen on things&lt;br /&gt;5. Lasted on the dry skin so I didn&#x27;t have to constantly reapply&lt;br /&gt;6. Natural and NOT tested on animals (I realize I listed this last but it is critical to me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Argan oil does all of this and more. Within a week, most of the dead skin is off the incision. I have good mobility and it doesn&#x27;t appear I will even have a scar on my palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus--oooh la la--I have changed my mind about lotions. This has a pleasant smell, doesn&#x27;t linger all sticky and nasty, and really does moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebecca Kyle, July 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I should find the facial moisturizer equivalent?</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the Pre De Provence Argan Body Butter.  It smells incredible without being over powering.  It makes your skin feel so soft and silky with no hint of greasiness at all and is easily absorbed.  I used my first container of it in a week and I usually hate to put things on my skin.  I actually looked forward to using this every day and sometimes twice a day.  I highly recommend this and all the products of this company.  I have used them for years and love every single one I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a luxurious, creamy amazing smelling body butter considering the price for this product. Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- its good. Nothing out of this world and I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, but I must say, it does get the job done. It leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized without the greasiness that most other lotions/body butters leave behind. Its definitely a quality product, but I&#x27;m not too crazy about the orangey scent. I should have read the reviews...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the feel of my skin after using this.  The smell is citrusy fresh, and your skin is soft for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect moisturizer for dry skin. A little goes a long way and lasts throughout the day. I will buy this again as it does a better job than my Shea butter lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. It&#x27;s dense but lightweight on. I use it as a night hand and body cream. Great for legs daytime.</li>
            <li> Made me a hero with my wife.  This is now her favorite skin cream.  I will keep buying this for her.</li>
            <li> Rich, thick lotion is indulgent and absorbs fairly quickly- this lotion penetrates &amp; moisturizes your skin. Smells great and is gentle enough for sensitive skin- even for children&#x27;s sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the bazillions of lotions &amp; potions I&#x27;ve bought over the years for my dry skin, this is in the top 3.</li>
            <li> This argan lotion leaves my skin looking healthy! Your skin will drink it up! You have to give this a try!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Received my first jar as a gift.  What a delightful surprise it was!  Will continue buying this body butter for myself and as gifts for others.</li>
            <li> This product is very moisterizing and lasts from morning to evening.  It is neither greasy nor drying.  The aroma is pleasant.  Pre De Provence Argan Body Butter, 6.76 Fluid Ounce is accurate in its Amazon description, while the product arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared other Argan Body Butters and this one has the highest level of Argan Oil and the kowest price.  It has a heavenly consistency and leaves my skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I live in a dry climate and if I put this on my skin it lasts all day long. Nothing I have found has ever worked this well. The smell is light and does nor overwhelm which is also a plus for me. The delivery was right on schedule so I was pleased with that as well.</li>
            <li> Fabulous......just fabulous.  Try it you will not be sorry. It&#x27;s rich, soothing, stays on the skin, I love all their products.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter! very creamy not really a fragrance to this, but I loved that it wasn&#x27;t thick! Seen a difference right away! would re order this!</li>
            <li> Paired with a pair of cotton gloves over night, you will have the softest hands. Bought it for all my friends.</li>
            <li> I first tried this cream at a health spa in Tucson, and loved it so much that when I finished the first jar I scoured the internet looking for another.  It hydrates and doesn&#x27;t make you feel all slimy and sweaty.  It smells fabulous and feels incredible.  I find lotions too watery, and some other creams too thick.  This cream is perfect!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cream/butter without mineral oil for dry feet, hands and cuticles. Pre De Provance product with Shea Butter and Argan Oil is perfect. It&#x27;s creamy white, moisturizing without being greasy, and has a lovely light citrus scent. Adds a touch of elegance to routine skin care at a reasonable price. Would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> Nice natural fragrance. It goes on my skin wonderfully. I do not like most of the body butter and I was not sure of it, but I would like to order this again.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my skin is not beginning to flake off.  This is the first lotion/body butter I have ever been able to say that about.  It is fabulous and I love the slight orange scent!  I just ordered the body oil to try as well!</li>
            <li> I love the subtle smell and luxurious feel of this lotion!  It was gift from my husband, and I am now passing it along to friends.  It&#x27;s a great gift at a great price!</li>
            <li> Wow!  Love love love.  Used it for the 1st time today, and lasted all day.  This is a pretty largecontainer.  This will last me a while.</li>
            <li> I love the feel and aroma of this product. I will continue to order this, it also has helped my husbands rough elbows.</li>
            <li> Best stuff in the world wish I would have ordered sooner! Definitely makes your skin smooth and silky and even better it has a beautiful scent of orange ...as always my products were sent to me sooner than expected</li>
            <li> It smells good and rich but too thick to apply on your body. So if you want a quick shower and apply the body cream quickly I have to use other lotion to get the job done. Also I have very dry skin during cold climate and felt bit dry after few hours applying it so had to reapply in the afternoon then evening again.</li>
            <li> I received this body butter as a gift and love it! It goes on smooth and is not greasy at all. It keeps my hands and feet moisturized and soft. It has a lovely citrus smell which is not overpowering. I Highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine shared hers with me when my hands were cracked and split. Within just a couple of days my hands were healed! Not only does this product work, and smells great.</li>
