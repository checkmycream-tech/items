            <li>is a good lotion and would recommend.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t FEEL good on.</li>
            <li>based on the reviews, esp the comments about how good it smells, I tried this.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good and mosturizes your skin.</li>
            <li>It is a good lotion</li>
            <li>It smells really good.</li>
            <li>Sells good.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>Its moisturizing qualities are just as dazzling for me -- it truly lasts and it is now my favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>it is a gift.&lt;br /&gt;Suave has put together a great scented and lovely product her</li>
            <li>Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion keeps my skin in good shape for up to 5 hours, which is amazing by my standards.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the scent of this!  </li>
            <li>Feels even better in your skin!</li>
            <li>This would be great for people who do not like strong scents from their lotions.</li>
            <li>This is just amazing</li>
            <li>but the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing .</li>
            <li>this lotion smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This also has a great light, Moroccan scent to it.</li>
            <li>and it softens my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and smells great!</li>
            <li>I globbed a bit on my hands, and liked how they felt when the lotion soaked</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy when I use it there, while using a much stronger lotion on my hands.</li>
            <li>To be honest I don&#x27;t try a lot of lotions</li>
            <li>At first I loved this lotion and thought it smelled and felt great.</li>
            <li>I love the great light scent that lingers after application too.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>, the smell is light and pleasant</li>
            <li>Instead there is a very strong, perfume-like, &amp;#34;Moroccan spice&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>this is probably my most favorite lotion I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I have to be honest and say that I didn&#x27;t love this lotion.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best one!!  </li>
            <li>This really makes you skin feel good and smells good too.  </li>
            <li>I have another bottle of lotion on my desk and it still works just as great as it did when i first got it.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Nice texture, strong smell.</li>
            <li>Smells good but evaporates too quickly</li>
            <li>It does smell wonderful and feels good going on, but it leaves an odd, almost sticky residue on my hands that I just can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li>I love this line of Suave Pro products.</li>
            <li>Love the product and the scent</li>
            <li>I bought a Suave lotion for my family and they asked more because they like it.</li>
            <li>I love this scent although it&#x27;s not for everyone.  </li>
            <li>I thought this lotion was just okay.  </li>
            <li>and I thought the scent was just okay -</li>
            <li>I love using it in my hair</li>
            <li>The scent is more of a tropical scent rather than a floral scent.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this creme for several months with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>I think this would be better suited for the Spring/Summer months.</li>
            <li>My hands love this stuff.</li>
            <li>After about 10 days of use, I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>a better scent</li>
            <li>I have tried soooo many lotions even prescribed.</li>
            <li>Scent is light, however, a bit oily!</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>This lotion is just okay.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I know some people love it.</li>
            <li>I am already a fan of Suave lotions or was more of a fan before they changed my Cocoa Butter lotion, it doesn&#x27;t smell like chocolate anymore, so I won&#x27;t be buying that scent anymore.</li>
            <li>love using this on my hands and my feet after my bath</li>
            <li>but I really liked this one it made my hands fill silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I love that it is non greasy.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this Suave Body</li>
            <li>I love Suave</li>
            <li>Like many others I do not like the scent.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something with a similar scent as the Moroccanoil line, which smells awesome, but at a more affordable price.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, so was very excited to receive Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion Body</li>
            <li>and I like how well they perform and the fragrance which is kind of unique.</li>
            <li>Now if you&#x27;re into great smelling lotions, this particular Suave isn&#x27;t recommended.</li>
            <li>and well I was not newly shaved it was this wonderful lotion.</li>
            <li>I purchased this based off reviews, I&#x27;m sure it does a fantastic job at moisturizing the skin</li>
            <li>It goes on oily but turns into smooth real quick.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly the scent is kind of light compared to the hair products and I use it frequently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I&#x27;m on the computer a lot,the fact that it absorbs so fast is a really good thing for me.</li>
            <li>As a man whose skin dries extremely fast, finding a good lotion to sustain the moisture on my hands has always been a chore.</li>
            <li>Strong smell.</li>
            <li>Usually I&#x27;m willing to pay more for a more indulgent experience.  </li>
            <li>It goes on light and blends in easily.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion and It has a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>the scent is pleasant but too masculine for me.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I purchased this product purely for the scent.  </li>
            <li>hope they will securely lock the container before they ship because the 2 container I bought it spilled.</li>
            <li>Skin stays smooth all day.  </li>
            <li>I like the light scent of this product as well as the way it goes</li>
            <li>It is a light weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li>For me this doesn&#x27;t fit the description of &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I tried this lotion and it goes on smoothly without feeling greasy but as one who does not use perfumes, I didn&#x27;t care for its scent.</li>
            <li>I like the texture of the lotion, it is smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Also, this lotion is light - not greasy at all, but still moisturizes.</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I have ever got my hands on very moisturising leaves my skin looking softer smoother and younger ...</li>
            <li>Although the scent is not that strong and it&#x27;s not a bad scent either</li>
            <li>my new favorite moisturizer, love this stuff</li>
            <li>It comes in a easy dispense bottle and glides right on with ease and leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great price and helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li>body lotion is a medium weight lotion &amp; suitable for hands &amp; body - very similar to most brand name body lotions on the market.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Huge bottle at an economical price</li>
            <li>I decided to use the Suave Professionals Body Lotion on my legs, so I&#x27;d get the benefit of the lovely scent on a part of me that doesn&#x27;t get so much</li>
            <li>There is a lot in there and the bottle was completely full.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand overpowering sweet smells</li>
            <li>Works better than Aveeno and Eurcerin, in my opinion, and much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a bargain hunter using a lot of lotion, this is not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad body lotion.</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful, but not very long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Purchased it locally, but found the large size bottles here on Amazon at a great price.  </li>
            <li>This lotion dries fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Suave Vitamin E lotion for a while, and it absorbs fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>absorbs in quick and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The super large pump bottle comes in handy and we keep this out all winter to keep our hands smooth, soft and well hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It smells so clean and absorbs right in leaving a glowing look on the skin.  </li>
            <li>First, let me freely admit that I have no idea</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the Moroccan series and the lotion works great especially problem areas such as elbows and knees</li>
            <li>I was kind of hesitant at first about using this lotion because I have the Shampoo and Conditioner of this same brand and scent, so I automatically figured that the scent would be too strong to walk around with on my body (skin).</li>
            <li>I can live with that, don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling great, and gives it a light sheen without being greasy or slick.</li>
            <li>I need a moisturizer that works very well, and doesn&#x27;t come off easily.</li>
            <li>Whatever it is, it smells delicious and this light, smooth lotion is altogether yummy and less cheap-smelling than other Suave products.  </li>
            <li>What I can say with certainty is that this is a *really* nice lotion, especially for its bargain</li>
            <li>The price is nice, too, especially since you don&#x27;t need gobs and gobs for it to do the job.</li>
            <li>The lotion dries pretty quickly on your body</li>
            <li>I think due to its lightness, it&#x27;ll be good for summer, too.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, two days.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a plus right?</li>
            <li>The price is right, too.</li>
            <li>The lotion absorbed nicely and left my skin feeling soft and lightly scented.</li>
            <li>would certainly suggest this to a friend to enjoy, especially the lovely and plesantly haunting smell.</li>
            <li>, I realized it had that newly shaved silky smooth feeling</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prior to this, I used Aveeno&#x27;s basic, unscented daily moisturizer, which worked great unless I skipped a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own because makes my skin smooth and silky even in the harsh winter.</li>
            <li>it has a faint scent of the Moroccan oil, whichis delightful, but it has a strong smell of old lady expired lotion.  </li>
            <li>I am already a big fan of Sauve for most of their personal care products so I was pretty sure I would like this lotion even before I used it.</li>
            <li>exactly what argan oil is, or why Moroccan lotion might be desirable; presumably Google has those answers.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Argan Oil is a HOT product these days.</li>
            <li>It is greasier than my current lotion, but thats ok in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I use this daily and love it.</li>
            <li>This lotion is a bit greasy when first applied, but it fades after a while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s more preservative (methylparaben) than actual argan oil in this</li>
            <li>This lotion is more suitable to use in the summer because it is pretty runny and not as thick as I like my body lotions to be.  </li>
            <li>This product is heavily fragranced and has a nice sweet smell.</li>
            <li>While it felt good to smooth on, it actually dried out my skin and made my eczema break out further.</li>
            <li>Pretty much on par for a bargain brand of lotion.  </li>
            <li>I don’t like most lotions because they leave my hands greasy long after application.  </li>
            <li>benefitsWinter in the Northeast lives my skin dry as a bone.&lt;br /&gt;Having a top notch product dedicated to softening and moisturizing</li>
            <li>Suave lotion is rich and creamy, sinks in easily and leaves my skin very soft for two days.</li>
            <li>I am mostly happy with the lotions I use but who wouldn&#x27;t like a little extra once in a while?&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>Skin is very  softer after  using  this  product.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t cheat you on product by leaving a quarter of the top empty, etc.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell, and they all work very well.</li>
            <li>but it moisturizers and absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li>The scent I had to get used to, not so much as the smell itself</li>
            <li>Very mositurizing lotion, yet lightweight.</li>
            <li>Whole family can use it as well.</li>
            <li>Not really one of Suave&#x27;s better products.</li>
            <li>fragrance is absolutely divine!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the extras that you get are a rich lotion that soaks in fast and leaves behind a kind of glow-</li>
            <li>The pump is very easy to use and allows you to use just a little at a time as opposed to a tube, which often squirts out too much at once.</li>
            <li>It is strong and lasts a long time, I just don&#x27;t wear perfume when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I was excited to learn that there was a lotion that had this same luxurious scent at a price I can afford.  </li>
            <li>It seems to hydrate well, it lasts about as long as other high-quality (and much higher priced) lotions, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel particularly moisturized</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>When this lotion arrived, I was thrilled - it has a luscious scent, the same as all the other Suave Moroccan Infusion products.</li>
            <li>I prefer a stronger aroma, like coconut or something that gave the skin a little more of a scent.</li>
            <li>First time I used, was pleasantly surprised how soft it my skin</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this and loved the scent, but was not sure if it would work for entire body because it was a sample sized.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s strong enough where I could still smell well after it was absorbed into my skin with the scent lasting for several hours.</li>
            <li>I just use a little on my arms and legs every night and they are really silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does live my skin silky and hydrated, EDven the roughest part of the body (the under feet) stays moistened all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a super dry winter here</li>
            <li>long time to be absorbed by the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Suave product comes in the familiar Moroccan Infusion brand bottle, similar to the shampoo and conditioner in the same line, and smells exactly the same as those hair products.  </li>
            <li>This, on the other hand, is more like vegetable oil - it doesn&#x27;t absorb at all, and I have to use a paper towel to get enough of it off that I can wash the rest off with soap &amp; water.</li>
            <li>This particular one absorbs fairly quickly, leaving behind soft, smooth, moisturized skin with no residue.</li>
            <li>but I think more or less my allergies and how they were getting along with the outside world that day.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Steer clear of this product + do yourself a favor.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>So if you are sensitive you may want to try another lotion.</li>
            <li>As with the shampoo &amp; conditioner, the body lotion scent is not a heavy scent (like the Bath &amp; Body lotions).  </li>
            <li>A couple days ago my husband mentioned how soft my skin felt</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my skin has been this soft since I was a kid.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, it smells old.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Product was given to my 20 year old son and his review is as follows:  </li>
            <li>and I hardly notice it, although other people smell it and think it smells good</li>
            <li>The side I used the Moroccan Infusion on stayed hydrated the whole day, the other side seemed to get &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; which is unusual.</li>
            <li>When I use it alone on my dry skin, I use more applications than I would typically use.</li>
            <li>Love the subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the same as a self tanning lotion but the oil seems to make your skin refract light so that it appears healthier and slightly sun kissed.</li>
            <li>Suave products have a reputation for being very effective and a lot less expensive than the high priced brands.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my new go-to brand when I need dependable, affordable body products for the entire family.</li>
            <li>This has a very soothing texture and helped with my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I had read some of the other reviews of this product and was a little concerned the scent would be overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin and have tried many many different lotions, including very expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Large bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It is just like a high end lotion that one would find in a much more expensive formula.</li>
            <li>While I don’t like lotion in general, this product gets the job done when you need it.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t wear it long enough to really figure that out.  </li>
            <li>Anyway I decided to give it a go and no regrets.</li>
            <li>If your skin dries frequently, this is definitely the product for you.</li>
            <li>Normally when I do put on lotion it never really feels like I put anything on, it goes right back to being rough.</li>
            <li>Suave is very affordable, and has really stepped up their image and quality in the past several years, so</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t necessarily want the same scent for the hand lotion, but considering it is highly moisturizing with virtually no greasy film left on your hands whatsoever, I will rate this four solid stars.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s super tacky, heavily perfumed, and never seemed to dry for me.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a ton of dimethicone + petrolatum in this product, so that&#x27;s why it just sits on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife raves about the argan oil shampoo and condition that she uses, and I decided to try out this lotion from Suave to see if it would put a dent in my dry hands that I have complements of Old Man Winter.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance seems a bit strong to me, a little heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I try not to use too much of it at bed time though because the smell can be a little overpowering when you are enveloped in blankets.</li>

            <li> It moisturizes well and gives good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is a good lotion and would recommend.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t FEEL good on.</li>
            <li> based on the reviews, esp the comments about how good it smells, I tried this.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good and mosturizes your skin.</li>
            <li> It is a good lotion</li>
            <li> It smells really good.</li>
            <li> Sells good.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> Its moisturizing qualities are just as dazzling for me -- it truly lasts and it is now my favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> it is a gift.&lt;br /&gt;Suave has put together a great scented and lovely product her</li>
            <li> Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion keeps my skin in good shape for up to 5 hours, which is amazing by my standards.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this!  </li>
            <li> Feels even better in your skin!</li>
            <li> This would be great for people who do not like strong scents from their lotions.</li>
            <li> This is just amazing</li>
            <li> but the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li> it is amazing.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing .</li>
            <li> this lotion smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This also has a great light, Moroccan scent to it.</li>
            <li> and it softens my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and smells great!</li>
            <li> I globbed a bit on my hands, and liked how they felt when the lotion soaked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy when I use it there, while using a much stronger lotion on my hands.</li>
            <li> To be honest I don&#x27;t try a lot of lotions</li>
            <li> At first I loved this lotion and thought it smelled and felt great.</li>
            <li> I love the great light scent that lingers after application too.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> , the smell is light and pleasant</li>
            <li> Instead there is a very strong, perfume-like, &amp;#34;Moroccan spice&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> this is probably my most favorite lotion I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I have to be honest and say that I didn&#x27;t love this lotion.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best one!!  </li>
            <li> This really makes you skin feel good and smells good too.  </li>
            <li> I have another bottle of lotion on my desk and it still works just as great as it did when i first got it.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, strong smell.</li>
            <li> Smells good but evaporates too quickly</li>
            <li> It does smell wonderful and feels good going on, but it leaves an odd, almost sticky residue on my hands that I just can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> I love this line of Suave Pro products.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the scent</li>
            <li> I bought a Suave lotion for my family and they asked more because they like it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent although it&#x27;s not for everyone.  </li>
            <li> I thought this lotion was just okay.  </li>
            <li> and I thought the scent was just okay -</li>
            <li> I love using it in my hair</li>
            <li> The scent is more of a tropical scent rather than a floral scent.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this creme for several months with excellent results.  </li>
            <li> I think this would be better suited for the Spring/Summer months.</li>
            <li> My hands love this stuff.</li>
            <li> After about 10 days of use, I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> a better scent</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many lotions even prescribed.</li>
            <li> Scent is light, however, a bit oily!</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just okay.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I know some people love it.</li>
            <li> I am already a fan of Suave lotions or was more of a fan before they changed my Cocoa Butter lotion, it doesn&#x27;t smell like chocolate anymore, so I won&#x27;t be buying that scent anymore.</li>
            <li> love using this on my hands and my feet after my bath</li>
            <li> but I really liked this one it made my hands fill silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I love that it is non greasy.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this Suave Body</li>
            <li> I love Suave</li>
            <li> Like many others I do not like the scent.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with a similar scent as the Moroccanoil line, which smells awesome, but at a more affordable price.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, so was very excited to receive Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion Body</li>
            <li> and I like how well they perform and the fragrance which is kind of unique.</li>
            <li> Now if you&#x27;re into great smelling lotions, this particular Suave isn&#x27;t recommended.</li>
            <li> and well I was not newly shaved it was this wonderful lotion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based off reviews, I&#x27;m sure it does a fantastic job at moisturizing the skin</li>
            <li> It goes on oily but turns into smooth real quick.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly the scent is kind of light compared to the hair products and I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I&#x27;m on the computer a lot,the fact that it absorbs so fast is a really good thing for me.</li>
            <li> As a man whose skin dries extremely fast, finding a good lotion to sustain the moisture on my hands has always been a chore.</li>
            <li> Strong smell.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m willing to pay more for a more indulgent experience.  </li>
            <li> It goes on light and blends in easily.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion and It has a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> the scent is pleasant but too masculine for me.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I purchased this product purely for the scent.  </li>
            <li> hope they will securely lock the container before they ship because the 2 container I bought it spilled.</li>
            <li> Skin stays smooth all day.  </li>
            <li> I like the light scent of this product as well as the way it goes</li>
            <li> It is a light weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For me this doesn&#x27;t fit the description of &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I tried this lotion and it goes on smoothly without feeling greasy but as one who does not use perfumes, I didn&#x27;t care for its scent.</li>
            <li> I like the texture of the lotion, it is smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Also, this lotion is light - not greasy at all, but still moisturizes.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever got my hands on very moisturising leaves my skin looking softer smoother and younger ...</li>
            <li> Although the scent is not that strong and it&#x27;s not a bad scent either</li>
            <li> my new favorite moisturizer, love this stuff</li>
            <li> It comes in a easy dispense bottle and glides right on with ease and leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great price and helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> body lotion is a medium weight lotion &amp; suitable for hands &amp; body - very similar to most brand name body lotions on the market.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Huge bottle at an economical price</li>
            <li> I decided to use the Suave Professionals Body Lotion on my legs, so I&#x27;d get the benefit of the lovely scent on a part of me that doesn&#x27;t get so much</li>
            <li> There is a lot in there and the bottle was completely full.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand overpowering sweet smells</li>
            <li> Works better than Aveeno and Eurcerin, in my opinion, and much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a bargain hunter using a lot of lotion, this is not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad body lotion.</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful, but not very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Purchased it locally, but found the large size bottles here on Amazon at a great price.  </li>
            <li> This lotion dries fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Suave Vitamin E lotion for a while, and it absorbs fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> absorbs in quick and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The super large pump bottle comes in handy and we keep this out all winter to keep our hands smooth, soft and well hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It smells so clean and absorbs right in leaving a glowing look on the skin.  </li>
            <li> First, let me freely admit that I have no idea</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Moroccan series and the lotion works great especially problem areas such as elbows and knees</li>
            <li> I was kind of hesitant at first about using this lotion because I have the Shampoo and Conditioner of this same brand and scent, so I automatically figured that the scent would be too strong to walk around with on my body (skin).</li>
            <li> I can live with that, don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling great, and gives it a light sheen without being greasy or slick.</li>
            <li> I need a moisturizer that works very well, and doesn&#x27;t come off easily.</li>
            <li> Whatever it is, it smells delicious and this light, smooth lotion is altogether yummy and less cheap-smelling than other Suave products.  </li>
            <li> What I can say with certainty is that this is a *really* nice lotion, especially for its bargain</li>
            <li> The price is nice, too, especially since you don&#x27;t need gobs and gobs for it to do the job.</li>
            <li> The lotion dries pretty quickly on your body</li>
            <li> I think due to its lightness, it&#x27;ll be good for summer, too.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, two days.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a plus right?</li>
            <li> The price is right, too.</li>
            <li> The lotion absorbed nicely and left my skin feeling soft and lightly scented.</li>
            <li> would certainly suggest this to a friend to enjoy, especially the lovely and plesantly haunting smell.</li>
            <li> , I realized it had that newly shaved silky smooth feeling</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to this, I used Aveeno&#x27;s basic, unscented daily moisturizer, which worked great unless I skipped a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own because makes my skin smooth and silky even in the harsh winter.</li>
            <li> it has a faint scent of the Moroccan oil, whichis delightful, but it has a strong smell of old lady expired lotion.  </li>
            <li> I am already a big fan of Sauve for most of their personal care products so I was pretty sure I would like this lotion even before I used it.</li>
            <li> exactly what argan oil is, or why Moroccan lotion might be desirable; presumably Google has those answers.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Argan Oil is a HOT product these days.</li>
            <li> It is greasier than my current lotion, but thats ok in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I use this daily and love it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a bit greasy when first applied, but it fades after a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s more preservative (methylparaben) than actual argan oil in this</li>
            <li> This lotion is more suitable to use in the summer because it is pretty runny and not as thick as I like my body lotions to be.  </li>
            <li> This product is heavily fragranced and has a nice sweet smell.</li>
            <li> While it felt good to smooth on, it actually dried out my skin and made my eczema break out further.</li>
            <li> Pretty much on par for a bargain brand of lotion.  </li>
            <li> I don’t like most lotions because they leave my hands greasy long after application.  </li>
            <li> benefitsWinter in the Northeast lives my skin dry as a bone.&lt;br /&gt;Having a top notch product dedicated to softening and moisturizing</li>
            <li> Suave lotion is rich and creamy, sinks in easily and leaves my skin very soft for two days.</li>
            <li> I am mostly happy with the lotions I use but who wouldn&#x27;t like a little extra once in a while?&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> Skin is very  softer after  using  this  product.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cheat you on product by leaving a quarter of the top empty, etc.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, and they all work very well.</li>
            <li> but it moisturizers and absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li> The scent I had to get used to, not so much as the smell itself</li>
            <li> Very mositurizing lotion, yet lightweight.</li>
            <li> Whole family can use it as well.</li>
            <li> Not really one of Suave&#x27;s better products.</li>
            <li> fragrance is absolutely divine!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the extras that you get are a rich lotion that soaks in fast and leaves behind a kind of glow-</li>
            <li> The pump is very easy to use and allows you to use just a little at a time as opposed to a tube, which often squirts out too much at once.</li>
            <li> It is strong and lasts a long time, I just don&#x27;t wear perfume when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I was excited to learn that there was a lotion that had this same luxurious scent at a price I can afford.  </li>
            <li> It seems to hydrate well, it lasts about as long as other high-quality (and much higher priced) lotions, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel particularly moisturized</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When this lotion arrived, I was thrilled - it has a luscious scent, the same as all the other Suave Moroccan Infusion products.</li>
            <li> I prefer a stronger aroma, like coconut or something that gave the skin a little more of a scent.</li>
            <li> First time I used, was pleasantly surprised how soft it my skin</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and loved the scent, but was not sure if it would work for entire body because it was a sample sized.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s strong enough where I could still smell well after it was absorbed into my skin with the scent lasting for several hours.</li>
            <li> I just use a little on my arms and legs every night and they are really silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> It does live my skin silky and hydrated, EDven the roughest part of the body (the under feet) stays moistened all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a super dry winter here</li>
            <li> long time to be absorbed by the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Suave product comes in the familiar Moroccan Infusion brand bottle, similar to the shampoo and conditioner in the same line, and smells exactly the same as those hair products.  </li>
            <li> This, on the other hand, is more like vegetable oil - it doesn&#x27;t absorb at all, and I have to use a paper towel to get enough of it off that I can wash the rest off with soap &amp; water.</li>
            <li> This particular one absorbs fairly quickly, leaving behind soft, smooth, moisturized skin with no residue.</li>
            <li> but I think more or less my allergies and how they were getting along with the outside world that day.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Steer clear of this product + do yourself a favor.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> So if you are sensitive you may want to try another lotion.</li>
            <li> As with the shampoo &amp; conditioner, the body lotion scent is not a heavy scent (like the Bath &amp; Body lotions).  </li>
            <li> A couple days ago my husband mentioned how soft my skin felt</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin has been this soft since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, it smells old.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Product was given to my 20 year old son and his review is as follows:  </li>
            <li> and I hardly notice it, although other people smell it and think it smells good</li>
            <li> The side I used the Moroccan Infusion on stayed hydrated the whole day, the other side seemed to get &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; which is unusual.</li>
            <li> When I use it alone on my dry skin, I use more applications than I would typically use.</li>
            <li> Love the subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the same as a self tanning lotion but the oil seems to make your skin refract light so that it appears healthier and slightly sun kissed.</li>
            <li> Suave products have a reputation for being very effective and a lot less expensive than the high priced brands.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my new go-to brand when I need dependable, affordable body products for the entire family.</li>
            <li> This has a very soothing texture and helped with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had read some of the other reviews of this product and was a little concerned the scent would be overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and have tried many many different lotions, including very expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Large bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is just like a high end lotion that one would find in a much more expensive formula.</li>
            <li> While I don’t like lotion in general, this product gets the job done when you need it.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t wear it long enough to really figure that out.  </li>
            <li> Anyway I decided to give it a go and no regrets.</li>
            <li> If your skin dries frequently, this is definitely the product for you.</li>
            <li> Normally when I do put on lotion it never really feels like I put anything on, it goes right back to being rough.</li>
            <li> Suave is very affordable, and has really stepped up their image and quality in the past several years, so</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t necessarily want the same scent for the hand lotion, but considering it is highly moisturizing with virtually no greasy film left on your hands whatsoever, I will rate this four solid stars.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s super tacky, heavily perfumed, and never seemed to dry for me.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a ton of dimethicone + petrolatum in this product, so that&#x27;s why it just sits on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife raves about the argan oil shampoo and condition that she uses, and I decided to try out this lotion from Suave to see if it would put a dent in my dry hands that I have complements of Old Man Winter.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance seems a bit strong to me, a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I try not to use too much of it at bed time though because the smell can be a little overpowering when you are enveloped in blankets.</li>
            <li> The scent does stay with you for a little while, but it is not overwhelming nor strong enough for you to be considered &amp;#34;sharing&amp;#34; it with your fellow</li>
            <li> It has a slightly almond aroma that I can live with.  </li>
            <li> If your all about results and long lasting moisturizing, this is definitely the lotion for you!</li>
            <li> But if you prefer a long lasting scented lotion, then you probably would like this product.</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals Body Lotion, Moroccan Infusion has lots of potential for individuals who have occasionally dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Nice lotion - not too thick, not too thin when applying.  </li>
            <li> just a light few drops and you are set for a day in the cold or a night of peaceful rest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells very similar to (but not exactly the same as) the Moroccanoil products.</li>
            <li> the shea butter version of suave lotion is WAY better than this in terms of moisturizing, even though I don&#x27;t like the artificial shea butter scent of that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> Will continue using as long as my body likes it.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to wait for too long in the humid bathroom.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on and they stay well moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> Layering the lotion with the Suave Moroccan Infusion dry oil, helped make the scent last slightly longer, but I think the line would benefit from a bath gel and a body mist so that the layered scent can really last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Go Suave, Yesssss a product that once applied will keep you moist without any dry spots in sight all day long.</li>
            <li> I can moisturize every other day in the middle of winter, and my skin is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We stay away from the medicated lotions since they can be costly and also sting on really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The dry cracks that would sometimes bleed have shown substantial improvement.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin and eczema,</li>
            <li> I have never tried this lotion before but my hands are always dry though out the winter time</li>
            <li> Makes my hands feel dry.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely not for people with anything less than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin; mine is somewhat dry and is doesn&#x27;t have the staying power that something like Lubriderm or Jergens does</li>
            <li> It is not a very over powering smell but it is different, it dies down though</li>
            <li> Furthermore; I have very dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> live in a cold wintery place and when the heat runs all the time my skin really drys out.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you only need a little bit of to garner the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As soon as I washed my hands, they felt as rough as sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not really what I would prefer, but it works.</li>
            <li> It is not a heavy, thick cream.  </li>
            <li> It does have a nice, underwhelming scent that isn&#x27;t annoying.</li>
            <li> I do not just have your  average \\&quot;dry skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It makes my dry skin less itchy and smooths my skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> about 15 minutes after I applied it, so I&#x27;m going to stick with other brands.  </li>
            <li> As for the smell it doesn&#x27;t smell like the other products of the set (although I wish it did.)  </li>
            <li> anymore lotion on the other side.</li>
            <li> This lotion kept my skin feeling smoother longer than the other lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> The lotion does what you would expect, I wouldn&#x27;t call it anything different than an ordinary lotion.</li>
            <li> the lotion itself is very thin and sticky, and leave a very filmy, dry feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, but still moisturizes my dry winter skin well.</li>
            <li> Like one of the other reviewers, I also found that this smells ok in the container, but takes on a very artificial smell on my skin.</li>
            <li> Its a sizeable bottle and should last you through the winter months when your skin is so dry from the hot house air and frigid outside air.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even worse if you put it on directly after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a typical drugstore lotion, and that&#x27;s probably the reason I don&#x27;t like it at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe even a little bit old-ladyish - like vintage 70&#x27;s Jergens.  </li>
            <li> Besides, a little dab will do anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few weeks and although I do like it, my skin requires something a little heavier for the drying winter months.</li>
            <li> but if you use a heavy application it feels greasy and takes</li>
            <li> Your skin will look radiant after just a few days of use.</li>
            <li> never really needed lotion until I was past 40, but lately it seems my skin can drink up all the lotion I find time to offer it--</li>
            <li> Our entire family suffers from dry skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I quickly went back to my heavy-duty lotion, which is boring and unscented, but keeps my hands baby-soft.</li>
            <li> (Which are not many)</li>
            <li> Its a typical lotion, smooth and silky, but the smell is terrible!  </li>
            <li> Neither greasy nor thick</li>
            <li> Yes, my skin felt moisturized, but the lotion seemed a bit on the thin side</li>
            <li> but the smell is even worse.</li>
            <li> It is very subtle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Suave lotion is now in the trash.</li>
            <li> fragrance that makes it difficult for me to use at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this one is a fail.</li>
            <li> it stinks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed !</li>
            <li> Sorry, Suave!</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t a bad smell, it just isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; smell -1 star.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Skin is very  softer after  using  this  product.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever got my hands on very moisturising leaves my skin looking softer smoother and younger ... This is just amazing I&#x27;m obsessed ! Great job suave</li>
            <li> its a bit greasy so i wouldnt use it on your hands or face. but the smell is amazing.  and it softens my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.  Very moisturizing and smells great!</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product.  Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this line of Suave Pro products. It makes my dry skin less itchy and smooths my skin.</li>
            <li> This works great. It&#x27;s great price and helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This body lotion is wonderful.  Purchased it locally, but found the large size bottles here on Amazon at a great price.  Leaves your skin feeling great, and gives it a light sheen without being greasy or slick.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the scent</li>
            <li> First time I used, was pleasantly surprised how soft it my skin</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband (I use Korres).  This is the only product I&#x27;ve encountered that gives Korres a run for it&#x27;s money.  It&#x27;s affordable, hydrating, and best of all it has the most intoxicating scent.  My husband just loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and It has a mild fragrance. I bought a Suave lotion for my family and they asked more because they like it. I would recommend this product to someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they will securely lock the container before they ship because the 2 container I bought it spilled.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion - not too thick, not too thin when applying.  I love this scent although it&#x27;s not for everyone.  Great price for what it is.</li>
            <li> the scent is pleasant but too masculine for me. the lotion itself is very thin and sticky, and leave a very filmy, dry feeling on the skin. the shea butter version of suave lotion is WAY better than this in terms of moisturizing, even though I don&#x27;t like the artificial shea butter scent of that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this is avon perfume creme with a suave label.</li>
            <li> I am already a big fan of Sauve for most of their personal care products so I was pretty sure I would like this lotion even before I used it. Happy to say it has exceeded even those expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a cold wintery place and when the heat runs all the time my skin really drys out. I am mostly happy with the lotions I use but who wouldn&#x27;t like a little extra once in a while?&lt;br /&gt;With the Sauve Pro Moroccan Infusion the extras that you get are a rich lotion that soaks in fast and leaves behind a kind of glow- it&#x27;s not the same as a self tanning lotion but the oil seems to make your skin refract light so that it appears healthier and slightly sun kissed. I love the great light scent that lingers after application too.&lt;br /&gt;This one&#x27;s a winner for the winter but I plan on using it in the summer too.</li>
            <li> I thought this lotion was just okay.  Pretty much on par for a bargain brand of lotion.  Yes, my skin felt moisturized, but the lotion seemed a bit on the thin side and I thought the scent was just okay - maybe even a little bit old-ladyish - like vintage 70&#x27;s Jergens.  Usually I&#x27;m willing to pay more for a more indulgent experience.  If you&#x27;re a bargain hunter using a lot of lotion, this is not bad.</li>
            <li> In winter, my hands often crack and bleed. I need a moisturizer that works very well, and doesn&#x27;t come off easily. When this lotion arrived, I was thrilled - it has a luscious scent, the same as all the other Suave Moroccan Infusion products. I globbed a bit on my hands, and liked how they felt when the lotion soaked in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t last. As soon as I washed my hands, they felt as rough as sandpaper.  I quickly went back to my heavy-duty lotion, which is boring and unscented, but keeps my hands baby-soft. I decided to use the Suave Professionals Body Lotion on my legs, so I&#x27;d get the benefit of the lovely scent on a part of me that doesn&#x27;t get so much abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion works beautifully on my legs. I&#x27;m very happy when I use it there, while using a much stronger lotion on my hands.</li>
            <li> First, let me freely admit that I have no idea exactly what argan oil is, or why Moroccan lotion might be desirable; presumably Google has those answers. What I can say with certainty is that this is a *really* nice lotion, especially for its bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never really needed lotion until I was past 40, but lately it seems my skin can drink up all the lotion I find time to offer it--so I&#x27;ve now tried rather a lot of them! This particular one absorbs fairly quickly, leaving behind soft, smooth, moisturized skin with no residue. It seems to hydrate well, it lasts about as long as other high-quality (and much higher priced) lotions, and it smells nice. (Don&#x27;t take my word for the scent. Sniff a test bottle in the store--though Amazon&#x27;s price is likely to beat your local market&#x27;s, sending you back here to order.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks like it&#x27;s going to be a regular purchase around here.</li>
            <li> Best smelling lotion available. Does not leave you feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> benefitsWinter in the Northeast lives my skin dry as a bone.&lt;br /&gt;Having a top notch product dedicated to softening and moisturizing it is a gift.&lt;br /&gt;Suave has put together a great scented and lovely product her and it is something&lt;br /&gt;you only need a little bit of to garner the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars but if you use a heavy application it feels greasy and takes&lt;br /&gt;a long time to be absorbed by the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just a light few drops and you are set for a day in the cold or a night of peaceful rest.&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly suggest this to a friend to enjoy, especially the lovely and plesantly haunting smell.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Argan Oil is a HOT product these days. I love using it in my hair so thought I&#x27;d give this lotion a try.  Its a sizeable bottle and should last you through the winter months when your skin is so dry from the hot house air and frigid outside air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened it up and took a whiff. Like one of the other reviewers, I also found that this smells ok in the container, but takes on a very artificial smell on my skin. I can live with that, don&#x27;t love it but I can deal. I applied some before I went to bed.  It is greasier than my current lotion, but thats ok in the winter.  However, about an hour after applying it, I started to break out in a rash and was SOOOO itchy!!!!!!!!!!! I had to get out of bed and take a shower and benadryl it was so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is now using it and not having any problems. So if you are sensitive you may want to try another lotion.</li>
            <li> I was kind of hesitant at first about using this lotion because I have the Shampoo and Conditioner of this same brand and scent, so I automatically figured that the scent would be too strong to walk around with on my body (skin). Surprisingly the scent is kind of light compared to the hair products and I use it frequently. It comes in a easy dispense bottle and glides right on with ease and leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky. I use this daily and love it.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, so was very excited to receive Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion Body Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion did not disappoint &amp; has the same scent as the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  As with the shampoo &amp; conditioner, the body lotion scent is not a heavy scent (like the Bath &amp; Body lotions).  The scent is more of a tropical scent rather than a floral scent.  The scent does stay with you for a little while, but it is not overwhelming nor strong enough for you to be considered &amp;#34;sharing&amp;#34; it with your fellow co-workers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body lotion is a medium weight lotion &amp; suitable for hands &amp; body - very similar to most brand name body lotions on the market.  It is not a heavy, thick cream.  It moisturizes well and gives good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not a floral body lotion fan and like the Moroccan Infusion line, this is a product that you will like a lot.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a bit greasy when first applied, but it fades after a while. I didn&#x27;t feel particularly moisturized about 15 minutes after I applied it, so I&#x27;m going to stick with other brands.  It does have a nice, underwhelming scent that isn&#x27;t annoying.</li>
            <li> Have been using this creme for several months with excellent results.  Love the subtle fragrance.  Have discarded all prescription medications, relieves itchy skin caused by allergies or acidity.  Skin stays smooth all day.  Works well as a facial moisturizer, as well.  Highly recommend this product.  I have a dispenser in every room of my home.</li>
            <li> This has a very soothing texture and helped with my dry skin. I had no irritations or signs of allergic reactions etc. I wasn&#x27;t in agreement with them about the smell. I prefer a stronger aroma, like coconut or something that gave the skin a little more of a scent. This would be great for people who do not like strong scents from their lotions. It is very subtle. The pump is very easy to use and allows you to use just a little at a time as opposed to a tube, which often squirts out too much at once. There is a lot in there and the bottle was completely full. They don&#x27;t cheat you on product by leaving a quarter of the top empty, etc.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a typical drugstore lotion, and that&#x27;s probably the reason I don&#x27;t like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super tacky, heavily perfumed, and never seemed to dry for me.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a ton of dimethicone + petrolatum in this product, so that&#x27;s why it just sits on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s more preservative (methylparaben) than actual argan oil in this product.&lt;br /&gt;Steer clear of this product + do yourself a favor.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Moroccan series and the lotion works great especially problem areas such as elbows and knees</li>
            <li> Our entire family suffers from dry skin in the winter.  We stay away from the medicated lotions since they can be costly and also sting on really dry skin.  This Suave product comes in the familiar Moroccan Infusion brand bottle, similar to the shampoo and conditioner in the same line, and smells exactly the same as those hair products.  I didn&#x27;t necessarily want the same scent for the hand lotion, but considering it is highly moisturizing with virtually no greasy film left on your hands whatsoever, I will rate this four solid stars.  The super large pump bottle comes in handy and we keep this out all winter to keep our hands smooth, soft and well hydrated.  It goes on light and blends in easily.  Suave is very affordable, and has really stepped up their image and quality in the past several years, so it&#x27;s my new go-to brand when I need dependable, affordable body products for the entire family.</li>
            <li> Suave is known for making &#x27;knock-offs&#x27; of more expensive products for a fraction of the price and this item is no exception. I have been using this lotion for a few weeks and although I do like it, my skin requires something a little heavier for the drying winter months. I think this would be better suited for the Spring/Summer months. This lotion does have a fragrance to it, but I did not find it bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good lotion and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based off reviews, I&#x27;m sure it does a fantastic job at moisturizing the skin but I couldn&#x27;t wear it long enough to really figure that out.  Its a typical lotion, smooth and silky, but the smell is terrible!  Definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> My hands love this stuff. It&#x27;s been a super dry winter here so I&#x27;m always reaching for lotion. I like the light scent of this product as well as the way it goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too often lotions are either greasy or tacky after I put them on. This one is neither. It did the trick for me. My hands drank it up! I will be getting another bottle when this one runs out. I don&#x27;t need a ton of it so I expect that it will last me a while. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;m on the computer a lot,the fact that it absorbs so fast is a really good thing for me.</li>
            <li> My wife raves about the argan oil shampoo and condition that she uses, and I decided to try out this lotion from Suave to see if it would put a dent in my dry hands that I have complements of Old Man Winter.  After about 10 days of use, I am pleased with the results.  The dry cracks that would sometimes bleed have shown substantial improvement.  I don’t like most lotions because they leave my hands greasy long after application.  This lotion dries fairly quickly.  I also like that this lotion is not flowery smelling.  It has a slightly almond aroma that I can live with.  While I don’t like lotion in general, this product gets the job done when you need it.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this lotion and thought it smelled and felt great. Then, after having it for a month, it became sticky like glue and I had to throw the bottle away. This doesn&#x27;t make any sense because it was sitting on my desk at work the entire time. I have another bottle of lotion on my desk and it still works just as great as it did when i first got it. Unfortunately, the Suave lotion is now in the trash. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this about 2 weeks it is amazing. A couple days ago my husband mentioned how soft my skin felt, I realized it had that newly shaved silky smooth feeling and well I was not newly shaved it was this wonderful lotion. Furthermore; I have very dry skin in the winter and this was worked miracles for that as well lastly, the smell is light and pleasant I can&#x27;t stand overpowering sweet smells I love this lotion. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and loved the scent, but was not sure if it would work for entire body because it was a sample sized. Anyway I decided to give it a go and no regrets. It does live my skin silky and hydrated, EDven the roughest part of the body (the under feet) stays moistened all day. Will continue using as long as my body likes it.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin and eczema, so all winter I have to be religious about daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this, I used Aveeno&#x27;s basic, unscented daily moisturizer, which worked great unless I skipped a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Suave lotion is rich and creamy, sinks in easily and leaves my skin very soft for two days. That&#x27;s right, two days. I can moisturize every other day in the middle of winter, and my skin is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just which it was either unscented or had a milder scent. Instead there is a very strong, perfume-like, &amp;#34;Moroccan spice&amp;#34; fragrance that makes it difficult for me to use at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a better scent this would be a five star product.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest and say that I didn&#x27;t love this lotion. It does smell wonderful and feels good going on, but it leaves an odd, almost sticky residue on my hands that I just can&#x27;t stand. It&#x27;s even worse if you put it on directly after getting out of the shower. It just doesn&#x27;t FEEL good on. I would choose the Organix Moroccan Argan Oil lotion over this any day of the week. That lotion actually leaves my skin feeling silky! This really doesn&#x27;t. Sorry, Suave!</li>
            <li> great product..great price..great smell..creamy and smooth...not sticky..natural hydration...</li>
            <li> My skin is aweful. I do not just have your  average \\&quot;dry skin\\&quot;. I have tried soooo many lotions even prescribed. This lotion is amazing . Put it on after a shower... It smells so clean and absorbs right in leaving a glowing look on the skin.  I have also found that this lotion works great as a leave in hair product.  I have curly hair and applying a touch in the hair with a scrunch works beautifully.  Removes frizzies and creates nice curls!! I am stocking up on it!</li>
            <li> Scent is light, however, a bit oily!</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals Body Lotion, Moroccan Infusion has lots of potential for individuals who have occasionally dry skin.  I find it a bit too perfumed and have to pair it with another moisturizer to last.  When I use it alone on my dry skin, I use more applications than I would typically use.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells great&lt;br /&gt;- Huge bottle at an economical price&lt;br /&gt;- Neither greasy nor thick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- This is definitely not for people with anything less than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin; mine is somewhat dry and is doesn&#x27;t have the staying power that something like Lubriderm or Jergens does</li>
            <li> Not a bad body lotion. This lotion is more suitable to use in the summer because it is pretty runny and not as thick as I like my body lotions to be.  The lotion dries pretty quickly on your body so you don&#x27;t have to wait for too long in the humid bathroom. This product is heavily fragranced and has a nice sweet smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I don&#x27;t think my skin has been this soft since I was a kid. I just use a little on my arms and legs every night and they are really silky smooth.  I like the smell of this even though I can&#x27;t tell you what it smells like since it doesn&#x27;t say anything but fragrance on label and made with Moroccan Argan Oil. It goes on oily but turns into smooth real quick. I try not to use too much of it at bed time though because the smell can be a little overpowering when you are enveloped in blankets. Besides, a little dab will do anyway. Your skin will look radiant after just a few days of use. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a big fan of the Sauve Moroccan Infusion line of products. I really like the smell, and they all work very well.The body lotion is another winner. It&#x27;s not too heavy, but still moisturizes my dry winter skin well. I think due to its lightness, it&#x27;ll be good for summer, too. The price is nice, too, especially since you don&#x27;t need gobs and gobs for it to do the job.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this lotion - one of the best I&#x27;ve ever had! Its moisturizing qualities are just as dazzling for me -- it truly lasts and it is now my favorite lotion! It is just like a high end lotion that one would find in a much more expensive formula. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had read some of the other reviews of this product and was a little concerned the scent would be overwhelming. It wasn&#x27;t. It is strong and lasts a long time, I just don&#x27;t wear perfume when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the lotion I put on after showering at the gym. It lasts all day long. My ankles are the driest part of my body. No clue why. I put this stuff on and they stay well moisturized all day long. I didn&#x27;t find that it lasted through multiple hand washings as one reviewer stated. It is still a wonderful product that works!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. It is a light weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I received this lotion as a gift in a gift set with shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.  I have very dry skin and sensitive skin and this lotion is a very good moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  As for the smell it doesn&#x27;t smell like the other products of the set (although I wish it did.)  The smell reminds of Vaseline lotion that used to come in the yellow bottles it isn&#x27;t a bad smell, it just isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; smell -1 star.  I would buy this lotion again on it&#x27;s own because makes my skin smooth and silky even in the harsh winter.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just okay.  The fragrance seems a bit strong to me, a little heavy.  It also left my hands with a sticky feel.  Overall, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this lotion.  I&#x27;ll finish the bottle, but wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> This really makes you skin feel good and smells good too.  I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> For me this doesn&#x27;t fit the description of &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve used the Suave Vitamin E lotion for a while, and it absorbs fairly quickly.  This, on the other hand, is more like vegetable oil - it doesn&#x27;t absorb at all, and I have to use a paper towel to get enough of it off that I can wash the rest off with soap &amp; water.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used lots of different hand lotions.  This one is by far the best one!!  It&#x27;s  not greased but it moisturizers and absorbs fast.  I luv it!!</li>
            <li> based on the reviews, esp the comments about how good it smells, I tried this.  it stinks, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, it smells old. it has a faint scent of the Moroccan oil, whichis delightful, but it has a strong smell of old lady expired lotion.  I know some people love it. I will try the smell test at the store before I every buy lotion online again.</li>
            <li> this lotion smells amazing. absorbs in quick and lasts all day. my new favorite moisturizer, love this stuff</li>
            <li> Smells so good and mosturizes your skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion and it goes on smoothly without feeling greasy but as one who does not use perfumes, I didn&#x27;t care for its scent. Although the scent is not that strong and it&#x27;s not a bad scent either, it&#x27;s strong enough where I could still smell well after it was absorbed into my skin with the scent lasting for several hours. That&#x27;s the reason why I&#x27;m giving it three stars. But if you prefer a long lasting scented lotion, then you probably would like this product.</li>
            <li> I am already a fan of Suave lotions or was more of a fan before they changed my Cocoa Butter lotion, it doesn&#x27;t smell like chocolate anymore, so I won&#x27;t be buying that scent anymore. But on to the Moroccan Infusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First week of using this I put it on one side of my body and my Suave not so Cocoa anymore lotion on the other side. The side I used the Moroccan Infusion on stayed hydrated the whole day, the other side seemed to get &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; which is unusual. I like the texture of the lotion, it is smooth and not greasy. The scent I had to get used to, not so much as the smell itself but I think more or less my allergies and how they were getting along with the outside world that day. It is not a very over powering smell but it is different, it dies down though and I hardly notice it, although other people smell it and think it smells good and that&#x27;s a plus right? right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using this on my hands and my feet after my bath I put this lotion on and my socks, softens them up. It is a good lotion and I like it, but I do not think I will purchase this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I do not like the phrase Clinically prove to moisturize as well as Moroccanoil..seriously?</li>
            <li> Nice texture, strong smell. I gave it to my daughter. But it does work well.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this!  It smells almost identical to Orofluidio Hair Oil.  This lotion penetrates into skin, leaving it feeling silky and not at all greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I have never tried this lotion before but my hands are always dry though out the winter time and so I decided to try this since it was being offered to vine reviewers. To be honest I don&#x27;t try a lot of lotions but I really liked this one it made my hands fill silky smooth. Normally when I do put on lotion it never really feels like I put anything on, it goes right back to being rough. This lotion kept my skin feeling smoother longer than the other lotions I have tried. (Which are not many)</li>
            <li> Very mositurizing lotion, yet lightweight. This also has a great light, Moroccan scent to it. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all. I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love that it is non greasy. This. Is great. A little goes a long way. It smells really good. Great for all over the body. Large bottle will last a long time.Whole family can use it as well.Sells good. Will not leave smears on everything you touch when your done.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Feels even better in your skin! A must try product!</li>
            <li> Moroccan argan oil  seems to be the cosmetic ingredient du jour these days.  Whatever it is, it smells delicious and this light, smooth lotion is altogether yummy and less cheap-smelling than other Suave products.  The price is right, too.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t take forever to soak in</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion because I&#x27;ve used their [[ASIN:B00A0IWRT4 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Shampoo 28 oz]] and their [[ASIN:B00A0IWRU8 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner 28 oz]] and I like how well they perform and the fragrance which is kind of unique. This lotion was no exception and I find it performs well and keeps my skin moisturised all day. Suave products have a reputation for being very effective and a lot less expensive than the high priced brands. Two thumbs up for another great Suave product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hands feel dry.  DO NOT LIKE IT!!!</li>
            <li> The lotion does what you would expect, I wouldn&#x27;t call it anything different than an ordinary lotion. The scent is not really what I would prefer, but it works.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I purchased this product purely for the scent.  I love the smell of the shampoo and conditioner, which smell very similar to the really expensive salon Moroccan products.  So I was excited to learn that there was a lotion that had this same luxurious scent at a price I can afford.  The lotion absorbed nicely and left my skin feeling soft and lightly scented. The scent is wonderful, but not very long lasting.  Layering the lotion with the Suave Moroccan Infusion dry oil, helped make the scent last slightly longer, but I think the line would benefit from a bath gel and a body mist so that the layered scent can really last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Product was given to my 20 year old son and his review is as follows:  If your skin dries frequently, this is definitely the product for you. As a man whose skin dries extremely fast, finding a good lotion to sustain the moisture on my hands has always been a chore. It was to the point where I simply used petroleum jelly because I knew it would keep my skin moisturized the longest. Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion keeps my skin in good shape for up to 5 hours, which is amazing by my standards. I work at Starbucks, where I am constantly washing my hands, and during my shift I only had to reuse the lotion twice. Now if you&#x27;re into great smelling lotions, this particular Suave isn&#x27;t recommended. It lacks a distinctant smell that&#x27;ll draw the attention of strangers, but hey, that&#x27;s what perfume is for. If your all about results and long lasting moisturizing, this is definitely the lotion for you!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and have tried many many different lotions, including very expensive ones. This is my favorite. It goes on very smoothly and lasts all day. Works better than Aveeno and Eurcerin, in my opinion, and much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell or feel of this product but, my wife did. Not really one of Suave&#x27;s better products.</li>
            <li> Love this Suave Body Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It is very effective, does a great job at moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is absolutely divine!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Strong smell. While it felt good to smooth on, it actually dried out my skin and made my eczema break out further. I can&#x27;t recommend this product based on that but the smell is even worse. My husband threw it out because it stunk up our bedroom and made him gag. I love Suave but this one is a fail.</li>
            <li> Smells good but evaporates too quickly</li>
            <li> this is probably my most favorite lotion I&#x27;ve used! I&#x27;ve used it during my entire pregnancy and have had no stretch marks!!! This is definitely a staple in my household!!</li>
            <li> Like many others I do not like the scent. But it does help to moisturize the skin</li>
            <li> Go Suave, Yesssss a product that once applied will keep you moist without any dry spots in sight all day long.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I bought this after trying some at my local store. I was looking for something with a similar scent as the Moroccanoil line, which smells awesome, but at a more affordable price. This fit the bill perfectly. It smells very similar to (but not exactly the same as) the Moroccanoil products. Also, this lotion is light - not greasy at all, but still moisturizes. I love it.</li>
            <li> This smells great and moisturizes well!</li>
            <li> Bab to try this. It is no foam.</li>
