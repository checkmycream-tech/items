            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>best way I&#x27;ve found to use this is to put a bunch on the roots of your hair before bed and don&#x27;t brush it until the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully on hair that needs a washing</li>
            <li>great product, best one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff works great.</li>

            <li>Smells great, without that &amp;#34;HEY</li>
            <li>being said, hair came out great.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great for the price --</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell great.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>Almost as good as Jean (Mantiates&#x27; spelling?)</li>
            <li>, I just rub it in with my finger tips and give it a good brushing to get out any excess.</li>
            <li>loved this product.  </li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and do not wash it every day!</li>
            <li>This product is PERFECT as it works quickly and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to be able to review this product but one month on I am still waiting for this product to arrive!!</li>
            <li>And i swear her hair looks better on the days she doesn&#x27;t wash it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I went a month with fresh bright colour because I didn&#x27;t have to wash when I used this great product.</li>
            <li>kind of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fine haired ladies, HERE&#x27;s your break!</li>
            <li>After doing this on many sections of hair (while my hair is fine, I seemingly have a LOT of it!)</li>
            <li>It takes a very light touch to make sure I don&#x27;t look as though I am wearing a powdered wig, but I figure that is more my concern than they product itself.  </li>
            <li>:) it virtually lightens up my roots</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t love the smell but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a ponytail day, for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and also use their shampoo and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I love this product....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find this much better than just using baby powder.  </li>
            <li>And more than just an illusion.  </li>
            <li>Love the spout top.</li>
            <li>this is wayyyyyyy better.</li>
            <li>Your hair has more fullness and gloss.</li>
            <li>.6 oz more than the Oscar Blandi one.</li>
            <li>so it feels more powdery in my hair.</li>
            <li>What I am most pleased with is the amount of product in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Like many of my fellow reviewers, I have been on a quest to find the best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo ever!  </li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>If you are looking to skip shampooing, I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>think I also might have noticed that the powder isn&#x27;t as fine as the Oscar Blandi one</li>
            <li>I am a blonde and I also use this for a great trick....</li>
            <li>A light scent would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Totally worth spending more on.</li>
            <li>This stuff allows me to skip one more day, which is an excellent time saver when I wake up late on hair-washing day (darn snooze button).</li>
            <li>listened to advice of younger generation thinking they know what they&#x27;re talking about when they said that fair haired ppl need more of the product to get correct affect.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair body, and clean look.</li>
            <li>Amazing product and the seller shipped it to me in an effective package, arriving on time as expected.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I hunted for it on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find at Ulta or Sephora.  </li>
            <li>but I was able to go for a number of days without shampooing thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>Even when I work out my hair feels super clean with this.  </li>
            <li>Just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>but I definitely don&#x27;t think it smells good or fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a trick to this product which will make your hair look fresh, clean and full of body for 5 days+.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair like me, you know it can start looking greasy just after getting in a hot car,</li>
            <li>The spout to distribute the product is great, you get a nice, thin line of powder and</li>
            <li>The bottle applies the powdery effectively, and while it smells a bit like campfire smoke at first the smell fades and then it is pretty much odorless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used dry shampoo in 40 years but the reviews looked good</li>
            <li>Not only does this allow for accuracy, it makes for a much more secure and clean experience when traveling.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is awesome and allows me to skip a day or two of actually washing my hair!  </li>
            <li>And there is never a weird smell; my hair smelled clean, even after one or 2 additional applications.</li>
            <li>This was the third product in my search for the perfect dry shampoo, and the search is now over!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s rare that I go two days without washing my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With this product, I can go about 5 days without washing my hair &amp; it still looks (and smells) fresh.</li>
            <li>, I feel compelling to mention my hair color as well.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not convinced of its worth varying that scenario.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw this on a youtube video, and thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this dry shampoo but mostly because the one I was using before this one was very superior to this one, I didn&#x27;t like my first one due to the scent</li>
            <li>This product adds life and body to your hair and really makes it seem clean.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s this product, because I&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before, but not really that impressed.  </li>
            <li>when mixed into my hair, I see that it offers a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell, so that&#x27;s good).</li>
            <li>The dry shampoo powder is as fine as a fog in the air and easily combed though.  </li>
            <li>It really soaks up the oil and leaves your hair feeling fresh without the weight of a sticky product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll still want to look at the back of your head and the top of your scalp in a mirro to make sure there are no lingering white spots.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job on my dirty hair, and brushes through without being visible at all, however it is messy so best to stand in the shower/tub when putting it on.  </li>
            <li>My one gripe is that the first thing I noticed when I pulled it out of the box was the smell.</li>
            <li>We need it for a trip and thought we&#x27;d try it out first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use it multiple days in a row without my hair/scalp feeling grimy.</li>
            <li>I can run errands without having to shower first.</li>
            <li>If you put too much on it can start to grey hair like baby powder, but a little on the fingers rubbed in at the roots and combed through hair is just perfect.</li>
            <li>If I need more, a firm shake gets a good amount out -- just enough, not too much.</li>
            <li>so I though give it a try to something different especially after reding good reviews.</li>
            <li>even though the product is totally unscented, is very easy to control how much you are applying, makes my hair feel clean and NOT dry or powdery.</li>
            <li>I was encouraged by all the positive reviews but still prefer Pssst.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle I switched back to my original powder until I recently found a spray I LOVE.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite powder dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have also used the dry shampoo sprays and this one is way better.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the spray versions of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Also, the white shows up easily on my brown hair.</li>
            <li>Product #2: only used it once because the smell was too strong and it made me itch.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to brush it out really well and don&#x27;t over-apply (with any dry shampoo, really.)</li>
            <li>The problem I have is that it really gunks up my hair.</li>
            <li>I have brown hair with light brown and blonde highlights.  </li>
            <li>Much longer than Pssst.</li>
            <li>I have very greasy hair</li>
            <li>It really revives hair.</li>
            <li>straight up cornstarch that I keep in a shaker with a vanilla bean pod.</li>
            <li>Can really get to the roots without getting powder everywhere.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Much appreciated.</li>
            <li>It took much much longer than it would have had I just showered and styled as usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really does work well.  </li>
            <li>The powder mixes well into the root of greasy hair without much fuss.</li>
            <li>I normally use Psssst!</li>
            <li>(I should note that I use more than the average person.</li>
            <li>pleasant but strong smell, difficult to control how much product was actually coming out, and ran out after about 5 uses.</li>
            <li>so I tried it, thinking there must be new technology!  </li>
            <li>At the same time, I prefer a natural, non-fussy look, so this dry shampoo has been coming in handy.</li>
            <li>use just a tiny bit, maybe a quarter&#x27;s worth in size</li>
            <li>It feels, looks and behaves same way as freshly washed but took me hours to get it there</li>
            <li>I had bought a few other dry shampoos and they all were strong smelling and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>only thing is that the dry shampoo smells like bandaids, but mostly just during application.</li>
            <li>I am a very busy mom of three, and some days I find I must go out and don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for busy, efficient people.</li>
            <li>I am not sure it works any better than baking soda and talc.</li>
            <li>I have fine, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The problem is that the nozzle clumps easily, with the result of powder being unevenly squirted onto my scalp.</li>
            <li>Not only is your hair awesome the day after a shampoo, this stuff balances out oil accumulation for at least a FEW days!</li>
            <li>This is a great dry shampoo to use if you don&#x27;t have time to do a full wash and dry, and your hair is looking a little oily or limp.</li>
            <li>If you accidentally put too much powder in and get a white spot on your scalp, no worries!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent that I can tell and it&#x27;s not messy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works well, and I appreciate that it&#x27;s natural...</li>
            <li>The hair&#x27;s natural way that it falls kind of emphasizes my part and makes my hair look thin, so I need lift.</li>
            <li>This is the first powder dry shampoo that I have used.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is easy to use, but you have to be careful not to over apply.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is light weight and  does not get sticky like a lot of the dry shampoos I have tried!</li>
            <li>The towel will remove any excess as well as spread around the dry shampoo a little more evenly.</li>
            <li>Place the nozzle directly in your roots, gently shake, and apply the powder to the areas that you know will get greasy (such as the hairline above your ear, near your bangs, hair parts, and at the nape of your neck).</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly a dozen dry shampoos, and this one works very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and as long as you rub it in well, it works with even dark hair to absorb extra oils to get away with not washing for one more day.  </li>
            <li>I hoped this dry shampoo would help keep the oil in control, but it doesn&#x27;t do much at all..  </li>
            <li>had it not been for one major reality...</li>
            <li>Some of the previous shampoos may have created slightly better volume, but they were a nightmare to blend with my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other dry shampoos on the market and Frederic Fekkai&#x27;s Au Naturel Dry Shampoo blows them all out of the water.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a friend who swore she would never use dry shampoo and it wouldn&#x27;t work on her fine, limp hair..</li>
            <li>Unlike the first few dry shampoos I used, which were shake style, this one squeezes out the small opening in the top.</li>
            <li>Out of all the powders I&amp;#34;ve used this one doesn&#x27;t have a horrible, strong scent and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make ur hair white (like so many other dry shampoos) if u follow the directions !!!!!</li>
            <li>The powder ones leave your hair clean but still dull looking.</li>
            <li>caveat, if you apply the dry shampoo on first-day hair, even a little, your hair may look and feel kind of stiff.</li>
            <li>Made my hair look and feel much dirtier with less body.  </li>
            <li>This powder takes away the oily feel and odor of unwashed hair without leaving behind a strong smell or gritty feeling.</li>
            <li>The trick is to put this dry shampoo powder in your hair on day 1, right after you have washed and blow dried your hair.</li>

            <li> Just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> but I definitely don&#x27;t think it smells good or fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a trick to this product which will make your hair look fresh, clean and full of body for 5 days+.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair like me, you know it can start looking greasy just after getting in a hot car,</li>
            <li> The spout to distribute the product is great, you get a nice, thin line of powder and</li>
            <li> The bottle applies the powdery effectively, and while it smells a bit like campfire smoke at first the smell fades and then it is pretty much odorless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used dry shampoo in 40 years but the reviews looked good</li>
            <li> Not only does this allow for accuracy, it makes for a much more secure and clean experience when traveling.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is awesome and allows me to skip a day or two of actually washing my hair!  </li>
            <li> And there is never a weird smell; my hair smelled clean, even after one or 2 additional applications.</li>
            <li> This was the third product in my search for the perfect dry shampoo, and the search is now over!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s rare that I go two days without washing my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With this product, I can go about 5 days without washing my hair &amp; it still looks (and smells) fresh.</li>
            <li> , I feel compelling to mention my hair color as well.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not convinced of its worth varying that scenario.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw this on a youtube video, and thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this dry shampoo but mostly because the one I was using before this one was very superior to this one, I didn&#x27;t like my first one due to the scent</li>
            <li> This product adds life and body to your hair and really makes it seem clean.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s this product, because I&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before, but not really that impressed.  </li>
            <li> when mixed into my hair, I see that it offers a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell, so that&#x27;s good).</li>
            <li> The dry shampoo powder is as fine as a fog in the air and easily combed though.  </li>
            <li> It really soaks up the oil and leaves your hair feeling fresh without the weight of a sticky product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll still want to look at the back of your head and the top of your scalp in a mirro to make sure there are no lingering white spots.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job on my dirty hair, and brushes through without being visible at all, however it is messy so best to stand in the shower/tub when putting it on.  </li>
            <li> My one gripe is that the first thing I noticed when I pulled it out of the box was the smell.</li>
            <li> We need it for a trip and thought we&#x27;d try it out first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use it multiple days in a row without my hair/scalp feeling grimy.</li>
            <li> I can run errands without having to shower first.</li>
            <li> If you put too much on it can start to grey hair like baby powder, but a little on the fingers rubbed in at the roots and combed through hair is just perfect.</li>
            <li> If I need more, a firm shake gets a good amount out -- just enough, not too much.</li>
            <li> so I though give it a try to something different especially after reding good reviews.</li>
            <li> even though the product is totally unscented, is very easy to control how much you are applying, makes my hair feel clean and NOT dry or powdery.</li>
            <li> I was encouraged by all the positive reviews but still prefer Pssst.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle I switched back to my original powder until I recently found a spray I LOVE.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite powder dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have also used the dry shampoo sprays and this one is way better.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the spray versions of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Also, the white shows up easily on my brown hair.</li>
            <li> Product #2: only used it once because the smell was too strong and it made me itch.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to brush it out really well and don&#x27;t over-apply (with any dry shampoo, really.)</li>
            <li> The problem I have is that it really gunks up my hair.</li>
            <li> I have brown hair with light brown and blonde highlights.  </li>
            <li> Much longer than Pssst.</li>
            <li> I have very greasy hair</li>
            <li> It really revives hair.</li>
            <li> straight up cornstarch that I keep in a shaker with a vanilla bean pod.</li>
            <li> Can really get to the roots without getting powder everywhere.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> It took much much longer than it would have had I just showered and styled as usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really does work well.  </li>
            <li> The powder mixes well into the root of greasy hair without much fuss.</li>
            <li> I normally use Psssst!</li>
            <li> (I should note that I use more than the average person.</li>
            <li> pleasant but strong smell, difficult to control how much product was actually coming out, and ran out after about 5 uses.</li>
            <li> so I tried it, thinking there must be new technology!  </li>
            <li> At the same time, I prefer a natural, non-fussy look, so this dry shampoo has been coming in handy.</li>
            <li> use just a tiny bit, maybe a quarter&#x27;s worth in size</li>
            <li> It feels, looks and behaves same way as freshly washed but took me hours to get it there</li>
            <li> I had bought a few other dry shampoos and they all were strong smelling and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li> only thing is that the dry shampoo smells like bandaids, but mostly just during application.</li>
            <li> I am a very busy mom of three, and some days I find I must go out and don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for busy, efficient people.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it works any better than baking soda and talc.</li>
            <li> I have fine, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The problem is that the nozzle clumps easily, with the result of powder being unevenly squirted onto my scalp.</li>
            <li> Not only is your hair awesome the day after a shampoo, this stuff balances out oil accumulation for at least a FEW days!</li>
            <li> This is a great dry shampoo to use if you don&#x27;t have time to do a full wash and dry, and your hair is looking a little oily or limp.</li>
            <li> If you accidentally put too much powder in and get a white spot on your scalp, no worries!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a scent that I can tell and it&#x27;s not messy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works well, and I appreciate that it&#x27;s natural...</li>
            <li> The hair&#x27;s natural way that it falls kind of emphasizes my part and makes my hair look thin, so I need lift.</li>
            <li> This is the first powder dry shampoo that I have used.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is easy to use, but you have to be careful not to over apply.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is light weight and  does not get sticky like a lot of the dry shampoos I have tried!</li>
            <li> The towel will remove any excess as well as spread around the dry shampoo a little more evenly.</li>
            <li> Place the nozzle directly in your roots, gently shake, and apply the powder to the areas that you know will get greasy (such as the hairline above your ear, near your bangs, hair parts, and at the nape of your neck).</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly a dozen dry shampoos, and this one works very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and as long as you rub it in well, it works with even dark hair to absorb extra oils to get away with not washing for one more day.  </li>
            <li> I hoped this dry shampoo would help keep the oil in control, but it doesn&#x27;t do much at all..  </li>
            <li> had it not been for one major reality...</li>
            <li> Some of the previous shampoos may have created slightly better volume, but they were a nightmare to blend with my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other dry shampoos on the market and Frederic Fekkai&#x27;s Au Naturel Dry Shampoo blows them all out of the water.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend who swore she would never use dry shampoo and it wouldn&#x27;t work on her fine, limp hair..</li>
            <li> Unlike the first few dry shampoos I used, which were shake style, this one squeezes out the small opening in the top.</li>
            <li> Out of all the powders I&amp;#34;ve used this one doesn&#x27;t have a horrible, strong scent and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make ur hair white (like so many other dry shampoos) if u follow the directions !!!!!</li>
            <li> The powder ones leave your hair clean but still dull looking.</li>
            <li> caveat, if you apply the dry shampoo on first-day hair, even a little, your hair may look and feel kind of stiff.</li>
            <li> Made my hair look and feel much dirtier with less body.  </li>
            <li> This powder takes away the oily feel and odor of unwashed hair without leaving behind a strong smell or gritty feeling.</li>
            <li> The trick is to put this dry shampoo powder in your hair on day 1, right after you have washed and blow dried your hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin blonde hair that gets flat and greasy within 36 hours of being washed.  </li>
            <li> This product comes in a fairly large bottle that will last you for ages since it&#x27;s a powder and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Moving it gently through the hair dispenses a tiny puff of the powder and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m dealing with hair styling professionally for over 20 years and while I suppose if your stranded on a desert island with no fresh water to bathe our shower this type of product will definitely be a life saver.</li>
            <li> A bit spendy, but seems to last a long time especially compared to the sprays.</li>
            <li> very little smell which is a plus &amp; really takes the oil out</li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo to boost body and freshen my hair, and this one only does the former.  </li>
            <li> I find the nozzle is too small to get much out</li>
            <li> Once you are finished, dunk your head upside-down, and \\&quot;clap\\&quot; your hair in between your hands (if you have long enough hair to do so).</li>
            <li> If this works for you it will probably last you a long time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t wear off as fast as the dry shampoo sprays I have used.  </li>
            <li> As far as this being a quality product it is, hands down, and it would have received 5 starts from me</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron or curling wand daily on my hair, so not having to wash &amp; dry my hair every day</li>
            <li> but it seems to be lasting a very long time.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo also deodorizes your hair so if you go out to a smokey bar on a Saturday night, don&#x27;t worry, your hair won&#x27;t smell like smoke the next day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this dry shampoo for about a month and a half now, and so far, it has been the only one to check all the boxes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the nozzle tip scare you away, simply give the bottle a little shake, like you&#x27;re putting salt on some French fries (mmm, French fries...)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only downsides to this product are its ridiculous price (especially considering how much I use), and that it doesn&#x27;t give your hair extra body (but it also doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.)</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of $ for me.</li>
            <li> I tried other products to save some money, but I keep going back to fekkai.</li>
            <li> (I have long hair and a lot of it!)</li>
            <li> other dry shampoos, I could only stand one day of dry shampooed hair before I decided I needed to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> DRY.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Fekkai Dry Shampoo for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> Switched from oscar blandi dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come in search for this dry shampoo that I adore.  </li>
            <li> Longtime dry shampoo user.</li>
            <li> I would not suggest this for beginner dry shampoo users.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile the ends of your hair are so dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;m reviewing dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I am used to using baby powder or spray dry shampoo...</li>
            <li> I JUST SPRAYED MY HAIR WITH DRY SHAMPOO</li>
            <li> I have gone through a 4 oz. tube of another brand of dry shampoo, and it was gone before the month has passed.</li>
            <li> Without it, I have to wash my hair every single day.</li>
            <li> My hair is a dark blonde, any darker and I&#x27;d be a brunette.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been trying to acclimate it being washed less without looking gross.</li>
            <li> Instead of applying directly to the scalp/hair, I pour out into the palm of one hand and work the product in little by little with fingertips.</li>
            <li> , it can leave a little white residue if you don&#x27;t work it in.  </li>
            <li> Reapply a little powder each following day to keep the grease as bay.</li>
            <li> I would like a light fragrance to cover the dirty hair smell, but it has nothing.  </li>
            <li> I have long, dark hair.</li>
            <li> the scent is minimal</li>
            <li> minimal residue, gives lots of body between washes.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My idea was that during the winter, I can wash my hair every other day and use this product on the off days.</li>
            <li> Just rub small to moderate amount into your scalp to absorb oil!  </li>
            <li> so I tried other types.</li>
            <li> I have only purchased sprays in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have very think dark brown hair and this powder was near impossible to rub in well and didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as my other product.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had trouble with the dry shampoo showing up against my dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still use it from time to time because it was expensive, and I really want to like it.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical when I bought this dry shampoo, but I was surprised at its efficacy.  </li>
            <li> is if you have black hair.  </li>
            <li> Ps I had to give one star as the system does not accept anything less.</li>
            <li> and I am not even half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE HERE.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little weirded out by all the aluminum in it and wanted to explore a less toxic alternative.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, thick, somewhat dry hair, and usually wash every other day.</li>
            <li> All I need is a little</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it stills makes my hair dull.</li>
            <li> it saves my hair from being washed everyday, decreasing the damage.</li>
            <li> in my humble opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just squeeze a few spots on the hair, comb through, and it absorbs oil in the hair on days when hair can&#x27;t be washed.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried, it doesn&#x27;t have color that can come off on clothes or hands, and it isn&#x27;t sticky or hard like hairspray.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair stiff and sticky  and smelly like the sprays.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I little goes a long way and it is difficult to remove excess if you listen to those who&#x27;ve used these types of shampoos before and not follow the package indications.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Take a small facecloth or towel and massage the powder into the rest of your scalp.</li>
            <li> I just read online that they are discontinuing it when I couldn&#x27;t find it in my usual shop.  </li>
            <li> I had in the past the spray shampoo</li>
            <li> Then asked as usual.</li>
            <li> I have very black, shiny hair and this leaves a dull super-thick texture in my hair.</li>
            <li> I did notice a very faint &amp;#34;medical smell&amp;#34; that other people noticed, but it was only for a moment at the time of application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just hard to distribute evenly on your roots sometimes.</li>
            <li> It was hard to apply and the smell was like having cement powder on your had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put off reviewing this product until I used it at least 5 times.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount in a shallow glass dish, I then use a blush brush to work it into the front hairline and temple area!  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have seriously oily skin, tho&#x27;.)</li>
            <li> Looks ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and then was unable to find</li>
            <li> After some trial and error, I&#x27;ve learned the secret is to massage it into your scalp with your fingers after sprinkling it in, and then brush (not comb)</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and go about a week between washings.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t even think of wearing my hair down on a day I used this product-</li>
            <li> I hate the chemical laden dry shampoo sprays.</li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> Well now she is addicted!</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side</li>
            <li> For this reason, and the slightly stale smell, I&#x27;m going to give it 3 stars.   </li>
            <li> It is difficult to distribute, so it clumps in my scalp</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, too.</li>
            <li> My friend said it didn&#x27;t smell weird, well, maybe it doesn&#x27;t smell weird</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this was an all out awful product just not good for my thick brunette hair.</li>
            <li> Smells a little weird but works wonders !!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t walk around feeling like I have dirty hair.  </li>
            <li> The sprays leave your hair so dirty.</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> However, I just can&#x27;t get past the horrible smell of it.</li>
            <li> But when I tried the powder, it also smelled weird!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as bad as it was 40 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that bad.</li>
            <li> I use this even when my hair isn&#x27;t dirty!</li>
            <li> I hate to say this</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite powder dry shampoo. It really soaks up the oil and leaves your hair feeling fresh without the weight of a sticky product. I am a blonde and I also use this for a great trick.... It works wonders for covering up roots!!! :) it virtually lightens up my roots and I just take a damp wash cloth and rub my visible scalp with it and I am good to go. It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I found the product can leave a bit of white residue if not worked into the hair properly.  Overall though, it really is a big help when you need to run out and don&#x27;t have time to wash and style your hair.  Instead of applying directly to the scalp/hair, I pour out into the palm of one hand and work the product in little by little with fingertips.</li>
            <li> BEST. DRY. SHAMPOO. EVER.</li>
            <li> Great product !!!! Doesn&#x27;t make ur hair white (like so many other dry shampoos) if u follow the directions !!!!! Smells a little weird but works wonders !!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used dry shampoo in 40 years but the reviews looked good so I tried it, thinking there must be new technology!  Wrong!  It&#x27;s just as bad as it was 40 years ago.  Trying it once was enough.  Made my hair look and feel much dirtier with less body.  Sorry.  It was a complete waste of $ for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend who swore she would never use dry shampoo and it wouldn&#x27;t work on her fine, limp hair.. Well now she is addicted! And i swear her hair looks better on the days she doesn&#x27;t wash it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Fekkai Dry Shampoo for a couple of years now. I love it. it saves my hair from being washed everyday, decreasing the damage. This dry shampoo is easy to use, but you have to be careful not to over apply. It gives my hair body, and clean look. I tried other products to save some money, but I keep going back to fekkai.</li>
            <li> I have long, dark hair. The hair&#x27;s natural way that it falls kind of emphasizes my part and makes my hair look thin, so I need lift. At the same time, I prefer a natural, non-fussy look, so this dry shampoo has been coming in handy. I like the applicator. Moving it gently through the hair dispenses a tiny puff of the powder and a little goes a long way. If I need more, a firm shake gets a good amount out -- just enough, not too much. I haven&#x27;t had trouble with the dry shampoo showing up against my dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that the dry shampoo smells like bandaids, but mostly just during application. A light scent would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With other dry shampoos, I could only stand one day of dry shampooed hair before I decided I needed to wash my hair. With this, I&#x27;ve gone three days, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat, if you apply the dry shampoo on first-day hair, even a little, your hair may look and feel kind of stiff. I recommend waiting for second-day hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put off reviewing this product until I used it at least 5 times. I don&#x27;t love it. My idea was that during the winter, I can wash my hair every other day and use this product on the off days. The spout to distribute the product is great, you get a nice, thin line of powder and the scent is minimal (I don&#x27;t love the smell but when mixed into my hair, I see that it offers a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell, so that&#x27;s good). The problem I have is that it really gunks up my hair. I have very black, shiny hair and this leaves a dull super-thick texture in my hair. It&#x27;s so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t even think of wearing my hair down on a day I used this product- it&#x27;s a ponytail day, for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  Yes it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side but it seems to be lasting a very long time.  I like that it&#x27;s a powder and like others have said, it can leave a little white residue if you don&#x27;t work it in.  Not a big deal.  I have brown hair with light brown and blonde highlights.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this is if you have black hair.  I have also used the dry shampoo sprays and this one is way better.  I love this brand and also use their shampoo and conditioners.  Definitely worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product....I love it so much I hunted for it on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find at Ulta or Sephora.  This is the best dry shampoo ever!  It&#x27;s powder product....a little goes a long way.  Here&#x27;s how I use it:  I put a small amount in a shallow glass dish, I then use a blush brush to work it into the front hairline and temple area!  The best part it&#x27;s odorless!</li>
            <li> I hate to say this but I was able to go for a number of days without shampooing thanks to this product.  And there is never a weird smell; my hair smelled clean, even after one or 2 additional applications. No itch, no redness or allergic reactions. The dry shampoo powder is as fine as a fog in the air and easily combed though.  Amazing product and the seller shipped it to me in an effective package, arriving on time as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I am not sure it works any better than baking soda and talc. Sorta of pricey for not working that well.</li>
            <li> great product, best one I&#x27;ve used.  Switched from oscar blandi dry shampoo.  minimal residue, gives lots of body between washes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other dry shampoos on the market and Frederic Fekkai&#x27;s Au Naturel Dry Shampoo blows them all out of the water. This product comes in a fairly large bottle that will last you for ages since it&#x27;s a powder and a little goes a long way. (I have long hair and a lot of it!) There is a trick to this product which will make your hair look fresh, clean and full of body for 5 days+. The trick is to put this dry shampoo powder in your hair on day 1, right after you have washed and blow dried your hair. Place the nozzle directly in your roots, gently shake, and apply the powder to the areas that you know will get greasy (such as the hairline above your ear, near your bangs, hair parts, and at the nape of your neck). If you accidentally put too much powder in and get a white spot on your scalp, no worries! Take a small facecloth or towel and massage the powder into the rest of your scalp. The towel will remove any excess as well as spread around the dry shampoo a little more evenly. Once you are finished, dunk your head upside-down, and \\&quot;clap\\&quot; your hair in between your hands (if you have long enough hair to do so). This will also get any excess powder away from your ends. Reapply a little powder each following day to keep the grease as bay. This dry shampoo also deodorizes your hair so if you go out to a smokey bar on a Saturday night, don&#x27;t worry, your hair won&#x27;t smell like smoke the next day. I promise you this product works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come in search for this dry shampoo that I adore.  I have a bottle that has lasted over a year, maybe even 18 months.  I just read online that they are discontinuing it when I couldn&#x27;t find it in my usual shop.  I wash my hair every-other-day on the advice of my hairdresser.  I use this on the days that I don&#x27;t wash.  Even when I work out my hair feels super clean with this.  (I have tried it on day two of not washing and it works okay, but it&#x27;s rare that I go two days without washing my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use just a tiny bit, maybe a quarter&#x27;s worth in size and I rub it on my scalp and temples.  It doesn&#x27;t have a scent that I can tell and it&#x27;s not messy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to stock up now in hopes that it lasts in my closet.  Fekkai, please bring this back!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and as long as you rub it in well, it works with even dark hair to absorb extra oils to get away with not washing for one more day.  (I don&#x27;t have seriously oily skin, tho&#x27;.)</li>
            <li> Longtime dry shampoo user. I normally use Psssst! but I&#x27;m a little weirded out by all the aluminum in it and wanted to explore a less toxic alternative. I was encouraged by all the positive reviews but still prefer Pssst.  I have fine, slightly wavy hair. After some trial and error, I&#x27;ve learned the secret is to massage it into your scalp with your fingers after sprinkling it in, and then brush (not comb) it in. You&#x27;ll still want to look at the back of your head and the top of your scalp in a mirro to make sure there are no lingering white spots. For this reason, and the slightly stale smell, I&#x27;m going to give it 3 stars.   On the plus side, you are getting a lot of product for the money. If this works for you it will probably last you a long time. Much longer than Pssst.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and do not wash it every day! This dry shampoo is awesome and allows me to skip a day or two of actually washing my hair!  This dry shampoo is light weight and  does not get sticky like a lot of the dry shampoos I have tried! Just rub small to moderate amount into your scalp to absorb oil!  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this much better than just using baby powder.  I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s this product, because I&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before, but not really that impressed.  I find the nozzle is too small to get much out</li>
            <li> This product does a great job on my dirty hair, and brushes through without being visible at all, however it is messy so best to stand in the shower/tub when putting it on.  I would not suggest this for beginner dry shampoo users.</li>
            <li> Removes oil buildup and adds volume. Freshens, but is not overly scented. My hair is medium length and color treated. I use a flat iron or curling wand daily on my hair, so not having to wash &amp; dry my hair every day helps prevent further damage. With this product, I can go about 5 days without washing my hair &amp; it still looks (and smells) fresh.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I had bought a few other dry shampoos and they all were strong smelling and not in a good way.  This powder takes away the oily feel and odor of unwashed hair without leaving behind a strong smell or gritty feeling. It takes a very light touch to make sure I don&#x27;t look as though I am wearing a powdered wig, but I figure that is more my concern than they product itself.  If you are looking to skip shampooing, I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very greasy hair and I&#x27;ve been trying to acclimate it being washed less without looking gross. I&#x27;ve used sprays, baby powders etc. but this stuff works great. The bottle applies the powdery effectively, and while it smells a bit like campfire smoke at first the smell fades and then it is pretty much odorless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way I&#x27;ve found to use this is to put a bunch on the roots of your hair before bed and don&#x27;t brush it until the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides to this product are its ridiculous price (especially considering how much I use), and that it doesn&#x27;t give your hair extra body (but it also doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.)</li>
            <li> Almost as good as Jean (Mantiates&#x27; spelling?) \\&quot;Pur\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this since France stopped shipping retail to the US.</li>
            <li> This is a great dry shampoo to use if you don&#x27;t have time to do a full wash and dry, and your hair is looking a little oily or limp. Unlike some of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried, it doesn&#x27;t have color that can come off on clothes or hands, and it isn&#x27;t sticky or hard like hairspray. It really revives hair. If you put too much on it can start to grey hair like baby powder, but a little on the fingers rubbed in at the roots and combed through hair is just perfect.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair like me, you know it can start looking greasy just after getting in a hot car, ick! Meanwhile the ends of your hair are so dry, your hair is flying around your head like you&#x27;re Bill the Cat from Doonesbury Comics. Can&#x27;t a girl catch a break!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well fine haired ladies, HERE&#x27;s your break! Don&#x27;t let the nozzle tip scare you away, simply give the bottle a little shake, like you&#x27;re putting salt on some French fries (mmm, French fries...) After doing this on many sections of hair (while my hair is fine, I seemingly have a LOT of it!), I just rub it in with my finger tips and give it a good brushing to get out any excess. Voila! Not only is your hair awesome the day after a shampoo, this stuff balances out oil accumulation for at least a FEW days! LITERALLY, I can go an entire work week without washing my hair!!!! Since my hair is shoulder length, this is a fantabulous time saver in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m reviewing dry shampoo and you&#x27;re reading about it, I feel compelling to mention my hair color as well. My hair is a dark blonde, any darker and I&#x27;d be a brunette. For the technical ladies out there, my hair is colored a 9N. This seems as though it would be manageable for anyone below a Chestnut Brown, above that and I have no doubt the color of the powder would have a greying affect.</li>
            <li> great product.  I am a very busy mom of three, and some days I find I must go out and don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.  This product adds life and body to your hair and really makes it seem clean.  And more than just an illusion.  I don&#x27;t walk around feeling like I have dirty hair.  Also works great for when I need to squeeze in a work out and rush out of the house too.  Just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I highly recommend it for busy, efficient people. \\&quot;work smarter, not harder!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin blonde hair that gets flat and greasy within 36 hours of being washed.  I hoped this dry shampoo would help keep the oil in control, but it doesn&#x27;t do much at all..  It is difficult to distribute, so it clumps in my scalp and I actually had someone think my hair had bird droppings in it.  I would like a light fragrance to cover the dirty hair smell, but it has nothing.  It&#x27;s expensive, too.</li>
            <li> This was the third product in my search for the perfect dry shampoo, and the search is now over! Product #1 was a spray: pleasant but strong smell, difficult to control how much product was actually coming out, and ran out after about 5 uses. Product #2: only used it once because the smell was too strong and it made me itch. Product #3: Frederic Fekkai to the rescue! It gets rid of my hair&#x27;s \\&quot;day-old smell\\&quot; even though the product is totally unscented, is very easy to control how much you are applying, makes my hair feel clean and NOT dry or powdery. Just be sure to brush it out really well and don&#x27;t over-apply (with any dry shampoo, really.) I have wavy, thick, somewhat dry hair, and usually wash every other day. This stuff allows me to skip one more day, which is an excellent time saver when I wake up late on hair-washing day (darn snooze button). A bit spendy, but seems to last a long time especially compared to the sprays. Totally worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> loved this product.  very little smell which is a plus &amp; really takes the oil out so one can go for another day w/o washing their hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly a dozen dry shampoos, and this one works very well. However, I just can&#x27;t get past the horrible smell of it. I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but a cross between antiseptic and plastic bandages comes to mind. And it lingers. I&#x27;m waiting for my husband to catch a whiff of my hair and ask if I&#x27;ve just sterilized an open wound. It&#x27;s that bad. I use dry shampoo to boost body and freshen my hair, and this one only does the former.  I prefer Oscar Blondi Pronto, or straight up cornstarch that I keep in a shaker with a vanilla bean pod. Cheap and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This product works well, and I appreciate that it&#x27;s natural... It&#x27;s just hard to distribute evenly on your roots sometimes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this dry shampoo but mostly because the one I was using before this one was very superior to this one, I didn&#x27;t like my first one due to the scent so I thought I would just give this a try. I have very think dark brown hair and this powder was near impossible to rub in well and didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as my other product.  I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle I switched back to my original powder until I recently found a spray I LOVE.  I don&#x27;t think this was an all out awful product just not good for my thick brunette hair.</li>
            <li> Love the spout top. Can really get to the roots without getting powder everywhere. Smells good too. Much better than the spray versions of dry shampoo. It does not make my hair stiff and sticky  and smelly like the sprays. Deducted one star because I&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and then was unable to find so I tried other types. The sprays leave your hair so dirty. The powder ones leave your hair clean but still dull looking. Out of all the powders I&amp;#34;ve used this one doesn&#x27;t have a horrible, strong scent and it does a good job. My only complaint is that it stills makes my hair dull.</li>
            <li> I had no idea this product would change my life!  Wow!  I went a month with fresh bright colour because I didn&#x27;t have to wash when I used this great product.</li>
            <li> Sent back, baby powder in hair??????</li>
            <li> This is the first powder dry shampoo that I have used.  I have only purchased sprays in the past.  The smell reminds me of a doctor&#x27;s office.  I really like this product.  A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t wear off as fast as the dry shampoo sprays I have used.  I already bought another bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to be able to review this product but one month on I am still waiting for this product to arrive!! Numerous emails to the company have produced promises to get back to me at once but nothing materializes. Utterly fed up. Ps I had to give one star as the system does not accept anything less.</li>
            <li> I had in the past the spray shampoo so I though give it a try to something different especially after reding good reviews. Well it did not work for me. It was hard to apply and the smell was like having cement powder on your had.</li>
            <li> I am used to using baby powder or spray dry shampoo... this is wayyyyyyy better. Totally worth spending more on. Smells great, without that &amp;#34;HEY I JUST SPRAYED MY HAIR WITH DRY SHAMPOO BECAUSE IT&#x27;S DIRTY&amp;#34; kind of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> As far as this being a quality product it is, hands down, and it would have received 5 starts from me had it not been for one major reality...it&#x27;s faster, simpler and cheaper to just shampoo and condition hair the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; way than use these products...in my humble opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m dealing with hair styling professionally for over 20 years and while I suppose if your stranded on a desert island with no fresh water to bathe our shower this type of product will definitely be a life saver. I&#x27;m just not convinced of its worth varying that scenario.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I little goes a long way and it is difficult to remove excess if you listen to those who&#x27;ve used these types of shampoos before and not follow the package indications.&lt;br /&gt;I listened to advice of younger generation thinking they know what they&#x27;re talking about when they said that fair haired ppl need more of the product to get correct affect. NOT TRUE HERE. Use sparingly, otherwise you&#x27;re going to start looking like you sprinkled baby powder in your hair and its hats to work it through the hair to remove and style. It took much much longer than it would have had I just showered and styled as usual.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, hair came out great. It feels, looks and behaves same way as freshly washed but took me hours to get it there and should have just jumped in the shower! Then asked as usual.</li>
            <li> This really does work well.  It has the texture of talc.  Just squeeze a few spots on the hair, comb through, and it absorbs oil in the hair on days when hair can&#x27;t be washed.  Does not have a scent.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on hair that needs a washing but you don&#x27;t have time. Your hair has more fullness and gloss. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great for the price -- .6 oz more than the Oscar Blandi one. My one gripe is that the first thing I noticed when I pulled it out of the box was the smell. The bottle is like a rubber plastic so I thought it was just that. But when I tried the powder, it also smelled weird! It smelled like rubber/plastic. My friend said it didn&#x27;t smell weird, well, maybe it doesn&#x27;t smell weird but I definitely don&#x27;t think it smells good or fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I also might have noticed that the powder isn&#x27;t as fine as the Oscar Blandi one so it feels more powdery in my hair.</li>
            <li> I saw this on a youtube video, and thought it was worth a try. I still use it from time to time because it was expensive, and I really want to like it. The problem is that the nozzle clumps easily, with the result of powder being unevenly squirted onto my scalp. Also, the white shows up easily on my brown hair. Looks ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Like many of my fellow reviewers, I have been on a quest to find the best dry shampoo. I have been using this dry shampoo for about a month and a half now, and so far, it has been the only one to check all the boxes. Unlike the first few dry shampoos I used, which were shake style, this one squeezes out the small opening in the top. Not only does this allow for accuracy, it makes for a much more secure and clean experience when traveling. The powder mixes well into the root of greasy hair without much fuss. Some of the previous shampoos may have created slightly better volume, but they were a nightmare to blend with my dark brown hair. What I am most pleased with is the amount of product in the bottle. I have gone through a 4 oz. tube of another brand of dry shampoo, and it was gone before the month has passed. It has been about six weeks and I am not even half way through the bottle. (I should note that I use more than the average person. I have thin hair and go about a week between washings.)</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical when I bought this dry shampoo, but I was surprised at its efficacy.  We need it for a trip and thought we&#x27;d try it out first.  It does the job well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell great.  Took  a while to absorb</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used! I did notice a very faint &amp;#34;medical smell&amp;#34; that other people noticed, but it was only for a moment at the time of application. I&#x27;m able to use it multiple days in a row without my hair/scalp feeling grimy.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does what it says it will. Without it, I have to wash my hair every single day. All I need is a little and it saves me the time of washing, drying and straightening my hair again. I especially like using it on Saturday morning, so I can run errands without having to shower first.</li>
            <li> I use this even when my hair isn&#x27;t dirty!</li>
            <li> I hate the chemical laden dry shampoo sprays. This product is PERFECT as it works quickly and does not leave a residue.</li>
    </ol>
