            <li>Give us the full brushes that give us great coverage on all our lashes.   </li>

            <li>Its way more smooth and my lashes look good.</li>
            <li>It smears very easily and you have to apply many coats to get the coverage you would like.  </li>
            <li>this is definitely the best mascara for people with sensitive eyes and/or allergies for the best price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love the applicator.</li>
            <li>but i still love it.. :)</li>
            <li>No clumping or flaking and very easy to wash off, yet it doesn&#x27;t come off all day like some easy to wash offs do.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s easy to wash off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara!!</li>

            <li>Excellent volume without the extreme look.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smell all strong and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itchy</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a really good mascara, and definitely the best I have found given the price point.</li>
            <li>Does not clump, goes on smooth, lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>I thought at first it was super duper amazing..</li>
            <li>So happy to have found it on Amazon;  it&#x27;s easily applied and slightly waterproof - great for all types of activity (except for long days at the beach).  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, I even subscribed to it when it was available on this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara by far</li>
            <li>It is somewhat more natural and it goes on like a dream.</li>
            <li>and I wanted the same kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more suited to those who want to enhance their natural look for daytime wear.</li>
            <li>Frankly, this is the first time I&#x27;ve used mascara with a rubber tip and honestly like it much better than the typical wire / plastic....</li>
            <li>and they were right.  </li>
            <li>Eating healthy is important, but it&#x27;s also crucial to use clean, natural products on your skin and face because it soaks right into your body.</li>
            <li>Gives me a curl and enhances my own long lashes.  </li>
            <li>I have super-sensitive eyes, and this is the first mascara I&#x27;ve found that I can use.  </li>
            <li>But now i remember when you first buy it it makes your eyelashes stick together</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clump hardly at all, won&#x27;t clump at all if you just put on one coat and don&#x27;t go over the same spot twice, makes your lashes soft, not stiff, nice rich color, is truly waterproof, lasts all day, and is the best for my allergies and sensitive eyes by far.</li>
            <li>You can have a great mascara, but if there is a bad mascara wand included, it&#x27;s not going to be a favorite.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t really accentuate my lashes and makes it look that much longer.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>This one is the real deal - truly hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>Some people prefer a more natural look, especially during the day.</li>
            <li>, I usually get brown/black) and I love it!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I have super blonde eye lashes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the only natural mascaras available</li>
            <li>If you have naturally long full lashes (i&#x27;m jealous), then this might be the product for you.</li>
            <li>but all the ones that are even more natural with less chemicals cost THREE times more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>This is water resistant and I was surprised that it stayed on as well as it did, but yet came off when I removed it with make-up remover.</li>
            <li>Keep the lid/wand tightly closed to keep it fresh and moist.</li>
            <li>I liked everything about this product until a teary-eyed moment and black streaks started to run down my face.  </li>
            <li>Pretty dry.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that it does not dry that quickly, but overall I like it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve changed all my skincare, shampoo, soap and lotions to clean products with no chemicals and harsh parabens.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes if I have a long day and don&#x27;t remove it; which doesn&#x27;t happen much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as thick and gooey as other products, so black looks great even on a brunette like me.</li>
            <li>Especially to those with sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I put it on early to give it extra time.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I was tired of my old mascara that would leave blotches on my lashes, and it just left me with a clumpy look most of the time.  </li>
            <li>This is not a dramatic mascara, it&#x27;s for a natural everyday look.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s liquid enough to not make a mess all over your face unless you&#x27;re going for the botched Emo look and the brushes are spaced out enough to coat your lashes evenly - unless you coat it on nice and thick but, that goes back to Mrs. Tammy and her uni-lashes.    </li>
            <li>I let Cover Girl know that I was disappointed to see this go, and they wrote a very nice reply.</li>

            <li> /&gt;-It was not remotely water-resistant and melted off my lashes completely after getting a tiny bit sweaty from being outside less than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I got very black (unusual</li>
            <li> Nothing like sticking something in your eye that resembles a mini toilet brush, ya know?</li>
            <li> The pluses: doesn&#x27;t flake (like my ex&#x27;s), doesn&#x27;t make a mess (like my ex&#x27;s), doesn&#x27;t get all over your face (unlike my ex&#x27;s) and looks incredibly natural (unlike Mrs. Tammy)</li>
            <li> I looks like my lashes are naturally long and noticeable.  </li>
            <li> No clumping, no flakes, but it did take a couple minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> and I have never had anything that covered all the way to the base without making myself look like Tammy Faye Bakker - mmmmm, sexy!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned this mascara took a while to dry</li>
            <li> Since other reviewers mentioned taking longer to dry</li>
            <li> I am so picky when it comes mascara, that I was shocked when I was pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> However, the mascara is always under my eyes after only a few hours of wearing it.</li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no problems wearing it.</li>
            <li> Black is a glamour choice</li>
            <li> made my lashes LESS noticeable than not wearing any mascara&lt;</li>
            <li> Washes off well without leaving a black smear under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> The brush is odd, it is plastic and that is why I gave it a four and not a five, I&#x27;m still getting accustomed to it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> &quot; well its not true.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The &amp;#34;very black&amp;#34; color was actually a weird dark blue-grey that clashed with my natural coloring and the rest of my makeup&lt;br /&gt;-Somehow</li>
            <li> It also has not gotten thick, or clumpy over time, usually after they have been open for a couple of weeks the texture changes, but this one hasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it is slow drying, but if that&#x27;s my biggest problem, I&#x27;m not going to complain.</li>
            <li> So tired of this weird trend of giving us these tiny, short mascara brushes.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it&#x27;s been discontinued, so I bought several.  </li>
            <li> This says water resistant,  I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, but this didn&#x27;t wasn&#x27;t either.  </li>
            <li> For the past 30 years, I gave up wearing any eye makeup at all (but still kept my hopes up that I could some day find a truly \\&quot;wearable\\&quot; brand).</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m going to have to try to find a new one :(</li>
            <li> I am still afraid to leave it on longer than 4-5 hours, but that&#x27;s just because of past problems when trying to use other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> As someone with dark circles already, this is rather unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for thick, fake looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this mascara will hold a curl terribly well, but it won&#x27;t completely straighten your lashes either.</li>
            <li> They cause a clumpy mess, blech.</li>
            <li> which is a little annoying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad it is discontinued</li>
            <li> I was afraid the makeup would be old/dry since it was online</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are awful!</li>
            <li> I have TERRIBLE allergies.</li>

            <li> I have super-sensitive eyes, and this is the first mascara I&#x27;ve found that I can use.  Sadly, it&#x27;s been discontinued, so I bought several.  I just hope I can find an equivalent when they are gone.  I let Cover Girl know that I was disappointed to see this go, and they wrote a very nice reply.</li>
            <li> You can have a great mascara, but if there is a bad mascara wand included, it&#x27;s not going to be a favorite. So tired of this weird trend of giving us these tiny, short mascara brushes. They are awful! They cause a clumpy mess, blech. Give us the full brushes that give us great coverage on all our lashes.   Also, how about some BROWN mascara? Not black-brown - just BROWN. Some people prefer a more natural look, especially during the day. Black is a glamour choice and it&#x27;s great, but a good BROWN would be fantastic for a polished look during the day without looking overdone.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara by far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump. However, it doesn&#x27;t really accentuate my lashes and makes it look that much longer.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I have already run though 3 tubes of it, and yes, I am repurchasing. I love the applicator. it does a good job of giving me good length in my lashes. The formula itself feels a bit on the watery side. It is water resistant, so it doesn&#x27;t move on me during the day, but it also comes off without a fight when you use a basic cleanser. I don&#x27;t think this mascara will hold a curl terribly well, but it won&#x27;t completely straighten your lashes either. Overall, I think this is a really good mascara, and definitely the best I have found given the price point.</li>
            <li> I loved this mascara.  I still can&#x27;t find it in the drug store here so I will keep looking... but it doesn&#x27;t smell all strong and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itchy</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, I even subscribed to it when it was available on this product. However, the mascara is always under my eyes after only a few hours of wearing it. As someone with dark circles already, this is rather unpleasant. Not for me!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find my favorite mascara in stores lately, so I am very glad I found it here! It&#x27;s also cheaper than in stores so I&#x27;d recommend this mascara to anyone!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. Does not clump, goes on smooth, lasts all day. Only complaint is that it is slow drying, but if that&#x27;s my biggest problem, I&#x27;m not going to complain. This will definately be repurchased.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, never clumpy, just enough coverage for every day use. Doesn&#x27;t smudge. This is not a dramatic mascara, it&#x27;s for a natural everyday look. It&#x27;s my staple for work.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara!! It is somewhat more natural and it goes on like a dream. It is very perfect for my lashes and the best I&#x27;ve ever found, up to this point in my life. No clumping or flaking and very easy to wash off, yet it doesn&#x27;t come off all day like some easy to wash offs do. I got very black (unusual, I usually get brown/black) and I love it! Gives me a curl and enhances my own long lashes.  The wand is awesome, you cannot make a mistake, no clumps at all. Keep the lid/wand tightly closed to keep it fresh and moist.</li>
            <li> It is water resistant but I did not care for this mascara one bit. It left my eyelashes wimpy looking even after a second application. If you are looking for a water proof mascara that plumps and/or lengthens your lashes, I would look elsewhere. If you have naturally long full lashes (i&#x27;m jealous), then this might be the product for you.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ever! I&#x27;m so sad it is discontinued, I&#x27;m going to have to try to find a new one :(</li>
            <li> The only reason I purchase this mascara was because it was \\&quot;water resistant\\&quot; well its not true. Other than that it is okay</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of my old mascara that would leave blotches on my lashes, and it just left me with a clumpy look most of the time.  This mascara is awesome though. The bristles do not leave clumps. Its way more smooth and my lashes look good. The only problem is that it does not dry that quickly, but overall I like it!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this in the grocery store, but they stopped selling it.  So happy to have found it on Amazon;  it&#x27;s easily applied and slightly waterproof - great for all types of activity (except for long days at the beach).  I love that it&#x27;s easy to wash off with soap and water.  We&#x27;re very happy with how nicely it applies.</li>
            <li> So I actually bought this same mascara at a walmart but they ran out of it and I wanted the same kind. It has a great formula and it&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li> I looooove it! Works great and washes off easily!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and I wear contacts, this is the only mascara I can wear that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Frankly, this is the first time I&#x27;ve used mascara with a rubber tip and honestly like it much better than the typical wire / plastic.... Nothing like sticking something in your eye that resembles a mini toilet brush, ya know? Ya, no.... Anyways, I have super blonde eye lashes and I have never had anything that covered all the way to the base without making myself look like Tammy Faye Bakker - mmmmm, sexy! Uni-lash! This stuff gets the job done without any eye digging all day (don&#x27;t want to look like Auntie Gertrude with her one runny eye), it&#x27;s liquid enough to not make a mess all over your face unless you&#x27;re going for the botched Emo look and the brushes are spaced out enough to coat your lashes evenly - unless you coat it on nice and thick but, that goes back to Mrs. Tammy and her uni-lashes.    All in all, this stuff is really great! The pluses: doesn&#x27;t flake (like my ex&#x27;s), doesn&#x27;t make a mess (like my ex&#x27;s), doesn&#x27;t get all over your face (unlike my ex&#x27;s) and looks incredibly natural (unlike Mrs. Tammy)</li>
            <li> Why? Let&#x27;s see:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The &amp;#34;very black&amp;#34; color was actually a weird dark blue-grey that clashed with my natural coloring and the rest of my makeup&lt;br /&gt;-Somehow made my lashes LESS noticeable than not wearing any mascara&lt;br /&gt;-It was not remotely water-resistant and melted off my lashes completely after getting a tiny bit sweaty from being outside less than 10 minutes&lt;br /&gt;-... OR SO I THOUGHT! Taking it off later that day required several passes of remover, and a ton of my lashes came off with it!</li>
            <li> this is definitely the best mascara for people with sensitive eyes and/or allergies for the best price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately; I can still tell a big difference with how my eyes feel with or without the mascara on. Maybe ANY mascara would still make my eyes feel a bit itchy by the end of the day. I have TERRIBLE allergies. but all the ones that are even more natural with less chemicals cost THREE times more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clump hardly at all, won&#x27;t clump at all if you just put on one coat and don&#x27;t go over the same spot twice, makes your lashes soft, not stiff, nice rich color, is truly waterproof, lasts all day, and is the best for my allergies and sensitive eyes by far. and I have tried a TON of different mascaras&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Especially to those with sensitive eyes and/or allergies.&lt;br /&gt;would defintily recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Made my eyelashes/eyes itchy!  Pretty dry.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I liked everything about this product until a teary-eyed moment and black streaks started to run down my face.  I only ever buy waterproof mascara just for this reason.  This says water resistant,  I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, but this didn&#x27;t wasn&#x27;t either.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned this mascara took a while to dry and they were right.  It smears very easily and you have to apply many coats to get the coverage you would like.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, but it doesn&#x27;t cover well at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a natural oomph to your eyelashes. Although when applied can be clumpy.</li>
            <li> In my middle 30s I became allergic to mascara.  For several years after that, I tried brand after brand after brand and none worked for me. My eyes would burn, water, itch, etc.  For the past 30 years, I gave up wearing any eye makeup at all (but still kept my hopes up that I could some day find a truly \\&quot;wearable\\&quot; brand). I recently saw this item in \\&quot;First\\&quot; magazine and thought I would try it.  I truly can wear mascara once again!  Whoopee!!!!!  I am still afraid to leave it on longer than 4-5 hours, but that&#x27;s just because of past problems when trying to use other mascaras.  This one is the real deal - truly hypoallergenic. I have had absolutely no problems wearing it.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural alternative for mascara.  Washes off well without leaving a black smear under the eyes.  Enhances my lashes very nicely.</li>
            <li> This mascara is an excellent product! Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for thick, fake looking lashes. It&#x27;s more suited to those who want to enhance their natural look for daytime wear. All I wear is mascara and lip gloss and I&#x27;m good to go. It&#x27;s not as thick and gooey as other products, so black looks great even on a brunette like me. It&#x27;s one of the only natural mascaras available so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve changed all my skincare, shampoo, soap and lotions to clean products with no chemicals and harsh parabens. Eating healthy is important, but it&#x27;s also crucial to use clean, natural products on your skin and face because it soaks right into your body.</li>
            <li> I thought at first it was super duper amazing.. But now i remember when you first buy it it makes your eyelashes stick together which is a little annoying but i still love it.. :)</li>
            <li> I am so picky when it comes mascara, that I was shocked when I was pleased with this one. It was actually given to me, and that is the only reason that I tried it. I always use water-proof mascaras, because I do a lot of on camera work with my job, so I don&#x27;t want smearing, or running. This is water resistant and I was surprised that it stayed on as well as it did, but yet came off when I removed it with make-up remover. The brush is odd, it is plastic and that is why I gave it a four and not a five, I&#x27;m still getting accustomed to it.&lt;br /&gt;Also it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes if I have a long day and don&#x27;t remove it; which doesn&#x27;t happen much. It also has not gotten thick, or clumpy over time, usually after they have been open for a couple of weeks the texture changes, but this one hasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps someone.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have found. The water resistant variety doesn&#x27;t smear yet it cleans up well at the end of the day. Excellent volume without the extreme look.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the makeup would be old/dry since it was online but It&#x27;s great.  I looks like my lashes are naturally long and noticeable.  I wore it at the gym today and it didn&#x27;t run at all! No clumping, no flakes, but it did take a couple minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> Nice mascara, not my all time favorite, but very nice.  Since other reviewers mentioned taking longer to dry I put it on early to give it extra time. So far I like it as an every day mascara and the price is excellent.</li>
