            <li>However, once I measure and if there is a great difference after about 1 month, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll continue buying it!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and even purchased more but this product wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>This tasted good, but it did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>This tasted good.  </li>
            <li>It does taste good</li>
            <li>while the tangerine flavor is good, it wasn&#x27;t as good as  Dr. Oz described.</li>
            <li>One I received the product, it was good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product &amp; will buy a life time supply if my results feel as great as thy</li>
            <li>Good taste but</li>
            <li>This was a good price</li>
            <li>SafSlim is a good way to minimize your belly.  </li>
            <li>A good way to start your weight loss program</li>
            <li>Also tastes good.  </li>
            <li>THEN THAT THE PRODUCT IS GOOD...</li>
            <li>It was a good product.</li>
            <li>The taste is good so is the berry flavor.</li>
            <li>but it is a good product.</li>
            <li>This taste so good.  </li>
            <li>but it does taste good.</li>
            <li>finally a good product that works</li>
            <li>It tasted good.  </li>
            <li>The berry is extremely sweet and the Tangerine seems to taste the best.</li>
            <li>Very satisfying.  </li>
            <li>lol I ask myself that question and realized losing weight and the desire to feel better</li>
            <li>Good luck with your own weight loss!tion</li>
            <li>I am stopping it right now and have not been impressed with this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>After trying this product I have lost a huge amount of respect for Dr. Oz!!</li>
            <li>Way better than taking just another pill!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Nice work  </li>
            <li>Some people who are already on a good healthy regimen, will probably see results faster.  </li>
            <li>two&#x27;s again nicely.  </li>
            <li>UNLESS I really think something is great!</li>
            <li>But now it kind of plateu</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say it helped me lose a pound.</li>
            <li>and they sell you a 4 wk supply...why not just get it over with and put the 6 weeks worth in the bottle and charge us for it!!!</li>
            <li>It tastes good to me, which is great because it it didn&#x27;t I would be loathe to consistently take it.  </li>
            <li>I was very satisfied, and will buy more.</li>
            <li>and I was super happy.  </li>
            <li>i love this! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it tastes very good (though the berry isn&#x27;t quite as nice as the tangerine), and I&#x27;ve had no negative digestive issues.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I see a HUGE difference in my appetite as well as cravings!  </li>
            <li>if you want to try this amazon is the best price by far....</li>
            <li>anything that sounds too good to be true - is too good to be true!</li>
            <li>I have been making more trips to the bathroom, but it&#x27;s been worth it to me!!!</li>
            <li>In any case I&#x27;m happy to see the fat coming from belly first.</li>
            <li>If it seems too good to be true, it is.  </li>
            <li>so am very aware of what I needed to do to keep in good condition.  </li>
            <li>The taste is very good, I take it directly from a tablespoon.</li>
            <li>That is huge for me!</li>
            <li>My belly was MORE bloated after about two weeks.</li>
            <li>Going to order more product and&lt;br /&gt;look</li>
            <li>I notice that it is working more at the top of my abdomen</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now my goal is to get my parents to take it. :)</li>
            <li>I checked the expiration and it was ok</li>
            <li>what most of the folks on here did.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It worked for me and for people I love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a safe and healthy way to reduce belly fat.</li>
            <li>Okay so Safslim is a bit pricey...</li>
            <li>I can feel that my stomach is doing some kind of transformation for the better, so I&#x27;m happy with the product thus far.</li>
            <li>but if you check their website it may be more by now or sold out.</li>
            <li>I hope to try this product one more time since I&#x27;ve take a break from it and see if my body can tolerate it and if not then I&#x27;ll return it to QVC to hopefully get a refund.</li>
            <li>Just love the taste and the results of this product.</li>
            <li>SafSlim to be a great product and the Tangerine Cream Fusion to have a very pleasent taste.</li>
            <li>While the prospect of a flatter belly and losing fat and inches and hopefully some weight is extremely appealing, I was drawn to the product to hopefully decrease my blood sugar levels in addition to the meds that I take.  </li>
            <li>results seem to be better with this product added.</li>
            <li>Amazon was the most affordable.</li>
            <li>and I have a healthy diet.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fitting my size</li>
            <li>I have also started on adding more fruits and grains and veggies.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe if you need to lose more than 30+ pounds it will help but</li>
            <li>The flavor is great, but I have had diarrhea and stomach aches very day since I started it.</li>
            <li>Lost 5 pounds in 9 days :) I love this product.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to be a workout junky like me, but you have to move and attempt to eat better.</li>
            <li>ok, i have been waiting a looooonnnnnnnnggggg time to write this review....</li>
            <li>I went through 1 bottle and hesitated to get another, But I thought that I needed to give it more time.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you in slim fitting dresses I can go without my Spanx!&lt;br</li>
            <li>that to get the most out of it, I had to take it 30-45 mins before I eat lunch and dinner.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>My belly does not feel as swollen when taking SafSlim which makes me feel better in my clothes.</li>
            <li>Have used this product several times over a year, with a couple of months in between, and have gotten excellent results each time.  </li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work by the end of bottle #1, I wont purchase any more.</li>
            <li>but I also added in exercise , eating better and upped my water intake.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad i tried it and continue to use it.</li>
            <li>a walk a bike eat healthy</li>
            <li>wish I would have had better results</li>
            <li>I changed everything I ate and added more Cardio to my workouts.</li>
            <li>On top of that I&#x27;ve been taking a GNC Mega Men&#x27;s Sports Vitamin.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I was also glad to see this in a berry flavor</li>
            <li>Like this product it was okay seemed to work</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>A LOT MORE FOR THE 16 WEEKS ....</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Oz</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, when taken regularly.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more bottles..</li>
            <li>but I have because this product has literally made me lose most of my cravings for sweets and junk food.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find it curbs my appetite or gives me more energy like others have said.</li>
            <li>literally I&#x27;ve gained about 8 pounds most in my stomach and thighs</li>
            <li>so I felt safe in taking it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the taste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway.... Here is a better weight loss trick.</li>
            <li>Dribble over a noontime salad with a sprinkle of your favorite spices.</li>
            <li>I accounted for that the product is an oil and is loaded with calories by more than reducing caloric intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just tried to eat better and exercise during the week when I could.</li>
            <li>She used it more than I did</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more</li>
            <li>but i must say it sure taste</li>
            <li>love the flavor of this one better than the strawberry flavor.  </li>
            <li>but I am satisfied with less.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I purchased the 16 oz tangerine flavored bottle from gnc and have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>But i have noticed a decrease in my belly bulge and I love the taste.  </li>
            <li>But with everything it just aids in losing body fat along with exercise and a healthy diet.</li>
            <li>This product helped a lot as I started eating healthy and 3-5 day exercise.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a safe kick start.  </li>
            <li>and although I love him, he hawks a lot of supplements</li>
            <li>I feel like I have more energy.  </li>
            <li>&amp; i&#x27;m losing more as my pants are looser.  </li>
            <li>so I am very familiar with the taste.  </li>
            <li>This product tastes delicious and it easy to incorporate into daily life.  </li>
            <li>but it tasted pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a very full feeling.  </li>
            <li>It is very sweet which begs the question of added sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I work at a restaurant where fattening lovely nibbles are free for the talking.</li>
            <li>Really like this product, been using it for five months works good taste</li>
            <li>It is rich and creamy and I love the taste.  </li>
            <li>tastes ok no change at all after 16weeks there was no difference taking this product, i wish i had saved my money and used for something more useful</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has some kind of ingredient that gives a lot of energy, but I wasn&#x27;t aware of it.</li>
            <li>, then the lack of interest became more noticeable, although I still ate three meals, I was full faster.  </li>
            <li>First of all, personally, it tastes delicious!</li>
            <li>taste is fine - the tangerine tastes like melted creamcicle.  </li>
            <li>anything aerobic is fine.  </li>
            <li>The taste was fine</li>
            <li>He and his people need to do better research or hold their own clinical trials before they just endorse any old thing!</li>
            <li>Took time however but easy and worth it!</li>
            <li>a plezr dng bzns w/ u, thanks alot A++ fast to ship, great Seller.</li>
            <li>and I have lost about an inch around my waist; my \\&quot;skinny jeans\\&quot; now fit like the jeans I used to save for \\&quot;fat days\\</li>
            <li>I do light walking and some aerobics at home but</li>
            <li>I actually gained weight after stopping it maybe because I was happy to eat without nausea affecting my appetite.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I bought two bottles and</li>
            <li>Only need to lose 2 inches from my waist, otherwise I am in great shape.</li>
            <li>People have to realize that the primary purpose of Safslim is to lose belly fat, not weight.</li>
            <li>So, two days ago, and soon after starting SafSlim, I noticed that my appetite diminished greatly.  </li>
            <li>Just started using it, but the taste is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Clothes fit</li>
            <li>- couldn&#x27;t enjoy the weekend at all -</li>
            <li>I enjoy the taste of it as well.</li>
            <li>but so far so good today.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>First, it tastes pretty good...  </li>
            <li>He explained not to do it in the mornings and that if I ate right after taking it, it would turn more into a digestive aid.</li>
            <li>The taste is great and actually helps with my sweet tooth.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s what made me super happy when I took it initially and didn&#x27;t exercise and lost 15 lbs.  </li>
            <li>but I would say that it is definitely worth a try!  </li>
            <li>As a postmenopausal woman, I&#x27;ve noticed my waist gradually disappearing, so I was excited to find a product that might help me lose inches.</li>
            <li>This works okay at first, perhaps one to 3 months, but eventually, seems to wear off and not working as well.</li>
            <li>These companies get rich by getting celebrities to lie for them.</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>First let me say that I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product so far.</li>
            <li>The product really meets my expectations and has a very good taste as well anit in the will definatly be using it in the future.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product does exactly what it says and tastes great lost 7 pounds fast now steadily losing every week.</li>
            <li>He was right!</li>
            <li>Amazon is a wonderful resource for the hard to find oils, teas and protein powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have a full review.</li>
            <li>i wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it the full 16+ weeks that safslim states it takes for &#x27;optimal results.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>I really think a&amp;#34;1&amp;#34; rating is better because it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL as advertised.</li>
            <li>Safflower is a polyunsaturated oil of which most of us get too much of in ratio to monounsaturated oil.  </li>
            <li>Tasted sweet like Tangerine yogurt maybe.  </li>
            <li>This tastes good, I think I saw results last summer when I used it.  </li>
            <li>I really dont know for sure if the product works.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need to use the product for the full 16 weeks that they recommend to find a weight gain to the tune of 80lbs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had no cravings or desire for any type of sweet or salty snack.</li>
            <li>I find this to be overly sweet,</li>
            <li>I do have to say the taste is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>not bad at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important that eat right and exercise.</li>
            <li>The directions on the bottle are more realistic.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, just be prepared for what could happen when you stop, unless you hope they make it the rest of your life and plan to use it until you die, then afterwards doesnt matter :)</li>
            <li>CLA is good for overall body weightloss and muscle development, however, this product goes right to my stomach and obliques!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But what excites me the most is that it has stopped my sweet cravings completely!  </li>
            <li>I do not crave foods that I normally eat for satisfaction and instead feel like eating healthier foods, which now have become satisfying...</li>
            <li>I  am very satisfied with SafSlim, I started taking it last summer</li>
            <li>Im monitoring my weight and eating healthy normal meals, I will post my loss in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>The taste is pretty good actually.</li>
            <li>However, I am so excited to say that this product is the real deal!  </li>
            <li>We followed the directions exactly!  </li>
            <li>Ok sooooo I usually never ever write reviews,</li>
            <li>Thank you Dr. Oz and Montel  for making us aware of these products!</li>
            <li>the product itself is completely bogus!!!!!</li>
            <li>Great for everyday.</li>
            <li>since taking this i get satisfied and stop eating, which wow i can never stop eating when there is still food left so this is amazing.</li>
            <li>It did reduce my appetite, but for what I paid for it, that just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I saw this on Dr. Oz yesterday and was impressed with the science behind the product.</li>
            <li>I am now 57 years old and have tried EVERYTHING to control gaining more belly fat.....</li>
            <li>I feel my health is worth the price of each bottle</li>
            <li>The product was pricey but would have been worth it - if I had seen ANY results.  </li>
            <li>I tried this because it&#x27;s safe and natural.  </li>
            <li>I am so far a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>I have no intention of spending $50 for two more bottles to complete the 16 weeks.</li>
            <li>So far, I love this product.</li>
            <li>His recommendations are worth nothing, he just needs material for an hour-long show every day.</li>
            <li>I have a way to go, but I am pleased, so far.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I am sedentary due to a disability, but am a vegetarian and consume a low-fat diet.  </li>
            <li>I am due for an A1C test in about a month and am hoping for something good.  </li>
            <li>so I noticed the dirt taste right away.  </li>
            <li>I am in the beginning of menopause and noticed that all my weight has gone right to my belly.</li>
            <li>So right off the bat</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right leakage.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget for ppl that purchased this also a nice little workout will help even if you walk arOund for a little bit good luck:)</li>
            <li>Not that I have all the time in the world for a nice long workout anyway.  </li>
            <li>Flavor is good, just not worth it.</li>
            <li>The taste is ok, kind of thick.</li>
            <li>good, little pricey they need to sell in in bulk and give a discount for bulk</li>
            <li>Last but also huge!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get my order!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3 weeks later</li>
            <li>tried it in the first place if I hadnt seen it on Dr OZ.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost finished with my first bottle, and have had no noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>In an \\&quot;I&#x27;m completely satisfied, not hungry at all, have to almost force myself to eat actual meals\\&quot; way.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have more energy to keep up with my son, and overall I just feel happier!</li>
            <li>I recently joined the gym and was already walking every day, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see drastic results VERY SOON!  </li>
            <li>I am currently adjusting my diet to eat more healthfully.</li>
            <li>It was also the first flavor to sell out.</li>
            <li>Will use this product for an additional 60 days and up date first part of April.</li>
            <li>and my body&#x27;s looking like a fit 20 year old again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lost no inches, but yet I feel more slender around the middle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about taste, so</li>
            <li>I do want to note that I also got rid of junk food in my diet and went back to using my elliptical machine making sure</li>
            <li>I do know from experience that xylotol can cause diarrhea at first, but as your body becomes used to it, that symptom subsides, and I have not had that side-effect.  </li>
            <li>17 weeks to be exact.  </li>
            <li>at first  it did nothing.</li>
            <li>it - exercising daily and watching what I eat (most of the time).&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>I do exercise moderately and I try to eat healthy.</li>
            <li>I used this product exactly as suggested, without a change in diet.  </li>
            <li>I gained 2 pounds after the first month.</li>
            <li>I might be willing to try it again, but overall I was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It is felt, using too many polyunsaturated oils, such as Safflower Oil is a cause of breast cancer.  </li>
            <li>More time will help determine if the results are lasting.</li>
            <li>Consumers be aware that this product might not work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not totally gone, but looks better than before taking the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this because this is the first product that has ever had any effect like this.</li>
            <li>Huh, really?!</li>
            <li>I know my mixture is working because I have done the daily exercise and healthy eating without these supplements with no results.</li>
            <li>First day of use, no problems.  </li>
            <li>and I am willing to order again.</li>
            <li>I love the flavor and can see me using the product in the future.</li>
            <li>Very tasty and curbs your appetite!</li>
            <li>I do recommend if your ready to do a 360 lifestyle change!</li>
            <li>At the end of the first week, I had lost almost 4 lbs.  </li>
            <li>I havent been on it long enough to see any real results but the company shipped it quickly and it does taste pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with this product so far, I have only been taking it a week and a half</li>
            <li>(I am a 50+ woman and losing weight is much harder than it used to be - I am happy with this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Finally, a product that taste good, it&#x27;s only a tablespoon to take and it works!  </li>
            <li>I gained exactly 4 pounds of pure fat since I started drinking this product.  </li>
            <li>At first it did curb my appetite and give me some energy, now not so much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the product and certainly won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the reviews are real either, none of the positive ones are verified buyers.</li>
            <li>And let me tell you at 2 TABLEspoons per day, that bottle goes quick and its not filled to the top when you get it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 3 weeks and have been losing weight steadily!</li>
            <li>The two have really helped me loose more inches than weight in my mid-section.</li>
            <li>I cant really give a review</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t think it would work</li>
            <li>Thanks Montel and Dr. Oz for introducing this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very filling and does not hurt my stomach or give me nausea.</li>
            <li>they said it really isn&#x27;t that much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very filling and does not hurt my stomach or give me nausea.</li>
            <li>they said it really isn&#x27;t that much</li>
            <li>when I reached 35 years of age I noticed that no matter how much I worked out or reduced my caloric intake</li>
            <li>The hype for this product was very over rated.</li>
            <li>, so I really thought this would help incease my chances of losing those 2 inches.</li>
            <li>I hope this is on the up and up, but I notice a lot of these Doctors advertize stuff, so I am wondering if they get paid for promoting this or if it really will work.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 bottles of this and have just gone through one bottle and haven&#x27;t really noticed any change.</li>
            <li>It is very oily and I have to say, the oil must have upset my stomach</li>
            <li>so I am not snacking as much</li>
            <li>TOO MUCH OF AN INGREDIENT IS WHAT I SUPPOSE.</li>
            <li>The taste is really good--like a creamsicle.  </li>
            <li>As for the benefits, I really couldn&#x27;t say.  </li>
            <li>The product has done absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>But for me, well not so much.</li>
            <li>but really didn&#x27;t see results</li>
            <li>so you go through it much faster than you expect to.  </li>
            <li>All my friends were really worried about me</li>
            <li>The science is real.  </li>
            <li>I have also found that I am not eating nearly as much at meals than before.</li>
            <li>but I would say there was some very conscientious discipline goin on too.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t even think about it til I got home and realized I thought nothing about eating.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
            <li>I really didnt lose any weight.  </li>
            <li>I find that I can&#x27;t finish as much of my meals.  </li>
            <li>Why wouldn&#x27;t people just buy safflower oil for $3.99 at Whole Foods?</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li>I take monthly hormone injections until my body goes through normal menopause and the hot flashes cease.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t eat as much.</li>
            <li>good!Time will tell ifit really helps or</li>
            <li>This stuff really does curb your appetite ...</li>
            <li>Before, I would try and try to diet and the scale would not budge, and every night I noticed that my belly would still get very bloated.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s threatened to drink the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Amazon to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury&#x27;s still out on belly fat reduction (I don&#x27;t have much to reduce) but&lt;br /&gt;THERE</li>
            <li>i am a 42yo male who is in good shape and not really overweight but was looking to lose some of the belly-bloat and love-handles that come along with age</li>
            <li>this morning!I feel very positive about my results so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to exercise more (more walking and occasional mini-trampoline workouts), but this has to be helping because I haven&#x27;t made any other major changes.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes that it would work.</li>
            <li>With any new product that you are taking large amounts of, you should always do the research on the pros and cons of the ingredient.    </li>
            <li>But this by far is an amazing miracle my hunger has decrease drastically &amp; my energy feels higher then usual</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the first thing that has ever worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josey&lt;br /&gt;Tequesta, Florida</li>
            <li>not sure how effective since I use fat burners and get b12 shots.</li>
            <li>I have not been on this long enough (only a week), to speak to the weight loss capacity of the product, but with as little (and much more healthful ) food as I&#x27;ve been eating, I can imagine it will be successful.  </li>
            <li>You will get 1000 times more nutritional benefit for half</li>
            <li>I just was amazed to see it for $25 at WF, and see the main ingredient is of course safflower oil, and then walk over to the oil section, and see WF brand safflower at $3.99.</li>
            <li>but clothes did fit loose.  </li>
            <li>If you avoid high glycemic index foods, anyone will lose weight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because of avoiding high glycemic foods and exercise.</li>
            <li>but the price is too high for an iffy product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>sum up, I would Highly recommend trying this product, but give it a month try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m middle aged female and am already in pretty good shape but the accumulating belly fat was making me feel frumpy and old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll lose a little bit of weight but nothing to make you go</li>
            <li>Was expensive at the store and got it at a great price here.</li>
            <li>I turned my 30 year old daughter on to this and the results were extremely fast for her.</li>
            <li>I still have a lot of flabby fat in my mid section but now it&#x27;s pretty much</li>
            <li>The advertisement should be specific and say how many times a day it is taken, how long it is taken before seeing measurable results, and the cost.</li>
            <li>My eating habits are normal with no increase or decrease in intake.</li>
            <li>im a gorger so its normal for me to eat until im in pain.</li>
            <li>then but if that&#x27;s the only price to pay for me losing 9 pounds so far I&#x27;m cool with that.</li>
            <li>I would like to complete the full 6 weeks to see if there are further results before I stop taking it.</li>
            <li>But now that I am in my mid 40&#x27;s, the weight seems to be creeping on even though I exercise 6 days a week (strenght training, and cardio), and eat right.</li>
            <li>and I seem to have a new found calmness.  </li>
            <li>I could live with that</li>
            <li>Hope he can live with his actions.</li>
            <li>I definitely have less urge to eat and overeat, so consequently, I started eating less, being satisfied more easily with less, and the weight started coming off.  </li>
            <li>I talked to a good friend that owns a health food store and he explained to me that I needed at least 3,000mg a day for it to properly work and</li>
            <li>CAN&#x27;T REALLY SAY ABOUT LONG TERM USE, STOPPED USING AFTER FIRST COUPLE DAYS.</li>
            <li>the 1st month I saw very modest change I tracked my stomach arms, thighs and waist.  </li>
            <li>but so far I have had no negative side effects what so ever.  </li>
            <li>The other benefits are a more regular digestive system, and my joint pain is gradually lessening day by</li>
            <li>Another time I took them on the way to the movies with friends and it did not cut my cravings for the usual movie foods I love.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a pretty big deal to me.</li>
            <li>It has totally curbed my cravings for anything sweet, which I constantly fought for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of lazy, so exercise is the last thing on my mind.  </li>
            <li>I have lost almost 10 lbs since January and have definitely noticed my mid section changing shape which started first before much weight loss.  </li>
            <li>I got this with high expectations, what I got was an intimate relationship with my toilet.</li>
            <li>The complete package may have been around $50</li>
            <li>so far.  </li>
            <li>but I am also on weight watchers and following really well.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived earlier than promised, was packaged well, and priced reasonably.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Two thumbs up so far for day two on SafSlim.</li>
            <li>Besides the fact that the price has increased I can not justify buying this product any longer, kinda surprised Dr. Oz had Montel on the show to promote this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started today and so far it does take away cravings.</li>
            <li>Bought two bottles hoping it would work...finished second bottle but don&#x27;t really see any results...</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle as instructed and lost only about three lbs.</li>
            <li>I have not done anything differently as far as exercise</li>
            <li>As with any product I think it is just naturally going to work for some people and not for others.</li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>However I felt compelled to share my experiences so far.</li>
            <li>love,love the Key Lime flavor which is harder to find, but Tangerine is my next favorite.  </li>
            <li>No results after 2 bottles absolutely none wished I could get money back</li>
            <li>I will give it a few more weeks to see if I feel/see a difference as compared to the times when I only changed my eating habits and exercised.</li>
            <li>im almost done with my first bottle and my scale is still reading normal but my clothes feel much looser and what i eat has almost cut in half!</li>
            <li>I bought some regular Safflower capsules and they seem to do the same thing, which is make you go to the bathroom right after you eat...</li>
            <li>I will get back on when my first bottles gone and tell you if am getting a second bottle!</li>
            <li>I have just started using this product and am aware that it states you should give it a few weeks to really see any benefits.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much only ate low fat protien, fruits and veggies (except corn and potatoes), and still saw NO results, not even an 1/8 of an inch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was already in decent shape to begin with and only wanted to lose an inch or so of belly fat.  </li>
            <li>now, in fairness, the product does seem to mainly target overweight, post-menopausal women (the only reason i did not give it 1 star.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not typically one to write a review</li>
            <li>, I did not change my diet so didn&#x27;t particularly eat low glycemic foods...</li>
            <li>A little oily, but not bad.</li>
            <li>If it is I highly recommend you try it again using my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already active and eat right.  </li>
            <li>No extra bathroom breaks than normal.</li>
            <li>Saffron does help tame hunger and overeating and is reputed to help digestion.&lt;br /&gt;SafSlim is simple to take, easy to store and quite tasty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and right now it&#x27;s not worth giving up 2 pts of food for something that hasn&#x27;t even shown a 1/2 inch loss.  </li>
            <li>husband started taking it at the same time I did, but he wants to wait several weeks before measuring his waist again.</li>
            <li>We could not possibly exercise more and we could not possibly eat healthier so please do not  buy this product, it is a waste of money!</li>
            <li>I have only been on this about 4 weeks, and I have noticed less gas and bloat, and feeling full longer.  </li>
            <li>My metabolism has slowed and I have only lost a few pounds but the loose clothing is better than lost pounds.</li>
            <li>In addition, I bought mine on QVC on a hot pick or daily special and paid less than half</li>
            <li>We used 1 bottles per week for both of us and in almost three months we experienced bad results.  </li>
            <li>His show seems to be about his ego, having women scream for him and pretend he&#x27;s sexy, his stupid, over the top illustrations of simple concepts, and supplements supplements supplements.</li>
            <li>yet I found out that it really needs to be taken twice as long as these two bottles would last.  </li>
            <li>I spent much time in the meditation seat, but I was not meditating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 54 year old menopausal woman and prior to this product, I was ALWAYS hungry and/or craving and wanting to binge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely had an appetite since I started taking it.</li>
            <li>We carefully use a measuring spoon, but have yet to get a whole week out of a bottle.</li>
            <li>Montel Williams apparently will sell anything.</li>
            <li>so i weighed myself and barely any change.</li>
            <li>I am a mature female.  </li>
            <li>kind of expensive.......</li>
            <li>Anyway, I took it the first day and felt a slight nausea immediately after swallowing it.</li>
            <li>but after 9-10 weeks with no results, I don&#x27;t think a few more weeks would have helped any.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, and not worth the money!</li>
            <li>You must eat better once you use this to see dramatic results.</li>
            <li>At first, I noticed less interest in eating (psychological??)</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s definitively not long enough to see if it&#x27;s going to do anything.</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t gotten such amazing results, it would be hard to justify buying a bottle a week for the two of us, but with the appetite suppressing qualities and my smaller waist, I&#x27;m going to give it at least 16 weeks.</li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I prefer swimming in the Gulf, but biking, running, walking, jogging are also great.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I didn&#x27;t see any great change in my weight.</li>
            <li> so I know it works great</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste that great, but if you like orange flavors you might.  </li>

            <li> Good luck with your own weight loss!</li>
            <li> However, once I measure and if there is a great difference after about 1 month, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll continue buying it!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and even purchased more but this product wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> This tasted good, but it did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> This tasted good.  </li>
            <li> It does taste good</li>
            <li> while the tangerine flavor is good, it wasn&#x27;t as good as  Dr. Oz described.</li>
            <li> One I received the product, it was good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product &amp; will buy a life time supply if my results feel as great as thy</li>
            <li> Good taste but</li>
            <li> This was a good price</li>
            <li> SafSlim is a good way to minimize your belly.  </li>
            <li> A good way to start your weight loss program</li>
            <li> Also tastes good.  </li>
            <li> THEN THAT THE PRODUCT IS GOOD...</li>
            <li> It was a good product.</li>
            <li> The taste is good so is the berry flavor.</li>
            <li> but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> This taste so good.  </li>
            <li> but it does taste good.</li>
            <li> finally a good product that works</li>
            <li> It tasted good.  </li>
            <li> The berry is extremely sweet and the Tangerine seems to taste the best.</li>
            <li> Very satisfying.  </li>
            <li> lol I ask myself that question and realized losing weight and the desire to feel better</li>
            <li> Good luck with your own weight loss!tion</li>
            <li> I am stopping it right now and have not been impressed with this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> After trying this product I have lost a huge amount of respect for Dr. Oz!!</li>
            <li> Way better than taking just another pill!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Nice work  </li>
            <li> Some people who are already on a good healthy regimen, will probably see results faster.  </li>
            <li> two&#x27;s again nicely.  </li>
            <li> UNLESS I really think something is great!</li>
            <li> But now it kind of plateu</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say it helped me lose a pound.</li>
            <li> and they sell you a 4 wk supply...why not just get it over with and put the 6 weeks worth in the bottle and charge us for it!!!</li>
            <li> It tastes good to me, which is great because it it didn&#x27;t I would be loathe to consistently take it.  </li>
            <li> I was very satisfied, and will buy more.</li>
            <li> and I was super happy.  </li>
            <li> i love this! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it tastes very good (though the berry isn&#x27;t quite as nice as the tangerine), and I&#x27;ve had no negative digestive issues.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I see a HUGE difference in my appetite as well as cravings!  </li>
            <li> if you want to try this amazon is the best price by far....</li>
            <li> anything that sounds too good to be true - is too good to be true!</li>
            <li> I have been making more trips to the bathroom, but it&#x27;s been worth it to me!!!</li>
            <li> In any case I&#x27;m happy to see the fat coming from belly first.</li>
            <li> If it seems too good to be true, it is.  </li>
            <li> so am very aware of what I needed to do to keep in good condition.  </li>
            <li> The taste is very good, I take it directly from a tablespoon.</li>
            <li> That is huge for me!</li>
            <li> My belly was MORE bloated after about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Going to order more product and&lt;br /&gt;look</li>
            <li> I notice that it is working more at the top of my abdomen</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now my goal is to get my parents to take it. :)</li>
            <li> I checked the expiration and it was ok</li>
            <li> what most of the folks on here did.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It worked for me and for people I love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a safe and healthy way to reduce belly fat.</li>
            <li> Okay so Safslim is a bit pricey...</li>
            <li> I can feel that my stomach is doing some kind of transformation for the better, so I&#x27;m happy with the product thus far.</li>
            <li> but if you check their website it may be more by now or sold out.</li>
            <li> I hope to try this product one more time since I&#x27;ve take a break from it and see if my body can tolerate it and if not then I&#x27;ll return it to QVC to hopefully get a refund.</li>
            <li> Just love the taste and the results of this product.</li>
            <li> SafSlim to be a great product and the Tangerine Cream Fusion to have a very pleasent taste.</li>
            <li> While the prospect of a flatter belly and losing fat and inches and hopefully some weight is extremely appealing, I was drawn to the product to hopefully decrease my blood sugar levels in addition to the meds that I take.  </li>
            <li> results seem to be better with this product added.</li>
            <li> Amazon was the most affordable.</li>
            <li> and I have a healthy diet.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fitting my size</li>
            <li> I have also started on adding more fruits and grains and veggies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if you need to lose more than 30+ pounds it will help but</li>
            <li> The flavor is great, but I have had diarrhea and stomach aches very day since I started it.</li>
            <li> Lost 5 pounds in 9 days :) I love this product.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to be a workout junky like me, but you have to move and attempt to eat better.</li>
            <li> ok, i have been waiting a looooonnnnnnnnggggg time to write this review....</li>
            <li> I went through 1 bottle and hesitated to get another, But I thought that I needed to give it more time.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you in slim fitting dresses I can go without my Spanx!&lt;br</li>
            <li> that to get the most out of it, I had to take it 30-45 mins before I eat lunch and dinner.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> My belly does not feel as swollen when taking SafSlim which makes me feel better in my clothes.</li>
            <li> Have used this product several times over a year, with a couple of months in between, and have gotten excellent results each time.  </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work by the end of bottle #1, I wont purchase any more.</li>
            <li> but I also added in exercise , eating better and upped my water intake.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad i tried it and continue to use it.</li>
            <li> a walk a bike eat healthy</li>
            <li> wish I would have had better results</li>
            <li> I changed everything I ate and added more Cardio to my workouts.</li>
            <li> On top of that I&#x27;ve been taking a GNC Mega Men&#x27;s Sports Vitamin.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I was also glad to see this in a berry flavor</li>
            <li> Like this product it was okay seemed to work</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> A LOT MORE FOR THE 16 WEEKS ....</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Oz</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, when taken regularly.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more bottles..</li>
            <li> but I have because this product has literally made me lose most of my cravings for sweets and junk food.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find it curbs my appetite or gives me more energy like others have said.</li>
            <li> literally I&#x27;ve gained about 8 pounds most in my stomach and thighs</li>
            <li> so I felt safe in taking it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the taste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway.... Here is a better weight loss trick.</li>
            <li> Dribble over a noontime salad with a sprinkle of your favorite spices.</li>
            <li> I accounted for that the product is an oil and is loaded with calories by more than reducing caloric intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just tried to eat better and exercise during the week when I could.</li>
            <li> She used it more than I did</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> but i must say it sure taste</li>
            <li> love the flavor of this one better than the strawberry flavor.  </li>
            <li> but I am satisfied with less.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased the 16 oz tangerine flavored bottle from gnc and have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> But i have noticed a decrease in my belly bulge and I love the taste.  </li>
            <li> But with everything it just aids in losing body fat along with exercise and a healthy diet.</li>
            <li> This product helped a lot as I started eating healthy and 3-5 day exercise.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a safe kick start.  </li>
            <li> and although I love him, he hawks a lot of supplements</li>
            <li> I feel like I have more energy.  </li>
            <li> &amp; i&#x27;m losing more as my pants are looser.  </li>
            <li> so I am very familiar with the taste.  </li>
            <li> This product tastes delicious and it easy to incorporate into daily life.  </li>
            <li> but it tasted pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a very full feeling.  </li>
            <li> It is very sweet which begs the question of added sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I work at a restaurant where fattening lovely nibbles are free for the talking.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, been using it for five months works good taste</li>
            <li> It is rich and creamy and I love the taste.  </li>
            <li> tastes ok no change at all after 16weeks there was no difference taking this product, i wish i had saved my money and used for something more useful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has some kind of ingredient that gives a lot of energy, but I wasn&#x27;t aware of it.</li>
            <li> , then the lack of interest became more noticeable, although I still ate three meals, I was full faster.  </li>
            <li> First of all, personally, it tastes delicious!</li>
            <li> taste is fine - the tangerine tastes like melted creamcicle.  </li>
            <li> anything aerobic is fine.  </li>
            <li> The taste was fine</li>
            <li> He and his people need to do better research or hold their own clinical trials before they just endorse any old thing!</li>
            <li> Took time however but easy and worth it!</li>
            <li> a plezr dng bzns w/ u, thanks alot A++ fast to ship, great Seller.</li>
            <li> and I have lost about an inch around my waist; my \\&quot;skinny jeans\\&quot; now fit like the jeans I used to save for \\&quot;fat days\\</li>
            <li> I do light walking and some aerobics at home but</li>
            <li> I actually gained weight after stopping it maybe because I was happy to eat without nausea affecting my appetite.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I bought two bottles and</li>
            <li> Only need to lose 2 inches from my waist, otherwise I am in great shape.</li>
            <li> People have to realize that the primary purpose of Safslim is to lose belly fat, not weight.</li>
            <li> So, two days ago, and soon after starting SafSlim, I noticed that my appetite diminished greatly.  </li>
            <li> Just started using it, but the taste is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Clothes fit</li>
            <li> - couldn&#x27;t enjoy the weekend at all -</li>
            <li> I enjoy the taste of it as well.</li>
            <li> but so far so good today.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> First, it tastes pretty good...  </li>
            <li> He explained not to do it in the mornings and that if I ate right after taking it, it would turn more into a digestive aid.</li>
            <li> The taste is great and actually helps with my sweet tooth.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s what made me super happy when I took it initially and didn&#x27;t exercise and lost 15 lbs.  </li>
            <li> but I would say that it is definitely worth a try!  </li>
            <li> As a postmenopausal woman, I&#x27;ve noticed my waist gradually disappearing, so I was excited to find a product that might help me lose inches.</li>
            <li> This works okay at first, perhaps one to 3 months, but eventually, seems to wear off and not working as well.</li>
            <li> These companies get rich by getting celebrities to lie for them.</li>
            <li> Worth a try!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product so far.</li>
            <li> The product really meets my expectations and has a very good taste as well anit in the will definatly be using it in the future.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product does exactly what it says and tastes great lost 7 pounds fast now steadily losing every week.</li>
            <li> He was right!</li>
            <li> Amazon is a wonderful resource for the hard to find oils, teas and protein powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a full review.</li>
            <li> i wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it the full 16+ weeks that safslim states it takes for &#x27;optimal results.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> I really think a&amp;#34;1&amp;#34; rating is better because it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL as advertised.</li>
            <li> Safflower is a polyunsaturated oil of which most of us get too much of in ratio to monounsaturated oil.  </li>
            <li> Tasted sweet like Tangerine yogurt maybe.  </li>
            <li> This tastes good, I think I saw results last summer when I used it.  </li>
            <li> I really dont know for sure if the product works.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need to use the product for the full 16 weeks that they recommend to find a weight gain to the tune of 80lbs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had no cravings or desire for any type of sweet or salty snack.</li>
            <li> I find this to be overly sweet,</li>
            <li> I do have to say the taste is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> not bad at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important that eat right and exercise.</li>
            <li> The directions on the bottle are more realistic.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, just be prepared for what could happen when you stop, unless you hope they make it the rest of your life and plan to use it until you die, then afterwards doesnt matter :)</li>
            <li> CLA is good for overall body weightloss and muscle development, however, this product goes right to my stomach and obliques!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But what excites me the most is that it has stopped my sweet cravings completely!  </li>
            <li> I do not crave foods that I normally eat for satisfaction and instead feel like eating healthier foods, which now have become satisfying...</li>
            <li> I  am very satisfied with SafSlim, I started taking it last summer</li>
            <li> Im monitoring my weight and eating healthy normal meals, I will post my loss in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The taste is pretty good actually.</li>
            <li> However, I am so excited to say that this product is the real deal!  </li>
            <li> We followed the directions exactly!  </li>
            <li> Ok sooooo I usually never ever write reviews,</li>
            <li> Thank you Dr. Oz and Montel  for making us aware of these products!</li>
            <li> the product itself is completely bogus!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for everyday.</li>
            <li> since taking this i get satisfied and stop eating, which wow i can never stop eating when there is still food left so this is amazing.</li>
            <li> It did reduce my appetite, but for what I paid for it, that just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz yesterday and was impressed with the science behind the product.</li>
            <li> I am now 57 years old and have tried EVERYTHING to control gaining more belly fat.....</li>
            <li> I feel my health is worth the price of each bottle</li>
            <li> The product was pricey but would have been worth it - if I had seen ANY results.  </li>
            <li> I tried this because it&#x27;s safe and natural.  </li>
            <li> I am so far a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> I have no intention of spending $50 for two more bottles to complete the 16 weeks.</li>
            <li> So far, I love this product.</li>
            <li> His recommendations are worth nothing, he just needs material for an hour-long show every day.</li>
            <li> I have a way to go, but I am pleased, so far.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I am sedentary due to a disability, but am a vegetarian and consume a low-fat diet.  </li>
            <li> I am due for an A1C test in about a month and am hoping for something good.  </li>
            <li> so I noticed the dirt taste right away.  </li>
            <li> I am in the beginning of menopause and noticed that all my weight has gone right to my belly.</li>
            <li> So right off the bat</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right leakage.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget for ppl that purchased this also a nice little workout will help even if you walk arOund for a little bit good luck:)</li>
            <li> Not that I have all the time in the world for a nice long workout anyway.  </li>
            <li> Flavor is good, just not worth it.</li>
            <li> The taste is ok, kind of thick.</li>
            <li> good, little pricey they need to sell in in bulk and give a discount for bulk</li>
            <li> Last but also huge!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get my order!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3 weeks later</li>
            <li> tried it in the first place if I hadnt seen it on Dr OZ.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost finished with my first bottle, and have had no noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> In an \\&quot;I&#x27;m completely satisfied, not hungry at all, have to almost force myself to eat actual meals\\&quot; way.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have more energy to keep up with my son, and overall I just feel happier!</li>
            <li> I recently joined the gym and was already walking every day, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see drastic results VERY SOON!  </li>
            <li> I am currently adjusting my diet to eat more healthfully.</li>
            <li> It was also the first flavor to sell out.</li>
            <li> Will use this product for an additional 60 days and up date first part of April.</li>
            <li> and my body&#x27;s looking like a fit 20 year old again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lost no inches, but yet I feel more slender around the middle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about taste, so</li>
            <li> I do want to note that I also got rid of junk food in my diet and went back to using my elliptical machine making sure</li>
            <li> I do know from experience that xylotol can cause diarrhea at first, but as your body becomes used to it, that symptom subsides, and I have not had that side-effect.  </li>
            <li> 17 weeks to be exact.  </li>
            <li> at first  it did nothing.</li>
            <li> it - exercising daily and watching what I eat (most of the time).&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I do exercise moderately and I try to eat healthy.</li>
            <li> I used this product exactly as suggested, without a change in diet.  </li>
            <li> I gained 2 pounds after the first month.</li>
            <li> I might be willing to try it again, but overall I was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> It is felt, using too many polyunsaturated oils, such as Safflower Oil is a cause of breast cancer.  </li>
            <li> More time will help determine if the results are lasting.</li>
            <li> Consumers be aware that this product might not work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not totally gone, but looks better than before taking the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this because this is the first product that has ever had any effect like this.</li>
            <li> Huh, really?!</li>
            <li> I know my mixture is working because I have done the daily exercise and healthy eating without these supplements with no results.</li>
            <li> First day of use, no problems.  </li>
            <li> and I am willing to order again.</li>
            <li> I love the flavor and can see me using the product in the future.</li>
            <li> Very tasty and curbs your appetite!</li>
            <li> I do recommend if your ready to do a 360 lifestyle change!</li>
            <li> At the end of the first week, I had lost almost 4 lbs.  </li>
            <li> I havent been on it long enough to see any real results but the company shipped it quickly and it does taste pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this product so far, I have only been taking it a week and a half</li>
            <li> (I am a 50+ woman and losing weight is much harder than it used to be - I am happy with this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that taste good, it&#x27;s only a tablespoon to take and it works!  </li>
            <li> I gained exactly 4 pounds of pure fat since I started drinking this product.  </li>
            <li> At first it did curb my appetite and give me some energy, now not so much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product and certainly won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the reviews are real either, none of the positive ones are verified buyers.</li>
            <li> And let me tell you at 2 TABLEspoons per day, that bottle goes quick and its not filled to the top when you get it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks and have been losing weight steadily!</li>
            <li> The two have really helped me loose more inches than weight in my mid-section.</li>
            <li> I cant really give a review</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t think it would work</li>
            <li> Thanks Montel and Dr. Oz for introducing this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very filling and does not hurt my stomach or give me nausea.</li>
            <li> they said it really isn&#x27;t that much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very filling and does not hurt my stomach or give me nausea.</li>
            <li> they said it really isn&#x27;t that much</li>
            <li> when I reached 35 years of age I noticed that no matter how much I worked out or reduced my caloric intake</li>
            <li> The hype for this product was very over rated.</li>
            <li> , so I really thought this would help incease my chances of losing those 2 inches.</li>
            <li> I hope this is on the up and up, but I notice a lot of these Doctors advertize stuff, so I am wondering if they get paid for promoting this or if it really will work.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of this and have just gone through one bottle and haven&#x27;t really noticed any change.</li>
            <li> It is very oily and I have to say, the oil must have upset my stomach</li>
            <li> so I am not snacking as much</li>
            <li> TOO MUCH OF AN INGREDIENT IS WHAT I SUPPOSE.</li>
            <li> The taste is really good--like a creamsicle.  </li>
            <li> As for the benefits, I really couldn&#x27;t say.  </li>
            <li> The product has done absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> But for me, well not so much.</li>
            <li> but really didn&#x27;t see results</li>
            <li> so you go through it much faster than you expect to.  </li>
            <li> All my friends were really worried about me</li>
            <li> The science is real.  </li>
            <li> I have also found that I am not eating nearly as much at meals than before.</li>
            <li> but I would say there was some very conscientious discipline goin on too.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t even think about it til I got home and realized I thought nothing about eating.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
            <li> I really didnt lose any weight.  </li>
            <li> I find that I can&#x27;t finish as much of my meals.  </li>
            <li> Why wouldn&#x27;t people just buy safflower oil for $3.99 at Whole Foods?</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li> I take monthly hormone injections until my body goes through normal menopause and the hot flashes cease.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t eat as much.</li>
            <li> good!Time will tell ifit really helps or</li>
            <li> This stuff really does curb your appetite ...</li>
            <li> Before, I would try and try to diet and the scale would not budge, and every night I noticed that my belly would still get very bloated.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s threatened to drink the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Amazon to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury&#x27;s still out on belly fat reduction (I don&#x27;t have much to reduce) but&lt;br /&gt;THERE</li>
            <li> i am a 42yo male who is in good shape and not really overweight but was looking to lose some of the belly-bloat and love-handles that come along with age</li>
            <li> this morning!I feel very positive about my results so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to exercise more (more walking and occasional mini-trampoline workouts), but this has to be helping because I haven&#x27;t made any other major changes.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes that it would work.</li>
            <li> With any new product that you are taking large amounts of, you should always do the research on the pros and cons of the ingredient.    </li>
            <li> But this by far is an amazing miracle my hunger has decrease drastically &amp; my energy feels higher then usual</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the first thing that has ever worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josey&lt;br /&gt;Tequesta, Florida</li>
            <li> not sure how effective since I use fat burners and get b12 shots.</li>
            <li> I have not been on this long enough (only a week), to speak to the weight loss capacity of the product, but with as little (and much more healthful ) food as I&#x27;ve been eating, I can imagine it will be successful.  </li>
            <li> You will get 1000 times more nutritional benefit for half</li>
            <li> I just was amazed to see it for $25 at WF, and see the main ingredient is of course safflower oil, and then walk over to the oil section, and see WF brand safflower at $3.99.</li>
            <li> but clothes did fit loose.  </li>
            <li> If you avoid high glycemic index foods, anyone will lose weight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because of avoiding high glycemic foods and exercise.</li>
            <li> but the price is too high for an iffy product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> sum up, I would Highly recommend trying this product, but give it a month try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m middle aged female and am already in pretty good shape but the accumulating belly fat was making me feel frumpy and old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll lose a little bit of weight but nothing to make you go</li>
            <li> Was expensive at the store and got it at a great price here.</li>
            <li> I turned my 30 year old daughter on to this and the results were extremely fast for her.</li>
            <li> I still have a lot of flabby fat in my mid section but now it&#x27;s pretty much</li>
            <li> The advertisement should be specific and say how many times a day it is taken, how long it is taken before seeing measurable results, and the cost.</li>
            <li> My eating habits are normal with no increase or decrease in intake.</li>
            <li> im a gorger so its normal for me to eat until im in pain.</li>
            <li> then but if that&#x27;s the only price to pay for me losing 9 pounds so far I&#x27;m cool with that.</li>
            <li> I would like to complete the full 6 weeks to see if there are further results before I stop taking it.</li>
            <li> But now that I am in my mid 40&#x27;s, the weight seems to be creeping on even though I exercise 6 days a week (strenght training, and cardio), and eat right.</li>
            <li> and I seem to have a new found calmness.  </li>
            <li> I could live with that</li>
            <li> Hope he can live with his actions.</li>
            <li> I definitely have less urge to eat and overeat, so consequently, I started eating less, being satisfied more easily with less, and the weight started coming off.  </li>
            <li> I talked to a good friend that owns a health food store and he explained to me that I needed at least 3,000mg a day for it to properly work and</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T REALLY SAY ABOUT LONG TERM USE, STOPPED USING AFTER FIRST COUPLE DAYS.</li>
            <li> the 1st month I saw very modest change I tracked my stomach arms, thighs and waist.  </li>
            <li> but so far I have had no negative side effects what so ever.  </li>
            <li> The other benefits are a more regular digestive system, and my joint pain is gradually lessening day by</li>
            <li> Another time I took them on the way to the movies with friends and it did not cut my cravings for the usual movie foods I love.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a pretty big deal to me.</li>
            <li> It has totally curbed my cravings for anything sweet, which I constantly fought for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of lazy, so exercise is the last thing on my mind.  </li>
            <li> I have lost almost 10 lbs since January and have definitely noticed my mid section changing shape which started first before much weight loss.  </li>
            <li> I got this with high expectations, what I got was an intimate relationship with my toilet.</li>
            <li> The complete package may have been around $50</li>
            <li> so far.  </li>
            <li> but I am also on weight watchers and following really well.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier than promised, was packaged well, and priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up so far for day two on SafSlim.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that the price has increased I can not justify buying this product any longer, kinda surprised Dr. Oz had Montel on the show to promote this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started today and so far it does take away cravings.</li>
            <li> Bought two bottles hoping it would work...finished second bottle but don&#x27;t really see any results...</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle as instructed and lost only about three lbs.</li>
            <li> I have not done anything differently as far as exercise</li>
            <li> As with any product I think it is just naturally going to work for some people and not for others.</li>
            <li> I was surprised</li>
            <li> However I felt compelled to share my experiences so far.</li>
            <li> love,love the Key Lime flavor which is harder to find, but Tangerine is my next favorite.  </li>
            <li> No results after 2 bottles absolutely none wished I could get money back</li>
            <li> I will give it a few more weeks to see if I feel/see a difference as compared to the times when I only changed my eating habits and exercised.</li>
            <li> im almost done with my first bottle and my scale is still reading normal but my clothes feel much looser and what i eat has almost cut in half!</li>
            <li> I bought some regular Safflower capsules and they seem to do the same thing, which is make you go to the bathroom right after you eat...</li>
            <li> I will get back on when my first bottles gone and tell you if am getting a second bottle!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product and am aware that it states you should give it a few weeks to really see any benefits.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much only ate low fat protien, fruits and veggies (except corn and potatoes), and still saw NO results, not even an 1/8 of an inch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was already in decent shape to begin with and only wanted to lose an inch or so of belly fat.  </li>
            <li> now, in fairness, the product does seem to mainly target overweight, post-menopausal women (the only reason i did not give it 1 star.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not typically one to write a review</li>
            <li> , I did not change my diet so didn&#x27;t particularly eat low glycemic foods...</li>
            <li> A little oily, but not bad.</li>
            <li> If it is I highly recommend you try it again using my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already active and eat right.  </li>
            <li> No extra bathroom breaks than normal.</li>
            <li> Saffron does help tame hunger and overeating and is reputed to help digestion.&lt;br /&gt;SafSlim is simple to take, easy to store and quite tasty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and right now it&#x27;s not worth giving up 2 pts of food for something that hasn&#x27;t even shown a 1/2 inch loss.  </li>
            <li> husband started taking it at the same time I did, but he wants to wait several weeks before measuring his waist again.</li>
            <li> We could not possibly exercise more and we could not possibly eat healthier so please do not  buy this product, it is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have only been on this about 4 weeks, and I have noticed less gas and bloat, and feeling full longer.  </li>
            <li> My metabolism has slowed and I have only lost a few pounds but the loose clothing is better than lost pounds.</li>
            <li> In addition, I bought mine on QVC on a hot pick or daily special and paid less than half</li>
            <li> We used 1 bottles per week for both of us and in almost three months we experienced bad results.  </li>
            <li> His show seems to be about his ego, having women scream for him and pretend he&#x27;s sexy, his stupid, over the top illustrations of simple concepts, and supplements supplements supplements.</li>
            <li> yet I found out that it really needs to be taken twice as long as these two bottles would last.  </li>
            <li> I spent much time in the meditation seat, but I was not meditating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 54 year old menopausal woman and prior to this product, I was ALWAYS hungry and/or craving and wanting to binge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely had an appetite since I started taking it.</li>
            <li> We carefully use a measuring spoon, but have yet to get a whole week out of a bottle.</li>
            <li> Montel Williams apparently will sell anything.</li>
            <li> so i weighed myself and barely any change.</li>
            <li> I am a mature female.  </li>
            <li> kind of expensive.......</li>
            <li> Anyway, I took it the first day and felt a slight nausea immediately after swallowing it.</li>
            <li> but after 9-10 weeks with no results, I don&#x27;t think a few more weeks would have helped any.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, and not worth the money!</li>
            <li> You must eat better once you use this to see dramatic results.</li>
            <li> At first, I noticed less interest in eating (psychological??)</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s definitively not long enough to see if it&#x27;s going to do anything.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t gotten such amazing results, it would be hard to justify buying a bottle a week for the two of us, but with the appetite suppressing qualities and my smaller waist, I&#x27;m going to give it at least 16 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a 72 year old male of average weight.</li>
            <li> I only gave it three stars, since I haven&#x27;t been on long enough to find out if the weight loss occurs or not, but I&#x27;d have to give it 5 stars for the appetite \\&quot;control\\&quot; (KILLER) alone.</li>
            <li> On QVC they were selling it as a TSV that included a large bottle, a small bottle and a pack of hunger chews.</li>
            <li> 2 of the large bottles were in Tangerine Cream, and I got the 2 small bottles in Berry and Pina Colada.</li>
            <li> I mean what&#x27;s the sense in investing in a product to help you lose weight if your just gonna go back to your lifestyle that got you there in the first place?</li>
            <li> so you know that I have been trying different things for a long time.</li>
            <li> I put a pair of jeans on today that were getting a little tight and they fit like they always did, maybe a slight bit difference.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this unless you like day trips to the toilet.</li>
            <li> b/c if you do the math, at 60 calories per tablespoon twice a day for 16+ weeks, that adds up to approx 14,500 EXTRA calories that you would not normally take in.  </li>
            <li> Taste kind of bad .You</li>
            <li> Be careful... had an enormous allergic reaction took two Benadryl and itchy hands and swollen tongue</li>
            <li> I had purposely waited a few weeks since the show aired as I was hoping to read up on how others were doing with&lt;br /&gt;the product.</li>
            <li> which is something I&#x27;ve wanted to do for a long time/since the birth of my son two years ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for the long review</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for the long review</li>
            <li> It took several weeks longer to get than was orginally expected.</li>
            <li> I find I am not nearly as hungry and</li>
            <li> Gave me stomach problems so didn&#x27;t take it for long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately, I don&#x27;t need that; but I was intrigued by the label warning that&lt;br /&gt;diabetics should be careful that their sugar rating doesn&#x27;t get too low because&lt;</li>
            <li> Product does not live up to expectations.  </li>
            <li> , I was worried that it might have a negative affect on my cholesterol which was borderline high.  </li>
            <li> It did hurt my stomach a bit like other reviewers stated and the nausea and stomach pain was only relieved when I ate half an hour later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked up some of his makeup recommendations on Makeup Alley, like one for dark circles, and the reviews there totally panned the product.</li>
            <li> My purpose for using SafSlim was to loose some belly fat and a couple pounds.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any inches or weight loss due to this product that you couldn&#x27;t do by eating right and getting some exercise.</li>
            <li> There was a very negative article about him and his ego in the New Yorker awhile back.</li>
            <li> letting you guys know that I&#x27;ve also taken Xenadrine in the late 90&#x27;s which absolutely worked and sent me down from a size 10 to a size 4 during the summer</li>
            <li> What seems strange, is I have only lost a few pounds due to the walking.</li>
            <li> It causes a little bit of a discomfort but not enough to make me stop taking it.</li>
            <li> The unopened one is being returned and the contents of the opened one is getting flushed down the toilet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m continuing, it doesn&#x27;t taste bad &amp; I&#x27;ve been able to get it on sale</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;re supposed to take it on an empty stomach.</li>
            <li> It made absolutely no difference in my appetite.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I gave it a try to lose a few extra pounds that are coming off with exercise.  </li>
            <li> but the end result was not as expected.  </li>
            <li> There are absolutely not side effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li> in a few weeks I started to feel smaller in my belly area</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive but worth every penny for now.</li>
            <li> I did not really follow through as directed.</li>
            <li> Deliver before expected time</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> I am curious to see what happens after a month or so.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m 36 and in a short time with minimal exercise (running at the park while my daughter rides her bike a few days a week.)</li>
            <li> Give it a try for few months but really diet too - there is no magic pill!  </li>
            <li> seem to start right away and increase,,,, scary</li>
            <li> , I felt like a little kid again who did not want to take his medicine, but I did finally get it down after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have just recently tried Liporidex which did help increase focus and made my heart race a little less than the others</li>
            <li> I do not recommend SafSlim due to no positive results obtained by me.</li>
            <li> Unable to conrtrol my bowel movements, quick urge and no time to waste.  </li>
            <li> I have also notice a decrease in appetite which I was not aware was even a side effect until&lt;</li>
            <li> In the past I found the time between dinner and bed my most difficult time to stay on track!  </li>
            <li> The hunger chews on the other hand are hit or miss.</li>
            <li> Any other benefits I get from taking this will be like frosting on a cake.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in anything, one way or the other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews where it is advised to mix your SS into some yogurt or a smoothie.  </li>
            <li> No effect one way or the other -</li>
            <li> I was hopeful based on other reviews but it has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for a call, letter or something to see if they are going to send me the other bottle or are they going to credit my charge card with an apology.  </li>
            <li> I walk 3 to five miles 4 times a week along with other exercise and I am watching what I eat.  </li>
            <li> Bought this with two other products.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is the price and it only last for approximately 2wks!</li>
            <li> It does work, my belly fat and other fat reduced from a size 22 to a 16.I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve lost maybe a few pounds and feel a little smaller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no side effects to this product aside from a little loose stool every now and</li>
            <li> I am an active person anyway but have that problem with the belly fat.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m moderately active.  </li>
            <li> Usually after eating dinner about a half hour later I want desert.</li>
            <li> (I could lose 5 - 8 lbs), so getting rid of the fat left after the birth of my son has been hard.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s the product or the diet and exercise, could be all of the above</li>
            <li> And yes i meant to put 5 stars because the product actually works (at least it did for me)</li>
            <li> but I think the cramping could be from ingesting something cold first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to flatten it and no success.</li>
            <li> Thanks Dr. Oz for another one of your useless facts.</li>
            <li> so it worried me that they might have put fillers or something else in here to keep price down.</li>
            <li> If it eventually works to whittle away my waist, I&#x27;ll continue choking it down.  </li>
            <li> and I am down 9 pounds.</li>
            <li> It helps keep the belly fat down even when she was not working out or eat well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking it for a little over a week, but not consistent</li>
            <li> I took the new Xenadrine formula after that which did not work as well as the old one, Hydroxycut and Cellucor D4 thermal shock made my heart race and made me feel sick</li>
            <li> The weight comes off very slowly, but at least it is coming off without much effort at all.  </li>
            <li> , however, it does have an ever so slightly oily taste...</li>
            <li> I read some articles in a couple of women&#x27;s magazines on this subject that Dr Oz wrote or that were written after he did the show that Montel was on.  </li>
            <li> After taking it for two and a half months their was no reduction of belly fat</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month and half</li>
            <li> Wish it would be less.</li>
            <li> is what I think - my belly fat does seem to be less -</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week and a half now and have lost 4 pounds.</li>
            <li> however I do see a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight irritation in my mouth which may be caused by an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> DOUBT THAT IT HAS REDUCED MY INSULIN USE BY NEARLY HALF.  </li>
            <li> The bottle I got from here had a very distinct dirty taste that I&#x27;ve never experienced with any other bottle I&#x27;ve purchased from a store.  </li>
            <li> I have had acid reflux in the past, an ulcer and other digestive issues</li>
            <li> This does seem a little pricey to me.</li>
            <li> It will give you a little stomach pain but that is just on of the side effects.</li>
            <li> I take medication, but was looking for another way to combat weight gain and maybe lose a little too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> I can be starving when I take it, but by the time I sit down to eat, I don&#x27;t feel hungry at all!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> anyway if you are looking to shed a few inches</li>
            <li> A friend of mine swears by green coffee bean extract and carb blocking pills.</li>
            <li> I was out for a few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfair to the people that value his professional opinion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> well, approximately $150 later, i can say unequivocally that this stuff did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> two tablespoons everyday before meals (breakfast and dinner.)</li>
            <li> - you see a difference in a few days.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money ...go for a run</li>
            <li> I have been taking rasberry ketones and apple cider vinegar for about 3 monthes and have lost a few pounds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only taken it for approximately 3wks</li>
            <li> but it actually adds unnecessary calories to your diet.</li>
            <li> Take the $23 you would have wasted on this product and buy some lean protein, fruits &amp; veggies.</li>
            <li> BUT I put on a shirt that was too tight about 6 months ago and now its too LOOSE!!!!!  </li>
            <li> In one week, I lost an inch and a half around my waist!</li>
            <li> I have no strong urges to go to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> For the past few months I added the treadmill to my workout so this may be why i lost some pounds.</li>
            <li> (I do very little).</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m having a hard time with my tummy even with workin out everyday weight watchers &amp; p90x...</li>
            <li> My only problem is that when i stopped taking it all weight and inches came back :(.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product at a supplement store (vs online) and have been using it for over 3 months</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t reduce my appetite, it KILLED it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get 10 minutes past a meal and be hungry again, then have to fight the rest of the night not to give in.  </li>
            <li> Over the past week I have lost about 1.5\\&quot;, but I have also changed my diet.  </li>
            <li> Once again, there is NO magic bullet.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> If you can get past the texture, I think it may work.  </li>
            <li> NOT SURE WHY.</li>
            <li> I did lose about 2 1/2 pounds but am not sure if it was the product.</li>
            <li> I have not loss any weight at this time, but plan to continue the product for the recommend 16 weeks to see if it works, diet small meals,  and incorparating an execise program as part of my life style modification plan.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if product&#x27;s claims are valid...</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> In fact I go as usual with no issues.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of trying to eat healthier by eating more veggies and cutting out bad stuff per meal</li>
            <li> Intense cardio exercise is not a good option for me because I have bad knees.</li>
            <li> I wake up and am hardly hungry.</li>
            <li> but I have been working hard at</li>
            <li> but I cannot give credit for my hard work to thiis product.</li>
            <li> But yesterday I took around 7 pm because I had a late dinner, and I could not sleep.</li>
            <li> The bottle says that you need to be on this for at least 16 weeks, so I have a ways to go.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks nothing has happened but it does say to take at least 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I a least gave it a chance to no avail.</li>
            <li> will give another review once ive been on it for at least the 16 weeks it recommends.</li>
            <li> THIS MADE ME FEEL REALLY WEIRD MENTALLY.</li>
            <li> I thought I at least should have lost something.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve a negative rating&lt;</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s slowly working</li>
            <li> This product works slowly.</li>
            <li> Also the taste is not half bad</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t try anything that is sold to you threw the tv!</li>
            <li> I usually found myself eating sweets and/or craving carbs when I was tired and needed to unwind.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even want to tell you how the experience was in the bathroom the next morning, but the worst part is that after that, I did not lose any weight, I did not have any appetite suppression and I did not have any extra energy.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after I read about what it could do I have such a hard time with weight</li>
            <li> Not sure what the other complaints are talking about with the bad flavor.  </li>
            <li> It is not good tasting at all, I don&#x27;t know if mine was expired or what, but I became very sick in about 45 minutes, it ruined my whole day.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t take this late in the day unless you wanna be up all night!</li>
            <li> Dumb idea.</li>
            <li> I was ready for some nasty tasting stuff</li>
            <li> And not in a \\&quot;jittery, still shaky-hungry but nauseated HydroxyCut\\&quot; way either.  </li>
            <li> I felt Really bloated and just awful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused and IF i do finish this bottle I will NOT be buying it again.</li>
            <li> It def curbs your appetite, but made me feel a little sick stomach.  </li>
            <li> Taking a tablespoon before meals isn&#x27;t hard to remember &amp; since it doesnt taste bad</li>
            <li> It is thick and slimy and it tastes really bad.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m returning the 2 unopened bottles that I received.  </li>
            <li> I always feel guilty about relying on reviews and not taking the time to write one</li>
            <li> I also worried that it would be difficult for me to tolerate taking.</li>
            <li> i was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> This Amazon affiliate may be questionable.</li>
            <li> And in addition to all that, you&#x27;ll be out $23 bucks for this useless stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product and it was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I wont waste my money on anymore of this stupid crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical of products like this and would never&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li> This is a very expensive oil that didn&#x27;t work at all like I was told it would.  </li>
            <li> For starters, this was the nastiest tasting liquid I have ever tried to drink on purpose, that alone made me sick and wanting to throw up</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and would get sick on the stomach.  </li>
            <li> I had to call in sick to work and go see a doctor</li>
            <li> Disappointed, of course.  </li>
            <li> Another product purchased and disappointed.  </li>
            <li> SO annoying.  </li>
            <li> We have all seen results, however, if you are eating nothing but crap and sitting on the damn couch, don&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> but I am VERY disappointed in this endorsement.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s disgusting too.</li>
            <li> That may be the way to go, as taking it &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; is awful.  </li>
            <li> These prod writing horrible reviews are forgetting that you still have to put in the work.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This tasted good, but it did nothing for me.  It did not help me lose any weight.  I won&#x27;t try anymore of it.</li>
            <li> I got this with high expectations, what I got was an intimate relationship with my toilet. I spent much time in the meditation seat, but I was not meditating.</li>
            <li> Be careful... had an enormous allergic reaction took two Benadryl and itchy hands and swollen tongue....i have no none allergies😞seem to start right away and increase,,,, scary</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for one day, so I cannot tell you if it works to reduce belly fat, just yet. What I can tell you is that it tastes great, like an orange julius and that it has reduced my appetite! That, I was not expecting! I will continue to use this product for that alone! I have done research on safflower oil and it has a ton of benefits. The orange flavor makes it easier to take. When I am done with the bottle, I will report back about the belly fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a short time using this product, I can say that it is total bunk. It is just an orange flavored laxative. It did reduce my appetite, but for what I paid for it, that just isn&#x27;t worth it. My belly was MORE bloated after about two weeks. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I tried this liquid concoction trying to lose weight for the holidays. It is not good tasting at all, I don&#x27;t know if mine was expired or what, but I became very sick in about 45 minutes, it ruined my whole day. Do not buy this unless you like day trips to the toilet. I don&#x27;t think the reviews are real either, none of the positive ones are verified buyers.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz yesterday and was impressed with the science behind the product. I&#x27;ve ordered it from the manufacturer&#x27;s site; am giving 5 stars because saw the results shown on the show, and Montel Williams. Can&#x27;t wait to get my order!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3 weeks later and I have lost about an inch around my waist; my \\&quot;skinny jeans\\&quot; now fit like the jeans I used to save for \\&quot;fat days\\&quot; so I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the tangerine flavor (I stir it into yogurt); will probably try the berry when I reorder. I don&#x27;t eat a lot to begin with and I&#x27;m not dramatically overweight (I could lose 5 - 8 lbs), so getting rid of the fat left after the birth of my son has been hard. I&#x27;m trying to exercise more (more walking and occasional mini-trampoline workouts), but this has to be helping because I haven&#x27;t made any other major changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this product so far, I have only been taking it a week and a half but after only 3 days my stomach felt flatter. I&#x27;m middle aged female and am already in pretty good shape but the accumulating belly fat was making me feel frumpy and old.  I&#x27;m very skeptical of products like this and would never&lt;br /&gt;have tried it in the first place if I hadnt seen it on Dr OZ.  I have also notice a decrease in appetite which I was not aware was even a side effect until&lt;br /&gt;I came back and read reviews of others.  I had purposely waited a few weeks since the show aired as I was hoping to read up on how others were doing with&lt;br /&gt;the product. I was concerned with stomach upset taking the product but so far I have had no negative side effects what so ever.  Going to order more product and&lt;br /&gt;look forward to what 16 weeks will bring!</li>
            <li> I have been taking SafSlim for 2 1/2 weeks.  It tastes great.  The girls at work said they could tell it was working.  I myself didn&#x27;t see any difference but I hadn&#x27;t checked.  Out of curiosity I went home and measured.&lt;br /&gt;I have lost 2 1/2 inches!  I notice that it is working more at the top of my abdomen and it&#x27;s slowly working it&#x27;s way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has also curbed my appitite for sweets, and junk food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my goal is to get my parents to take it. :)</li>
            <li> I tried the safslim and I must say it does seem to work. And yes i meant to put 5 stars because the product actually works (at least it did for me) I lost 2 inches on waist and 5 lbs.  My only problem is that when i stopped taking it all weight and inches came back :(. I had to stop b/c at this point in my life I simply cannot afford 24 a bottle. And let me tell you at 2 TABLEspoons per day, that bottle goes quick and its not filled to the top when you get it. My only point is that, I wonder if this had been lets say 6 months of use and then I stopped would the weight then all come back again.  anyway if you are looking to shed a few inches and some lbs I highly recommend this product, just be prepared for what could happen when you stop, unless you hope they make it the rest of your life and plan to use it until you die, then afterwards doesnt matter :)</li>
            <li> Im On my second day. I was ready for some nasty tasting stuff but it taste great!  I cant really give a review but I can say that I had a stomach ache yesterday but so far so good today. No extra bathroom breaks than normal.I bought my at health food store yesterday. I will get back on when my first bottles gone and tell you if am getting a second bottle!</li>
            <li> The write-up in Woman&#x27;s World was so glowing, and well endorsed by Montel and Dr Oz, I just had to try it.  The directions on the bottle are more realistic.  I&#x27;m almost finished with my first bottle, and have had no noticeable results.  Disappointed, of course.  However,it does taste good!</li>
            <li> Taste like a push-up! I have noticed that I am not as hunger since I have been using this product!</li>
            <li> Great taste and it helps. Thanks. Great for everyday. Hoping for great results. Wonderful great an lovely. Nice work  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product at a supplement store (vs online) and have been using it for over 3 months so I am very familiar with the taste.  The bottle I got from here had a very distinct dirty taste that I&#x27;ve never experienced with any other bottle I&#x27;ve purchased from a store.  I actually like the taste of Safslim a lot so I noticed the dirt taste right away.  I checked the expiration and it was ok so it worried me that they might have put fillers or something else in here to keep price down. Needless to say I&#x27;m returning the 2 unopened bottles that I received.  Yuk.</li>
            <li> tastes wonderful, just like an orange &amp;#34;creamsicle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t reduce my appetite, it KILLED it!  And not in a \\&quot;jittery, still shaky-hungry but nauseated HydroxyCut\\&quot; way either.  In an \\&quot;I&#x27;m completely satisfied, not hungry at all, have to almost force myself to eat actual meals\\&quot; way.  I&#x27;m a 54 year old menopausal woman and prior to this product, I was ALWAYS hungry and/or craving and wanting to binge.  I&#x27;d get 10 minutes past a meal and be hungry again, then have to fight the rest of the night not to give in.  SO annoying.  I have not been on this long enough (only a week), to speak to the weight loss capacity of the product, but with as little (and much more healthful ) food as I&#x27;ve been eating, I can imagine it will be successful.  The other benefits are a more regular digestive system, and my joint pain is gradually lessening day by day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it tastes very good (though the berry isn&#x27;t quite as nice as the tangerine), and I&#x27;ve had no negative digestive issues.  In addition, I bought mine on QVC on a hot pick or daily special and paid less than half what most of the folks on here did.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how it does for weight loss.  I only gave it three stars, since I haven&#x27;t been on long enough to find out if the weight loss occurs or not, but I&#x27;d have to give it 5 stars for the appetite \\&quot;control\\&quot; (KILLER) alone.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and can&#x27;t tell much difference. I do have to say the taste is not bad at all. I bought the Tangerine flavor. I put a pair of jeans on today that were getting a little tight and they fit like they always did, maybe a slight bit difference. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. I bought my sister some also and she says the same thing I do.</li>
            <li> I am well into my 3rd week using this product and I am starting to see results of a flatter stomach. Really didn&#x27;t think it would work but b/c Montel was promoting it I took a chance. I still have a lot of flabby fat in my mid section but now it&#x27;s pretty much flabby waist and upper hips - stomach has a noticeable difference especially when I stand sideways in the mirror which is always a sign of what&#x27;s going on to me.  One bottle last about 3 weeks so the 2 bottle order will not get me to the 16 weeks they recommend for results. I can only tell you if you use it twice a day before meals you will see progress in the 3rd week.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It worked for me and for people I love. It&#x27;s a safe and healthy way to reduce belly fat. I saw a difference in my waist size after just two weeks. Remember, this is high-linoleic safflower oil--not the safflower oil you buy at the grocery store. It tastes like a smoothie. Absolutely delicious.</li>
            <li> Okay so Safslim is a bit pricey...especially since a bottle doesn&#x27;t last the entire month!  However, I am so excited to say that this product is the real deal!  I have been using it for several weeks and lost 2 inches in my waist already which is something I&#x27;ve wanted to do for a long time/since the birth of my son two years ago.  But what excites me the most is that it has stopped my sweet cravings completely!  I take a tbsp in the morning (which has reduced my need to snack before lunch), and I take another tbsp before dinner (which has curbed my night time appetite entirely).  In the past I found the time between dinner and bed my most difficult time to stay on track!  I usually found myself eating sweets and/or craving carbs when I was tired and needed to unwind.  However, since starting Safslim my after dinner cravings are non-existent!  I feel like I have more energy to keep up with my son, and overall I just feel happier!</li>
            <li> I ordered the tangerine flavored one from vitaminshoppe.com and I like the taste of it, however, it does have an ever so slightly oily taste...but...err...it is made with safflower oil, so no shocker there!  I&#x27;ve been taking it for almost a week now and I can honestly say I see a HUGE difference in my appetite as well as cravings!  I recently joined the gym and was already walking every day, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see drastic results VERY SOON!  I can feel that my stomach is doing some kind of transformation for the better, so I&#x27;m happy with the product thus far. I will report when I&#x27;m done with it, but I WILL be ordering another bottle before I run out.  Finally, a product that taste good, it&#x27;s only a tablespoon to take and it works!  Thanks Montel and Dr. Oz for introducing this product.  Remember people, it is not a cure all for weight loss, and like anything else, you have to give it time. Some people who are already on a good healthy regimen, will probably see results faster.  Good luck everyone!</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and I have about 25-30 lbs to lose. I am currently adjusting my diet to eat more healthfully. Intense cardio exercise is not a good option for me because I have bad knees. I do light walking and some aerobics at home but not often enough because of pain. On QVC they were selling it as a TSV that included a large bottle, a small bottle and a pack of hunger chews. The complete package may have been around $50 but if you check their website it may be more by now or sold out. I ordered 2 sets because they said it would take about 6 weeks to start seeing results. The creator of SafSlim said her mother lost inches from using it and had the energy that she didn&#x27;t before. She said you would lose inches on your belly and not necessarily weight so don&#x27;t get discouraged looking at the scale not budging. They have a video on QVC as well as different options for ordering. 2 of the large bottles were in Tangerine Cream, and I got the 2 small bottles in Berry and Pina Colada. The berry is extremely sweet and the Tangerine seems to taste the best. It was also the first flavor to sell out. The hunger chews only came in Tangerine I believe. Some reviewers on Qvc say they mix it in their morning yogurt but you&#x27;re supposed to take it on an empty stomach. I don&#x27;t know if they lost weight doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Anyway, I took it the first day and felt a slight nausea immediately after swallowing it. It did hurt my stomach a bit like other reviewers stated and the nausea and stomach pain was only relieved when I ate half an hour later. Because of this I found myself dreading to take it regularly. I didn&#x27;t like starting my morning like this. I think it surpressed my appetite because I was too nauseous to want to eat so eventually after taking it on and off I just stopped. You are supposed to keep it in your fridge once you open it and it is 1 tablespoon 30 minutes before you eat. I actually gained weight after stopping it maybe because I was happy to eat without nausea affecting my appetite. I have had acid reflux in the past, an ulcer and other digestive issues so it could just be my system that is not compatible with this product. I did notice having softer stools with this product as well as some stomach cramping but I think the cramping could be from ingesting something cold first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. The hunger chews on the other hand are hit or miss. They taste like an orange starburst and they do not hurt my stomach. I have taken them when out shopping where I don&#x27;t have time to eat and I find they will cut my hunger until I can get home to eat. Another time I took them on the way to the movies with friends and it did not cut my cravings for the usual movie foods I love. I hope to try this product one more time since I&#x27;ve take a break from it and see if my body can tolerate it and if not then I&#x27;ll return it to QVC to hopefully get a refund. I am in the process of trying to eat healthier by eating more veggies and cutting out bad stuff per meal but I get my biggest cravings and hunger at night time and when I&#x27;m out with friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just letting you guys know that I&#x27;ve also taken Xenadrine in the late 90&#x27;s which absolutely worked and sent me down from a size 10 to a size 4 during the summer but I gained it all back once I stopped it. I took the new Xenadrine formula after that which did not work as well as the old one, Hydroxycut and Cellucor D4 thermal shock made my heart race and made me feel sick (I bought it at GNC but reviewed it on Amazon) and I have just recently tried Liporidex which did help increase focus and made my heart race a little less than the others but it also gave me heartburn. I&#x27;m telling you this so you know that I have been trying different things for a long time. A friend of mine swears by green coffee bean extract and carb blocking pills. I am also taking Reishi mushrooms for immune support which have greatly helped me. A reviewer stated it helped them with appetite reduction but I have not found this. The only thing that has helped me with appetite reduction with no side effect is Chia seeds in water. It&#x27;s very filling and does not hurt my stomach or give me nausea. I bought Nutiva organic chia seed at Vitamin shoppe for $8.99 for 12oz. The white is more expensive but from the chia book I read they said it really isn&#x27;t that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long review but I appreciate when reviewers let me know their background, what they have tried and what has or hasn&#x27;t worked for them so I try to do the same. I hope this helps and I hope to update this review if I give Safslim another try. Good luck with your own weight loss!tion but I have not found this.

            <li> Just love the taste and the results of this product. I have recommended it to a lot of people because it works.</li>
            <li> I have been taking it for about 3 1/2 weeks now and do feel like I&#x27;ve seen some results.  Tastes very good!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product and am aware that it states you should give it a few weeks to really see any benefits.  It tastes good to me, which is great because it it didn&#x27;t I would be loathe to consistently take it.  Over the past week I have lost about 1.5\\&quot;, but I have also changed my diet.  I will give it a few more weeks to see if I feel/see a difference as compared to the times when I only changed my eating habits and exercised.</li>
            <li> After 16 weeks, I lost not a pound, ounce or inch.  To be fair, I am sedentary due to a disability, but am a vegetarian and consume a low-fat diet.  Perhaps I need to restrict my carb intake.  It made absolutely no difference in my appetite.  I feel, if you practice portion control and increase your exercise, you will reduce your weight without adding Safslim.  Once again, there is NO magic bullet.  One last point, I took Carb Intercept along with this product, and once again, I see NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER.</li>
            <li> SafSlim to be a great product and the Tangerine Cream Fusion to have a very pleasent taste. I have been using this for 3 weeks and have lost 12 puonds with out changing my eating or exercise habits, this product does what it claims, which is plesant to find. I would recommend this product to anyone who is in need of losing weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R.E. Gunsallus</li>
            <li> when I reached 35 years of age I noticed that no matter how much I worked out or reduced my caloric intake I was gaining belly fat and could not control nor get rid of it.  Over the years the weight just started to creep up no matter what I did.  This is the truth!  I used to compete in body building competitions so am very aware of what I needed to do to keep in good condition.  I am now 57 years old and have tried EVERYTHING to control gaining more belly fat.....but it&#x27;s like my body had a mind of it&#x27;s own!  I attribute it to menopause, hormonal changes.  Well, I tried SafSlim as one last effort to help this situation.  I AM AMAZED!  I am on my second bottle of Tangerine Cream Fusion and can&#x27;t believe what I am seeing!  My stomach is getting FLATTER! It has totally curbed my cravings for anything sweet, which I constantly fought for years.  Does it work the same for everyone?  I can&#x27;t answer that but I would say that it is definitely worth a try!  I feel my health is worth the price of each bottle and I can&#x27;t wait to see my results after 16 weeks.  This is, by far, the first thing that has ever worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josey&lt;br /&gt;Tequesta, Florida</li>
            <li> I read some articles in a couple of women&#x27;s magazines on this subject that Dr Oz wrote or that were written after he did the show that Montel was on.  I did not see the show but did some research.  I&#x27;m the proverbial never ending dieter, over 50, BBW, going through menopause and diabetic.  While the prospect of a flatter belly and losing fat and inches and hopefully some weight is extremely appealing, I was drawn to the product to hopefully decrease my blood sugar levels in addition to the meds that I take.  I purchased a bottle of each flavor.  Both are tasty - like orange and raspberry sherbert.  I use a cooking measuring tablespoon and take one in the morning before leaving for work and one in the evening when I get home about 30 min or so before dinner.  I do feel like it helps curve my appetite and I seem to have a new found calmness.  I am due for an A1C test in about a month and am hoping for something good.  Any other benefits I get from taking this will be like frosting on a cake.  I&#x27;m not looking for a miracle weight loss product. I will check back after I have my blood test.</li>
            <li> the transaction from the seller was great - no problems whatsoever.  the product itself is completely bogus!!!!! anything that sounds too good to be true - is too good to be true!</li>
            <li> This tasted good.  But it did nothing for me.  Still hungry, no weight lose. The hype for this product was very over rated.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product and it was disappointing.  1.  The product was pricey but would have been worth it - if I had seen ANY results.  2.  Fortunately I bought two bottles and yet I found out that it really needs to be taken twice as long as these two bottles would last.  The advertisement should be specific and say how many times a day it is taken, how long it is taken before seeing measurable results, and the cost.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the other complaints are talking about with the bad flavor.  I started taking this product on 01/09/12.  I have been working out 5 days a week as well as of that date. 2 days week 25 min on ellyptical and 3 days 15 minutes on ellyptical with 3 days of back/mid section work out.  I have lost 11 lbs. so far.  I can notice a difference in my waistline as well.  Will use this product for an additional 60 days and up date first part of April.</li>
            <li> The belly fat is gradually reducing, along with diet if reduced carbs and calories and walking an hour each day....  results seem to be better with this product added.</li>
            <li> I used this product for over 2 months, and saw no results whatsoever. Only need to lose 2 inches from my waist, otherwise I am in great shape. I have always \\&quot;belly fat\\&quot;, and have to struggle to keep my weight in check.  But now that I am in my mid 40&#x27;s, the weight seems to be creeping on even though I exercise 6 days a week (strenght training, and cardio), and eat right. I started this at the same time I went on an elimination diet for 4 weeks(to check for allergies), so I really thought this would help incease my chances of losing those 2 inches. I ate NO processed foods, did not eat ANY grain. Pretty much only ate low fat protien, fruits and veggies (except corn and potatoes), and still saw NO results, not even an 1/8 of an inch.&lt;br /&gt;I know it says 16 weeks, but after 9-10 weeks with no results, I don&#x27;t think a few more weeks would have helped any.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, and not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and even purchased more but this product wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> Started taking Safslim a week ago.  It does taste good but I am also on weight watchers and following really well.  Have been losing on ww but mysteriously after taking Safslim this week had a 2 pound weight gain.  I am stopping it right now and have not been impressed with this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005AY7XZ6 SafSlim- Tangerine Cream Fusion - 16 oz - Liquid]]</li>
            <li> wonderful customer service experience. I was impressed. great product. thank you!</li>
            <li> I am a 72 year old male of average weight. I exercise at a moderate rate 7 days a week(elliptical,running,biking,moderate weight lifting). My purpose for using SafSlim was to loose some belly fat and a couple pounds. After taking it for two and a half months their was no reduction of belly fat and I gained a couple of pounds. My eating habits are normal with no increase or decrease in intake. I do not recommend SafSlim due to no positive results obtained by me.</li>
            <li> I guess everybody&#x27;s body is different because this does not work for me. For some reason it increases my appetite.</li>
            <li> I have only been taking this product for 2 days so I don&#x27;t have a full review. I can say that it does suppress appetite. I&#x27;ve barely had an appetite since I started taking it. It also does make you go to the bathroom, which i don&#x27;t mind. But yesterday I took around 7 pm because I had a late dinner, and I could not sleep. I don&#x27;t know if it has some kind of ingredient that gives a lot of energy, but I wasn&#x27;t aware of it. I gave 4 stars because It does suppress appetite, and to me that means it&#x27;s working. Just don&#x27;t take this late in the day unless you wanna be up all night!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> After only 3 weeks of taking Safslim I have lost 1.5 inches from waist. I am dieting and working out so taht can play a factor in my iches and weight loss. In any case I&#x27;m happy to see the fat coming from belly first.</li>
            <li> I have only been on this about 4 weeks, and I have noticed less gas and bloat, and feeling full longer.  I was out for a few days and I did notice a difference on how my tummy felt.  The bottle says that you need to be on this for at least 16 weeks, so I have a ways to go.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz with Montel and decided to try it! Amazon was the most affordable. Tried for 2 weeks now and have seen results!! Yay! Can&#x27;t wait for the 16 weeks that is recommended!</li>
            <li> I always feel guilty about relying on reviews and not taking the time to write one but now I feel I am obligated to let you know that this product does not work!  I have tried it for 2.5 months and my husband has tried it too.  Both are now complaining that it increased our body fat!  My body fat mass in December 2011 was 56.9 pounds and since I started taking this product it increased to 60.9 pounds.  I gained exactly 4 pounds of pure fat since I started drinking this product.  I lost 1 pound of muscle.  I exercise 4-5 times a week and I have a healthy diet.  My husband and I gave it a try to lose a few extra pounds that are coming off with exercise.  We followed the directions exactly!  I felt an urge to go to the bathroom as soon as I took the product in the morning and occasionally it reduced my appetite but the end result was not as expected.  We used 1 bottles per week for both of us and in almost three months we experienced bad results.  WE GAINED BODY FAT! We could not possibly exercise more and we could not possibly eat healthier so please do not  buy this product, it is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I tried this because it&#x27;s safe and natural.  It also taste great! I keep one at the office and one at home and swallow it with water before meals. It&#x27;s been about six weeks and my stomach&#x27;s flatter then it&#x27;s been since I had my daughter five years ago and I&#x27;m fitting my size two&#x27;s again nicely.  I also started wearing magnetic bracelets and anklets.  Maybe it&#x27;s the combination of the two but I&#x27;m 36 and in a short time with minimal exercise (running at the park while my daughter rides her bike a few days a week.) and my body&#x27;s looking like a fit 20 year old again.&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> After Watching Dr. Oz, I ordered this. while the tangerine flavor is good, it wasn&#x27;t as good as  Dr. Oz described. A little oily, but not bad.I am close to finishing my 1st bottle. I can&#x27;t tell any difference yet. I will continue for the 16 weeks. I am a senior citizen. I walk 20 to 30 minutes a day briskly. I have also started on adding more fruits and grains and veggies. What seems strange, is I have only lost a few pounds due to the walking. Lost no inches, but yet I feel more slender around the middle. I hope this is on the up and up, but I notice a lot of these Doctors advertize stuff, so I am wondering if they get paid for promoting this or if it really will work. It is not a miracle, you have to work at it.  I will be back to update my review as time goes on. This does seem a little pricey to me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks and have been losing weight steadily! Even while eating out!!! I have been making more trips to the bathroom, but it&#x27;s been worth it to me!!! I will keep using it all year and see if I can tell any difference this summer!!!! Excited!!!!!</li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier than promised, was packaged well, and priced reasonably. However, I had no results from using this product.</li>
            <li> Tried this product and I saw no difference whatsoever.  Save your money and just  diet and exercise.  I tried this after watching Dr Oz and Montel.  Dumb idea.</li>
            <li> Did not find the product helpful at all.  If you avoid high glycemic index foods, anyone will lose weight. It&#x27;s not because of safslim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already in decent shape to begin with and only wanted to lose an inch or so of belly fat.  I&#x27;m already active and eat right.  After taking this product for 4 months I can say that it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you need to lose more than 30+ pounds it will help but I doubt it&#x27;s because of safslim.  It&#x27;s because of avoiding high glycemic foods and exercise.</li>
            <li> I think Dr.Oz should stop endorsing products that do not work. It&#x27;s unfair to the people that value his professional opinion. I tried the product and it does not work. Looking at others reviews I am not alone. Shame on you Dr.Oz.</li>
            <li> I started this today. The taste is ok, kind of thick. It taste like berry flavored castor oil. I&#x27;ve been researching this for quite sometime now, so I am hoping this claims to do what it says it will. People have to realize that the primary purpose of Safslim is to lose belly fat, not weight. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll lose a little bit of weight but nothing to make you go WOW. This is suppose to aid you in belly fat reduction. Also is says to take for a minimum of 16 weeks to see results.  I&#x27;ll keep updating my reviews as time passes.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tangerine flavor after seeing the Dr. Oz show with Montel Williams. As a postmenopausal woman, I&#x27;ve noticed my waist gradually disappearing, so I was excited to find a product that might help me lose inches. I was cautiously optimistic, and that has turned into incredulous disbelief. In one week, I lost an inch and a half around my waist! I&#x27;m pretty picky about taste, so I also worried that it would be difficult for me to tolerate taking. Surprisingly, it has a very pleasant taste--almost sherbert like. Another pleasant surprise is that it greatly decreases my appetite. I take it 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner. I can be starving when I take it, but by the time I sit down to eat, I don&#x27;t feel hungry at all! I do want to note that I also got rid of junk food in my diet and went back to using my elliptical machine making sure I got in 10,000 total steps a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband started taking it at the same time I did, but he wants to wait several weeks before measuring his waist again. He also notices that it greatly decreases his appetite. Since two of us are taking this, the bottle should last one week. We carefully use a measuring spoon, but have yet to get a whole week out of a bottle. That&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t understand. A bottle is 16 fluid ounces and there are two tablespoons to an ounce. Therefore it should last one person 16 days and two people 8 days. If I hadn&#x27;t gotten such amazing results, it would be hard to justify buying a bottle a week for the two of us, but with the appetite suppressing qualities and my smaller waist, I&#x27;m going to give it at least 16 weeks.</li>
            <li> Ive been following WW diet and taking the safslim.  After 4 weeks nothing has happened but it does say to take at least 6 weeks but it&#x27;s 2 pts on the WW diet and right now it&#x27;s not worth giving up 2 pts of food for something that hasn&#x27;t even shown a 1/2 inch loss.  I would definitely buy from this dealer again.  It was here lightning fast.&lt;br /&gt;PS  Why is it that the mfg always tells you it takes 6 wks and they sell you a 4 wk supply...why not just get it over with and put the 6 weeks worth in the bottle and charge us for it!!!</li>
            <li> The flavor is great, but I have had diarrhea and stomach aches very day since I started it. If no improvement today I am going to stop it. You can get the CLA in pill form, so will prob end up on that. You have to be dieting and exercising for this to work.</li>
            <li> I found this product at the local health food store and inquired about it.  So, two days ago, and soon after starting SafSlim, I noticed that my appetite diminished greatly.  I do not crave foods that I normally eat for satisfaction and instead feel like eating healthier foods, which now have become satisfying...grapefruit juice, salads, vegetables etc.  I am so far a satisfied customer.  I do know from experience that xylotol can cause diarrhea at first, but as your body becomes used to it, that symptom subsides, and I have not had that side-effect.  Two thumbs up so far for day two on SafSlim.</li>
            <li> One I received the product, it was good. It took several weeks longer to get than was orginally expected. Guess others had to wait as well.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t try anything that is sold to you threw the tv! But I was talking about how I&#x27;ve lost 50 lbs to my grandma but I&#x27;m having a hard time with my tummy even with workin out everyday weight watchers &amp; p90x... But this by far is an amazing miracle my hunger has decrease drastically &amp; my energy feels higher then usual I put this is my smoothies 1 banana Greek yogurt &amp; blueberries with just a teaspoon of the mixed berry saf slim. Delicious!!!! I&#x27;m loving this product &amp; will buy a life time supply if my results feel as great as thy are now. Don&#x27;t forget for ppl that purchased this also a nice little workout will help even if you walk arOund for a little bit good luck:)</li>
            <li> I have been taking this since mid Jan. I am an active person anyway but have that problem with the belly fat. At first it did curb my appetite and give me some energy, now not so much. I have not experienced any inches or weight loss due to this product that you couldn&#x27;t do by eating right and getting some exercise. Besides the fact that the price has increased I can not justify buying this product any longer, kinda surprised Dr. Oz had Montel on the show to promote this product and I fell for it. I a least gave it a chance to no avail. It sounds like it might work for some people, BUT what happens when you stop taking it?????? More $$$$ out of your pocket!!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of this and have just gone through one bottle and haven&#x27;t really noticed any change. I do work out and eat well but I still have approx. 12 lbs to reach my goal weight. I am going to reach my goal then start using the 2nd bottle purchased. It tastes very good. I also recently purchased safflower oil and will probably try and incorporate it with my foods daily as it is approx $20.00 cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for two months @ $50 per month with no results.  I can&#x27;t keep spending this amount of money for something that does not work</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT WITH THE INTENTIONS OF ACTUALLY LOSING FAT AROUND MY MID SECTION.  I GUESS WE SHOULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE EVERYTHING WE READ AND HEAR FROM DR. OZ AND MONTEL.  THE ONLY THING THIS PRODUCT DID FOR ME WAS TO CAUSE STOMACH CRAMPS.  I BOUGHT 2 BOTTLES AND NOW I AM STUCK WITH THEM.</li>
            <li> I figured I would try saf slim as it was not a pill, but a liquid, which was something different. For starters, this was the nastiest tasting liquid I have ever tried to drink on purpose, that alone made me sick and wanting to throw up, I felt like a little kid again who did not want to take his medicine, but I did finally get it down after about 10 minutes. It is very oily and I have to say, the oil must have upset my stomach and I don&#x27;t even want to tell you how the experience was in the bathroom the next morning, but the worst part is that after that, I did not lose any weight, I did not have any appetite suppression and I did not have any extra energy. I will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> Just started using it, but the taste is fantastic.  Hoping it lives up to it&#x27;s claims!</li>
            <li> im almost done with my first bottle and my scale is still reading normal but my clothes feel much looser and what i eat has almost cut in half! im a gorger so its normal for me to eat until im in pain. since taking this i get satisfied and stop eating, which wow i can never stop eating when there is still food left so this is amazing. i got this cause my doctor recommended i should add it to my routine since i am diabetic and this product was designed for it basically. will give another review once ive been on it for at least the 16 weeks it recommends. plus it tastes awesome!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month and half and I do notice a difference in the fat around my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;It is important that eat right and exercise.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now and I have lost 3 pounds. My stomach is smaller. It will give you a little stomach pain but that is just on of the side effects.</li>
            <li> Taste kind of bad .You only get enough for 16 days with 16oz and that&#x27;s definitively not long enough to see if it&#x27;s going to do anything. kind of expensive.......</li>
            <li> If you can get past the texture, I think it may work.  I cannot find anything that it mixes with. It is thick and slimy and it tastes really bad.  I bought some regular Safflower capsules and they seem to do the same thing, which is make you go to the bathroom right after you eat...</li>
            <li> Ok sooooo I usually never ever write reviews, UNLESS I really think something is great! THIS in my opinion is great. First of all, personally, it tastes delicious! Like a tangerine smoothie. Second, I have been taking this for approx a week and I have lost almost 2 pounds and my belly is definitely flatter. I cant tell you enough what this does for my appetite. I am the one who is always starving. I go to bed starving, wake up starving. This totally curbs my hunger. I am definitely NOT as hungry. I wake up and am hardly hungry. My hunger is stabilized throughout the day. Of course I get hungry but never to the point where I am starving and want to binge. For anyone who is unsure about this product, I would say just try it. There are absolutely not side effects whatsoever. I give it an A+!</li>
            <li> Product does not live up to expectations.  Does not assist in any weight loss whatsoever.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. Montel Williams apparently will sell anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started today and so far it does take away cravings. I will keep people updated on what&#x27;s going on.</li>
            <li> OK,been taking safslim for 8 week.  I also got a trainer and started doing a bunch of AB work 5 months ago. BUT I put on a shirt that was too tight about 6 months ago and now its too LOOSE!!!!!  I ordered my 3rd bottle of safslim as I think it definitely helps! The tangerine sort of tastes like an orange julius or a dreamsicle. Definitely recommend. My metabolism has slowed and I have only lost a few pounds but the loose clothing is better than lost pounds. WOO HOO</li>
            <li> Lost 5 pounds in 9 days :) I love this product. Wish it would be less. but going to buy Safflower oil I found at the grocery store that is working as well.</li>
            <li> I have been taking safslim for 3 weeks so have 2 of my friends that don&#x27;t exercise.  We have all seen results, however, if you are eating nothing but crap and sitting on the damn couch, don&#x27;t complain.  It does work if you work with it.  You don&#x27;t have to be a workout junky like me, but you have to move and attempt to eat better.</li>
            <li> ok, i have been waiting a looooonnnnnnnnggggg time to write this review....17 weeks to be exact.  just finished my last bottle this morning. i wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it the full 16+ weeks that safslim states it takes for &#x27;optimal results.&#x27;  some background on me...i am a 42yo male who is in good shape and not really overweight but was looking to lose some of the belly-bloat and love-handles that come along with age and/or the winter months.  i, like a lot of people posting here, saw this on Dr. Oz back in the beginning of january where Montel Williams gushed over this stuff.  i thought, hey, if Dr. Oz and Montel are hyping it let me give it a try.  well, approximately $150 later, i can say unequivocally that this stuff did nothing for me.  in fact, it might have even made me fatter b/c if you do the math, at 60 calories per tablespoon twice a day for 16+ weeks, that adds up to approx 14,500 EXTRA calories that you would not normally take in.  now, in fairness, the product does seem to mainly target overweight, post-menopausal women (the only reason i did not give it 1 star.)  but with the way montel said it worked for him i thought it could work for my demographic as well.  i was wrong.  and for the record, i followed the program that they recommended to the T...two tablespoons everyday before meals (breakfast and dinner.)</li>
            <li> I am in the beginning of menopause and noticed that all my weight has gone right to my belly. I have tried everything to flatten it and no success. So I saw this product at the health food store and thought I would give it a try. at first  it did nothing. I went through 1 bottle and hesitated to get another, But I thought that I needed to give it more time. in a few weeks I started to feel smaller in my belly area so i weighed myself and barely any change. Then I measured my belly area and I lost 2 inches. It is finally starting to work. I can&#x27;t wait too see where I am at 16 weeks. give it a try and see, you just can&#x27;t expect instant loss of inches..</li>
            <li> I have been taking this supplement for several months.  My total weight loss is about 12 pounds but I have been working hard at it - exercising daily and watching what I eat (most of the time).&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I think - my belly fat does seem to be less - I did not measure so I cannot report inchese but I can tell you in slim fitting dresses I can go without my Spanx!&lt;br /&gt;It definitely curbs the appetite if you take it 1/2 hour before meals and also drink something (water, tea, diet drink).  I find I am not nearly as hungry and a sensible dinner suffices.&lt;br /&gt;My cholesterol has dropped 40 pts - yep, I was worried that it might have a negative affect on my cholesterol which was borderline high.  So whether it is the supplement or the fact that it curbs hunger so I am not snacking as much - I do not care - my cholesterol dropped 40 pts - woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;The taste is fine - the tangerine tastes like melted creamcicle.  I buy it on Amazon for 24.99 a bottle.  Give it a try for few months but really diet too - there is no magic pill!  This helped keep my on my diet. (I am a 50+ woman and losing weight is much harder than it used to be - I am happy with this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been on Saf Slim for 3 months now. I have lost 18 lbs. and 4 inches. I talked to a good friend that owns a health food store and he explained to me that I needed at least 3,000mg a day for it to properly work and that to get the most out of it, I had to take it 30-45 mins before I eat lunch and dinner. He explained not to do it in the mornings and that if I ate right after taking it, it would turn more into a digestive aid. He was right! Glad I talked to him before taking it. I do exercise moderately and I try to eat healthy. Otherwise, I haven&#x27;t changed my diet or lifestyle. I will continue to take Saf Slim. It is a bit expensive but worth every penny for now.</li>
            <li> This is a very expensive oil that didn&#x27;t work at all like I was told it would.  I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I really think a&amp;#34;1&amp;#34; rating is better because it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL as advertised. The 2 is because I loved the flavor!</li>
            <li> This product works slowly. It has to be taken daily.</li>
            <li> After trying this product I have lost a huge amount of respect for Dr. Oz!! It seems he is all about making money and people trusting his name will by products he endorses. I think he is a phony as well as this product!</li>
            <li> Only been using 2 months. Recommended usage is 4. Good taste but not sure how effective since I use fat burners and get b12 shots.</li>
            <li> Saffron does help tame hunger and overeating and is reputed to help digestion.&lt;br /&gt;SafSlim is simple to take, easy to store and quite tasty.&lt;br /&gt;I linke Tangerine flavor best.</li>
            <li> My belly does not feel as swollen when taking SafSlim which makes me feel better in my clothes. Try it!</li>
            <li> Great product. I recommend it  for belly fat loss (+ exercise) over a period of time;&lt;br /&gt;tangerine tastes the best to me.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, been using it for five months works good taste good, little pricey they need to sell in in bulk and give a discount for bulk</li>
            <li> THIS MADE ME FEEL REALLY WEIRD MENTALLY. NOT SURE WHY. TOO MUCH OF AN INGREDIENT IS WHAT I SUPPOSE. CAN&#x27;T REALLY SAY ABOUT LONG TERM USE, STOPPED USING AFTER FIRST COUPLE DAYS.</li>
            <li> This was a good price so I tried it.  The taste is really good--like a creamsicle.  As for the benefits, I really couldn&#x27;t say.  I didn&#x27;t notice any change in anything, one way or the other.  Maybe if it is taken for months there might be some result but I won&#x27;t spend the money on it again.</li>
            <li> I got no results after using this product.  I followed the directions and would get sick on the stomach.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Have used this product several times over a year, with a couple of months in between, and have gotten excellent results each time.  you must include a workout along with taking it for maximum benefits...anything aerobic is fine.  I prefer swimming in the Gulf, but biking, running, walking, jogging are also great.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I was diagnosed w/ PCOS, which makes me insulin resistant.  I take medication, but was looking for another way to combat weight gain and maybe lose a little too.  I&#x27;ve only been using SS for about a week; I&#x27;ve seen no changes/reductions in my mid section as of yet.  If there&#x27;s a breakthrough later on, I&#x27;ll update this review.  I can, however, comment on the taste.  The &amp;#34;tangerine cream&amp;#34; taste comes through, but it doesn&#x27;t cover up the overpowering flavor of the safflower oil.  It&#x27;s like drinking cooking oil.  Gross.  It also leaves an oily film in your mouth and throat.  That&#x27;s disgusting too. I dread taking it, but I&#x27;m going to stick w/ it until the bottle is gone.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews where it is advised to mix your SS into some yogurt or a smoothie.  That may be the way to go, as taking it &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; is awful.  If it eventually works to whittle away my waist, I&#x27;ll continue choking it down.  If it doesn&#x27;t work by the end of bottle #1, I wont purchase any more.</li>
            <li> If it seems too good to be true, it is.  I used this product exactly as suggested, without a change in diet.  I gained 2 pounds after the first month.</li>
            <li> Combined with diet and exercise, I found that after only 3 weeks it was reducing the size of my waist.  I was very satisfied, and will buy more.</li>
            <li> I got this product after watching Montel talk about it on the Dr Oz show. I have been using product for 19 days now and notice it does suppress my appetite and has helpped with belly bulge. This is no miracle weightloss solution in my opinion but it does help assist in weightloss. I still feel a nutritious meal plan and exercise is key. With that said this has helped me aid my weightloss. I have lost 9 pounds but I also added in exercise , eating better and upped my water intake. Hope my opinion answers some questions you have.</li>
            <li> No effect one way or the other - but it tasted pretty good.  Wonder what Dr Oz saw in it???</li>
            <li> SafSlim is a good way to minimize your belly.  I think it speeds up your digesting so that the food doesn&#x27;t stay in your intestines - causing a big belly.  A good way to start your weight loss program - you see a difference in a few days.  The flavor of the liquid tastes like a creamcycle....not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my stomach after using the entire bottle. However, this stuff tastes like an orange dreamcicle and I probably could have eaten the entire bottle in one sitting (hence the reason I needed this to work). I might be willing to try it again, but overall I was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Tastes like an ice cream bar--best part. Otherwise, I didn&#x27;t see any great change in my weight. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I noticed in time that a lot of my rolls were shrinking.  Clothes fit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also no side affects to worry about, as I am diabetic and there is no sugar in it.  Would an do recommend it to asks me how I did it .  I really love this product.</li>
            <li> helps cut my appetite and has was recommended to me by a doctor.</li>
            <li> [...]    There are polyunsaturated oils and monounsaturated oils.  Safflower is a polyunsaturated oil of which most of us get too much of in ratio to monounsaturated oil.  It is felt, using too many polyunsaturated oils, such as Safflower Oil is a cause of breast cancer.  With any new product that you are taking large amounts of, you should always do the research on the pros and cons of the ingredient.    Darlena  Nutritional Consultant</li>
            <li> a plezr dng bzns w/ u, thanks alot A++ fast to ship, great Seller. safslim, has the omega 6 that helps to reduce belly fat. endorsed by montel williams on the Dr. Oz show. i&#x27;m glad i tried it and continue to use it.</li>
            <li> i bought this stuff to help with curbing my appetite. This is a rip off. Thanks Dr. Oz for another one of your useless facts. I wont waste my money on anymore of this stupid crap.</li>
            <li> joke... don&#x27;t waste your money ...go for a run a walk a bike eat healthy</li>
            <li> Bought two bottles hoping it would work...finished second bottle but don&#x27;t really see any results...took as directed....if you want to try this amazon is the best price by far....taste is also very good....wish I would have had better results</li>
            <li> I have used this product before so I know it works great but the taste of this one is not the best. Personally I prefer the Tangerine flavored one.</li>
            <li> Listen, Ipurchased a bottle of this 1 month ago and I am down 9 pounds. I changed everything I ate and added more Cardio to my workouts. On top of that I&#x27;ve been taking a GNC Mega Men&#x27;s Sports Vitamin. As with all products you have to change you lifestyle also. You can&#x27;t just take the product and continue doing what you were doing before. Isn&#x27;t that the reason we are in this predicament because of the things we use to eat and the exercising we didn&#x27;t do. Its a package deal. These prod writing horrible reviews are forgetting that you still have to put in the work. Saf Slim is just a dietary aid. What makes it truly work is what we do that follows those 2 spoonfuls. I&#x27;ve had no side effects to this product aside from a little loose stool every now and then but if that&#x27;s the only price to pay for me losing 9 pounds so far I&#x27;m cool with that. Try it, its only 20 dollars. If it doesn&#x27;t work try something else but don&#x27;t ruin it for those who put their faith in it.</li>
            <li> This product tastes okay but it bloats me and binds my system. I really had high hopes that it would work. I just threw away $20++</li>
            <li> First let me say that I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product so far. I&#x27;ve been taking it for a little over a week, but not consistent but it tastes so YUMMY! I can take it alone or mix it with my morning vanilla yogurt. OMGosh its so good! I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my tummy yet, but definitely a difference in my desire to eat. YAY!</li>
            <li> It is rich and creamy and I love the taste.  I found that my stomach was firmer when I exercised and dieted.  I shopped around and found that Amazon had the cheapest price for this item.  I was also glad to see this in a berry flavor so I bought one of each.</li>
            <li> I havent been on it long enough to see any real results but the company shipped it quickly and it does taste pretty good.</li>
            <li> She loves the taste. I believe it is helping her keep trim. More time will help determine if the results are lasting.</li>
            <li> Tasted sweet like Tangerine yogurt maybe.  I used the whole bottle as instructed and lost only about three lbs. but clothes did fit loose.  I only bought one bottle and didn&#x27;t continue.  I was hoping to have more drastic weight loss for such an expensive product.</li>
            <li> This works okay at first, perhaps one to 3 months, but eventually, seems to wear off and not working as well. It&#x27;s a start but the price is too high for an iffy product.</li>
            <li> Not convinced it works for weightless, but it tastes yummy!</li>
            <li> I cannot say that i notice a difference</li>
            <li> I been trying for over a year to get rid of my belly fat and I bought this and put it in my breakfast smoothies and dinner drink since its twice a day. I did my 30 min workout and watched what I ate and after about 2-3 weeks I measured my belly not any inches lose form this product. So please reconsider.</li>
            <li> tastes ok no change at all after 16weeks there was no difference taking this product, i wish i had saved my money and used for something more useful</li>
            <li> I did post this elsewhere, but here it is again. I weigh about 147 and am a bit muscular. I workout four times per week but I have some belly fat which I have been trying to get rid of. Thought this product would help since I saw some rave reviews. My belly measures about 34\\&quot; and after using the product faithfully for 12 weeks my belly still measures 34\\&quot;. The product has done absolutely nothing for me. I have no intention of spending $50 for two more bottles to complete the 16 weeks. I did lose about 2 1/2 pounds but am not sure if it was the product. For the past few months I added the treadmill to my workout so this may be why i lost some pounds. There is no guarantee this product will work and customer service gave me no answer why. Well I tried. Consumers be aware that this product might not work.</li>
            <li> Actually works well for men. But for me, well not so much. Also tastes good.  It curbs your appetite. Just don&#x27;t care for the price.</li>
            <li> Another product purchased and disappointed.  It doesn&#x27;t taste that great, but if you like orange flavors you might.  I did not really follow through as directed.</li>
            <li> Like this product it was okay seemed to work</li>
            <li> Okay but really didn&#x27;t see results</li>
            <li> The product does not contain the number of servings that the label claims to have so you go through it much faster than you expect to.  After using 4 bottles and seeing no results I decided this is not a product for me.  I would not recommend this product for weight loss at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 months and have not noticed any changes whatsoever.  I was hopeful based on other reviews but it has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this item yet.  However, I ordered two bottles but only received one.  I called the customer service line and was told they would verify my allegations with the warehouse.  I&#x27;m still waiting for a call, letter or something to see if they are going to send me the other bottle or are they going to credit my charge card with an apology.  This Amazon affiliate may be questionable.</li>
            <li> I have not loss any weight at this time, but plan to continue the product for the recommend 16 weeks to see if it works, diet small meals,  and incorparating an execise program as part of my life style modification plan.  The taste is oily and leaves after taste in your mouth so I just eat a tic tac candy.  Therefore, I will write an updated review on the SafSlim-Tangerine Cream Fusion 16 oz Liquid.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IN ITS DAILY AMOUNT DOSES X AMOUNT IT SAYS OR IN THE 16OZ BOTTLE ARE NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!&lt;br /&gt;OTHER THEN THAT THE PRODUCT IS GOOD...JUST ORDER A LOT MORE FOR THE 16 WEEKS ....</li>
            <li> I think it has been about 6 weeks, give or take, since I have been using this product.  Since I exercise on a regular basis, this was also factored into my progress with SafSlim.  I do see a definite difference in the fat around my middle.  It&#x27;s not totally gone, but looks better than before taking the product.  All in all, i am going to continue on the plan and see what happens.  Also the taste is not half bad</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for 9 days and a couple of days ago - my stomach started to cramp up. I felt Really bloated and just awful - couldn&#x27;t enjoy the weekend at all - because I had this upset stomach. No changes to my diet. Today (Monday) I had to call in sick to work and go see a doctor the pain was so nauseating. Told him what I last ate on thursday - which was granola in the morning along with a tablespoon of this and then a turkey burger for lunch along with this product. He immediately told me to stop taking it as it was the cause of all my problems. My suggestion to you would be not to buy. I love Dr. Oz but I am VERY disappointed in this endorsement. He and his people need to do better research or hold their own clinical trials before they just endorse any old thing! All my friends were really worried about me and I had to lose a day of work and now have a hospitable to pay for. Jeeza! Just stay away!</li>
            <li> This product tastes delicious and it easy to incorporate into daily life.  Way better than taking just another pill!  The science is real.  It just takes time.  I eat well and exercise regularly anyway.  This gave me extra push and \\&quot;treat\\&quot;.  Lost 2 inches on waist!  Took time however but easy and worth it!</li>
            <li> So far, I love this product. I&#x27;ve been taking it for about a month now, and I have already seen results</li>
            <li> Safslim taste great, like a orange smoothie.  Don&#x27;t know if its working yet.  I walk 3 to five miles 4 times a week along with other exercise and I am watching what I eat.  I hope I see some change by the end of October.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, when taken regularly. I am almost done with my 1st bottle, and while I do not weigh myself on a scale, the tightening of my belt notches tells me a lot. CLA is good for overall body weightloss and muscle development, however, this product goes right to my stomach and obliques!&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say that it curbes my desire for sweets and that says a lot- as I am a chocoholic. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This tastes good, I think I saw results last summer when I used it.  I hope I see results soon.  I just ordered two more bottles..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week and a half now and have lost 4 pounds. I have not done anything differently as far as exercise (I do very little). I would say I haven&#x27;t changed my eating habits but I have because this product has literally made me lose most of my cravings for sweets and junk food. I have also found that I am not eating nearly as much at meals than before. I take it twice a day. Sometimes before breakfast and before dinner and sometimes before lunch and then before dinner. I&#x27;m writing this because this is the first product that has ever had any effect like this. I&#x27;m not typically one to write a review so for me to be writing tells you I am IMPRESSED. As with any product I think it is just naturally going to work for some people and not for others. But if you don&#x27;t try it you won&#x27;t know if it works for you or not. So if you are skeptical I would suggest trying it because what is $29.95 in comparison to feeling better about yourself? As for me I am a believer. I will try to remember to post again in about a month to report my progress.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product. At the time I had not heard of it. After trying it and truly (and believe me, coming from a food addict) I was amazed how I was not preoccupied by food cravings.  So at 20 some bucks I decided to order a bottle. Day one, 1 tbsp. at breakfast...blah yeah okay but I would say there was some very conscientious discipline goin on too. Day two 1 tbsp at breakfast one at lunch. Huh, really?! I work at a restaurant where fattening lovely nibbles are free for the talking. I really didn&#x27;t even think about it til I got home and realized I thought nothing about eating. I dunno if its SafSlim, but that&#x27;s a pretty big deal to me. I will keep everyone posted.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see much of a difference so ended up just buying this one bottle. The taste is pretty good actually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month now and I&#x27;ve lost maybe a few pounds and feel a little smaller but it&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s the product or the diet and exercise, could be all of the above but I don&#x27;t find it curbs my appetite or gives me more energy like others have said.</li>
            <li> I so it in TV. Was expensive at the store and got it at a great price here. Deliver before expected time</li>
            <li> I  am very satisfied with SafSlim, I started taking it last summer and I have lost and kept off 6 inches mid  stomach area.</li>
            <li> Bought this with two other products.  One product caused me to break out in a rash.  Didn&#x27;t know which one, so stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lot&#x27;s of products but this one seems to be working.  SafSlim tastes like a orange creme ice-cream pop.  Very satisfying.  I&#x27;m getting back into my clothes.  Try it-&#x3D; what do you have to loose--Belly Fat.</li>
            <li> The product really meets my expectations and has a very good taste as well anit in the will definatly be using it in the future.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle (though I&#x27;m considering not taking this) the 1st month I saw very modest change I tracked my stomach arms, thighs and waist.  but since then I&#x27;ve actually GAINED wait, I did not change my diet so didn&#x27;t particularly eat low glycemic foods...I&#x27;m wondering if regular foods in regular amounts combined with the oil actually made me GAIN weight?  literally I&#x27;ve gained about 8 pounds most in my stomach and thighs but it&#x27;s showing on my face too.... I&#x27;m confused and IF i do finish this bottle I will NOT be buying it again. I guess everything is not for everyone and everyone body processes things differently.</li>
            <li> I really dont know for sure if the product works.  For the price i didnt take it as prescribed to I took one tablespoon a day instead of two tablespoons a day to conserve it.  I really didnt lose any weight.  I thought I at least should have lost something.</li>
            <li> lets see!  I took this since February and it took off about 15 lbs and I was super happy.  But now it kind of plateu and I haven&#x27;t lost any extra lbs or inches.  I didn&#x27;t take this with exercise as it was recommended.  But that&#x27;s what made me super happy when I took it initially and didn&#x27;t exercise and lost 15 lbs.  I&#x27;m kind of lazy, so exercise is the last thing on my mind.  Not that I have all the time in the world for a nice long workout anyway.  Overall, I gave it 4 stars because it did work for me.</li>
            <li> I don&amp;#34;t know if works I don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Love this product! This is so yummy....I have lost 5 lbs in 2 weeks. If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying don&#x27;t be! I will be buying more!!!!</li>
            <li> It def curbs your appetite, but made me feel a little sick stomach.  It gives you a very full feeling.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks and have lost only three pounds, but that is by doing NOTHING else, no diet, no increased exercise...so I think it is working. I find that I can&#x27;t finish as much of my meals.  Taste good too!</li>
            <li> It was a good product. My doctor recoomended this product so I felt safe in taking it. Love it. Thank you</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it. This is safflower oil, with some flavoring. Why wouldn&#x27;t people just buy safflower oil for $3.99 at Whole Foods? I haven&#x27;t tried the product and certainly won&#x27;t. I just was amazed to see it for $25 at WF, and see the main ingredient is of course safflower oil, and then walk over to the oil section, and see WF brand safflower at $3.99. So right off the bat you know this company is totally ripping people off. As for Dr. Oz, he&#x27;ll sell anything and say it works. His show seems to be about his ego, having women scream for him and pretend he&#x27;s sexy, his stupid, over the top illustrations of simple concepts, and supplements supplements supplements. I&#x27;ve looked up some of his makeup recommendations on Makeup Alley, like one for dark circles, and the reviews there totally panned the product. His recommendations are worth nothing, he just needs material for an hour-long show every day. I wouldn&#x27;t trust anything that guy says. There was a very negative article about him and his ego in the New Yorker awhile back.</li>
            <li> Love the taste. Shipped as promised. Not sure if product&#x27;s claims are valid...I am still using it. This was recommended by Dr Oz on his TV show.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a suggestion from my sister but it did not have the effect on me as it had on her for weight loss. The taste was fine but I saw no difference in my weight loss program with the product so I did not reorder</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really work for me I was disappointed after I read about what it could do I have such a hard time with weight ive tried everything I thought this would work</li>
            <li> This product tastes like an Orange Push-up Popsicle!  No after taste at all.  I take it as recommended: 1Tbsp. before meals.  I take it in conjunction with the Raspberry Ketone by GreenWeb Nutrition Products.  The two have really helped me loose more inches than weight in my mid-section. I have a way to go, but I am pleased, so far.  I have only used the one bottle, but I just re-ordered the Raspberry Ketones, so I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Ok. So I did try this product but I cannot give credit for my hard work to thiis product. It is very sweet which begs the question of added sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.... Here is a better weight loss trick. Mix 1 teaspoon of organic hemp oil, 1 teaspoon of grapeseed oil and 1 teaspoon of safflower oil. Dribble over a noontime salad with a sprinkle of your favorite spices. You will get 1000 times more nutritional benefit for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your weight loss will accelerate with a 20 minute walk after the above mentioned salad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lost 25 and counting.... So can you! Amazon is a wonderful resource for the hard to find oils, teas and protein powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> Read all the hoopla on this product.  In my case it didn&#x27;t work.  Flavor is good, just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I am using both Safslim and Metabolife Ultra daily and am seeing results in 6 days. The Safslim targets hormonal belly fat and the Metabolife is a fat burner. I am 53 and have been post menopausal after a hysterectomy for 14 years. I take monthly hormone injections until my body goes through normal menopause and the hot flashes cease. If your belly fat is not hormonal belly fat, that may be why you did not see results. If it is I highly recommend you try it again using my daily routine. I do watch my calories and I sometimes walk 2 miles and sometimes exercise but I have no specific routine. I know my mixture is working because I have done the daily exercise and healthy eating without these supplements with no results.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve a negative rating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for six days and attest to immediately gaining 4lbs and possibly even gained about 1/2 to the belly. I accounted for that the product is an oil and is loaded with calories by more than reducing caloric intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to use the product for the full 16 weeks that they recommend to find a weight gain to the tune of 80lbs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two sixteen ounce bottles. The unopened one is being returned and the contents of the opened one is getting flushed down the toilet</li>
            <li> I give this product the highest rating. I am a mature female.  I personally only take it one time a day in the morning before breakfast. Because I did not know how it work on my system. I was surprised that over a month of using I lost inches around my waist. If I were to use it as often as they suggest I may have lost the weight faster. The taste is good so is the berry flavor. I was not on a diet. I just tried to eat better and exercise during the week when I could. I turned my 30 year old daughter on to this and the results were extremely fast for her. It helps keep the belly fat down even when she was not working out or eat well.</li>
            <li> I just started taking saf slim tangerine flavor last night at dinner time. However I felt compelled to share my experiences so far. The taste is very good, I take it directly from a tablespoon.Usually after eating dinner about a half hour later I want desert. I had no cravings or desire for any type of sweet or salty snack. That is huge for me! Since pre menopause that&#x27;s all I crave.Last but also huge!, I did not wake up hungry this morning!I feel very positive about my results so far. Im monitoring my weight and eating healthy normal meals, I will post my loss in 2 weeks.This will be a part of my lifestyle change. Thank you Dr. Oz and Montel  for making us aware of these products!</li>
            <li> This product is great and it was used by myself and my daughter in law.  She used it more than I did but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> This product tastes very good. I bought the tagerine cream flavor.  First day of use, no problems.  Second day of use;  diarrhea within 30 minutes and I had to RUN to bathroom.  Third day, all was going well...until the next morning.  Unable to conrtrol my bowel movements, quick urge and no time to waste.  Continued throughout the day to the point that I had leakage...That&#x27;s right leakage.  Never in my life!  Let&#x27;s just say I won&#x27;t be continuing with this product!  Beware before you buy.</li>
            <li> This taste so good.  Not sure it&#x27;s working but it does taste good.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Great Job</li>
            <li> So I have ony been taking safslim for three days but have already noticed a difference in my appetite. I have been taking rasberry ketones and apple cider vinegar for about 3 monthes and have lost a few pounds. But since adding safslim I have lost an additional 2 pounds! Cant wait to see what 16 weeks bring!!</li>
            <li> finally a good product that works</li>
            <li> I find this to be overly sweet, both flavors, it made no difference.  I could live with that as it&#x27;s only a tablespoon a day however, I have seen no decrease in appetite nor weight loss since that was the reason for taking the tablespoon a day to begin with, there seems to be no point in using it any longer.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only taken it for approximately 3wks however I do see a slight difference. I am curious to see what happens after a month or so. The taste is great and actually helps with my sweet tooth. Only problem is the price and it only last for approximately 2wks! However, once I measure and if there is a great difference after about 1 month, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll continue buying it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product does exactly what it says and tastes great lost 7 pounds fast now steadily losing every week. Lost inches around my waist. Try this product!</li>
            <li> I took it for two weeks and I have already taken two inches off!</li>
            <li> Even when I&#x27;m not working out I know this is working for me.  Don&#x27;t give up, you didn&#x27;t gain out over night so, your not going to lose it over night. It makes me feel fuller so I don&#x27;t eat as much. 1 tablespoon before breakfast and 1 tablespoon before dinner.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.. I will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  It tasted good.  I have to say that it was dissapointing.  I can&#x27;t honestly say it helped me lose a pound.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the results but i must say it sure taste good!Time will tell ifit really helps or and I am willing to order again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work -- not even close AND 2 tablespoons have 120 calories. So not only does it not help you lose weight but it actually adds unnecessary calories to your diet. And in addition to all that, you&#x27;ll be out $23 bucks for this useless stuff. Don&#x27;t bother. Take the $23 you would have wasted on this product and buy some lean protein, fruits &amp; veggies. You may actually even lose some weight.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does curb your appetite ...love the flavor of this one better than the strawberry flavor.  great price too!</li>
            <li> I started using Safslim the beginning of January. I did not see loss of pounds for about 6 days, then suddenly I dropped a pound.  I have lost almost 10 lbs since January and have definitely noticed my mid section changing shape which started first before much weight loss.  The BIGGEST thing I notice is the effect on my appetite.  I definitely have less urge to eat and overeat, so consequently, I started eating less, being satisfied more easily with less, and the weight started coming off.  I can&#x27;t say I have changed my diet drastically but I am satisfied with less.&lt;br /&gt;I love,love the Key Lime flavor which is harder to find, but Tangerine is my next favorite.  Altho it does have an oily taste, it is only a tablespoon, so I can tolerate that.&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, I would Highly recommend trying this product, but give it a month try.  The weight comes off very slowly, but at least it is coming off without much effort at all.  Before, I would try and try to diet and the scale would not budge, and every night I noticed that my belly would still get very bloated. I do not notice that anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using the product and haven&#x27;t begun to see results yet. I love the flavor and can see me using the product in the future.</li>
            <li> No noticeable benefits.</li>
            <li> No results after 2 bottles absolutely none wished I could get money back I will not suggest this product to anyone</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;m currently  at my goal weight  but wanted to get rid of the belly fat and bloating that doesn&#x27;t seem to want to budge.  I purchased the 16 oz tangerine flavored bottle from gnc and have been pleased with the results. I have lost 4 lbs in only 4 days though weight loss wasn&#x27;t  my goal. But i have noticed a decrease in my belly bulge and I love the taste.  It reminds me of cake batter. My mom, who I purchased for as well. says it tastes like a creamy custard. She&#x27;s threatened to drink the whole bottle. I take one tablespoon twice a day before breakfast and dinner. I have had no feelings of nausea or stomach cramps. I have no strong urges to go to the bathroom. In fact I go as usual with no issues. I have noticed a slight irritation in my mouth which may be caused by an allergic reaction.  Upon research I discovered that people who are allergic to ragweed may also be allergic to safflower. It causes a little bit of a discomfort but not enough to make me stop taking it. I would like to complete the full 6 weeks to see if there are further results before I stop taking it.</li>
            <li> Montel is a snake oil salesman now. Hope he can live with his actions. These companies get rich by getting celebrities to lie for them.</li>
            <li> so this is my second bottle ... and I have noticed a difference! Personally I feel this does aid in losing bellyfat. But with everything it just aids in losing body fat along with exercise and a healthy diet. I enjoy the taste of it as well. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> Gave me stomach problems so didn&#x27;t take it for long. It does state that it may cause stomach issues for some.</li>
            <li> Very tasty and curbs your appetite! You must eat better once you use this to see dramatic results. I mean what&#x27;s the sense in investing in a product to help you lose weight if your just gonna go back to your lifestyle that got you there in the first place? lol I ask myself that question and realized losing weight and the desire to feel better means I have to have a lifestyle change. This product helped a lot as I started eating healthy and 3-5 day exercise. I saw immediate results. I do recommend if your ready to do a 360 lifestyle change!</li>
            <li> It does work, my belly fat and other fat reduced from a size 22 to a 16.I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before but i&#x27;ve always read reviews about products that I planned to buy.  Let me say that I want to lose about 15 pounds &amp; I&#x27;m moderately active.  I carry my weight in my tummy through my thighs, losing weight is a bummer so I was looking for a safe kick start.  I saw the product on Dr Oz and although I love him, he hawks a lot of supplements but I decided to give this one a try.  First, it tastes pretty good...  Taking a tablespoon before meals isn&#x27;t hard to remember &amp; since it doesnt taste bad it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  At first, I noticed less interest in eating (psychological??), then the lack of interest became more noticeable, although I still ate three meals, I was full faster.  I feel like I have more energy.  At the end of the first week, I had lost almost 4 lbs.  I&#x27;m into week 2 &amp; i&#x27;m losing more as my pants are looser.  My husband said he can notice that my midsection is smaller..  I&#x27;m continuing, it doesn&#x27;t taste bad &amp; I&#x27;ve been able to get it on sale so why not!</li>
            <li> My brother and sister-in-law were using this product for belly fat reduction.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I don&#x27;t need that; but I was intrigued by the label warning that&lt;br /&gt;diabetics should be careful that their sugar rating doesn&#x27;t get too low because&lt;br /&gt;Safslim iimproves the use of the body&#x27;s insulin.  I bought a couple of bottles&lt;br /&gt;from Amazon to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury&#x27;s still out on belly fat reduction (I don&#x27;t have much to reduce) but&lt;br /&gt;THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT HAS REDUCED MY INSULIN USE BY NEARLY HALF.  I can&lt;br /&gt;hardly believe it but I am now on my sixth bottle and there is just no doubt&lt;br /&gt;about it!  I don&#x27;t dare stop taking it.</li>
            <li> taste awesome burns sitting fat i love this! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I think SafSlim tastes great but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working. It has been a month and I have not seen any changes.</li>
