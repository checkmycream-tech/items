            <li>my favorite!</li>
            <li>It was cheaper to buy this nice set with the perfume and the lotion through Amazon than just the perfume was at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>Item was as described and arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Wow...the bottle of lotion is huge!  </li>
            <li>This is my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>the lotion was HOT!!!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if it wasn&#x27;t available .</li>
            <li>and I thought it was a fabulous purchase for the price as well.</li>
            <li>Its a fabulous scent.</li>
            <li>so ima let it cool off from being in thee</li>
            <li>Always want to keep this on hand and purchasing from Amazon is easy, convenient and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I wore this in junior high and remembered it being clean.  </li>

            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but now that I know I can readily find it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>now  i need to order the lotion by itself that costs almost as much as both items.</li>
            <li>When I opened it it was brown, runny and smelled old musty, like some cheap old lotion.</li>
            <li>you make sure your bag is big enough for it because its 6.8oz!</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift and usually I do not give Giorgio away</li>
            <li>Could it have been an old tube?  </li>
            <li>it still smells the same and the scent lasts the whole day.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the colone but didn&#x27;t open the lotion until yesterday 4/13/15 because I still had lotion that I was using. When I opened it it was brown, runny and smelled old musty, like some cheap old lotion. The brown color is what stunned me.Would I buy this set again? Not from here. I can&#x27;t find a number or person to contact about this. Maybe Amazon will contact me after reading this! Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom.  Finding gift sets of Giorgio are difficult here.  I ordered this and she loved it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Mother.  She was elated by it and arrived in good time and as she said &amp;#34;It is Perfect!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Product great perfect delivery!</li>
            <li> Great bargain AND my husband likes it!  That&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorites. Always want to keep this on hand and purchasing from Amazon is easy, convenient and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> One of my very  favs will always wear this as I always get compliments on it when I do!  Thanks</li>
            <li> Wow...the bottle of lotion is huge!  It was cheaper to buy this nice set with the perfume and the lotion through Amazon than just the perfume was at Walmart.  Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Giorgio by Giorgio Beverly Hills for over 30 years. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if it wasn&#x27;t available .</li>
            <li> My mother loves this perfume! Its on her Christmas list EVERY year and she gets it EVERY year. LOL Looks, great. smells great and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> Memories should be memories.  I wore this in junior high and remembered it being clean.  Ordered this and it&#x27;s just not the same.  Reminds me of rubbing alcohol.  Did not smell any fragrance.  Will not order again!</li>
            <li> What a great price for my favorite perfume. I gave this as a gift and usually I do not give Giorgio away but now that I know I can readily find it on Amazon.com. Not a problem.</li>
            <li> I loveeeeeeee it my grandma use to wear it that&#x27;s y I got it, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is thee lotion. I notice lotion hardly smell like the spray. im starting to smell it alil when I got it the lotion was HOT!!! ups or fedX didn&#x27;t knock on my door so I didn&#x27;t know it was out side till about 9pm! (I&#x27;ve been home all day) so maybe that&#x27;s why the smell is different so ima let it cool off from being in thee sun.&lt;br /&gt;ps. if you the type to carrier the lotion around with you make sure your bag is big enough for it because its 6.8oz! so I just put some in a smaller to carrier around.</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s longtime favorite perfume, excellent price!!!!</li>
            <li> Lotion was thinner than usual.  Also, it was tan in color.  Could it have been an old tube?  I have ordered this item before and it has always been great, until this time.</li>
            <li> Used it forever... my favorite!</li>
            <li> Good experience.  Item was as described and arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Great set of Giorgio perfume and lotion. Mom loved it lots and I thought it was a fabulous purchase for the price as well.</li>
            <li> EVERY time I wear this scent I am complimented.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for my mom. She uses the body lotion &amp; the perfume... however what i received WAS NOT that. it was the perfume and the Shower Gel, which I have no use for... very disappointed. Not as described.</li>
            <li> ordered this for my wife,  did not get the lotion.  she got a body wash instead,  now  i need to order the lotion by itself that costs almost as much as both items.</li>
            <li> This is my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume. I recently ordered it for her birthday I was surprise to find after so many years it still smells the same and the scent lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> Very very great price! I bought it for my mom for Christmas and she absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> They are selling out of date Giorgio body lotion and Edt Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t use either.</li>
            <li> A mainstay for my wife&#x27;s stable of fragrance horses.</li>
            <li> I am a perfume fanatic! I like for people to say I smell good. I purchased this perfume a month ago and every time I wear it I get compliments from everyone. Its a fabulous scent.</li>
