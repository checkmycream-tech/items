            <li>&quot; of products to achieve a great head of curls.</li>
            <li>Great for people with permed hair, to hold curl</li>
            <li>not so great days</li>
            <li>Works great with curly hair.</li>

            <li>The free shipping, and the trust factor in Amazon, makes it an ideal purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that ranges from curly to wavy depending on the weather, and this product works great for me.</li>
            <li>It is truly an amazing product for me.</li>
            <li>My hair takes to it so nicely.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>It works very well and smells really good!</li>
            <li>It controls without stickiness or stiffness (unless you use too much) and defines beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light scent is nice as well.</li>
            <li>The product was ok.  </li>
            <li>The humidity can frizz out my hair, but this cream keeps it lovely.  </li>
            <li>It has become one of my favorite hair products.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>What I mostly like are the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have used every curly product you can name. :)</li>
            <li>My favorite styling product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>Most of these products don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I would like to order some more of it.</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I love this product, it does exactly what we were hoping for and are very, very pleased.</li>
            <li>So far holding up great in the humid Florida summer.</li>
            <li>and I do not have easy curls.  </li>
            <li>MY HAIR TYPE IS FINE AND FRIZZY</li>
            <li>When applied damp, this product makes the most amazing defined and SOFT texture!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using C-curl for a few years and it is THE BEST styling product for curly heads.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much product to hold hair in place and gives nice shine.</li>
            <li>I just got this yesterday so this morning I was so excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>people seem to really like the smell, but it isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product despite my &amp;#34;it&#x27;s ok&amp;#34; review just because I think there is a lot of potential.</li>
            <li>Love the look so much, but:&lt;br /&gt;CON: you cannot put your fingers through it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise nice, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>i may go thru the tube rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make it super greasy or crunchy.</li>
            <li>My new favorite hair product from MOP.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to make my routine easy with only this one product for styling, instead of multiples like I used to have.</li>
            <li>If you use too much it will make your curls a bit crunchy instead of smooth.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>RIGHT..</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it since moving back East.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it online since local salons here don&#x27;t carrying it.  </li>
            <li>I thought my hair was straight until I started using this product (I always wanted curly hair)!</li>
            <li>curls look nicely formed (no frizz, no excessive crunchiness) and last for a 12 hour work day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find what&#x27;s best for your specific curl type.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair, and have gone through so many different products throughout my life.</li>
            <li>Worth the high price tag.</li>
            <li>The first day I used too much, and my hair felt like it was super-glued together.</li>
            <li>It works even better if I blow dry my hair with a diffuser.</li>
            <li>Ok, I really want to give this product 5 stars because I had such high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>I have fine, frizzy, blonde, curly hair.</li>
            <li>If you have curls this works very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair.  </li>
            <li>and it really defines my curls without frizz.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do much to help the curl either.  </li>
            <li>It really defines and enhances.</li>
            <li>has expanded my hair too much and gave me poofy frizzy curls, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>guess is with this cream, less is more.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that keeps my curls looking nice and hydrated without looking too wet.</li>
            <li>and i find i need to use a little more than they recommend to achieve desired results, so</li>
            <li>:) I can definitely see mixing it with other products to loosen the hold</li>
            <li>i have fine hair with a little wave.  </li>
            <li>I agree with several contributors, less is more.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it, this may have just been to heavy a product for my fickle locks.</li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of products over a lifetime, searching for the product that would achieve strong hold, but soft - not crunchy or stiff, waxy or flaky.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to make my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I bought this with hopes of embracing my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was no longer made and was surprised to find it again.</li>
            <li>Mop C just transforms my wavy hair into lush locks.</li>
            <li>AND IF YOU USE EVEN A TINY BIT TOO MUCH....</li>
            <li>IF I GO WITH MY NATURALLY WAVY HAIR...</li>
            <li>1 hour into the day, I&#x27;ll gently do a soft de-crunching.</li>
            <li>The product does not come out completely until you wash it.</li>
            <li>I dry my shoulder-length hair first with a microfiber towel (scrunch upwards, no rubbing or wrapping).</li>
            <li>Then I pull it through all the strands, place a few horizontal clips at the top to help hold some lift and dry with a diffuser to bring out the curls.  </li>
            <li>ITS SIMPLY AMAZING BUT DEFINATELY WAY TO EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li>I really like this, as long as I don&#x27;t use too much on my short hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left with soft, well-defined curls.  </li>
            <li>I scrunch to crack the crispy shell and end up with soft and lasting curls.  </li>
            <li>The product is best used when your hair is semi-wet, and use less than you would of less expensive products.</li>
            <li>this keeps the shape but doesn&#x27;t really do anything to &amp;#34;encourage&amp;#34; curl, not like other products eg bumble and bumble.</li>
            <li>It has a sort of minty smell, reminds me a little of toothpaste but that is way better than heavy musky or flowery to me.</li>
            <li>Apparently this was discontinued for awhile, and now back.  </li>

            <li> Apparently this was discontinued for awhile, and now back.  </li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s probably from years of flat ironing though).</li>
            <li> A few months ago, my new hair stylist recommended MOP Curl Cream.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE A TINY BIT GOES A VERY LONG WAY!  </li>
            <li> A little bit is all that is needed for soft, defined curls.</li>
            <li> If I use too much you can tell by the dull look.  </li>
            <li> On the long run you want your hair to become healthier.</li>
            <li> Once completely dry, I break up the stiffness by just scrunching the hair upwards.  </li>
            <li> I never blow dry my hair (no time).</li>
            <li> I just pat my hair dry with a knit cotton shirt, brush it out</li>
            <li> Brush it again, make about 7-9 sections by twisting the hair together, and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I put it in, finger comb it, and let it air dry--don&#x27;t touch until dry.  </li>
            <li> When it is dry</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t touch until it&#x27;s completely dry!</li>
            <li> So the next day (yesterday) I used half that amount.</li>
            <li> comb it in soaking wet hair, define with fingers and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> With my hair wet from the shower, I towel dry it only a little, run this cream in, and then crunch of the curls with my fingers.</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s partially where my problem is.</li>
            <li> My hair felt sticky and heavy and crunchy all at the same time.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that actually define my frizzy curls.  </li>
            <li> If it makes your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; try using less or just scrunch your hair again after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The Handbook by Lorraine Massey and Michele Bender\\&quot; and learn this and other life-changing techniques for curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is type 3A and extremely prone to frizz, dryness and irregular curl patterns</li>
            <li> Every other gel or mousse</li>
            <li> It sounds weird but works really well.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but the combination is really odd.</li>
            <li> Small amount is enough but I combine it with also a small amount of the mop leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful about this product based on the reviews but after trying a few times, each time changing the amount I was using in case that was the problem I was left with a common problem when it comes to curl creams.  </li>
            <li> I get some serious bedhead in the mornings, but I&#x27;ve found that I can revive my hair simply by wetting it a little and twisting my hair into sections again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a victim of flat ironing and blow drying because I just could not manage my natural hair type without me looking like Helena Bonham Carter on a bad hair day.</li>
            <li> It was a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> Again, a sticky mess and crunchy hair.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is the size is quite small</li>
            <li> Can be a little greasy.</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair a bit crunchy, no matter how little I have tried to use.</li>
            <li> I see one reviewer thought this made her hair seem stiff.</li>
            <li> Holds my very thick, long, curly hair but without any stiffness.</li>
            <li> IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR VERY STIFF...</li>
            <li> But it have my curls that hard, crispy feeling that I do not care for.</li>
            <li> so sticky and unmoldable once in hair that it was hard to use.</li>
            <li> No more crunchy curls!</li>
            <li> So today I just used a tiny amount - probably the size of two peas - and I still got crunchy hair, though not quite as bad.</li>
            <li> NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE KMS SPIRAL SPRAY</li>
            <li> I have frizzy thin medium curly hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive, too, so</li>
            <li> A BUDGET :-(  </li>
            <li> My hair feels horrible.  </li>

            <li> I agree with several contributors, less is more. The product is best used when your hair is semi-wet, and use less than you would of less expensive products.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good condtion.  If you have curls this works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using C-curl for a few years and it is THE BEST styling product for curly heads. I&#x27;ve been able to make my routine easy with only this one product for styling, instead of multiples like I used to have. It controls without stickiness or stiffness (unless you use too much) and defines beautiful curls. It&#x27;s light scent is nice as well. A must have for curly hair!</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday so this morning I was so excited to try it.  Oh my gosh...My hair feels horrible.  I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through it at all.  It pulled on my hair, made it crunchy.  I had to put it up because I couldn&#x27;t bear to feel it throughout the day. It feel almost as if there is glue in my hair, all over.  There is no way to get a comb through this.  I thought it was going to make my hair soft.  No, this is not that product.  I will be returning it as soon as I can.</li>
            <li> Ok, I really want to give this product 5 stars because I had such high hopes for it. But I can&#x27;t as of now. I have fine, frizzy, blonde, curly hair. The first day I used too much, and my hair felt like it was super-glued together. It was a sticky mess. So the next day (yesterday) I used half that amount. Again, a sticky mess and crunchy hair. So today I just used a tiny amount - probably the size of two peas - and I still got crunchy hair, though not quite as bad. The good thing is that I have had no frizz. So tomorrow I will try a pea size and update after my hair dries.   Almost forgot - people seem to really like the smell, but it isn&#x27;t my favorite. To me, it smells like spearmint with a hint of orange. It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but the combination is really odd.</li>
            <li> The product was ok.  But it have my curls that hard, crispy feeling that I do not care for.</li>
            <li> Can be a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Back in the day, I used what I call a \\&quot;curl cocktail\\&quot; of products to achieve a great head of curls. Since discovering this product, I only use one! It is worth the price. I have fine hair that ranges from curly to wavy depending on the weather, and this product works great for me.</li>
            <li> i have fine hair with a little wave.  i was looking for a moderately priced curl cream that did not have loads of preservatives/funky ingredients.  i am very pleased with this product- and received a number of compliments on my hair when i used it.  my only complaint is the size is quite small and i find i need to use a little more than they recommend to achieve desired results, so i may go thru the tube rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this with hopes of embracing my naturally curly hair. It reminds me of Elmer&#x27;s Glue.  Made my hair feel gummy.  The company would not allow me to return it. Bummer. Maybe I&#x27;ll need to glue some construction paper together some day. Until then, it will sit.</li>
            <li> Great product! Holds my very thick, long, curly hair but without any stiffness.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it since moving back East.  There is something about it that makes my curls just beautiful. The humidity can frizz out my hair, but this cream keeps it lovely.  I was so glad to find it online since local salons here don&#x27;t carrying it.  The free shipping, and the trust factor in Amazon, makes it an ideal purchase.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was no longer made and was surprised to find it again.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair, and have gone through so many different products throughout my life. It&#x27;s hard to find what&#x27;s best for your specific curl type. A few months ago, my new hair stylist recommended MOP Curl Cream. It has become one of my favorite hair products. My hair takes to it so nicely. Doesn&#x27;t make it super greasy or crunchy. it&#x27;s awesome. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This curl cream does a good job holding your curl.   If you use too much it will make your curls a bit crunchy instead of smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of products over a lifetime, searching for the product that would achieve strong hold, but soft - not crunchy or stiff, waxy or flaky. This is it. I get stopped regularly and asked which product I use... and I do not have easy curls.  I am positivey evangelical about MOP C-Curl. Worth the high price tag.</li>
            <li> The Holy Grail for this wavy/curly girl. So far holding up great in the humid Florida summer. A little bit is all that is needed for soft, defined curls.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Apparently this was discontinued for awhile, and now back.  Great for people with permed hair, to hold curl</li>
            <li> i have wavy hair that i am trying to encourage to curl and stay curled. this keeps the shape but doesn&#x27;t really do anything to &amp;#34;encourage&amp;#34; curl, not like other products eg bumble and bumble. also, it leaves your hair crunchy which i don&#x27;t like. it&#x27;s expensive, too, so i won&#x27;t buy it again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I see one reviewer thought this made her hair seem stiff. I&#x27;ve experienced good (kinda) days with it and not so great days so maybe it&#x27;s in how I&#x27;m applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is with this cream, less is more. I tend to go with lighter hold so maybe that&#x27;s partially where my problem is. It definitely cuts frizz, my hair looked almost too defined and I&#x27;m not used to that :) I can definitely see mixing it with other products to loosen the hold too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product despite my &amp;#34;it&#x27;s ok&amp;#34; review just because I think there is a lot of potential. I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from trying it out, it just might take some experimentation to figure out the best way to apply it and style.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair.  When applied damp, this product makes the most amazing defined and SOFT texture! No more crunchy curls!</li>
            <li> Works great with curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product made my scalp scab and itch. I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best products for curly hair. I have 3c curls and it really defines my curls without frizz. Small amount is enough but I combine it with also a small amount of the mop leave in conditioner.  comb it in soaking wet hair, define with fingers and let it air dry. Don&#x27;t touch until it&#x27;s completely dry! What I mostly like are the ingredients. On the long run you want your hair to become healthier. I have used every curly product you can name. :)</li>
            <li> My favorite styling product</li>
            <li> so good. I have frizzy thin medium curly hair. great because you can touch your hair throughout the day and it doesn&#x27;t frizz or fall apart.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful about this product based on the reviews but after trying a few times, each time changing the amount I was using in case that was the problem I was left with a common problem when it comes to curl creams.  My hair felt sticky and heavy and crunchy all at the same time.  It didn&#x27;t really do much to help the curl either.  I have fine hair, but a lot of it, this may have just been to heavy a product for my fickle locks.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It really defines and enhances. Mop C just transforms my wavy hair into lush locks. It works very well and smells really good! This is the only product I use from this line because it is rather expensive, but I don&#x27;t need more. It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders in controlling frizz and defining my curls.  I dry my shoulder-length hair first with a microfiber towel (scrunch upwards, no rubbing or wrapping). Then rub a quarter size portion between my hands and scrunch it onto my hair.  Then I pull it through all the strands, place a few horizontal clips at the top to help hold some lift and dry with a diffuser to bring out the curls.  Once completely dry, I break up the stiffness by just scrunching the hair upwards.  That breaks the \\&quot;gel cast\\&quot; or stiffness some reviews complain about. I&#x27;m left with soft, well-defined curls.  Order the book: \\&quot;Curly Girl: The Handbook by Lorraine Massey and Michele Bender\\&quot; and learn this and other life-changing techniques for curly hair.</li>
            <li> NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE KMS SPIRAL SPRAY I HESITATED TO BUY AGAIN BECAUSE IT WAS DOUBLE THE PRICE!!&lt;br /&gt; THIS IS A BIT TOO STICKY AND IF YOU USE EVEN A TINY BIT TOO MUCH.... IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR VERY STIFF...THIS IS WHAT I TRY TO AVOID....I WANTED TO LIKE IT CONSIDERING IT WILL LAST FOREVER IF IT DOES WORK FOR YOU!! BECAUSE A TINY BIT GOES A VERY LONG WAY!  BUT FYI...MY HAIR TYPE IS FINE AND FRIZZY IF I GO WITH MY NATURALLY WAVY HAIR...SO I TEND TO GO FOR THE BEACH LOOK IF I DO WAVY/CURLY AND THE ONLY PRODUCTS THAT WORK FOR ME ARE ANTI-FRIZZ MOUSSE OR LIKE I SAID BEFORE KMS SPIRAL SPRAY...ITS SIMPLY AMAZING BUT DEFINATELY WAY TO EXPENSIVE IF YOUR ON A BUDGET :-(  THIS ONE WORKS WHEN I USE IT RIGHT.. BUT ISN&#x27;T MY GO-2.....</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that actually define my frizzy curls.  I&#x27;m impressed.  Most of these products don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: curls look nicely formed (no frizz, no excessive crunchiness) and last for a 12 hour work day. I never blow dry my hair (no time). With my hair wet from the shower, I towel dry it only a little, run this cream in, and then crunch of the curls with my fingers. That&#x27;s it. 1 hour into the day, I&#x27;ll gently do a soft de-crunching. Love the look so much, but:&lt;br /&gt;CON: you cannot put your fingers through it. That&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s the price you pay for form.&lt;br /&gt;I buy this by the box and it lasts me a year.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much product to hold hair in place and gives nice shine. My new favorite hair product from MOP.</li>
            <li> so sticky and unmoldable once in hair that it was hard to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best curl product I have ever used!! My hair is type 3A and extremely prone to frizz, dryness and irregular curl patterns (that&#x27;s probably from years of flat ironing though). Every other gel or mousse I&#x27;ve used has expanded my hair too much and gave me poofy frizzy curls, which I don&#x27;t like. I&#x27;ve been a victim of flat ironing and blow drying because I just could not manage my natural hair type without me looking like Helena Bonham Carter on a bad hair day. I just pat my hair dry with a knit cotton shirt, brush it out (I know brushing curls is ill-advised but it helps to relax mine as well as evenly distribute product), and apply about a nickel sized amount throughout my hair. Brush it again, make about 7-9 sections by twisting the hair together, and let it air dry. Not a frizzy hair in sight! I get some serious bedhead in the mornings, but I&#x27;ve found that I can revive my hair simply by wetting it a little and twisting my hair into sections again. The product does not come out completely until you wash it. It is truly an amazing product for me. Will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I thought my hair was straight until I started using this product (I always wanted curly hair)! I just put a nickel size amount in my palm and scrunch it into my hair. It works even better if I blow dry my hair with a diffuser. Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the Elmer&#x27;s-glue-like appearance and consistency. Once it dries in your hair it isn&#x27;t sticky at all. If it makes your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; try using less or just scrunch your hair again after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I like this curl cream.  It does leave my hair a bit crunchy, no matter how little I have tried to use.</li>
            <li> I really like this, as long as I don&#x27;t use too much on my short hair.  I put it in, finger comb it, and let it air dry--don&#x27;t touch until dry.  When it is dry I scrunch to crack the crispy shell and end up with soft and lasting curls.  It sounds weird but works really well.  If I use too much you can tell by the dull look.  Otherwise nice, soft and shiny.  It has a sort of minty smell, reminds me a little of toothpaste but that is way better than heavy musky or flowery to me.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I love this product, it does exactly what we were hoping for and are very, very pleased. When the MOP company took their forming product (Defining Cream) off the market, we tried different brands and products, but none could satisfy us and meet our expectations like this MOP C-System Curl Defining Cream!  I would like to order some more of it. Thank you. Patricia A. Federowicz.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that keeps my curls looking nice and hydrated without looking too wet. A little bit goes a long way. Oh, and it smells nice too.</li>
