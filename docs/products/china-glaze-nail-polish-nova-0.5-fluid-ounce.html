            <li>But I give it 4 stars because it is such an awesome nail polish!</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t provide the larger, chunky glitter that some like to apply here and there, but it&#x27;s perfect for the starry</li>
            <li>I added one light coat of Nova to the top and it just looks like a light sprinkle of glitter.  </li>
            <li>It will remove it more quickly.</li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>It is such bright and colorful sparkle!</li>
            <li>Works good as a top coat to other polishes as it&#x27;s not opaque in one coat.</li>
            <li>Have fun and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I absolute love it 10000%</li>
            <li>Perfect for top coat and the glitter is very thick!</li>
            <li>This polish is very pretty for over another color.</li>
            <li>I like this polish, the holographic sparkle of the glitter is very pretty.</li>

            <li>This is so splendiferous and fun.</li>
            <li>Worth the money and does its job.</li>
            <li>first glitter top coat I tried from OPI was so densely populated it pretty much covered my art and ruined the point.  </li>
            <li>It does crack and chip much sooner than cream polishes, but the sparkle is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more China Glaze</li>
            <li>My nails looked like a hot</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good glitter to use on your galaxy manicure (lots of videos on YouTube to demonstrate if you&#x27;re not sure what I&#x27;m referring to)</li>
            <li>The formula gets a bit clumpy after a while, so it may be smart to buy OPI polish thinner.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re just looking to add a little pizzazz to a basic manicure, Nova is great for that as well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I usually change my polish twice a week, but I have worn this more than a week with no chipping!</li>
            <li>It reflects so beautifully in direct light, especially the sun, but I find myself just stopping and staring at my nails all the time!</li>
            <li>It catches the light nicely and you can&#x27;t go wrong with China Glaze or OPI</li>
            <li>Lots of compliments on the looks, but high maintenance.</li>
            <li>I love the fact the glitter is small and you can build on how much you want.</li>
            <li>(The Gelish never chips, the glitter polish just hides the new growth!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is good for layering over other polishes, but be careful: the polish is very densely packed with glitter, so unveven application is very possible if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>It gave my nails such beautiful demension with all different colors subtly sparkling.</li>
            <li>I wear 2-3 coats over Celeb City by Sally Hansen and it is completely opaque!</li>
            <li>It distributes enough glitter that it shows up, but not too much that it overwhelms your art.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little different than China Glaze&#x27;s Techno in that it has very finely milled glitter, which give a different look.</li>
            <li>Two coats will near completely cover the color underneath your nails; it covers almost completely making it a solid silver finish.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because the product looks great at the beginning but IMPOSSIBLE to get it chip proof.  </li>
            <li>will say, of all the glitter polishes I&#x27;ve tried, this is thick and FULL of glitter.  </li>
            <li>This polish is very pretty, this glitter comes out evenly which is hard to find with glitter nail polish.  </li>

            <li> But can be a little sloppy if you don&#x27;t take your time!!!</li>

            <li> This is a great color, I normally HATE glitter/shimmer with a passion, but I like using this over Mint Candy Apple (Essie) for a Winter feel. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good glitter polish-the brush makes application very easy, and it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> I know there is an expression, \\&quot;I&#x27;m speechless\\&quot; but \\&quot; I&#x27;m wordless\\&quot;. This is so splendiferous and fun. I just put one coat over a China Glaze gold glitter. It gave my nails such beautiful demension with all different colors subtly sparkling. This looks wonderful over most any color if you like glitz which by now you know I obviously do. Take a chance, it is truly silver splendor. Will brighten up purple, red, pink , copper and let your imagination run wild. Have fun and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I adore this glitter polish! This is my second bottle. I wear 2-3 coats over Celeb City by Sally Hansen and it is completely opaque! I get so many compliments on this polish and the wear is great for a glitter polish. I usually change my polish twice a week, but I have worn this more than a week with no chipping! It reflects so beautifully in direct light, especially the sun, but I find myself just stopping and staring at my nails all the time! Its so gorgeous. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no chipping and I use this often.  When my Gelish grows out a bit on my fingers, I put this over whatever color I&#x27;ve got on and I can make my Gelish manicure last another week.  (The Gelish never chips, the glitter polish just hides the new growth!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, of all the glitter polishes I&#x27;ve tried, this is thick and FULL of glitter.  Two coats will near completely cover the color underneath your nails; it covers almost completely making it a solid silver finish.  I only do one coat because I like some of the base color to shine through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOTS of compliments when I put this over grey polish!</li>
            <li> Very thick and goopy polish.</li>
            <li> I searched every where for this polish and only found it here! The prIce was great and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because as it is stunning silver glitter. It can be messy applying it. I don&#x27;t have any issues taking it off now that I have looked into tips and tricks for removing glitter!!!! I love the fact the glitter is small and you can build on how much you want. But can be a little sloppy if you don&#x27;t take your time!!!</li>
            <li> The color is so perfect. Too bad China Glaze has a subpar formula. The polish take forever to dry from just one coat but the polish gums up in the bottle after 3 uses. The polish also chips of in a matter of hours.</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t buy this at the price china glaze polishes typically go for, I&#x27;m content with it at the price I paid. It&#x27;s a standard glitter polish that shines like a diamond- giving all the colors of the rainbow. Works good as a top coat to other polishes as it&#x27;s not opaque in one coat. The formula is very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This polish is very pretty for over another color. It adds sparkle and shine. I am glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product if your looking for something that looks similair to \\&quot;gel toes\\&quot; and your not opposed to constant touchups.  That&#x27;s because the product looks great at the beginning but IMPOSSIBLE to get it chip proof.  Constantly \\&quot;touching up\\&quot; toes......  Lots of compliments on the looks, but high maintenance.</li>
            <li> Love love Kobe this nail polish!!! I have been looking everywhere for a sparkle nail polish that I don&#x27;t need a hundred coats of! This is perfect. So sparkly. Perfect for new yrs or as a too coat to make a color more fancy :)</li>
            <li> I choose this color because it goes with a lot of colors. It goes on smooth and leaves a nice look with many options to pair it with. I will definently buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> This polish is awesome. I use it as a sparkle topcoat to embellish my flat lacquers. It does crack and chip much sooner than cream polishes, but the sparkle is definitely worth it. To remove, press a saturated cotton ball over each nail for about thirty seconds. It will remove it more quickly. The formula gets a bit clumpy after a while, so it may be smart to buy OPI polish thinner.</li>
            <li> I had been looking all over for this polish an I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but found it here and it is amazing I absolute love it 10000%</li>
            <li> Perfect for top coat and the glitter is very thick! surprisingly lasts a long time too! Definitely buying more China Glaze</li>
            <li> Good product, I would buy it again. Worth the money and does its job. I bought it for a friend who was pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. It is such bright and colorful sparkle! The only negative thing about it is that it is extremely hard to remove, even with 100% pure acetone. But I give it 4 stars because it is such an awesome nail polish!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good glitter to use on your galaxy manicure (lots of videos on YouTube to demonstrate if you&#x27;re not sure what I&#x27;m referring to) this one is perfect.  It distributes enough glitter that it shows up, but not too much that it overwhelms your art.  It won&#x27;t provide the larger, chunky glitter that some like to apply here and there, but it&#x27;s perfect for the starry look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first glitter top coat I tried from OPI was so densely populated it pretty much covered my art and ruined the point.  My nails looked like a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just looking to add a little pizzazz to a basic manicure, Nova is great for that as well.  I used a pink neon on my pedicure this week, and it dried with a very matte finish (from the China Glaze 2012 Summer Neons collection).  I added one light coat of Nova to the top and it just looks like a light sprinkle of glitter.  Not overwhelming..just a dusting.  Very pretty!</li>
            <li> This polish is very pretty, this glitter comes out evenly which is hard to find with glitter nail polish.  It catches the light nicely and you can&#x27;t go wrong with China Glaze or OPI</li>
