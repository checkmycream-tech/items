            <li>the color is awesome and it lasts.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful shade of Auburn!</li>
            <li>The best color ever..</li>
            <li>Awesome..</li>
            <li>I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this color because it fits my skin tones perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Very good price and</li>
            <li>great color lots of complements</li>
            <li>Great product, will use nothing else.</li>
            <li>The color is shiny and bright without being brassy.  </li>
            <li>Loved it - will buy again.</li>
            <li>guess it&#x27;s good for an &#x27;emergency color&#x27; if you need that, or to cover the roots in a flash</li>
            <li>Love this color and great delivery.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really bummed about it because it was perfect.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find that I could still get this product.</li>
            <li>For some reason, medium auburn does not seem to be popular since basically every CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens has stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that the color is ready to wash off in 10 mins..</li>
            <li>The absolute best color for me.  </li>
            <li>And the best part for me is that when it grows out, no one can tell a difference in my natural color and where I applied the color.</li>
            <li>this product is superior to Nice &amp; Easy -- worth the price difference.  </li>
            <li>Great fast hair color.  </li>
            <li>and I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>I love this color, I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>Love the color and ease</li>
            <li>AS I LOVE THE MEDIUM AUBURN.</li>
            <li>I love the color.  </li>
            <li>I love the 10 minute waiting time.  </li>
            <li>have used it for years the best color and minimal fade,</li>
            <li>It is easy to use</li>
            <li>I place two orders/4boxes and get the shipping free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy and quick --</li>
            <li>This is the perfect shade and is pretty much the only one I will purchase.  </li>
            <li>the comb like applicator makes home coloring so much easier and more evenly distributed.  </li>
            <li>This colour EXACTLY matches my younger haircolour and completely covered the strands of gray perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Washes out too quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair is always soft after use and the 6wks of extra conditioner is great.</li>
            <li>Very fast, no unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it covered.  </li>
            <li>I used Medium Auburn and I constantly get compliments on my color, which is naturally a light brown with light auburn highlights, and everyone thinks this is naural, even hairdressers.</li>
            <li>This color is just a shade more vibrant than my natural shade.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time to use foam colour</li>
            <li>I love that this color takes only 1o min.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes regularly without me having to reorder it all the time.  </li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t love is that the color doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that i can get this from amazon, none of the stores carry this color and this color is the only color for me</li>
            <li>Does not take much time,</li>
            <li>I have found my new favourite!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main attraction for this product.  </li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND WHY I CANNOT FIND IT WHERE I LIVE.</li>
            <li>My only dislike about it is my hair really sucks up the color and makes me panic because it looks really bright until I wash it out some.  </li>
            <li>Such a beautiful subtle change and easily covered all the greys in less than 20 minutes total.  </li>
            <li>This is a subscription item for me -- even my hairdresser says it looks natural!</li>
            <li>So vivid yet natural looking ..</li>
            <li>The color doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; and more evenly covers my previously dyed along with my now-almost white roots!</li>
            <li>however I could not get the water to run clear.</li>
            <li>I now have my hair professionally colored, you may want to as well...</li>
            <li>(I am a natural redhead, but my hair has faded over the years.)</li>
            <li>ten minutes as it implies and the color last pretty long.</li>

            <li> great color lots of complements</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair colour  because I was having increased problems locating the one I had been buying for years. I have found my new favourite! This colour EXACTLY matches my younger haircolour and completely covered the strands of gray perfectly.  It was my first time to use foam colour and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it covered.  The 10-minute time was also a bonus because my previous haircolour had to remain on 30-45 minutes.  Very fast, no unpleasant odor.  I would eagerly recommend this to redheads looking for a medium auburn without the brassy, metallic, or neon shades some haircolour leaves.  I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Great fast hair color.  I really hate waiting around for 30 minutes with hair color on my head and this product gave me great color in only 10 minutes!  The only problem is that I think they discontinued my color which is medium auburn. I&#x27;m really bummed about it because it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful subtle change and easily covered all the greys in less than 20 minutes total.  Loved it - will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find that I could still get this product. I place two orders/4boxes and get the shipping free. It is easy to use and I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Love this color. I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so I get it through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save service. I used Medium Auburn and I constantly get compliments on my color, which is naturally a light brown with light auburn highlights, and everyone thinks this is naural, even hairdressers.</li>
            <li> Very good price and this product is superior to Nice &amp; Easy -- worth the price difference.  The color doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; and more evenly covers my previously dyed along with my now-almost white roots!</li>
            <li> I love that this color takes only 1o min. covers well and doesn&#x27;t stain my hairline.&lt;br /&gt; Why is it being discontinued?</li>
            <li> Love this color and great delivery.</li>
            <li> the comb like applicator makes home coloring so much easier and more evenly distributed.  the color is awesome and it lasts.  I have received tons of compilments on the color and all the diversity in it.</li>
            <li> I love this color, I love this product.  For some reason, medium auburn does not seem to be popular since basically every CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens has stopped carrying it.  I&#x27;ve been using this color for 5 years now and I&#x27;ve been getting it off of Amazon for 3 of those years.  I love that it comes regularly without me having to reorder it all the time.  I will definitely continue buying it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful shade of Auburn! This color is just a shade more vibrant than my natural shade.  It gives my hair a boost when I&#x27;m feeling blah about it.  And the best part for me is that when it grows out, no one can tell a difference in my natural color and where I applied the color. My only dislike about it is my hair really sucks up the color and makes me panic because it looks really bright until I wash it out some.  I don&#x27;t have to leave it on but for 5 minutes though, so that&#x27;s a plus for me.</li>
            <li> The best color ever.. So vivid yet natural looking .. Awesome.. The best part is that the color is ready to wash off in 10 mins.. What else can I ask for..</li>
            <li> Great product, will use nothing else. J</li>
            <li> I love this color.  It applies with ease and only taking 10 mins to work is the bonus of this product.  The color is shiny and bright without being brassy.  My hair is always soft after use and the 6wks of extra conditioner is great.</li>
            <li> have used it for years the best color and minimal fade,</li>
            <li> Love the color and ease however I could not get the water to run clear. I might be hair challenged but I half to sit there and blow dry my long thick hair so it doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets. Am I doing something wrong? Very likely.</li>
            <li> The resulting color was not as red as in the package, even though my wife already had red on her hair. Also, she has been complaining about the coverage (she only has a couple of white hairs, but it bothers her).</li>
            <li> Washes out too quickly. I gave it a one year trial and it came off on my pillow case, not to mention my shower curtain while rinsing it off. Too bad, the color was nice. I now have my hair professionally colored, you may want to as well...</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AND NOW AM UNABLE TO FIND IT IN MY AREA AND HAVE TO SEND AWAY FOR IT. I DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND WHY I CANNOT FIND IT WHERE I LIVE. I MAY HAVE TO CHANGE SHADES AS I AM TIRED OF ORDERING AND HAVE TO BUY SOUR AT A TIME TO SAVE ON SHIPPING. I WOULD HATE TO HAVE TO CHANGE SHADES AS I LOVE THE MEDIUM AUBURN.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and it was as thick as mud when she tried to apply it. It was very difficult to get out of the applicator. Not a very good product</li>
            <li> The absolute best color for me.  I cannot find it any longer in local stores.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this color because it fits my skin tones perfectly.  I get compliments even from hair stylists.</li>
            <li> This is a subscription item for me -- even my hairdresser says it looks natural! (I am a natural redhead, but my hair has faded over the years.) It&#x27;s so easy and quick -- I don&#x27;t know why anyone would use a 30-minute dye when they can use a 10-minute one!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shade and is pretty much the only one I will purchase.  Does not take much time, ten minutes as it implies and the color last pretty long.</li>
            <li> I love the color.  That&#x27;s the main attraction for this product.  What I don&#x27;t love is that the color doesn&#x27;t last.  After a week, the gray comes through and after two weeks, it&#x27;s as if I never colored it.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s good for an &#x27;emergency color&#x27; if you need that, or to cover the roots in a flash, otherwise, it never stays for long.  I try not to wash my hair often, but that doesn&#x27;t help the fading.</li>
            <li> I love the 10 minute waiting time.  I can use it at the gym after I swim and it&#x27;s over and done while I finish my shower.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that i can get this from amazon, none of the stores carry this color and this color is the only color for me</li>
