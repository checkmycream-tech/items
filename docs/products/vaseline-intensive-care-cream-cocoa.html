            <li>and I&#x27;m happy that they&#x27;ve done themselves again.</li>
            <li>I love this wonderful cream</li>
            <li>It smells like chocolate, almost too good to put on.     </li>
            <li>The scent is light but very pleasant.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad product just not the best.</li>

            <li>I truly love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this when I did.</li>
            <li>More like a cream instead of a lotion.</li>
            <li>much better quality than the 3oz pack.</li>
            <li>Obviously good lotion because otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t buy it, but the reason it&#x27;s 4 and not 5 stars is because of the size and how fast it goes.</li>
            <li>very good for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>this is very good for dry cracking skin on heels of feet</li>
            <li>I also, love the mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>nice combination and much needed after the winter</li>
            <li>keeps one with me all the time , smooth to the touch</li>
            <li>It also has a light scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;I love this so much, I will have to buy you some more I keep using it!!\\</li>
            <li>With that said I have sensitive fair skin.</li>
            <li>Now with this new product my skin stays nicely moisturized without any greasy feeling</li>
            <li>It feels amazing, leaves my skin soft and smooth, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>It was easy to buy as most of the stores around where I live carry it.  </li>
            <li>Of course, these appear to have been discontinued in stores (except Wal-Mart) just because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>U cannot find this kind in stores only the lotion form.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the reward.</li>
            <li>Best for those with dry to very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It relieved my very dry elbows and just feels amazing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product when it first came out.  </li>
            <li>I love cocoa radiant glow lotion, I use it all the time, this intensive care I was curious about and honestly it seems like it would work much better than the lotion at removing marks, but it&#x27;s thick, greasy, kinda cake like.</li>
            <li>Not wild about the smell, but I can easily live with it for such great results with NO SILICONE.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong, but it&#x27;s definitely a smoothing lotion.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much to help it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best for use in the winter, when the heat is on, which dries my skin out like crazy.</li>
            <li>It is very mousturizing and leaves my skin so silky.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m only using it when my hands are really dry from washing them all the time and on my scars I have on my thighs from third degree burns I got as a child, honestly though I couldn&#x27;t tell you which cream lotion or oil is helping those, over time I&#x27;ve used so many,</li>
            <li>Silicone based products on the other hand seem to just sit on top of the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotions hands down.</li>
            <li>Very thick and rich and no parabens, which is very important.  </li>
            <li>It has a light scent and never leave my sckin dry.  </li>
            <li>Works okay for legs but broke out my upper arms, back and chest.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my hands very soft and supple!</li>
            <li>This lotion is thick and perfect for dry skin, especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love the results</li>
            <li>My skin tends to dry out but this helps out tremendously.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hands soft all day.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle yet people always tell me I smell like the beach or chocolate :)</li>
            <li>I accidentally bought this item thinking it was the normal CocoaRadiant Lotion in a smaller size for my purse.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have found that moisturizes extremely well for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reliable, inexpensive, and goes on smoothly if a bit too thickly.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it on my body, but it is much too thick and is better used for small concentrations on a smaller area of the body.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft for a long while after application.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> nice combination and much needed after the winter</li>
            <li> very good for dry winter skin. My friend told me to buy products with cocoa butter, which this has, for itchy dry skin in the winters</li>
            <li> This lotion was ok. I have very dry senstive skin and it didn&#x27;t do much to help it. In fact, my skin got drier with the continued use. Also, I was not fond of the smell!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotions hands down. It has a light scent and never leave my sckin dry.  Perferect for winter and summer.  I&#x27;m just hoping Vaseline doesn&#x27;t discontinue it... it would be a sad day if they do.</li>
            <li> I love this body cream. It smells like chocolate, almost too good to put on.     I usually put it on my feet, my knees and my elbows..problem areas for dry skin.

            <li> I bought this on a whim when strolling through my local store, the bottle caught my eye. I&#x27;ve been through my share of moisturizers and lotions and potions - you name it, none have cured me of my dry skin. It feels amazing, leaves my skin soft and smooth, and isn&#x27;t greasy. The smell is relaxing, vaseline products have saved me before (got a bad allergic reaction to some new lip balm and i&#x27;ve been using vaseline lip therapy since) and I&#x27;m happy that they&#x27;ve done themselves again. Love it.</li>
            <li> Best lotion crème ever</li>
            <li> I have very very dry skin.  I started using this product when it first came out.  It was easy to buy as most of the stores around where I live carry it.  Now no one does so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It is very mousturizing and leaves my skin so silky. I also, love the mild fragrance. I have been using it for years and its the only body lotion that keeps my skin hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> Of course, these appear to have been discontinued in stores (except Wal-Mart) just because I love it so much. This lotion is thick and perfect for dry skin, especially during the winter months. I do not find it to be greasy but my husband thinks that it gets sticky after it is rubbed in. Not me!</li>
            <li> I love cocoa radiant glow lotion, I use it all the time, this intensive care I was curious about and honestly it seems like it would work much better than the lotion at removing marks, but it&#x27;s thick, greasy, kinda cake like.

            <li> I truly love this lotion. I have eczema and my skin is always drying out by lunch time. Now with this new product my skin stays nicely moisturized without any greasy feeling</li>
            <li> I love this wonderful cream but it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It keeps my hands soft all day.</li>
            <li> Love this. It smells amazing and does it&#x27;s job. Not much more I can say, but will definitely buy again.</li>

            <li> keeps one with me all the time , smooth to the touch</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed to combat my dreaded winter skin. Thick enough to help moisturize, but not too thick that I felt like my skin was swimming under a layer of Crisco. Plus, it has a great light scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this when I did.</li>
            <li> Very good quality!! More like a cream instead of a lotion. Which my skins loves especially during these cold winter months. My skin tends to dry out but this helps out tremendously. U cannot find this kind in stores only the lotion form.</li>
            <li> I am a woman, over 60 years of age, with very dry skin, especially on my hands, forearms and elbows.  I also have thinning hair and have been told not to use products with silicone in them because it contributes to the blockage of the hair folicle.  Do you know how hard it is to find a lotion or cream without dimethicone in it?  It is nearly impossible.  This is the first product that I have found that moisturizes extremely well for an extended period of time.  It actually absorbs into the skin.  Silicone based products on the other hand seem to just sit on top of the skin.  When I put this cream on my hands they look ten years younger. I love it, love it, love it!  Not wild about the smell, but I can easily live with it for such great results with NO SILICONE.</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought this item thinking it was the normal CocoaRadiant Lotion in a smaller size for my purse. Silly me didn&#x27;t discover it was a cream until well after initial use, having used it for my hands daily and noticing that it&#x27;s very thick to the lotion. Then I actually read the tube and imagine my surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hands very soft and supple! I use it after washing my hands. Now I also use it on my feet after showering. I tried to use it on my body, but it is much too thick and is better used for small concentrations on a smaller area of the body. You only need a little bit. It does leave your fingers oily for a few minutes until it can soak into your skin. Any thick cream (shea butter, cocoa butter, etc) will do this, so I don&#x27;t mind. It&#x27;s worth the reward. My hands and feet look beautiful and I will repurchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product several times before. It&#x27;s reliable, inexpensive, and goes on smoothly if a bit too thickly.</li>
            <li> Scent is pleasant, nice texture. Not the greatest ingredients. Works okay for legs but broke out my upper arms, back and chest. With that said I have sensitive fair skin. I now use Sheabutter  brand Cocoa -nut Crème, it is awesome. This is not a bad product just not the best.</li>
            <li> The scent is light but very pleasant. The cream is thick but pretty soothing. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers skin while leaving a glow and causing skin to look radiant.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a lotion that isn&#x27;t watered down and actually does what it says it will do. I have dry skin in some areas and wanted something that not only works in those areas, but my entire body as well.I found this body lotion and absolutely love it ! It it creamy, but not oily. It also has a light scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  I use it everyday and love the results</li>
            <li> Very thick and rich and no parabens, which is very important.  The smell is subtle yet people always tell me I smell like the beach or chocolate :)</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong, but it&#x27;s definitely a smoothing lotion. Skin feels soft for a long while after application.</li>
            <li> This one they stop making it....much better quality than the 3oz pack.</li>
            <li> Obviously good lotion because otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t buy it, but the reason it&#x27;s 4 and not 5 stars is because of the size and how fast it goes. If anything, just get the biggest size possible.</li>
