            <li>This is a GREAT DEAL!!!!</li>
            <li>One of the best fragrances being sold.</li>
            <li>Although I think it&#x27;s best for cooler weather, it wears wonderfully in summer!</li>
            <li>The price and package were perfect and arrived in a mint condition.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful scent and a quality</li>
            <li>good luck and happy smelling!</li>
            <li>Splendid.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this as a great buy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to apply twice which is really a great benefit.</li>
            <li>smells great.</li>
            <li>, mind you) what they can do to make me happy.</li>
            <li>I think they are a great company; and I will still use them.  </li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;This is a GREAT product</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>The perfume is amazing - great scent that is said to be for evening</li>
            <li>It was a wise choice for me then</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s still a wise choice for me today.     </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and was so happy with the price.</li>
            <li>Blvgaria Omnia is one of my favorite perfume!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Pleasant from top to bottom &amp; wears close to the skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is very inviting and is perfect for all seasons.</li>
            <li>but again I think this is a nice change to what is out there today</li>
            <li>I saved the sample and kept smelling it for a month and really liked it.</li>
            <li>Smells nice on a card...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of lukewarm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with the packaging</li>
            <li>arrived quick at a great price.</li>
            <li>I will be happy to help you and get the order to you as quickly as possible\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a fan of woodsy fragrances for women, but Omia is great!</li>
            <li>continue to order from AMAZON, they are a great company, they made things right.</li>
            <li>i used super saver shipping and it arrived very fast in excellent condition</li>
            <li>the price seems too good to be true</li>
            <li>I love the design of the bottle too...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li>I love the way they packaged my perfumes.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of bvlgari omnia</li>
            <li>This has more of an alcohol and a drop of perfume.</li>
            <li>alot of flower smells granted I love flowers</li>
            <li>It mellows into a lovely, roasted concoction.</li>
            <li>many perfumes give me a headache, this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>wear it day and night, thou i tend to take it out more often as winter approaches.</li>
            <li>with all perfumes, you have to try it on your skin and see (sniff :))for yourself.</li>
            <li>I like a couple scents by Bvgari,  but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>the smell is okay, but someone said \\&quot;warm\\&quot;- and that&#x27;s it-</li>
            <li>It is great for day wear and it lasts whole day.</li>
            <li>and I love perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen it anywhere for a better price than Amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my wife and it&#x27;s now my favorite.</li>
            <li>very unique just like the perfume.</li>
            <li>I admit I originally bought this because the price on Amazon was amazing</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered perfume from amazon but didn&#x27;t have a good experience.  </li>
            <li>It came in about a week and was in original package!  </li>
            <li>This perfume is a nice smelling perfume that is not too strong or sweet.  </li>
            <li>I sent this perfume for my daughters birthday, it took a month for her to recieve it, the perfume is okay no complaints but nothing special, it cost more in post than it did to buy</li>
            <li>this parfum smells really nice, and with a small quantity is complacent to get a delicious fragancy all day....</li>
            <li>At the top, it is a bit sweet, creamy &amp; spicy, but not overtly so.</li>
            <li>the best thing they&#x27;ve ever done was give you those little cards with the smell on them</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>Plus, the scent stays put for hours, which is very rare with perfumes.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not the original one.  </li>
            <li>well and I like it too, smell fresh and soft but not too soft either, over all a great buy with this!!!</li>
            <li>I will totally buy from this vendor again and recommend them to anyone looking for a great deal and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I remember Omnia as woody, spicy, and slightly sweet in the winter.</li>
            <li>Sweet but not sugary.     </li>
            <li>, it is a perfect blend between fruity, woody and spicy, with tendency toward spicy, at least on my skin.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for the missus and she seems to like this scent since it does not have a very overpowering scent to it and does not fade that quickly as most perfume.</li>
            <li>Product is very nice and delivered before expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>This specific sale represented a very good value when compared with the normal retail price.....would definitely purchase here again in light of good price &amp; fast shipping.</li>
            <li>If anything, as others have said, it tends to fade too quickly.</li>
            <li>I first tried this at the same time as the Bvlgari pour Femme and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Not too strong and very feminine.</li>
            <li>I have so many old bottles they should come up with a promotion of bring 3 old bottles and get 1 for free!</li>
            <li>Not sure the one that is shipped is genuine, becuase the smell is good</li>
            <li>This is a truly beautiful perfume, a classic woody oriental scent that&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li>As usual I received it very quickly and discovered I really love this scent!</li>
            <li>i bought this for a friend and she like very much, the scent is exelent,</li>
            <li>Product was in mint condition and was exactly what it was described as.  </li>
            <li>so this was not really for me but for those who like the inbetween without that sweetness this will be a nice purchase for you.  </li>
            <li>my current favorite scent.</li>
            <li>so I always purchase more at the same time because I never want to run out!</li>
            <li>first call came while we were daling with a terminal diagnosis.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s been a personal favorite of mine for years</li>
            <li>so i was very pleased to get it at such a low price i bought 2!!</li>
            <li>They really out-did themselves.</li>
            <li>it really helps in decision making</li>
            <li>very earthy/woodsy.</li>
            <li>I ve been purchasing this perfume for my wife like for 3 years now, all of them bought at Macys, this time i decided it to buy it online and for our surprise, do not smell like Bvlgary omnia to us, i guess its not the real deal, its what we feel.</li>
            <li>In the summer, it is very gourmand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Every time I find one I really like it gets discontinued.  </li>
            <li>was sealed and the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t attract me much-</li>
            <li>Really did not smell like the ones you find in department</li>
            <li>Once someone says they have a serious emergency, you stop bothering them unless you are friends and loved ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Omnia is not a stuffy, straight up oriental, but a very modern, contemporary, and adult one.</li>
            <li>Buying perfume (for somebody else) is always a challenge, but this delicate, warm scent and unusual bottle from Bvlgari were very-well received; there is just no beating Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>never had any problem before but this time bougth it in a different place and the scent does not last for more than 10 min</li>
            <li>Not What I Expected , I Thought It Was An Original Name Brand.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This perfume is subtle and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure which one I like better</li>
            <li>Exelent product, fast deliver, and product is extra condition.</li>
            <li>I sprayed so much but the scent still doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>I had not trouble finding it at Amazon and</li>
            <li>It was received way earlier than expected, 2 days later with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I actually read a review on this and because the girl had so many of my interests and likes and dislikes and the way she portrayed the smell of this I actually just bought it on a whim, which I never do without smelling a perfume for a few days</li>
            <li>Full of depth and complexity but not strong or heady.</li>
            <li>, I get lots of complements, men love the scent, they stop and ask me whats the name, also from women, I really recommend this perfum, you wont go wrong if you get it.</li>
            <li>But the price is little bit higher than store like Ross etc.</li>
            <li>At some point I picked up some powdery florals, but they were not long lasting.</li>

            <li> So I really hope this reveiw has helped at least one person.  </li>
            <li> There is no fragrance at all, I am pretty sure this is totally fake or 100 years old, I am sad to have wasted my money, I don&#x27;t know if I could have returned it after opening it,plus sending back an item is always a pain!</li>
            <li> next time we told them we are still busy with a family emergency and that a perfume order is the least of our concerns.</li>
            <li> the bottle is really pretty though -- also, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long which to me is another downfall, I like to put perfume on in the morning and never having to again for the day and the ones I purchase which are expensive</li>
            <li> Later returned second bottle, did not smell right, bad product, they said I couldn&#x27;t open a box and try parfume</li>
            <li> It has been harder and harder to find this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Ordered 2 bottles of Bvlgari Omnia parfum from TUCCINI for Christmas, arrived late.&lt;br /&gt;One box had empty bottle in box, Tuccini said I had returned a used empty bottle, not so.</li>
            <li> Also, it has no \\&quot;lingering\\&quot; scent once the initial spray had dried</li>
            <li> but it is not strong enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Should Specify That It&#x27;s An Imitation Brand</li>
            <li> Im upset with this purchase, did not have any problems with shipping but the perfum is not good, i been using this perfum for long time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, we stopped answering their calls for a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can still return it though...</li>
            <li> Likely a fake considering the price.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product I received from Tuccini was weak and didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> (too late for the gift it was meant</li>
            <li> I believe we have had at least nine calls from them after we received the order.</li>
            <li> the company that was to fill the order was seriously lacking in customer service and</li>
            <li> So it became about me questioning my order when it should have been an \\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I bought Omnia blind a couple years ago based on the notes, the nose, the brand, &amp; the price (no reviews!).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hae the box anymore :(</li>
            <li> The response to my checking on the order was insulting and was merely a jab because I questioned, and about MY RESPONSE ABOUT CHECKING ON THE ORDER, rather than their lack of getting the order taken care of as promised.</li>
            <li> Expensive in the stores, but this was a STEAL!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This perfume is subtle and smells nice. I love the design of the bottle too... very unique just like the perfume. I use it in rotation with Ralph Lauren Blue and Estee Lauder Beyond Paradise.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT DEAL!!!! This parfum sells for almost triple in every store I have bought it so i was very pleased to get it at such a low price i bought 2!! Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> One of the best fragrances being sold. The scent is very inviting and is perfect for all seasons. I would recommend this as a great buy.</li>
            <li> Product was in mint condition and was exactly what it was described as.  It was received way earlier than expected, 2 days later with free shipping.  It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li> Its my favourite perfume.I love the way they packaged my perfumes. They really out-did themselves. Splendid. I would recommend my friends.</li>
            <li> Exelent product, fast deliver, and product is extra condition. One word: GREAT&lt;br /&gt;Thanks AMAZON</li>
            <li> Blvgaria Omnia is one of my favorite perfume!  Expensive in the stores, but this was a STEAL!!  It came in about a week and was in original package!  I will totally buy from this vendor again and recommend them to anyone looking for a great deal and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> There is no fragrance at all, I am pretty sure this is totally fake or 100 years old, I am sad to have wasted my money, I don&#x27;t know if I could have returned it after opening it,plus sending back an item is always a pain!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered perfume from amazon but didn&#x27;t have a good experience.  I love the scent of bvlgari omnia but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not the original one.  I sprayed so much but the scent still doesn&#x27;t last.  This has more of an alcohol and a drop of perfume. I&#x27;m not sure if I can still return it though... I don&#x27;t hae the box anymore :(</li>
            <li> this parfum smells really nice, and with a small quantity is complacent to get a delicious fragancy all day....I love it!</li>
            <li> The perfume is amazing - great scent that is said to be for evening but I wear it every day.  Unfortunately, the product I received from Tuccini was weak and didn&#x27;t last.  Likely a fake considering the price.  Two thumbs up for the product and I won&#x27;t purchase from the seller Tuccini again.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a nice smelling perfume that is not too strong or sweet.  I actually do like stronger perfumes though like Tabu, Amirage etc... so this was not really for me but for those who like the inbetween without that sweetness this will be a nice purchase for you.  I actually read a review on this and because the girl had so many of my interests and likes and dislikes and the way she portrayed the smell of this I actually just bought it on a whim, which I never do without smelling a perfume for a few days the best thing they&#x27;ve ever done was give you those little cards with the smell on them it really helps in decision making but again I think this is a nice change to what is out there today alot of flower smells granted I love flowers but I don&#x27;t want to smell like one! the bottle is really pretty though -- also, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long which to me is another downfall, I like to put perfume on in the morning and never having to again for the day and the ones I purchase which are expensive I don&#x27;t have to apply twice which is really a great benefit. So I really hope this reveiw has helped at least one person.  good luck and happy smelling!</li>
            <li> my current favorite scent. very earthy/woodsy. i used super saver shipping and it arrived very fast in excellent condition</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume last year and since then I keep using the same one, doesnt matter if is spring, summer, fall or winter, I get lots of complements, men love the scent, they stop and ask me whats the name, also from women, I really recommend this perfum, you wont go wrong if you get it.</li>
            <li> I first tried this at the same time as the Bvlgari pour Femme and I loved it. I&#x27;m not sure which one I like better but I always run out of both at the same time so I always purchase more at the same time because I never want to run out! I have so many old bottles they should come up with a promotion of bring 3 old bottles and get 1 for free! If your reading this Bvlgari I want credit for this idea if its implemented! Get It Get It Get It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ve been purchasing this perfume for my wife like for 3 years now, all of them bought at Macys, this time i decided it to buy it online and for our surprise, do not smell like Bvlgary omnia to us, i guess its not the real deal, its what we feel.</li>
            <li> I bought Omnia blind a couple years ago based on the notes, the nose, the brand, &amp; the price (no reviews!). It was a wise choice for me then, it&#x27;s still a wise choice for me today.     Although I think it&#x27;s best for cooler weather, it wears wonderfully in summer! I remember Omnia as woody, spicy, and slightly sweet in the winter. In the summer, it is very gourmand. At the top, it is a bit sweet, creamy &amp; spicy, but not overtly so. At some point I picked up some powdery florals, but they were not long lasting. It mellows into a lovely, roasted concoction. I get vanilla, cafe au lait (the chai?), chocolate, almonds, tonka bean, and just a bit of wood. Pleasant from top to bottom &amp; wears close to the skin. Full of depth and complexity but not strong or heady. Sweet but not sugary.     Omnia is not a stuffy, straight up oriental, but a very modern, contemporary, and adult one. I would be hard-pressed to replace it in my fragrance wardrobe with anything but another bottle of Omnia.</li>
            <li> many perfumes give me a headache, this one doesn&#x27;t. &lt;br /&gt;besides that, it is a perfect blend between fruity, woody and spicy, with tendency toward spicy, at least on my skin. &lt;br /&gt;I wear it day and night, thou i tend to take it out more often as winter approaches. &lt;br /&gt;as with all perfumes, you have to try it on your skin and see (sniff :))for yourself. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a fan of woodsy fragrances for women, but Omia is great! Not too strong and very feminine. Plus, the scent stays put for hours, which is very rare with perfumes. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Buying perfume (for somebody else) is always a challenge, but this delicate, warm scent and unusual bottle from Bvlgari were very-well received; there is just no beating Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I like a couple scents by Bvgari,  but this is my favorite.  I don&#x27;t know what it is about perfume.  Every time I find one I really like it gets discontinued.  Unfortunatly this one seems to be going in that direction too.</li>
            <li> The price and package were perfect and arrived in a mint condition. Just love it. I recommended to this website to my friends.</li>
            <li> I sent this perfume for my daughters birthday, it took a month for her to recieve it, the perfume is okay no complaints but nothing special, it cost more in post than it did to buy so this is not something i would do again.&lt;br /&gt;shop, smell, buy and use the post office</li>
            <li> arrived quick at a great price. about 30% off retail. was sealed and the real deal. smells great. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Someone just dropped a sample in my hand while I was walking around a department store. I saved the sample and kept smelling it for a month and really liked it. Smells nice on a card... but after putting it into my rotation (Hanae Mori, D &amp; G Feminine, Gucci, Organza by Givenchy, Miracle, Salvatore Ferragamo, among others- depends on how I feel that day and what I&#x27;m doing) it really doesn&#x27;t attract me much- the smell is okay, but someone said \\&quot;warm\\&quot;- and that&#x27;s it- it&#x27;s kind of lukewarm.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and was so happy with the price. I paid almost twice the price for a 1.1 oz size in the mall!! I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with the packaging and I received it in three days. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Product is very nice and delivered before expected delivery date.But the price is little bit higher than store like Ross etc.</li>
            <li> It has been harder and harder to find this fragrance.  I had not trouble finding it at Amazon and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 bottles of Bvlgari Omnia parfum from TUCCINI for Christmas, arrived late.&lt;br /&gt;One box had empty bottle in box, Tuccini said I had returned a used empty bottle, not so. Later returned second bottle, did not smell right, bad product, they said I couldn&#x27;t open a box and try parfume then say I did not like the smell.  How can you know what it smells like if you can&#x27;t try it. Really did not smell like the ones you find in department stores.&lt;br /&gt;If the price seems too good to be true it probable is.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to order from AMAZON, they are a great company, they made things right.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use Omnia. It is a wonderful scent and a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER.....the company that was to fill the order was seriously lacking in customer service and courtesy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order was not received on time. The response to my checking on the order was insulting and was merely a jab because I questioned, and about MY RESPONSE ABOUT CHECKING ON THE ORDER, rather than their lack of getting the order taken care of as promised. So it became about me questioning my order when it should have been an \\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry you have not received the order. I will be happy to help you and get the order to you as quickly as possible\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then they started calling me after I finally received the order. (too late for the gift it was meant for)&lt;br /&gt;The first call came while we were daling with a terminal diagnosis. We told them we were in an emergency and could not talk. Then they called again the next morning. Then again the next day... next time we told them we are still busy with a family emergency and that a perfume order is the least of our concerns. They called again the next day....geesh!!!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, we stopped answering their calls for a few days. I believe we have had at least nine calls from them after we received the order. They did offer a $3.00 or $5.00 credit toward my next purchase. There won&#x27;t be one. When I told them that, they did also ask (snideley, mind you) what they can do to make me happy. Our response was to leave it be. They still called.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man who called us on he phone was polite, however, when told we were at the hospital with an emergency, he still wanted to talk so he could give us information on how to reach them so we would call them back. WHAT??? Who does that? And he kept calling. Once someone says they have a serious emergency, you stop bothering them unless you are friends and loved ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Amazon. I think they are a great company; and I will still use them.  The seller of this item;&lt;br /&gt;I will do without!</li>
            <li> OMNIA, is different from any perfume I have ever purchased.  It has a woody, musky scent.  It is great for day wear and it lasts whole day.</li>
            <li> Not sure the one that is shipped is genuine, becuase the smell is good but it is not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Im upset with this purchase, did not have any problems with shipping but the perfum is not good, i been using this perfum for long time never had any problem before but this time bougth it in a different place and the scent does not last for more than 10 min</li>
            <li> My wife has been wearing Bulgari Omnia for a few years now, &amp; really likes it. This specific sale represented a very good value when compared with the normal retail price.....would definitely purchase here again in light of good price &amp; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I admit I originally bought this because the price on Amazon was amazing and I love perfume. As usual I received it very quickly and discovered I really love this scent! It is in my regular rotation now along with Prada, Dior Addict , Obsession Night and Samsara so you get an idea of the scents I like! I have even gotten compliments on it from both men and women! I will get it again.</li>
            <li> This is a truly beautiful perfume, a classic woody oriental scent that&#x27;s not too heavy. If anything, as others have said, it tends to fade too quickly. Still, it&#x27;s been a personal favorite of mine for years and I often receive compliments on it. I&#x27;ve never seen it anywhere for a better price than Amazon.</li>
            <li> i bought this for a friend and she like very much, the scent is exelent, well and I like it too, smell fresh and soft but not too soft either, over all a great buy with this!!!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for the missus and she seems to like this scent since it does not have a very overpowering scent to it and does not fade that quickly as most perfume. Also, it has no \\&quot;lingering\\&quot; scent once the initial spray had dried up.&lt;br /&gt;This is a GREAT product</li>
            <li> I had smelled this perfume on a customer of mine and got up the nerve to ask her what it was. I bought it for my wife and it&#x27;s now my favorite. And no, it doesn&#x27;t remind me of that customer of mine. lol.  I recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not What I Expected , I Thought It Was An Original Name Brand.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should Specify That It&#x27;s An Imitation Brand</li>
