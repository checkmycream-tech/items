            <li> Excellent cologne. Such a fresh and clean smell. The price was so great I was blown away. The same size bottle cost about $185 back in 1998. This is my favorite cologne by far, and it drives my wife wild. To describe the smell, its kinda like a pine scent mixed with fresh fruit. What I love about it is every woman I know loves the way it smells, and you can&#x27;t ask for more than that in a cologne. 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVVVE LOVVVVVE!!!&lt;br /&gt;My husband LOVES it too!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful classic scent that solicits compliments even from the Generation X&#x27;rs!  I recommend as the price/value is outstanding!  If not, more for me.....if it ever runs out ;-)</li>
            <li> Scent is very strong and to me not very pleasant but it does last fairly long so i will keep it although i did purchase some calvin klein eternity that smelled alot like it but not as stronng so i dont know if either was the real thing now.</li>
            <li> Great product. love the smell</li>
            <li> It was for my boyfriend and I love the smell of it.  More men should smell so good</li>
            <li> Great buy--- this is a huge bottle at less than you would  pay for a small bottle  in a store</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.  Nothing special about this fragrance.  To be honest, it smells kind of cheap.  It has sort of a cheap, chemical smell to it.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.  I bought Reserve by Perry Ellis and liked it a lot.  Reserve, to me, has sort of creamy Anise, Cinnamon smell.  I thought this might be as high quality.  No, it&#x27;s not. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> i love perry ellis cologne but i order blue and you guys send me red so i not to happy i keep it because take more time to getting back and i rening outs of cologne</li>
