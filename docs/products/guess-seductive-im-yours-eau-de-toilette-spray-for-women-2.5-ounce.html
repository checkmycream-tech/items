            <li> Great scent but doesn&#x27;t last long.  I put on 3 pumps first thing in the a.m. (a LOT for perfume) and can&#x27;t smell it at all a few hours later.  My $10 body sprays from meijer last longer ...</li>
            <li> Guess Seductive I&#x27;m Yours Eau De Toilette Spray for Women, 2.5 Ounce.. Delivered on time. Nice perfume, it was a gift and my wife really like it.</li>
            <li> No complaints.. SATISFIED</li>
            <li> This scent is really nice, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I loved this and I will buy again. Smells very good and I was very excited about buying it. Great option</li>
            <li> I perfume does not last long.  I was really looking forward to it but then it was just blahh!!!  No compliments on this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume. Smells nice and the scent lasts. The packaging is cute and it has a little charm on it. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing</li>
            <li> I bought this at the Guess Store in the mall for a friend at 60 dollars. Paid 25 dollars on this site for a 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> My daughter in-law bought it for me several years ago, but it seems GUESS doesn&#x27;t carry it any more.  My 14 year old grand daughter just fell in love with it, but I couldn&#x27;t find it.  Then I thought about Amazon--did they carry it?--yes they did, so I bought it for her for Christmas.  Amazon saved me again.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice and soft but strong enough to last the day.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, light, enticing musky scent...everytime I wear it, I get complimented by both men and women.  I originally found it on clearance at a department store and then came to Amazon to find more...the price here is great!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love it&lt;br /&gt;the scent is amazing and it persists&lt;br /&gt;actually some people asked me what perfume i use&lt;br /&gt;i will buy this again</li>
            <li> I used to purchased this perfume from Macy&#x27;s at double the cost advertised here.  So, at first, I thought it was going to be a cheaper version or else.  I took the chance anyway and ordered.  I was very happy when I was able to confirm the bottle purchased here had the same quality as the ones purchased at the retailer store.  Since then, I&#x27;ve always purchased this perfume from this seller.</li>
            <li> Producto recomendado.</li>
            <li> Fabulous perfume, smells great.  Shipping was super fast.  I love this perfume.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and I get allot of compliments on it.</li>
