            <li>Thank you to the person who made this product.  :)</li>

            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>extremely pleased with product and service from seller</li>
            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>i would love it</li>
            <li>I have so many hair tools: a 1&amp;#34; curler, a 1 1/4&amp;#34; curler, a straightener, a crimper, and a blow-dryer.</li>
            <li>If in the future they could put even more slots in, that&#x27;d be awesome.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The Hair dryer section functions well and the large holder for the hair straightener is good.</li>
            <li>Has made my vanity more organized and clean looking.</li>
            <li>But overall, I am so happy and satisfied that I bought this.</li>
            <li>so I ended up relocating all my styling tools to my bedroom where I do my makeup in front of a huge mirror, and it&#x27;s been a great success thanks to this product C:</li>
            <li>Rubber gasket for the bottom was not so easy to put on, but that was because I wasn&#x27;t looking at how it was suppose to fit.</li>
            <li>Nice product, fast ship.</li>
            <li>Such a great idea that there is a 3 outlets attached however the outlets are spaced to close together</li>
            <li>I love how there are 3 outlet plugs right there</li>
            <li>Very useful tool for hair dyer and curling irons.  </li>
            <li>The outlet on the front is very useful.</li>
            <li>It keeps my irons organized and accessible.</li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m glad I paid for it because it is pretty sturdy metal.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly.</li>
            <li>one of the iron holes could be bigger, but I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Love that power outlet is attached,  works well and solid...doesn&#x27;t fit anything bigger than 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Well worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>Because it won&#x27;t fit anything more than a 1 1/4&amp;#34; curler, and my straightener only fits in</li>
            <li>Also a place that can be used for a flat iron would have been nice.</li>
            <li>The black finish is very nice, the item is high quality!  </li>
            <li>This item is a nice weight, only had one screw for the &amp;#34;put together&amp;#34;  and is very practical.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I want.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly whay I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>Although it took a few weeks to arrive, this product is wonderful for a normally cluttered bathroom vanity that only had one outlet!  </li>
            <li>The sturdiness is great especially since it has to hold other metal tools</li>
            <li>Holds hair dryer in large holder.</li>
            <li>AND the prongs are loose when I plug them in which is a huge inconvenience!</li>
            <li>Can move the whole unit to the other bathroom easily, too!  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair tools very organized.</li>
            <li>I get ready at.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and heavy too so it stays put.</li>
            <li>I was able to plug this in and put it on the other end of our vanity.  </li>
            <li>Makes my counter/dresser appear less cluttered, more organized and everytime</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product been waiting for years for someone to make one of these.</li>
            <li>, it makes my 1 1/4 curling iron stand up too high, should&#x27;ve just made it a hole to slide through.</li>
            <li>Love this, the only thumbs down would be that it doesn&#x27;t fit a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone professional hairdresser or for home use.</li>
            <li>It sits on my dresser and looks very professional.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and this one is by far the bestest!</li>
            <li>Just wow.</li>
            <li>We only have one outlet in our bathroom and it is right next to the door.  </li>

            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> and this one is by far the bestest!</li>
            <li> Just wow.</li>
            <li> We only have one outlet in our bathroom and it is right next to the door.  </li>
            <li> Also, make the smaller curling iron holders (2) larger to accommodate flat irons which is what a majority of stylists use nowadays.</li>
            <li> Flat iron fits in closed holder.</li>
            <li> My blow dryer topples the whole thing over and the base is HUGE</li>
            <li> Although the only issues I have with it are: the outlet plugs are upside down,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, thick, durable, very strong, it&#x27;s not whimpy nor weak.</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, just wish the closed holder was longer.</li>
            <li> Curling iron fits in other closed ended holder.</li>
            <li> The two small holders should have been made bigger-</li>
            <li> Brush and comb fits in other slots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked at all other hair tool holders out there</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s really no cord-tangeling messiness!</li>
            <li> The base is heavy doesn&#x27;t tip over and all of my hair dryers fit and my flat iron.</li>
            <li> because she had blow dryer and stuff all over the little table that I have to walk by</li>
            <li> The outlet portion (reason I bought this one) was completely missing in my package.</li>
            <li> This is worth buying, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not suitable for a small counter.</li>
            <li> Only problem I&#x27;ve had with it is that the plug ins are too close to the base.</li>
            <li> The plug was partially broken</li>
            <li> The only difficulty was getting the rubber trim to stay on the base.</li>
            <li> The base is quite wide and takes up a lot of bathroom counter space.</li>
            <li> One little wing nut attaches the stand and base.</li>
            <li> Impossible to get the rubber gasket to go on the base.</li>
            <li> The plug in on the base helps keep everything portable.</li>
            <li> This product has a sturdy base that will keep things in place and not tip over.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this thing! Only problem I&#x27;ve had with it is that the plug ins are too close to the base. i can only plug in one accessory if my hair dryer is plugged in.</li>
            <li> This is a good product when you want the styling accessories off your counter &amp; out of your way.  I also bought it to save my bathroom counter from possible burns.</li>
            <li> Love that power outlet is attached,  works well and solid...doesn&#x27;t fit anything bigger than 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really happy that I purchased this. It keeps my hair tools very organized.</li>
            <li> The plug was partially broken</li>
            <li> Nice product, fast ship. This item is a nice weight, only had one screw for the &amp;#34;put together&amp;#34;  and is very practical. The Hair dryer section functions well and the large holder for the hair straightener is good. The two small holders should have been made bigger- they do not function for anything I have. Having the outlet attached is a big plus. Over all a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Love it</li>
            <li> It works great.Takes all the clutter off the counter.</li>
            <li> This will make a very nice gift for the women in my house. packaged nicely and delivered on-time</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s bathroom and it is perfect to hold all of her things and keep her organized</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect size and held the essentials my wife uses I no longer have to wrap up her cords every day!</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s sturdy and looks good too:)</li>
            <li> Just as described. Love the plug in being on the stand. Holds hair dryer in large holder. Flat iron fits in closed holder. Curling iron fits in other closed ended holder. Brush and comb fits in other slots. Rubber gasket for the bottom was not so easy to put on, but that was because I wasn&#x27;t looking at how it was suppose to fit. Great product.</li>
            <li> Totally in love with this thing! It&#x27;s a great way to maximize your outlets without creating too much clutter. My bathroom is pretty small so I ended up relocating all my styling tools to my bedroom where I do my makeup in front of a huge mirror, and it&#x27;s been a great success thanks to this product C:</li>
            <li> Great product with fast shipping</li>
            <li> Love this for my makeup room now everything looks more organized.</li>
            <li> This works great for the bathroom counter. I use it at home.</li>
            <li> Worked well for my handicapped sister</li>
            <li> Love this!!! It keeps my irons organized and accessible. It is a good size and fits nicely on my table I get ready at.</li>
            <li> Although it took a few weeks to arrive, this product is wonderful for a normally cluttered bathroom vanity that only had one outlet!  Now I can keep my toothbrush plugged in and keep the hair dryer/iron/flatiron in one place.  Can move the whole unit to the other bathroom easily, too!  I love it!  The black finish is very nice, the item is high quality!  Well worth waiting for.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product been waiting for years for someone to make one of these. The base is heavy doesn&#x27;t tip over and all of my hair dryers fit and my flat iron. I would highly recommend this product to anyone professional hairdresser or for home use. Thank you to the person who made this product.  :)</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  Works, looks just like it should.  The only difficulty was getting the rubber trim to stay on the base.</li>
            <li> The outlet portion (reason I bought this one) was completely missing in my package. My blow dryer topples the whole thing over and the base is HUGE so it&#x27;s not suitable for a small counter.</li>
            <li> Love LOVE this stand! Such a great idea that there is a 3 outlets attached however the outlets are spaced to close together AND the prongs are loose when I plug them in which is a huge inconvenience! Also, make the smaller curling iron holders (2) larger to accommodate flat irons which is what a majority of stylists use nowadays. If those things were updated, these would be top notch!</li>
            <li> Wow! Just wow. What a great idea and a very sturdy product. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Great organizational idea! The plug in on the base helps keep everything portable. Love it!</li>
            <li> ALMOST perfect...one of the iron holes could be bigger, but I love it!</li>
            <li> Was a welcome and  wonderful  gift  for  my  daughter  for  Christmas .</li>
            <li> This is worth buying, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You have to assemble, but works great</li>
            <li> Very useful tool for hair dyer and curling irons.  I use two of the slots for my brushes since I only use one curling iron.  Has made my vanity more organized and clean looking.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It was exactly what I want.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> extremely pleased with product and service from seller</li>
            <li> I think this is great.  It sits on my dresser and looks very professional.</li>
            <li> This thing is great.  I bought it for my wife because she had blow dryer and stuff all over the little table that I have to walk by and this got them off the table and makes it easier to plug them all in.  It&#x27;s nice and heavy too so it stays put.</li>
            <li> I really love it but my the bending part wont stay up to hold my hairdryer would need lite dryer otherwise i would love it</li>
            <li> Keeps everything organized and if I forget to turn off my curling iron I don&#x27;t have to worry because I place it in the holder and it stays away from anything that could cause fire.</li>
            <li> Works perfect, she loves it.</li>
            <li> This thing is AMAZING! One little wing nut attaches the stand and base. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> It does exactly whay I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> Love this, the only thumbs down would be that it doesn&#x27;t fit a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I like this item because it keeps my bathroom well organized and it has an outlet on it so no need for extension cord. I would highly recommend because its wonderful and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as space saving as I was hoping. The base is quite wide and takes up a lot of bathroom counter space. In terms of holding my tools, it works out great though! The outlet on the front is very useful.</li>
            <li> keeps the salon organized.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly. It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am returning this item. Impossible to get the rubber gasket to go on the base.</li>
            <li> This product has a sturdy base that will keep things in place and not tip over. It&#x27;s great having additional plugs at table level.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, just wish the closed holder was longer. It works for my regular shorter curling iron but not for my curling wand. Also a place that can be used for a flat iron would have been nice.</li>
            <li> This is actually quality material. For the price, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m glad I paid for it because it is pretty sturdy metal. It&#x27;s heavy, thick, durable, very strong, it&#x27;s not whimpy nor weak. The sturdiness is great especially since it has to hold other metal tools lol. I&#x27;ve looked at all other hair tool holders out there and this one is by far the bestest! I love how there are 3 outlet plugs right there, it makes it so convenient for my hair tools with shorter cords. Although the only issues I have with it are: the outlet plugs are upside down, which I don&#x27;t like, I don&#x27;t like the slot that is blocked underneath, it makes my 1 1/4 curling iron stand up too high, should&#x27;ve just made it a hole to slide through. Also, I think the blow-dryer slot could&#x27;ve been bigger, I&#x27;m gonna have to take a hammer and try to spread out the bar cuz it&#x27;s not big enough for my blow-dryer to sit in sturdily. Also, for convenience purposes, I think they should&#x27;ve made each slot/hole bigger! Because it won&#x27;t fit anything more than a 1 1/4&amp;#34; curler, and my straightener only fits in it opened. I have so many hair tools: a 1&amp;#34; curler, a 1 1/4&amp;#34; curler, a straightener, a crimper, and a blow-dryer. If in the future they could put even more slots in, that&#x27;d be awesome. But overall, I am so happy and satisfied that I bought this. Makes my counter/dresser appear less cluttered, more organized and everytime I style my hair, there&#x27;s really no cord-tangeling messiness! If you have many hair tools and want them more organized, get this!!!! I love it.</li>
            <li> It came quick an works great!</li>
            <li> LOVE love LOVE this!  We only have one outlet in our bathroom and it is right next to the door.  I was able to plug this in and put it on the other end of our vanity.  Now I have three outlets on this holder and one open outlet on the wall!</li>
            <li> I love it! I just wish the cord went through the bottom</li>
