            <li>Great cologne makes my man spell wonderful!  </li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Superb fragrance - manly and uniquely effective.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered on time, smells great.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS GREAt WITH MY BODY CHEMISTRY, AND</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re some office dweller who likes to go out once in a while and smell good for your girl.  </li>
            <li>Good scent</li>
            <li>Good Job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VAI</li>
            <li>(But, in a good way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This version is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used it for @ 20 years, but remember how the ladies leaving marks all over my neck, because it smells &amp; (I guess) tastes so good</li>
            <li>but it still smells so good.</li>
            <li>Frank Sinatra would have loved it -- in fact ultra-dry fougeres like this were all the rage during the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; era.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly and in good shape and my husband smells divine!!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It seems always to attract nice compliments.  </li>
            <li>and that is the kind of scent i am into any way.</li>
            <li>It is really one of the best I have ever got and plan to have more YSL products.</li>
            <li>refreshing  and eye catching fragrance..</li>
            <li>I would describe this fragrance as a soft, very pleasant sandalwoody sort of scent.  </li>
            <li>I simply love this one...</li>
            <li>Love this, you don&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li>Love this cologne, will continue to buy it for my husband</li>
            <li>still my husband favorite. : )</li>
            <li>It is my favorite and I am glad to see it can still be purchased at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is bright, fresh with the lime overtones I wanted.</li>
            <li>you either love or hate.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>personally love it.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll probably love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I use many years, and leave.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s all-time favorite.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Jazz for more than 20 years now.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Jazz\\&quot; is an appropriate name for this, and the art-deco piano-bar bottle is a hoot.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and lasts all day long!</li>
            <li>Good service and shipping fast,</li>
            <li>Not too strong, not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you want to spice it up around people that don&#x27;t like strong, overbearing fragrance, this could work for you.</li>
            <li>My husband use to use JAZZ when we first met &amp; married, but had not been able to find it until I found it on line..wonderful fragrance!!</li>
            <li>it seems to be genuine to me.</li>
            <li>I AM CONSTANTLY GETTING COMPLIMENTS OF HOW GREAT I SMELL.  </li>
            <li>It had this stinging chemically smell that my original bottle didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>Jazz is one of those \\&quot;unique</li>
            <li>my dad love it so much</li>
            <li>Not bad / not</li>
            <li>Not a bad fragrance, just not my thing.</li>
            <li>too sweet or too rugged, delivery was quick and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>I use this parfum for ten years now and i am very satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift for my uncle and he loved it, unknowingly he said that YSL was actually the first cologne he had ever gotten.</li>
            <li>&quot;  Worth it?  </li>
            <li>wanted a fresh, lime/citrus, sort of cologne and saw this one reviewed well.</li>
            <li>This is the product i&#x27;m looking for because its the old one an it really Nice product and very appriciate it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance itself is very good and last long.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>I immediately realized that it didn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li>is right...</li>
            <li>Unless your wife or girlfriend has very specific preferences or is some kind of bloodhound, she&#x27;ll likely find this appealing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you skip the Jazz and go right to the Live Jazz which is a phenomenal summer/spring cologne that will turn heads.</li>
            <li>Been using it over the years, tried other and glad to buy it again such a good deal.</li>
            <li>Jazz is actually a more modern take by YSL, though it is really a stand alone fragrance in its own right and has virtually nothing in common with original Jazz.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the scent on this product lasts about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>and I know exactly how it should smell.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I use to love this fragrance back in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT IN 1998.</li>
            <li>This is apparently a note-for-note remake of the classic Yardley While Label, but it&#x27;s better because it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Hope they will always make it for next generations to enjoy and to appreciate.</li>
            <li>for me it lasts almost whole day</li>
            <li>Haha...</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Smelled this on an airline attendant and had to ask what he was wearing?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a very pungent smell to it</li>
            <li>I held up my old bottle and compared it to this one and sure enough, they smell different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally, I consider this one of the true masterpieces of men&#x27;s perfumery.</li>
            <li>That guy&#x27;s such a douche anyway and found this possibly fake cologne somehow &amp;#34;smelling awesome, bro!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>the cologne a Junior High kid wears when he doesn&#x27;t know any</li>
            <li>Or do what real men used to do, don&#x27;t bathe unless it rains and bring home wild boar.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Turns out, there is \\&quot;Jazz\\&quot; and then there is \\&quot;Live Jazz\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find Live Jazz on Amazon for about $30?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this scent from year past.</li>
            <li>Someone looking for a masculine fragrance this is def a GO GO!</li>
            <li>It took a while longer to get here, than they said it would, but not a big deal ;)</li>
            <li>After using up my last bottle, I decided to order it online since it was pretty much 50% cheaper than buying it at the local mall.</li>
            <li>It does not last as long as the original 90&#x27;s version used to but still sober.</li>
            <li>It removed the more gimmicky smells of the black and white plastic bottle and left the core sensual and sophisticated masculine alone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softly woodsy and spicy.  </li>
            <li>Yea, thats how old it is</li>
            <li>The brisk tang of lavender and the quiet warmth of sandalwood make this a scent that&#x27;s clean, dry, subtle, and supremely elegant -- this will make you smell as if you&#x27;d just gotten out of the shower all day</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and this size bottle has lasted him over 6 months :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Young folks will not be understood wearing this, but a confident serious gentleman can pull off this fougere magnificently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Long-lasting masculine scent not overpowering like other really fits all types.</li>
            <li>It is much in line with other old timers like Tsar, CK Obsession and etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>long lasting and really seductive fragrance...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, everything about this product is top notch in terms of longevity and overall quality, but I just don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s  worse is it&#x27;s not returnable because its considered hazardous due to Amazon&#x27;s policy.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s (and my) favorite cologne and it is so hard to find where we live and if available, it&#x27;s outrageously expensive!  </li>
            <li>This is hugely disappointing to me because YSL Live Jazz is one of my all time favorite colognes.</li>

            <li> This is hugely disappointing to me because YSL Live Jazz is one of my all time favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t linger for twenty yards behind you but for the one that gets close enough it is just right.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t promise extra nookie or supermodels breaking down your door, but this might make the difference between a fun night out and an otherwise identical night out with at least one girl saying,</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about how long I&#x27;ve been wearing this stuff and still get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Smell lasts long too.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS GETTING HARDER TO FIND NOW DAYS, SO</li>
            <li> I will try this other Jazz soon also.</li>
            <li> The first impression was not impressive</li>
            <li> a little more spice and less floral but not to bad.</li>
            <li> I suppose this is a bit of a niche cologne, you love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> but as the days passed and I continued using it, its base note started to have its captivating effect.</li>
            <li> im truly picky when it comes down to fragrance</li>
            <li> I wish the price was little lower.</li>
            <li> Avoid the new, small, and expensive cube bottle--it has been watered down into nothing.  </li>

            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, if you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re probably not a hunter or a truck driver.  You&#x27;re some office dweller who likes to go out once in a while and smell good for your girl.  Unless your wife or girlfriend has very specific preferences or is some kind of bloodhound, she&#x27;ll likely find this appealing. I can&#x27;t promise extra nookie or supermodels breaking down your door, but this might make the difference between a fun night out and an otherwise identical night out with at least one girl saying, \\&quot;You smell nice.\\&quot;  Worth it?  You decide.  Or do what real men used to do, don&#x27;t bathe unless it rains and bring home wild boar.  You won&#x27;t get compliments, but you&#x27;ll get their respect!</li>
            <li> Good scent my dad love it so much</li>
            <li> Husband is a great lover of this cologne!</li>
            <li> I simply love this one...you can wear it in morning and it will be on you until next morning....long lasting and really seductive fragrance...Try it and you will not repent. I have been wearing it since over 12 years!</li>
            <li> Good Job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VAI CORINTHIANS! Campeão Brasileiro de 2011!&lt;br /&gt;VAI CORINTHIANS! Campeão Brasileiro de 2011!&lt;br /&gt;VAI CORINTHIANS! Campeão Brasileiro de 2011!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about how long I&#x27;ve been wearing this stuff and still get compliments on it. I will be buried with it on.</li>
            <li> Love this, you don&#x27;t smell too sweet or too rugged, delivery was quick and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat. I will try this other Jazz soon also.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have bought this product for years now as a gift for my Husband.  I have tried to get  him to try something else but he won´t stray from this scent.  Not overpowering, just right.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, will continue to buy it for my husband</li>
            <li> I would describe this fragrance as a soft, very pleasant sandalwoody sort of scent.  It&#x27;s softly woodsy and spicy.  Not too strong, not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to spice it up around people that don&#x27;t like strong, overbearing fragrance, this could work for you.</li>
            <li> still my husband favorite. : )</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s (and my) favorite cologne and it is so hard to find where we live and if available, it&#x27;s outrageously expensive!  Product came quickly and in good shape and my husband smells divine!! LOL</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my uncle and he loved it, unknowingly he said that YSL was actually the first cologne he had ever gotten. Smell lasts long too.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the scent on this product lasts about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> refreshing  and eye catching fragrance..thank u all for suggestion..im truly picky when it comes down to fragrance cant wait to mix this and kick it up a notch</li>
            <li> Superb fragrance - manly and uniquely effective.  Hope they will always make it for next generations to enjoy and to appreciate. I have been using it for over 20 years.  It seems always to attract nice compliments.  It has become a signature fragrance for me. George Brzostowski SC, Canberra Australia.</li>
            <li> Not what I remember from back in the day. a little more spice and less floral but not to bad.</li>
            <li> Love this scent from year past. It is my favorite and I am glad to see it can still be purchased at Amazon.com. Smells wonderful and lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using YSL Jazz to attract the ladies for the past 2 years now. After using up my last bottle, I decided to order it online since it was pretty much 50% cheaper than buying it at the local mall. Boy, was that a mistake. After receiving the cologne in the mail, I open it up, sprayed it on and went to work. I immediately realized that it didn&#x27;t smell right. It had this stinging chemically smell that my original bottle didn&#x27;t have. The smell made me so nauseated that I had to pull over and vomit on the side of the road. No way I was gonna go work with this so I drive back home, shower, and get on with life. I held up my old bottle and compared it to this one and sure enough, they smell different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this same brand for years and I know exactly how it should smell. The one being sold here is not the same! What&#x27;s  worse is it&#x27;s not returnable because its considered hazardous due to Amazon&#x27;s policy. I can&#x27;t even believe that Amazon would allow this. So what do I do? I wrap back up and gave it away as a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; to that guy I hate in the office. That guy&#x27;s such a douche anyway and found this possibly fake cologne somehow &amp;#34;smelling awesome, bro!&amp;#34; Go figure.</li>
            <li> How do you review a product that is so subjective to each person? You just give your opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a fresh, lime/citrus, sort of cologne and saw this one reviewed well. I have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you want a heavy outdoor fragrance like Aspen or Z-14. But I like to have a choice and added this to my wish list.&lt;br /&gt;It is bright, fresh with the lime overtones I wanted. It doesn&#x27;t linger for twenty yards behind you but for the one that gets close enough it is just right.</li>
            <li> Long-lasting masculine scent not overpowering like other really fits all types. Been using it over the years, tried other and glad to buy it again such a good deal.</li>
            <li> Very outdated scent. Not to say that its bad, but its certainly not for the younger crowd. It is much in line with other old timers like Tsar, CK Obsession and etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young folks will not be understood wearing this, but a confident serious gentleman can pull off this fougere magnificently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live Jazz is actually a more modern take by YSL, though it is really a stand alone fragrance in its own right and has virtually nothing in common with original Jazz.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find Live Jazz on Amazon for about $30?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, there is \\&quot;Jazz\\&quot; and then there is \\&quot;Live Jazz\\&quot;. Totally different colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live Jazz is one of those \\&quot;unique scents\\&quot;---that you either love or hate.&lt;br /&gt;I personally love it. To me it smells like lemons and sweat...(But, in a good way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t know there was also a \\&quot;jazz\\&quot;...I ordered that by accident.&lt;br /&gt;It is spicy and cinnamon smelling.&lt;br /&gt;More of a: \\&quot;It&#x27;s night time and I&#x27;m a guido hanging out in the mall\\&quot; scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like generic cologne. Not bad / not good.&lt;br /&gt;Like the cologne a Junior High kid wears when he doesn&#x27;t know any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live Jazz is one of my favorites--This one is not my cup of tea.&lt;br /&gt;But, I have weird taste so you&#x27;ll probably love it.</li>
            <li> This version is the second obvious reformulation.  It removed the more gimmicky smells of the black and white plastic bottle and left the core sensual and sophisticated masculine alone.  Ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, this was updated again by L&#x27;Oreal, who destroyed it.  Avoid the new, small, and expensive cube bottle--it has been watered down into nothing.  This version is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> RaJuR real deep kool on the web and YOUTUBE!!!</li>
            <li> I use this parfum for ten years now and i am very satisfied with this one. It was delivered on time, smells great. Very satisfied. My recommendation.</li>
            <li> This is one of the oldest colognes in the Market. My dad used to wear it and now me. The projection; longevity with this thing is crazy! for me it lasts almost whole day and that is the kind of scent i am into any way. Someone looking for a masculine fragrance this is def a GO GO!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it in department stores or any stores out here in Washington. I was amazed to finally find JAZZ online. Haha...I hadn&#x27;t used it for @ 20 years, but remember how the ladies leaving marks all over my neck, because it smells &amp; (I guess) tastes so good ;) Everything was shipped great! It took a while longer to get here, than they said it would, but not a big deal ;)</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it everday for 13 years.  I get a lot of compliments from women.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I use many years, and leave.&lt;br /&gt;Now I went back to buy I think it has lost a bit of quality, as it evaporates very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is the same</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband. I use to love this fragrance back in the 80&#x27;s. Yea, thats how old it is but it still smells so good. Shipping was fast but I heard its been hard to find so I just may have to order him another bottle!!</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing!!!!  My husband&#x27;s all-time favorite.  A little bit goes a long way and this size bottle has lasted him over 6 months :)</li>
            <li> Great cologne makes my man spell wonderful!  Smelled this on an airline attendant and had to ask what he was wearing?</li>
            <li> The fragrance itself is very good and last long. It does not last as long as the original 90&#x27;s version used to but still sober. I wish the price was little lower.</li>
            <li> The YSL colognes are some of the best, that&#x27;s why I decided to give this one a try. It&#x27;s a quality bottle, quality packaging and the price is right... but it&#x27;s not my favorite fragrance. I suppose this is a bit of a niche cologne, you love it or hate it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, everything about this product is top notch in terms of longevity and overall quality, but I just don&#x27;t really like the smell. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m rating it on, the smell. Not a bad fragrance, just not my thing.</li>
            <li> Excellent...My husband use to use JAZZ when we first met &amp; married, but had not been able to find it until I found it on line..wonderful fragrance!!</li>
            <li> I was worried that I might be buying a knock-off or fake of some kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it seems to be genuine to me. I&#x27;ve been using Jazz for more than 20 years now. You decide if the scent works for you. If it does, this seems to be a reliable supplier. (I&#x27;ve now bought a number of bottles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your Jazz!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Jazz\\&quot; is an appropriate name for this, and the art-deco piano-bar bottle is a hoot. Frank Sinatra would have loved it -- in fact ultra-dry fougeres like this were all the rage during the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; era. This is apparently a note-for-note remake of the classic Yardley While Label, but it&#x27;s better because it lasts longer. The brisk tang of lavender and the quiet warmth of sandalwood make this a scent that&#x27;s clean, dry, subtle, and supremely elegant -- this will make you smell as if you&#x27;d just gotten out of the shower all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re tired of scents that smell like bug-spray, laundry detergent or your granny&#x27;s fruit-bowl, I beg you -- do this as a blind buy. You&#x27;ll NEVER regret it! Personally, I consider this one of the true masterpieces of men&#x27;s perfumery.</li>
            <li> I THINK I STARTED USING THIS COLOGNE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT IN 1998. IT WORKS GREAt WITH MY BODY CHEMISTRY, AND I AM CONSTANTLY GETTING COMPLIMENTS OF HOW GREAT I SMELL.  THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS GETTING HARDER TO FIND NOW DAYS, SO WHEN I FIND IT I USUALLY ORDER 3-4 BOTTLES AT A TIME.</li>
            <li> The first impression was not impressive but as the days passed and I continued using it, its base note started to have its captivating effect. It is really one of the best I have ever got and plan to have more YSL products.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer - don&#x27;t read any further if you already use and like this cologne because this may turn you off of the scent for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this cologne simply smells like dirty baby diaper. It&#x27;s got a very pungent smell to it and it really does evoke that dirty diaper, eau-de-porta-potty scent and I simply don&#x27;t like it. This is hugely disappointing to me because YSL Live Jazz is one of my all time favorite colognes. I highly recommend you skip the Jazz and go right to the Live Jazz which is a phenomenal summer/spring cologne that will turn heads.</li>
            <li> This is the product i&#x27;m looking for because its the old one an it really Nice product and very appriciate it. Good service and shipping fast,</li>
