            <li>it would be nice.  </li>

            <li>In my search for a replacement I came across this one and liked what I saw.</li>
            <li>Nice brush for the money.  </li>
            <li>The 2 minute timer is a nice idea.</li>
            <li>package was in good state when delivered, and my friend&#x27;s child love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The 2 minute timer thing is also a nice touch.</li>

            <li>He liked it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s some kind of ulterior motive going on.</li>
            <li>He liked it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s some kind of ulterior motive going on.</li>

            <li>Good buy :)</li>
            <li>Loving this for my kids.</li>
            <li>It felt so nice</li>

            <li>Reliable, good price, effective, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re super happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li>Make good brushing very quick work</li>
            <li>They all seem to enjoy them and do a good job with them when brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my 9 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find any toothbrushes that specified the softness of the brushes, so I chose this one because it&#x27;s suitable for kids.</li>
            <li>good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)</li>
            <li>Works great and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Much more powerful and the battery life is great.  </li>

            <li>This is a very good product and I enjoy using it very much</li>
            <li>I gave this 5 stars because it was just perfect for my tween boy who is 11 and isn&#x27;t so much into super hero tooth brushes anymore.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is perfect to start in this whole new world of good cleaning habits.</li>
            <li>It is what it is, nothing more, nothing less...works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to parents who want their kids to do a better job cleaning their teeth.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love these just wish the batteries lasted longer</li>
            <li>The dental tech recommended Braun and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Takes a bit getting used to, but mouth already feels better after not even a week.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more is there to say about how well it works than that?  </li>
            <li>Always squirming and trying to leave, this tooth brush mashes me feel and notice that his teeth get cleaned better because of the rotating motion.</li>
            <li>The design on the handle is cute and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have done more research,</li>
            <li>Love the tooth brushes for the kids.</li>
            <li>Love the timer for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an Oral B brush for yours (so many years that it cost $20 when I bought it and came with 3 brush heads at Walmart).  </li>
            <li>I like the job the toothbrush does, and I love the price.  </li>
            <li>This more for kids</li>
            <li>But the price on this was appealing, so why not?  </li>
            <li>For me, this one makes the most sense.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and it is a much better option for him.  </li>
            <li>but it does better than when I help him with a hand brush.  </li>
            <li>All children could benefit from the better cleaning of an electric brush.  </li>
            <li>Great product shipping was fast</li>
            <li>we love it</li>
            <li>This one works even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my dentist will be giving me a thumbs up.</li>
            <li>this cannot possibly be the best kids toothbrush they make.</li>
            <li>and yes, as most parents will tell you, stubboner is a word.</li>
            <li>and yes, as most parents will tell you, stubboner is a word.</li>
            <li>I would continue shelling out money for battery-powered spin brushes a couple more years.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have two of these toothbrushes for both my kids, they both love it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great item</li>
            <li>Kids love them.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace one I&#x27;ve had for many years.</li>
            <li>They absolutely love it</li>
            <li>and it works much better than the battery powered ones.</li>
            <li>They both wear braces &amp; they love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>this price my kids have 1 each :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Our kids love those.</li>
            <li>After using the brush 10 times I decided to not use it any more.</li>
            <li>I am sure she will love it.</li>
            <li>Pretty good</li>
            <li>Pretty good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter was excited!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are easy to find and most department stores have a store brand that is cheaper.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dentist as a good one that is more gentle than the Sonicare we already have at home.</li>
            <li>My daughter can use this toothbrush on her own and it does such a great job compared to hand brushing.  </li>
            <li>This lets me so it myself, and gets his teeth sparkly clean!</li>
            <li>toothbrush is fine, although it needs more than one speed.</li>
            <li>It works nicely to clean my teeth with stars printed on it!  </li>
            <li>Charge lasts and the action is great.</li>
            <li>The soft brush makes me feel great about using it on her teeth.</li>
            <li>is a great starter electric for a child.&lt;br /&gt;Since my child began using this, the oral hygienist and dentist have seen marked improvement in her teeth and gums...</li>
            <li>Kids loved the graphics and love having their own power brushes that actually work (unlike the battery powered versions which seem woefully underpowered).&lt;br</li>
            <li>My kids love them, as much as they can love a toothbrush, so that works for me!</li>
            <li>This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned and is extremely affordable.  </li>
            <li>my kids could imitate easily....</li>
            <li>Easy to charge.</li>
            <li>so she could get a better clean.</li>
            <li>I would advise, however, you go easy in breaking this in.</li>
            <li>but it is easily knocked over.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The brush is easy to use, cleans well, and comes with replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, You feel your teeth so clean.</li>
            <li>The brush snaps in easily.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a couple of weeks for me, and then it recharges easily in the brush.  </li>
            <li>Easy for my daughter to use.</li>
            <li>I now understand others&#x27; comments about this toothbrush being too noisy and the vibration too strong.</li>
            <li>and I will leave mine soaking in a strong mouthwash  day and night.</li>
            <li>purchased this power toothbrush and a water irrigatir for her online.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very effective and the only toothbrush that we have been able to use painlessly and with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>and we don&#x27;t have to watch the timer to make sure they brush for the full time.  </li>
            <li>Other wise its a good product in my opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After almost 3 months with the replacement toothbrush everything is working out fine</li>
            <li>it should be fine and good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating updated to reflect replacement.</li>
            <li>Although it is marketed towards children, it works fine for adults as well.</li>
            <li>and I like it fine.</li>
            <li>This is easier to fit in and perfect size for little mouths and teeth.</li>
            <li>It is more powerful, too.</li>
            <li>Ionly wish there was some sort of light indicator for the timer.</li>
            <li>The slower spinning is great for younger kids.</li>
            <li>This product is great for cleaning braces, and I would definitely order it again</li>
            <li>I immediately went online to reorder, and found it was no longer available except in this model, which, according to reviews, is intended for kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t have a blinking light to show it&#x27;s charging&lt;br</li>
            <li>It appears to be well made and my daughter does enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>I honestly believe he really tried.</li>
            <li>Also wish there  was a charge indicator light.  </li>
            <li>We have had the brushes for several months now and they still work great.  </li>
            <li>regards to the transaction, from purchase to arrival, everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li>Light weight and compact.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light for charging.</li>
            <li>This is great gift for child as a reward to regular brushing of teeth.</li>
            <li>Great value for money, especially as it incudes 2 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I did&#x27;t feel comfortable using it</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It works well so far with good battery power.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>it workds really good and replaces my old toothbrush</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted for my daughter perfect for children to remind them how long they should be brushing</li>
            <li>The original brush works fine.</li>
            <li>It has a nice small head which makes it easy for him to use and the timer is great</li>
            <li>I was leery about purchasing this particular model, but I fell in love with it immediately!</li>
            <li>Perhaps I have received that very rare faulty item that slips through QA.</li>
            <li>I am lucky to be an old geezer with good genes when it comes to teeth.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and works as good as the one I paid nearly three times for.</li>
            <li>It seems to work well, and the novelty of it gets my kids excited to brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have been very happy with Oral B products in the past</li>
            <li>This is the first motorized toothbrush I have used, and I love it.</li>
            <li>no cavities!&lt;br /&gt;It does provide the 2 minute vibration change, which is important so that the child knows to brush the full two minutes as dentists recommend.  </li>
            <li>I had originally purchased one of these for my oldest daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>The mold had collected although, after use, I habitually shake and clean the brush in running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but effective on his teeth and fun for a kid.</li>
            <li>, she never felt her teeth feels so clean.</li>
            <li>Gives your teeth a clean feeling every time.</li>
            <li>this one is easier to clean</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and my gums don&#x27;t feel sanded.</li>
            <li>If you can get in there, swish around, make some contact, and buzz most teeth, you&#x27;re far better off than trying to use a manual one.</li>
            <li>bought for my granddaughter, just the right size for a child and easy to handle for a child</li>
            <li>And the price is right!</li>
            <li>In the time we have been using these toothbrushes we have made a trip to the dentist office for teeth cleaning and our dental techs say our teeth are very well taken care of and most of all clean.  </li>
            <li>He likes it and his teeth are super clean.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far</li>
            <li>It it superior to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It runs for a full 2 minutes with no indicator as to when to switch parts of your mouth.</li>
            <li>They cant quite do it for the full 2 min yet, but we are working on it.</li>
            <li>You can feel the buzz in your hand when you turn it on, but it&#x27;s not a bad vibration.</li>
            <li>my old one gave out, and this new one is working great.</li>
            <li>I liked the brush head because its small which is perfect for younger children</li>
            <li>Just like a dentist visit, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless the &amp;#34;signal&amp;#34; for the two minutes is not a &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; but just a quickly stop of the toothbrush...</li>
            <li>Luckily it broke within the 30 day</li>
            <li>Works better than the older model it is replacing</li>
            <li>Amazon of course madee a quick refund.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the timer that makes sure you brush enough</li>
            <li>Excellent toothbrush for the kids especially the 2min timer that helps ensure kids have proper brush time</li>
            <li>but so far so good cleans their teeth very well.</li>
            <li>The item shipped quickly and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>In the beginning two minutes seemed like forever for him, but it quickly became the norm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric toothbrushes in the past, but I liked that this one was affordable (including the refills), incredibly effective yet gentle, and doesn&#x27;t have too many &amp;#34;functions&amp;#34; or</li>
            <li>A manual toothbrush simply cannot clean as effectively as an Oral-B electric.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>love my new toothbrush</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s a great toothbrush, just like all my previous Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Since dental care is becoming so expensive, this is a great way to keep those teeth from decaying!</li>
            <li>Have to teach child to clean tooth manually first .</li>
            <li>First of all, these clean your teeth far better than can be achieved with a manual brush.</li>
            <li>It is OK I hope it will stay good for toothbrushing at least 1 year</li>
            <li>After many years of service my old Oral-B Rechargeable  Toothbrush stopped working.</li>
            <li>It was time for me to replace my old one, since it wasn&#x27;t keeping it&#x27;s charge for more than 3 days.</li>
            <li>and my smile is prettier.</li>
            <li>I love the soft brushes.</li>
            <li>He is 7 years old now and he is still enjoying his spin brush.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this sensitive Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>Works well, powerful scrubbing.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are simple, sanitary (no seems or cracks), and effective (no over brushing anymore, and no plaque).  </li>
            <li>For the price, it was absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>ortho-head is worth it if you&#x27;re buying it for someone with braces.</li>
            <li>ortho-head is worth it if you&#x27;re buying it for someone with braces.</li>
            <li>They are well worth the money IMO.</li>
            <li>It is deserving of zero stars rather than 1 star as I noted that others have the same problem.  </li>
            <li>Fun design.</li>
            <li>Braun builds a quality tooth brush that is well worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one will be returned and I will chalk this up to just a rare defective unit.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my 10 year old, she love it!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>My 5 &amp; 3 year old love brushing their teeth now.</li>
            <li>The youthful decals are worth the savings.</li>
            <li>and my teeth seemed more sensitive afterward.</li>
            <li>In limited time, these brushes manage to do a pretty good job of powering off all the gunk.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased a sonicare kids tooth brush for my 5 year son and it was too much for him.  </li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>Is the right price and lasts years.</li>
            <li>It worked right out of the box and we haven&#x27;t had any issue with it.</li>
            <li>this is a great motivation  for tweens to brush teeth long enough to clean them well.  </li>
            <li>The battery needs about 16 hours to get a full charge, but if you set it on its stand in the morning it&#x27;s ready for you by bedtime and should hold that charge for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>This brush (with the extra gentle head) is kind to your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Although it is sold for young people, I am using it as an adult and loving it.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy one of the more expensive rechargeables for him, so this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>Just like the adult version, does a fine job.</li>
            <li>now have a replacement that so far is working fine.</li>
            <li>Our dentist put us on one of these and my gums have recovered normal depths, and, of course our teeth are really clean.</li>
            <li>It has more of an open area in the middle to fit around braces to clean around the edges of the brackets.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has more of an open area in the middle to fit around braces to clean around the edges of the brackets.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Kids will really like having this product , its fun to they do not want to stop brushing their teeth</li>
            <li>and it definitely helps him do a better job cleaning his teeth than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>More chance of splatter with only one speed</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I like it.  </li>
            <li>They work better than regular toothbrushes do.</li>
            <li>And the soft bristled head is so comfortable.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using them for many years - they don&#x27;t last for ever.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>This is it exactly.</li>
            <li>Cute design and larger grip for tween age kids.  </li>
            <li>Nothing too fancy, but definitely better than a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>First month checkup</li>
            <li>Much better than the throw away toothbrushes that we have been buying at the local box store.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud and cheap sounding.</li>
            <li>I like it better than former snooker....</li>
            <li>This one works very well for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the brushheads aren&#x27;t too big</li>
            <li>I searched Amazon for &amp;#34;toothbrush for braces&amp;#34; but this brush came up first.</li>
            <li>That bugged me out at 1st, but it hasn&#x27;t died, so I guess it&#x27;s charging ;)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty hardy brushes.</li>
            <li>It works well and there are no complicated \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Great brush plenty of power and long lasting charge!</li>
            <li>My old heads fit onto my kid&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They make a vibrating noise that the kids can hear and feel after 2 minutes and they kids just love to use this over a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>So far I love my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this kind of brush over 10 ten years and am surprised to find this very good priced model, especially with two extra soft brush heads included</li>
            <li>I had braces growing up, but really didn&#x27;t know if they were right for our son.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t worry as much about them doing it right, because the toothbrush takes care of that for me.</li>
            <li>I still had a large package of the brush heads and thought since this looked like the same brush head I would be able to use them with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My eight year old was so excited to have almost the identical toothbrush to me--</li>
            <li>/&gt;She tells me the orthodontist was pretty upset with our son and said he&#x27;s been fussing at him every month for not brushing enough and not brushing good enough.</li>
            <li>The power toothdrush was received earlier then expected which was great.</li>
            <li>Or use this brush every third day and more gentle spin brushes the rest of the time.</li>
            <li>She loved it so much that we actually had to buy a second one for our youngest daughter.</li>
            <li>If they design it with a high *and* a low speed this product would fare much better.</li>
            <li>We accomplish more cleaning, and he likes this brush better than a regular toothbrush, due to the vibrationand massage like sensation.</li>
            <li>The price was right, it gets my teeth clean and it has a timer so it certainly meets my basic needs.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided there must be something good about it or he would have abandoned it long ago, so I got one for me.</li>
            <li>needed two things--the right size and a very gentle brush for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a plain rechargeable power toothbrush, nothing special, I like the one with timer and seperate on/off button better.</li>
            <li>Certainly encourages children to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li>So has now found a new love for this triple daily activity</li>
            <li>I love new products and when I get them I put them to the ultimate test within the 30 day trial.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush for my 8 year old daughter because she really dislikes brushing teeth!!</li>
            <li>my 7 year old daughter loves it, and it works pretty well!</li>
            <li>IT is very rare that something actually goes down in cost and is still the same product with the same excellent brushing motion.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrushes for the little ones, encourages them to brush regularly!</li>
            <li>But the spin speed is really too fast.</li>
            <li>They do not hurt with this brush because you don&#x27;t need to scrub--you can let the toothbrush glide gently on your teeth and it does the work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets my 5 stars because it does the job of the much more expensive models for a great low price.</li>
            <li>This really helped.</li>
            <li>It is made very well and the head oscillates, instead of some of the kids toothbrushes where they just vibrate.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>Very afforadable and works very well for the price I paid for.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very inconsistent with brushing.</li>
            <li>The ones that shows holes in teeth of people who had braces, but didn&#x27;t take care of them, I really was stuck on the fence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really can see the difference.</li>
            <li>You really can see the difference.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>My 9yos teeth are much cleaner.</li>
            <li>The handle pulses 3 or 4 times to let you know when it&#x27;s been running for 2 minutes, which is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Both are nice features for smaller, more clumsy, hands.</li>
            <li>Stays charged for a whole week.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is always ready to go, and my teeth are noticeably cleaner.  </li>
            <li>He wants to trade.</li>
            <li>When you have a toddler who defends herself against tooth brushing as if she&#x27;s being probed by aliens, this thing really helps.</li>
            <li>He loves it and this toothbrush has really helped keep his teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very functional, no complaints</li>
            <li>This item works better then I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable compared to others out there.</li>
            <li>A toothbrush rechargeable electric, with at least one replacement head and a timer to indicate time optimum brushing (2 minutes).</li>
            <li>Many of them clearly with the same problem..  </li>
            <li>We were right near his orthodontist</li>
            <li>We were right near his orthodontist</li>
            <li>I believe that Oral-B was forced by the government to make the battery accessible for recycling, but Oral-B chose to retain the feature that removing the battery almost surely destroys the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy for me to brush my back teeth without gagging like I do with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>She loves waiting for the timer and for me, it keeps her bruising better and longer than she would with any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li>His gums were sensitive and took a while to adjust so make sure they are brushing right for the first few months.</li>
            <li>I just turned 60 and only needed to clean my teeth,</li>
            <li>do recommend it especially for those, like our son, who believes teeth clean themselves.</li>
            <li>do recommend it especially for those, like our son, who believes teeth clean themselves.</li>
            <li>Its pretty powerful for younger kids.  </li>
            <li>But honestly, the kids know when the battery is almost empty or empty and it charges so quickly that this is not a problem.</li>
            <li>The only changes I&#x27;d make to this product are to include a cover for the brush head for storage and travel, and to advertise more accurately (it says two refill heads included, but there are only two total).</li>
            <li>the above said, it is still true that the brush cleans well, never-the-less</li>
            <li>identical to the adult model except for the price and funny stickers....</li>
            <li>This is exactly what we wanted for our 5 year old.  </li>
            <li>Wish that it buzzed at 30-second intervals like the higher end adult models.  </li>
            <li>My children are actually pretty young.  </li>
            <li>He brushes for the full two minutes at night and uses it in the morning too, but just brushes every tooth, not necessarily for two minutes.</li>
            <li>The charge is decent and it fits the bill of being an electric toothbrush for older kids.</li>
            <li>The handle on this unit is shorter and easier to hold than our older model from Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>By perfect I mean not for little boys and not for adults.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brushes that are packaged with this unit.  </li>
            <li>front of the package indicates it is appropriate for 8 year-olds and above, although the accompanying instructions simply say not to use it on kids under 3.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re child is 6 or 7 (or older)</li>
            <li>older mouths)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I was using a battery charged tooth brush prior to this, but the batteries always wore out too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I was quite surprised that we got a defective unit as every other item by oral B has been outstanding.</li>
            <li>This week at his appointment the hygienist said he has one of the cleanest 9 year old mouths she&#x27;s ever seen!!</li>
            <li>Great brush, virtually identical to the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; model but for less than half the price.</li>
            <li>did not expect such a gentle brush would clean my teeth better than my hard scrubbing, but it does.</li>
            <li>It seems a little smaller and gentler than my old one which is just fine with me since my gums and teeth have become more sensitive.</li>
            <li>The Brush is quite strong and does the  job Like my other tooth brush, which was a Vitality Braun, lasted 6 years, until the battery&lt;br /&gt;went out.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement, and with the decent battery a new lease on dental care excellence.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m decent with a toothbrush, but I finally feel like I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my old orthodontist having those scare photos in his office.</li>
            <li>Using the Oral B has allowed me to go much longer between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li>Worth the price as I couldn&#x27;t find one in the local Target or Wal-Mart stores.</li>
            <li>I nodded, &amp;#34;So pretty much anything electronic?&amp;#34; He nodded back, &amp;#34;Now</li>
            <li>I nodded, &amp;#34;So pretty much anything electronic?&amp;#34; He nodded back, &amp;#34;Now</li>
            <li>The head attachments that come with it are sort of small, but in my experience this is a good thing so you can reach back teeth</li>
            <li>Yes, the smaller round spinning heads seem to be effective, but it is very aggressive.</li>
            <li>We actually bought 2 one for my 9 year old, but he still likes is super hero brush for now, so we will put this up in the cupboard.</li>
            <li>And the head of one of these is just the right size to get those back molars.</li>
            <li>Loved the little design on it and even though it is a little different than the one I had I am not disappointed in its performance.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush was charged for the entire recommended charge time, and I left it off the charger every day for 7 days, and it still brushes my teeth just fine.</li>
            <li>but I want to know what other options are available--</li>
            <li>new one uses Nickel Metal Hydride batteries.</li>
            <li>They do get to a point that the rechargeable battery won&#x27;t recharge, so I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>My nephew loves his new toothbrush</li>
            <li>It can be intimidating for a child who is new to electric toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expecting this new Oral B  </li>
            <li>I like it very much my new rechargeable toothbrush, I charge it and can use it for 5 or 6 days.</li>
            <li>When the batteries are new I can go on two week camping trips without a charging.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old son loves his new toothbrush!</li>
            <li>so my 3 year old uses it with a big smile every day</li>
            <li>It runs just a little bit weaker since the battery is low on day seven, but runs enough for a good brushing.</li>
            <li>We have been using these for a little over a month and really like how they make your mouth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>And what I found is that it fits my hand better, cleans just as well, and the only thing is doesn&#x27;t do that the other did</li>
            <li>I ordered this one for my 8 year old and he loves it!</li>
            <li>I should have asked for a refund when the first of this type stopped working after only 3 months.</li>
            <li>A review combined with a short funny story.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up on the idea of an electric toothbrush, however, because I need the round head for my teeth!  </li>
            <li>: a bit to fast which makes it messy, my gums still bleed (painless), no cover on the brush to keep the bristles clean, could be a bit quieter&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>The timer on the brushes has been working very well in telling them how long they should really be brushing.  </li>
            <li>So I replaced my old one with the exact same model.  </li>
            <li>Blasts away tooth junk, holds a charge very very well and buzzes to let you know how long you&#x27;ve used it at one stretch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hard on the kids compared to most parents these days.</li>
            <li>I have very high oral hygiene standards and felt my son just wasn&#x27;t brushing with enough enthusiasm.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that the button is not as easy to operate as other Oral-B electric brushes.</li>
            <li>There is a slight &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; if you are new to electric toothbrushes but the kids caught on quickly.  </li>
            <li>I clearly need to pay attention.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 80 year old mother because advertised for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>My 8 year old uses it</li>
            <li>This one has decals that make it look a bit like a kid&#x27;s toothbrush, but it is adult size.</li>
            <li>Got one of these at the dentist, then ordered this one for my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that my teeth are much cleaner/brighter/sparkly after 2 mos. of regular use.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old loves it</li>
            <li>With just one person using it, it&#x27;ll go nearly 2 weeks before it needs charged again.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old hates brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li>We purchased this for  my 4 year old daughter</li>
            <li>This one offers both.</li>
            <li>Soft brush or not, it can sandblast your teeth and take some skin off the roof of your mouth if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was a bit cheaper than what seemed like the equivalent adult toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 6 year old and he loves it.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old needs help</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums like the old one could do.  </li>
            <li>I will stick with the sensitive from now on.  </li>
            <li>I like that the heads are interchangeable with the adult handle.  </li>
            <li>The motor is noisier than the adult models we have.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft for her enamel and gums.</li>
            <li>Much improved over the earlier Oral-Bs...</li>
            <li>I got this for my 5 yr old son.</li>
            <li>I use this for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li>About 5 months ago, our family dentist recommended our 11 year old son get braces.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>saw a few questions about the sound of this model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>saw a few questions about the sound of this model.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too sensitive for 2 year olds.</li>
            <li>We purchased this for our 7yr old daughter.  </li>
            <li>The outer bristles are soft and message the gums without scratching them.  </li>
            <li>I LIKE IT AND NEED FOR MY SENSITIVE TEETH .</li>
            <li>The bristles are noticeably softer than adult brushes, however.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 9 year old daughter hates it, 6 year old doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.</li>
            <li>I have an 8 and 11 year old and my 8 year old</li>
            <li>It was cheaper than the adult versions</li>
            <li>Works well, but my child&#x27;s sensitive gums bleed from this.</li>
            <li>It does not, however, come with a clock/timer and vibrate every 30 seconds like the adult Oral-B electric brushes.</li>
            <li>The last one I used so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used battery operated brushes that felt like all the action was in the handle and nothing at the bristles.</li>
            <li>This brush puts the action where it belongs - on the teeth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a heavy thing.</li>
            <li>So far no cavities.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 10 year old with braces.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner than when using a regular hand brush.</li>
            <li>Replaced the 10 year old predecessor.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old is scared of it</li>
            <li>We use it for a 4 year old and 7 year old</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Oral B Plaque Control electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My seven year old&#x27;s dentist asked we not have her use this regularly until she&#x27;s a teenager, he feels younger children aren&#x27;t dextrous enough to clean well with these.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the toothbrush, is that it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light that flashes when it&#x27;s due to be recharged.</li>
            <li>so I finally succumbed to an electric model because I have MS and it was becoming more difficult to brush my teeth properly.</li>
            <li>overall quality of this product is good, but just not good for my son, who only accept a slower spin speed toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it works better than regular brushing, but you would think it would.</li>
            <li>Wow, Oral-B apparently hasn&#x27;t changed the head design in 20 years!  </li>
            <li>I rotates at a constant high speed until the battery energy is almost depleted.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and tired of shelling out $7 a month on a disposable princess spin brush (the bristles never seem to hold up for a full 3 months), this and Sonicare are pretty much your only options for rechargeable kids brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to buy our 7 year old one too now!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need to pay twice as much for that little alert, and this one does have a pulse to let me know when my two minutes of brushing are up.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought it to replace one lost in my luggage while travelling and was a lot less than the original Oral B one I had.</li>
            <li>My dentist told me to only use this toothbrush, as it is for sensitive teeth, and the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate the soft heads, because my mouth and teeth are sensitive.</li>
            <li>Since this is a basic model it doesn&#x27;t show how much battery is left, like Oral-B for grown ups do.</li>
            <li>I do not know if it is smaller than the adult brushes, but this one is easy to maneuver in my small mouth and around my individual teeth.</li>
            <li>The real test is how long the battery will last - not between charges, but until it doesn&#x27;t take a charge;</li>
            <li>The lower profile charger is nicer than the bigger one my old toothbrush had.  </li>
            <li>Son likes the sonic brush &#x27;like Mom&#x27;s&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second timer buzzes like the adult version to let you know to switch brushing &#x27;quadrants&#x27;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Relatively soft bristles will not hurt the gums , and the rotational speed is also very moderate.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft enough that they don&#x27;t hurt ( and thus cause them to recede) my gums.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s for kids, but I needed a smaller, soft brush.  </li>
            <li>and he felt like a big boy (8 years old).</li>
            <li>My old one simply wore out.  </li>
            <li>This is a smaller sized brush with the soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>It uses the same replacement heads as the adult brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the same size as my old Oral b  </li>
            <li>We were having trouble having our kids brush their teeth for a full 2 minutes as we were using a timer, but that requires that all the kids start brushing their teeth at the same time.  </li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like, is the charger has no wall mount for it, but other than that I really like it!</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it is a bit noisy, but because this is the first motorized brush I&#x27;ve used, I cannot compare the noise to other products.</li>
            <li>4 and 6 yrs old but with a little instruction they are doing very well with these brushes.  </li>
            <li>From the description, this didn&#x27;t seem so different from the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; version, so I gave it a try, and so far as I can tell the only differences are some decoration and the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because the battery in my old one had weakened to the point of only lasting three days off the charger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier than trying to rotate a toothbrush around in his mouth, especially since he doesn&#x27;t keep it open well or keep his lips loose as I brush.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well, for a fraction of the cost of other electronic toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s nearly twice as long as my last one.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 8 year old because he wasn&#x27;t brushing his teeth long enough.  </li>
            <li>I would note that the heads on these brushes are the standard oral-b heads which mean they might be a tiny bit large for the 6 and under crowd, particularly in the gum line.  </li>
            <li>It spins way too fast, which both hurts my daughter&#x27;s mouth and creates a toothpaste-y mess.</li>
            <li>I was not at all disappointed, and I love it so much that I am buying one for my 12 year old son.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter loves this - and no need to buy a new brush every few months - just exchange the head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a more expensive unit, which didn&#x27;t last long or perform nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>My little girl never really liked to brush and she has actually started enjoyed brushing since this purchase.</li>
            <li>I feel so bad because my son LOVED it</li>

            <li> it would be nice.  </li>

            <li> In my search for a replacement I came across this one and liked what I saw.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the money.  </li>
            <li> The 2 minute timer is a nice idea.</li>
            <li> package was in good state when delivered, and my friend&#x27;s child love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The 2 minute timer thing is also a nice touch.</li>
            <li> But I just thought it was coincidence, my own electronic toothbrush lasted forever.</li>
            <li> He liked it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some kind of ulterior motive going on.</li>
            <li> He liked it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some kind of ulterior motive going on.</li>

            <li> Good buy :)</li>
            <li> Loving this for my kids.</li>
            <li> It felt so nice</li>

            <li> They all seem to enjoy them and do a good job with them when brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my 9 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any toothbrushes that specified the softness of the brushes, so I chose this one because it&#x27;s suitable for kids.</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)</li>
            <li> Works great and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> Much more powerful and the battery life is great.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth really nice and clean!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is more suitable for me to use too, I feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I enjoy using it very much</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because it was just perfect for my tween boy who is 11 and isn&#x27;t so much into super hero tooth brushes anymore.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is perfect to start in this whole new world of good cleaning habits.</li>
            <li> It is what it is, nothing more, nothing less...works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to parents who want their kids to do a better job cleaning their teeth.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love these just wish the batteries lasted longer</li>
            <li> The dental tech recommended Braun and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Takes a bit getting used to, but mouth already feels better after not even a week.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more is there to say about how well it works than that?  </li>
            <li> Always squirming and trying to leave, this tooth brush mashes me feel and notice that his teeth get cleaned better because of the rotating motion.</li>
            <li> The design on the handle is cute and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have done more research,</li>
            <li> Love the tooth brushes for the kids.</li>
            <li> Love the timer for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an Oral B brush for yours (so many years that it cost $20 when I bought it and came with 3 brush heads at Walmart).  </li>
            <li> I like the job the toothbrush does, and I love the price.  </li>
            <li> This more for kids</li>
            <li> But the price on this was appealing, so why not?  </li>
            <li> For me, this one makes the most sense.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and it is a much better option for him.  </li>
            <li> but it does better than when I help him with a hand brush.  </li>
            <li> All children could benefit from the better cleaning of an electric brush.  </li>
            <li> Great product shipping was fast</li>
            <li> we love it</li>
            <li> This one works even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my dentist will be giving me a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> this cannot possibly be the best kids toothbrush they make.</li>
            <li> and yes, as most parents will tell you, stubboner is a word.</li>
            <li> and yes, as most parents will tell you, stubboner is a word.</li>
            <li> I would continue shelling out money for battery-powered spin brushes a couple more years.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have two of these toothbrushes for both my kids, they both love it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great item</li>
            <li> Kids love them.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace one I&#x27;ve had for many years.</li>
            <li> They absolutely love it</li>
            <li> and it works much better than the battery powered ones.</li>
            <li> They both wear braces &amp; they love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> this price my kids have 1 each :)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Our kids love those.</li>
            <li> After using the brush 10 times I decided to not use it any more.</li>
            <li> I am sure she will love it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good</li>
            <li> Pretty good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter was excited!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are easy to find and most department stores have a store brand that is cheaper.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dentist as a good one that is more gentle than the Sonicare we already have at home.</li>
            <li> My daughter can use this toothbrush on her own and it does such a great job compared to hand brushing.  </li>
            <li> This lets me so it myself, and gets his teeth sparkly clean!</li>
            <li> toothbrush is fine, although it needs more than one speed.</li>
            <li> It works nicely to clean my teeth with stars printed on it!  </li>
            <li> Charge lasts and the action is great.</li>
            <li> The soft brush makes me feel great about using it on her teeth.</li>
            <li> is a great starter electric for a child.&lt;br /&gt;Since my child began using this, the oral hygienist and dentist have seen marked improvement in her teeth and gums...</li>
            <li> Kids loved the graphics and love having their own power brushes that actually work (unlike the battery powered versions which seem woefully underpowered).&lt;br</li>
            <li> My kids love them, as much as they can love a toothbrush, so that works for me!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned and is extremely affordable.  </li>
            <li> my kids could imitate easily....</li>
            <li> Easy to charge.</li>
            <li> so she could get a better clean.</li>
            <li> I would advise, however, you go easy in breaking this in.</li>
            <li> but it is easily knocked over.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to use, cleans well, and comes with replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, You feel your teeth so clean.</li>
            <li> The brush snaps in easily.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a couple of weeks for me, and then it recharges easily in the brush.  </li>
            <li> Easy for my daughter to use.</li>
            <li> I now understand others&#x27; comments about this toothbrush being too noisy and the vibration too strong.</li>
            <li> and I will leave mine soaking in a strong mouthwash  day and night.</li>
            <li> purchased this power toothbrush and a water irrigatir for her online.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very effective and the only toothbrush that we have been able to use painlessly and with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> and we don&#x27;t have to watch the timer to make sure they brush for the full time.  </li>
            <li> Other wise its a good product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After almost 3 months with the replacement toothbrush everything is working out fine</li>
            <li> it should be fine and good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating updated to reflect replacement.</li>
            <li> Although it is marketed towards children, it works fine for adults as well.</li>
            <li> and I like it fine.</li>
            <li> This is easier to fit in and perfect size for little mouths and teeth.</li>
            <li> It is more powerful, too.</li>
            <li> Ionly wish there was some sort of light indicator for the timer.</li>
            <li> The slower spinning is great for younger kids.</li>
            <li> This product is great for cleaning braces, and I would definitely order it again</li>
            <li> I immediately went online to reorder, and found it was no longer available except in this model, which, according to reviews, is intended for kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t have a blinking light to show it&#x27;s charging&lt;br</li>
            <li> It appears to be well made and my daughter does enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I honestly believe he really tried.</li>
            <li> Also wish there  was a charge indicator light.  </li>
            <li> We have had the brushes for several months now and they still work great.  </li>
            <li> regards to the transaction, from purchase to arrival, everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li> Light weight and compact.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light for charging.</li>
            <li> This is great gift for child as a reward to regular brushing of teeth.</li>
            <li> Great value for money, especially as it incudes 2 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;t feel comfortable using it</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> It works well so far with good battery power.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> it workds really good and replaces my old toothbrush</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my daughter perfect for children to remind them how long they should be brushing</li>
            <li> The original brush works fine.</li>
            <li> It has a nice small head which makes it easy for him to use and the timer is great</li>
            <li> I was leery about purchasing this particular model, but I fell in love with it immediately!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have received that very rare faulty item that slips through QA.</li>
            <li> I am lucky to be an old geezer with good genes when it comes to teeth.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and works as good as the one I paid nearly three times for.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well, and the novelty of it gets my kids excited to brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have been very happy with Oral B products in the past</li>
            <li> This is the first motorized toothbrush I have used, and I love it.</li>
            <li> no cavities!&lt;br /&gt;It does provide the 2 minute vibration change, which is important so that the child knows to brush the full two minutes as dentists recommend.  </li>
            <li> I had originally purchased one of these for my oldest daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> The mold had collected although, after use, I habitually shake and clean the brush in running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle but effective on his teeth and fun for a kid.</li>
            <li> , she never felt her teeth feels so clean.</li>
            <li> Gives your teeth a clean feeling every time.</li>
            <li> this one is easier to clean</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and my gums don&#x27;t feel sanded.</li>
            <li> If you can get in there, swish around, make some contact, and buzz most teeth, you&#x27;re far better off than trying to use a manual one.</li>
            <li> bought for my granddaughter, just the right size for a child and easy to handle for a child</li>
            <li> And the price is right!</li>
            <li> In the time we have been using these toothbrushes we have made a trip to the dentist office for teeth cleaning and our dental techs say our teeth are very well taken care of and most of all clean.  </li>
            <li> He likes it and his teeth are super clean.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far</li>
            <li> It it superior to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It runs for a full 2 minutes with no indicator as to when to switch parts of your mouth.</li>
            <li> They cant quite do it for the full 2 min yet, but we are working on it.</li>
            <li> You can feel the buzz in your hand when you turn it on, but it&#x27;s not a bad vibration.</li>
            <li> my old one gave out, and this new one is working great.</li>
            <li> I liked the brush head because its small which is perfect for younger children</li>
            <li> Just like a dentist visit, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless the &amp;#34;signal&amp;#34; for the two minutes is not a &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; but just a quickly stop of the toothbrush...</li>
            <li> Luckily it broke within the 30 day</li>
            <li> Works better than the older model it is replacing</li>
            <li> Amazon of course madee a quick refund.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the timer that makes sure you brush enough</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush for the kids especially the 2min timer that helps ensure kids have proper brush time</li>
            <li> but so far so good cleans their teeth very well.</li>
            <li> The item shipped quickly and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> In the beginning two minutes seemed like forever for him, but it quickly became the norm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric toothbrushes in the past, but I liked that this one was affordable (including the refills), incredibly effective yet gentle, and doesn&#x27;t have too many &amp;#34;functions&amp;#34; or</li>
            <li> A manual toothbrush simply cannot clean as effectively as an Oral-B electric.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> love my new toothbrush</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s a great toothbrush, just like all my previous Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Since dental care is becoming so expensive, this is a great way to keep those teeth from decaying!</li>
            <li> Have to teach child to clean tooth manually first .</li>
            <li> First of all, these clean your teeth far better than can be achieved with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> It is OK I hope it will stay good for toothbrushing at least 1 year</li>
            <li> After many years of service my old Oral-B Rechargeable  Toothbrush stopped working.</li>
            <li> It was time for me to replace my old one, since it wasn&#x27;t keeping it&#x27;s charge for more than 3 days.</li>
            <li> and my smile is prettier.</li>
            <li> I love the soft brushes.</li>
            <li> He is 7 years old now and he is still enjoying his spin brush.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this sensitive Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> Works well, powerful scrubbing.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are simple, sanitary (no seems or cracks), and effective (no over brushing anymore, and no plaque).  </li>
            <li> For the price, it was absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> ortho-head is worth it if you&#x27;re buying it for someone with braces.</li>
            <li> ortho-head is worth it if you&#x27;re buying it for someone with braces.</li>
            <li> They are well worth the money IMO.</li>
            <li> It is deserving of zero stars rather than 1 star as I noted that others have the same problem.  </li>
            <li> Fun design.</li>
            <li> Braun builds a quality tooth brush that is well worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one will be returned and I will chalk this up to just a rare defective unit.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 10 year old, she love it!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> My 5 &amp; 3 year old love brushing their teeth now.</li>
            <li> The youthful decals are worth the savings.</li>
            <li> and my teeth seemed more sensitive afterward.</li>
            <li> In limited time, these brushes manage to do a pretty good job of powering off all the gunk.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased a sonicare kids tooth brush for my 5 year son and it was too much for him.  </li>
            <li> Priced right.</li>
            <li> Is the right price and lasts years.</li>
            <li> It worked right out of the box and we haven&#x27;t had any issue with it.</li>
            <li> this is a great motivation  for tweens to brush teeth long enough to clean them well.  </li>
            <li> The battery needs about 16 hours to get a full charge, but if you set it on its stand in the morning it&#x27;s ready for you by bedtime and should hold that charge for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> This brush (with the extra gentle head) is kind to your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Although it is sold for young people, I am using it as an adult and loving it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy one of the more expensive rechargeables for him, so this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> Just like the adult version, does a fine job.</li>
            <li> now have a replacement that so far is working fine.</li>
            <li> Our dentist put us on one of these and my gums have recovered normal depths, and, of course our teeth are really clean.</li>
            <li> It has more of an open area in the middle to fit around braces to clean around the edges of the brackets.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has more of an open area in the middle to fit around braces to clean around the edges of the brackets.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Kids will really like having this product , its fun to they do not want to stop brushing their teeth</li>
            <li> and it definitely helps him do a better job cleaning his teeth than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> More chance of splatter with only one speed</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I like it.  </li>
            <li> They work better than regular toothbrushes do.</li>
            <li> And the soft bristled head is so comfortable.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using them for many years - they don&#x27;t last for ever.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> This is it exactly.</li>
            <li> Cute design and larger grip for tween age kids.  </li>
            <li> Nothing too fancy, but definitely better than a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> First month checkup</li>
            <li> Much better than the throw away toothbrushes that we have been buying at the local box store.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud and cheap sounding.</li>
            <li> I like it better than former snooker....</li>
            <li> This one works very well for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the brushheads aren&#x27;t too big</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for &amp;#34;toothbrush for braces&amp;#34; but this brush came up first.</li>
            <li> That bugged me out at 1st, but it hasn&#x27;t died, so I guess it&#x27;s charging ;)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty hardy brushes.</li>
            <li> It works well and there are no complicated \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Great brush plenty of power and long lasting charge!</li>
            <li> My old heads fit onto my kid&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They make a vibrating noise that the kids can hear and feel after 2 minutes and they kids just love to use this over a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> So far I love my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this kind of brush over 10 ten years and am surprised to find this very good priced model, especially with two extra soft brush heads included</li>
            <li> I had braces growing up, but really didn&#x27;t know if they were right for our son.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t worry as much about them doing it right, because the toothbrush takes care of that for me.</li>
            <li> I still had a large package of the brush heads and thought since this looked like the same brush head I would be able to use them with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My eight year old was so excited to have almost the identical toothbrush to me--</li>
            <li> /&gt;She tells me the orthodontist was pretty upset with our son and said he&#x27;s been fussing at him every month for not brushing enough and not brushing good enough.</li>
            <li> The power toothdrush was received earlier then expected which was great.</li>
            <li> Or use this brush every third day and more gentle spin brushes the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> She loved it so much that we actually had to buy a second one for our youngest daughter.</li>
            <li> If they design it with a high *and* a low speed this product would fare much better.</li>
            <li> We accomplish more cleaning, and he likes this brush better than a regular toothbrush, due to the vibrationand massage like sensation.</li>
            <li> The price was right, it gets my teeth clean and it has a timer so it certainly meets my basic needs.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided there must be something good about it or he would have abandoned it long ago, so I got one for me.</li>
            <li> needed two things--the right size and a very gentle brush for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a plain rechargeable power toothbrush, nothing special, I like the one with timer and seperate on/off button better.</li>
            <li> Certainly encourages children to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> So has now found a new love for this triple daily activity</li>
            <li> I love new products and when I get them I put them to the ultimate test within the 30 day trial.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my 8 year old daughter because she really dislikes brushing teeth!!</li>
            <li> my 7 year old daughter loves it, and it works pretty well!</li>
            <li> IT is very rare that something actually goes down in cost and is still the same product with the same excellent brushing motion.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes for the little ones, encourages them to brush regularly!</li>
            <li> But the spin speed is really too fast.</li>
            <li> They do not hurt with this brush because you don&#x27;t need to scrub--you can let the toothbrush glide gently on your teeth and it does the work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets my 5 stars because it does the job of the much more expensive models for a great low price.</li>
            <li> This really helped.</li>
            <li> It is made very well and the head oscillates, instead of some of the kids toothbrushes where they just vibrate.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> Very afforadable and works very well for the price I paid for.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very inconsistent with brushing.</li>
            <li> The ones that shows holes in teeth of people who had braces, but didn&#x27;t take care of them, I really was stuck on the fence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really can see the difference.</li>
            <li> You really can see the difference.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> My 9yos teeth are much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The handle pulses 3 or 4 times to let you know when it&#x27;s been running for 2 minutes, which is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Both are nice features for smaller, more clumsy, hands.</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a whole week.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is always ready to go, and my teeth are noticeably cleaner.  </li>
            <li> He wants to trade.</li>
            <li> When you have a toddler who defends herself against tooth brushing as if she&#x27;s being probed by aliens, this thing really helps.</li>
            <li> He loves it and this toothbrush has really helped keep his teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very functional, no complaints</li>
            <li> This item works better then I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable compared to others out there.</li>
            <li> A toothbrush rechargeable electric, with at least one replacement head and a timer to indicate time optimum brushing (2 minutes).</li>
            <li> Many of them clearly with the same problem..  </li>
            <li> We were right near his orthodontist</li>
            <li> We were right near his orthodontist</li>
            <li> I believe that Oral-B was forced by the government to make the battery accessible for recycling, but Oral-B chose to retain the feature that removing the battery almost surely destroys the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy for me to brush my back teeth without gagging like I do with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> She loves waiting for the timer and for me, it keeps her bruising better and longer than she would with any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> His gums were sensitive and took a while to adjust so make sure they are brushing right for the first few months.</li>
            <li> I just turned 60 and only needed to clean my teeth,</li>
            <li> do recommend it especially for those, like our son, who believes teeth clean themselves.</li>
            <li> do recommend it especially for those, like our son, who believes teeth clean themselves.</li>
            <li> Its pretty powerful for younger kids.  </li>
            <li> But honestly, the kids know when the battery is almost empty or empty and it charges so quickly that this is not a problem.</li>
            <li> The only changes I&#x27;d make to this product are to include a cover for the brush head for storage and travel, and to advertise more accurately (it says two refill heads included, but there are only two total).</li>
            <li> the above said, it is still true that the brush cleans well, never-the-less</li>
            <li> identical to the adult model except for the price and funny stickers....</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we wanted for our 5 year old.  </li>
            <li> Wish that it buzzed at 30-second intervals like the higher end adult models.  </li>
            <li> My children are actually pretty young.  </li>
            <li> He brushes for the full two minutes at night and uses it in the morning too, but just brushes every tooth, not necessarily for two minutes.</li>
            <li> The charge is decent and it fits the bill of being an electric toothbrush for older kids.</li>
            <li> The handle on this unit is shorter and easier to hold than our older model from Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> By perfect I mean not for little boys and not for adults.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brushes that are packaged with this unit.  </li>
            <li> front of the package indicates it is appropriate for 8 year-olds and above, although the accompanying instructions simply say not to use it on kids under 3.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re child is 6 or 7 (or older)</li>
            <li> older mouths)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I was using a battery charged tooth brush prior to this, but the batteries always wore out too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I was quite surprised that we got a defective unit as every other item by oral B has been outstanding.</li>
            <li> This week at his appointment the hygienist said he has one of the cleanest 9 year old mouths she&#x27;s ever seen!!</li>
            <li> Great brush, virtually identical to the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; model but for less than half the price.</li>
            <li> did not expect such a gentle brush would clean my teeth better than my hard scrubbing, but it does.</li>
            <li> It seems a little smaller and gentler than my old one which is just fine with me since my gums and teeth have become more sensitive.</li>
            <li> The Brush is quite strong and does the  job Like my other tooth brush, which was a Vitality Braun, lasted 6 years, until the battery&lt;br /&gt;went out.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement, and with the decent battery a new lease on dental care excellence.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m decent with a toothbrush, but I finally feel like I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my old orthodontist having those scare photos in his office.</li>
            <li> Using the Oral B has allowed me to go much longer between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li> Worth the price as I couldn&#x27;t find one in the local Target or Wal-Mart stores.</li>
            <li> I nodded, &amp;#34;So pretty much anything electronic?&amp;#34; He nodded back, &amp;#34;Now</li>
            <li> I nodded, &amp;#34;So pretty much anything electronic?&amp;#34; He nodded back, &amp;#34;Now</li>
            <li> The head attachments that come with it are sort of small, but in my experience this is a good thing so you can reach back teeth</li>
            <li> Yes, the smaller round spinning heads seem to be effective, but it is very aggressive.</li>
            <li> We actually bought 2 one for my 9 year old, but he still likes is super hero brush for now, so we will put this up in the cupboard.</li>
            <li> And the head of one of these is just the right size to get those back molars.</li>
            <li> Loved the little design on it and even though it is a little different than the one I had I am not disappointed in its performance.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was charged for the entire recommended charge time, and I left it off the charger every day for 7 days, and it still brushes my teeth just fine.</li>
            <li> but I want to know what other options are available--</li>
            <li> new one uses Nickel Metal Hydride batteries.</li>
            <li> They do get to a point that the rechargeable battery won&#x27;t recharge, so I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> My nephew loves his new toothbrush</li>
            <li> It can be intimidating for a child who is new to electric toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expecting this new Oral B  </li>
            <li> I like it very much my new rechargeable toothbrush, I charge it and can use it for 5 or 6 days.</li>
            <li> When the batteries are new I can go on two week camping trips without a charging.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old son loves his new toothbrush!</li>
            <li> so my 3 year old uses it with a big smile every day</li>
            <li> It runs just a little bit weaker since the battery is low on day seven, but runs enough for a good brushing.</li>
            <li> We have been using these for a little over a month and really like how they make your mouth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> And what I found is that it fits my hand better, cleans just as well, and the only thing is doesn&#x27;t do that the other did</li>
            <li> I ordered this one for my 8 year old and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I should have asked for a refund when the first of this type stopped working after only 3 months.</li>
            <li> A review combined with a short funny story.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up on the idea of an electric toothbrush, however, because I need the round head for my teeth!  </li>
            <li> : a bit to fast which makes it messy, my gums still bleed (painless), no cover on the brush to keep the bristles clean, could be a bit quieter&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> The timer on the brushes has been working very well in telling them how long they should really be brushing.  </li>
            <li> So I replaced my old one with the exact same model.  </li>
            <li> Blasts away tooth junk, holds a charge very very well and buzzes to let you know how long you&#x27;ve used it at one stretch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard on the kids compared to most parents these days.</li>
            <li> I have very high oral hygiene standards and felt my son just wasn&#x27;t brushing with enough enthusiasm.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that the button is not as easy to operate as other Oral-B electric brushes.</li>
            <li> There is a slight &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; if you are new to electric toothbrushes but the kids caught on quickly.  </li>
            <li> I clearly need to pay attention.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 80 year old mother because advertised for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> My 8 year old uses it</li>
            <li> This one has decals that make it look a bit like a kid&#x27;s toothbrush, but it is adult size.</li>
            <li> Got one of these at the dentist, then ordered this one for my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my teeth are much cleaner/brighter/sparkly after 2 mos. of regular use.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old loves it</li>
            <li> With just one person using it, it&#x27;ll go nearly 2 weeks before it needs charged again.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old hates brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li> We purchased this for  my 4 year old daughter</li>
            <li> This one offers both.</li>
            <li> Soft brush or not, it can sandblast your teeth and take some skin off the roof of your mouth if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was a bit cheaper than what seemed like the equivalent adult toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 6 year old and he loves it.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old needs help</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums like the old one could do.  </li>
            <li> I will stick with the sensitive from now on.  </li>
            <li> I like that the heads are interchangeable with the adult handle.  </li>
            <li> The motor is noisier than the adult models we have.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft for her enamel and gums.</li>
            <li> Much improved over the earlier Oral-Bs...</li>
            <li> I got this for my 5 yr old son.</li>
            <li> I use this for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li> About 5 months ago, our family dentist recommended our 11 year old son get braces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> saw a few questions about the sound of this model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> saw a few questions about the sound of this model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too sensitive for 2 year olds.</li>
            <li> We purchased this for our 7yr old daughter.  </li>
            <li> The outer bristles are soft and message the gums without scratching them.  </li>
            <li> I LIKE IT AND NEED FOR MY SENSITIVE TEETH .</li>
            <li> The bristles are noticeably softer than adult brushes, however.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 9 year old daughter hates it, 6 year old doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.</li>
            <li> I have an 8 and 11 year old and my 8 year old</li>
            <li> It was cheaper than the adult versions</li>
            <li> Works well, but my child&#x27;s sensitive gums bleed from this.</li>
            <li> It does not, however, come with a clock/timer and vibrate every 30 seconds like the adult Oral-B electric brushes.</li>
            <li> The last one I used so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used battery operated brushes that felt like all the action was in the handle and nothing at the bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush puts the action where it belongs - on the teeth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a heavy thing.</li>
            <li> So far no cavities.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 10 year old with braces.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner than when using a regular hand brush.</li>
            <li> Replaced the 10 year old predecessor.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old is scared of it</li>
            <li> We use it for a 4 year old and 7 year old</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Oral B Plaque Control electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My seven year old&#x27;s dentist asked we not have her use this regularly until she&#x27;s a teenager, he feels younger children aren&#x27;t dextrous enough to clean well with these.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the toothbrush, is that it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light that flashes when it&#x27;s due to be recharged.</li>
            <li> so I finally succumbed to an electric model because I have MS and it was becoming more difficult to brush my teeth properly.</li>
            <li> overall quality of this product is good, but just not good for my son, who only accept a slower spin speed toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works better than regular brushing, but you would think it would.</li>
            <li> Wow, Oral-B apparently hasn&#x27;t changed the head design in 20 years!  </li>
            <li> I rotates at a constant high speed until the battery energy is almost depleted.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and tired of shelling out $7 a month on a disposable princess spin brush (the bristles never seem to hold up for a full 3 months), this and Sonicare are pretty much your only options for rechargeable kids brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to buy our 7 year old one too now!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need to pay twice as much for that little alert, and this one does have a pulse to let me know when my two minutes of brushing are up.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought it to replace one lost in my luggage while travelling and was a lot less than the original Oral B one I had.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to only use this toothbrush, as it is for sensitive teeth, and the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate the soft heads, because my mouth and teeth are sensitive.</li>
            <li> Since this is a basic model it doesn&#x27;t show how much battery is left, like Oral-B for grown ups do.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is smaller than the adult brushes, but this one is easy to maneuver in my small mouth and around my individual teeth.</li>
            <li> The real test is how long the battery will last - not between charges, but until it doesn&#x27;t take a charge;</li>
            <li> The lower profile charger is nicer than the bigger one my old toothbrush had.  </li>
            <li> Son likes the sonic brush &#x27;like Mom&#x27;s&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second timer buzzes like the adult version to let you know to switch brushing &#x27;quadrants&#x27;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Relatively soft bristles will not hurt the gums , and the rotational speed is also very moderate.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft enough that they don&#x27;t hurt ( and thus cause them to recede) my gums.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s for kids, but I needed a smaller, soft brush.  </li>
            <li> and he felt like a big boy (8 years old).</li>
            <li> My old one simply wore out.  </li>
            <li> This is a smaller sized brush with the soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> It uses the same replacement heads as the adult brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the same size as my old Oral b  </li>
            <li> We were having trouble having our kids brush their teeth for a full 2 minutes as we were using a timer, but that requires that all the kids start brushing their teeth at the same time.  </li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like, is the charger has no wall mount for it, but other than that I really like it!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is a bit noisy, but because this is the first motorized brush I&#x27;ve used, I cannot compare the noise to other products.</li>
            <li> 4 and 6 yrs old but with a little instruction they are doing very well with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> From the description, this didn&#x27;t seem so different from the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; version, so I gave it a try, and so far as I can tell the only differences are some decoration and the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because the battery in my old one had weakened to the point of only lasting three days off the charger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier than trying to rotate a toothbrush around in his mouth, especially since he doesn&#x27;t keep it open well or keep his lips loose as I brush.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well, for a fraction of the cost of other electronic toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s nearly twice as long as my last one.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 8 year old because he wasn&#x27;t brushing his teeth long enough.  </li>
            <li> I would note that the heads on these brushes are the standard oral-b heads which mean they might be a tiny bit large for the 6 and under crowd, particularly in the gum line.  </li>
            <li> It spins way too fast, which both hurts my daughter&#x27;s mouth and creates a toothpaste-y mess.</li>
            <li> I was not at all disappointed, and I love it so much that I am buying one for my 12 year old son.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter loves this - and no need to buy a new brush every few months - just exchange the head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a more expensive unit, which didn&#x27;t last long or perform nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> My little girl never really liked to brush and she has actually started enjoyed brushing since this purchase.</li>
            <li> I feel so bad because my son LOVED it</li>
            <li> It is going back to Amazon and I am still searching for a good kids&#x27; rechargeable brush :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had NiCads last that long</li>
            <li> Also the brush heads seem to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Amazon also sells the refills so cheaper than buying a new tooth brush every few weeks.</li>
            <li> The other&#x27;s rechargeable battery finally gave out, and we were going to replace it with the same version.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to other children - especially ones who don&#x27;t like to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> A little bit loud when you turn it on.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that I have to really push hard on the on switch/button to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> It stays charged a surprisingly long time.  </li>
            <li> , when I got the product and used it, I realized I should have replaced my old unit a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a round brush with soft to medium bristles.</li>
            <li> so there are no questions on how long he should brush for.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as I would have hoped though.</li>
            <li> Our 9 year old son has had a few cavities, even after brushing twice a day.</li>
            <li> the current product still has a high risk of failure..  ..</li>
            <li> Given that the brush is a pretty complex piece of engineering with lots of moving parts its pretty sad that this otherwise fine product fails due to a simple solid state defective charger.</li>
            <li> had several other electric Oral-B toothbrushes in the family</li>
            <li> not interested in some different heads for the brush.</li>
            <li> The one we bought from the dentist had the battery go out due to being used for several years.  </li>
            <li> even my 5 years old can use the small head to brush</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this model is that black stars and circles on the handle.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it only lasted less than 2 minutes...</li>
            <li> In the holes on the front and back of the brush head, I noticed something black.</li>
            <li> That buzz I mentioned encourages you to slow down and move gently.</li>
            <li> Only other difference than the price is that this brush handle has a small graphic design.</li>
            <li> Only complaint that I wish there were different patterns and/or colors.  </li>
            <li> They have been using them at least twice a day for nearly six months now.  </li>
            <li> my girl is only 3+ not fit</li>
            <li> I have absolutely NO issues with the&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li> I disliked a similar adult toothbrush I tried an electric toothbrush a number of years ago and was not thrilled to have to get another one.</li>
            <li> Be careful where you place it.</li>
            <li> I had taken him fishing a few days later.</li>
            <li> I had taken him fishing a few days later.</li>
            <li> and I am going to see what my return options are since I had to destroy the plastic packaging to open it.</li>
            <li> Not as rough as I had heard.</li>
            <li> My old battery Sonicare forced me to do that.</li>
            <li> In the future I would like to be able to purchase the toothbrush without the base.</li>
            <li> The batteries last at least two years (which is how long I&#x27;ve had mine) without any reduction in effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> There is only 1 speed and it is crazy fast!</li>
            <li> a little tooth paste goes a long way,good price,&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Water and toothpaste residue would get into the threads of that cap and it was very difficult to clean, maintain and keep dry!  </li>
            <li> and this is the first one to ever fail on us......</li>
            <li> it uses reusable brush heads, unlike the other kid&#x27;s electric toothbrushes that are disposable.</li>
            <li> Read this description carefully!</li>
            <li> but I changed to my other one which died.  </li>
            <li> so I have no recourse other than to state</li>
            <li> I purchased 2-- one for each of my kids; the other is still working--</li>
            <li> I wish it came in other colors or had color wraps to tell them apart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shorter than the other electric toothbrushes in the Oral B line [that I&#x27;ve purchased].</li>
            <li> cons are small enough to keep the rate up.</li>
            <li> Their stuff is usually built to last.</li>
            <li> No more sawing at your teeth and jamming the head into the back of your jaw.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a simple design with small footprint .  </li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and teeth--I needed children&#x27;s size braces on my adult teeth--and the head of the brush is small.</li>
            <li> But even worse, the second one only lasted 1.5 months.</li>
            <li> His teethe actually got worse tartar build up initially.</li>
            <li> Given the limited window of opportunity to get in a few brushes, having a power brush is a godsend.  </li>
            <li> solutions: put the toothpaste on and brush your teeth with the power off for a little bit then turn it on, try to keep your mouth closed when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I exposed some nerve tissue by brushing too hard and two teeth were hurting when I brushed.</li>
            <li> so it seems like if you received a defective/faulty toothbrush it&#x27;ll fail in the first few</li>
            <li> I have had a very similar  .. if not identical Oral B Pro-Health brush that lasted at least a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I think just like with any product,  some people will love it, and some will hate it.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries but they are both getting use to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this thing run out of battery or slow down while using it, and I&#x27;ve only been charging it about once a week and using it 1-2 times a day for around 2 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li> When his wears out I&#x27;ll have to hunt him down a &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; one like mine.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I didn&#x27;t take the warnings of other buyers!</li>
            <li> My kids had the Sonicare toothbrush for a few years and other than the replacement heads being expensive, it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I got these for my 2 kids 7 &amp; 8 yrs old they been wanting one of these for a long time and they are little expensive</li>
            <li> I was SO please that this one was 50% of the cost of my previous one that I&#x27;d had for about 5 years.  </li>
            <li> After less than two months the toothbrush stopped recharging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also slightly wider, and has a rubber backing.</li>
            <li> The last Oral-B I purchased lasted 8 years before the battery was no good.</li>
            <li> There is a long list negative reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> But, I have a small mouth (only my dentist says so) and don&#x27;t like the hard bristles.</li>
            <li> With a history in psychology and being raised by in a lower income single parent home made me realize how hard life can be, but also made me appreciate things I didn&#x27;t think I would appreciate as a kid ...</li>
            <li> Love it and the small base charging stand.  </li>
            <li> He uses it 4 times a day and hasn&#x27;t complained a single time.</li>
            <li> He uses it 4 times a day and hasn&#x27;t complained a single time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little louder than my Pro-3000.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little louder than my Pro-3000.</li>
            <li> was a little scared of it.  </li>
            <li> is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to continuing brushing with Oral B for a few years ...</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this toothbrush to anyone because it is a waste of money seeing that the battery has a life of 6-7 months.</li>
            <li> I think I saw the difference when he used it a few times and kept talking about how &amp;#34;nice and clean&amp;#34; his mouth felt.</li>
            <li> I think I saw the difference when he used it a few times and kept talking about how &amp;#34;nice and clean&amp;#34; his mouth felt.</li>
            <li> After it died I decided to save a few $$ and bought this one</li>
            <li> When the 2 minutes are up, it sputters a few times then</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look childish, and no one sees it it my bathroom anyway.</li>
            <li> His has hit the floor a few times and you&#x27;d never know it.</li>
            <li> Therefore: Since the risk of receiving a faulty set still in the supply chain due entirely to  failure of the charger I see no reason to change the rating from one star..</li>
            <li> My son does not like it and we change back to the less expensive ones, like G.U.M.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> In other words, when the battery goes bad, you must purchase a new electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> We did try to go with a Phillips Sonicare, and I still use it when I need a real power-brushing, but my wife couldn&#x27;t stand that singing vibration - it &#x27;shocked&#x27; her teeth.</li>
            <li> I know there usually is nothing like that included</li>
            <li> We choose this one because of the small brush head.</li>
            <li> that THIS IS A REALLY LOUSY PRODUCT: :HAS FAILED TOTALLY AFTER ONLY THREE MONTHS.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure my 4 year-old would have the patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I Like the small head and the timer.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a toothbrush head that is designed for braces, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The cheapest power head, such as this one is built just as well as the expensive models.</li>
            <li> Typically I get three or four years out of one of these before water gets inside or the battery starts getting weak.</li>
            <li> The button is very stiff also.</li>
            <li> But with a warning from my dentist that I am damaging my teeth by brushing too hard, I decided to take his recommendation and try again.</li>
            <li> She says the bristles are hard on her gums.</li>
            <li> The on button is somewhat hard to turn on, but I think that may be by design.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> It does not have a working timer like it says it does, or at least mine does not work.  </li>
            <li> I will give a negative rating for this product if allowed.</li>
            <li> It at least slows the build-up of gunk on the charging base.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It at least slows the build-up of gunk on the charging base.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sad to see such a poor product from oral-B.</li>
            <li> If you can find the &amp;#34;For Me&amp;#34; brush heads, they are less expensive.</li>
            <li> Accustomed to the rapid growth of mold and mildew in our city, I inserted an inter-proximal brush (very thin) in the holes and withdrew black mold.</li>
            <li> Mom is around 70 and while she typically will take up for the kids, she also isn&#x27;t as bad as my wife for going overboard and telling &amp;#34;white lies&amp;#34; for the kids.</li>
            <li> SEEM WEAK.</li>
            <li> I poured hydrogen peroxide down the brush and collected the dirty liquid in a glass.</li>
            <li> and I think they like brushing their teeth now, at the very least, it motivates them to get it done</li>
            <li> but I thin</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I have discovered what seems to be a design flaw that negatively affects use in damp climates.</li>
            <li> Poor quality control.</li>
            <li> i ordered another hoping the previous one was just a bad piece.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find they do not fit.  </li>
            <li> Worst packaging that I have ever seen or tried to open on any product.  </li>
            <li> She has no problem holding it and returns it to the charging base without trouble.  </li>
            <li> : Wife takes him and I hear nothing to make me think anything was wrong.</li>
            <li> The base it small and tips .</li>
            <li> This is a bad situation, but I don&#x27;t see a competitive rechargeable toothbrush with a replaceable battery.</li>
            <li> I have a bad shoulder, brushing my teeth can be painful...</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just replace one because it gets ugly.</li>
            <li> I was prepared to hate this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Since I had kept the defective brush and charging base I have established that its the charging base that is defective.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the base is a motor and battery</li>
            <li> I still have my base, after years the button on the brush give out.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and had just bought a set of replacement brushes..</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because now I have to pay to return it and find another toothbrush ...</li>
            <li> One of the oral b pro health for me did not have the spare refill which I sent a email about amnd did not get a reply to, very disappointed .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great Product Great Service</li>
            <li> It is OK I hope it will stay good for toothbrushing at least 1 year</li>
            <li> Kids are happy. Nevertheless the &amp;#34;signal&amp;#34; for the two minutes is not a &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; but just a quickly stop of the toothbrush...my kids could imitate easily....</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 3 year old. This brush takes the fight out of brushing. He likes it and his teeth are super clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased two for each of my kids.  It seems to work well, and the novelty of it gets my kids excited to brush their teeth.  Not sure if it works better than regular brushing, but you would think it would.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and amazing price! Loving it so far</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 80 year old mother because advertised for sensitive teeth and she loves it.  Says it is the best toothbrush she has ever owned.  And the price is right!</li>
            <li> very nice for children</li>
            <li> Good brush for the kids</li>
            <li> It is assumed that this is a product for teenagers, but I bought it even though I have 41 years because it is just what I wanted: A toothbrush rechargeable electric, with at least one replacement head and a timer to indicate time optimum brushing (2 minutes). Works great, has a beautiful design and a great price, you can not ask for more! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Looks like it will do the job.  So far so good.  Priced right.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and the toothbrush stopped working after only 2 uses.  It doesn&#x27;t start at all even after charging it for 16-24 hrs.  Luckily it broke within the 30 day Amazon return period so I&#x27;ll be ordering another one but if this had broke after day 31 I&#x27;d be a bit peeved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had several other electric Oral-B toothbrushes in the family and this is the first one to ever fail on us......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost 3 months with the replacement toothbrush everything is working out fine so it seems like if you received a defective/faulty toothbrush it&#x27;ll fail in the first few uses otherwise it should be fine and good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating updated to reflect replacement.</li>
            <li> bought for my granddaughter, just the right size for a child and easy to handle for a child</li>
            <li> Love it! You do not have to go for 2 minutes if you don&#x27;t want to. My old battery Sonicare forced me to do that. Also, goes circular instead of vibrating. It is more powerful, too. Easy to charge. I am so pleased!</li>
            <li> My son received this for Christmas. He loves it! Ionly wish there was some sort of light indicator for the timer.</li>
            <li> My son loves this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The power toothdrush was received earlier then expected which was great. I wish I had bought this product years ago makes brushing easier and more thorough!!</li>
            <li> From the description, this didn&#x27;t seem so different from the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; version, so I gave it a try, and so far as I can tell the only differences are some decoration and the price. Very happy I went with this one!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  I just turned 60 and only needed to clean my teeth, nothing fancy.  This is perfect,</li>
            <li> Kids will really like having this product , its fun to they do not want to stop brushing their teeth</li>
            <li> Works great! Cleans very well, for a fraction of the cost of other electronic toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> Each one of my kids has one of these.  They all seem to enjoy them and do a good job with them when brushing their teeth.  Replacement heads are easy to find and most department stores have a store brand that is cheaper.  Only complaint that I wish there were different patterns and/or colors.  We had to put stickers on them so the kids would know which one was theirs.  Have not had any battery recharge issues but will update if we do.</li>
            <li> It is what it is, nothing more, nothing less...works as advertised.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old uses it and it definitely helps him do a better job cleaning his teeth than a manual toothbrush.  It stays charged a surprisingly long time.  I recommend this to parents who want their kids to do a better job cleaning their teeth.</li>
            <li> This is an extra help to get my kids teeth brush properly. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this product. Perfect for kids.</li>
            <li> Great buy,does the job.</li>
            <li> There is nothing in the package to cover the brush when not in use  I know there usually is nothing like that included but I thin it would be nice.  Just leaving it sticking up uncovered attracts germs.  I an not interested in some different heads for the brush.</li>
            <li> Love these just wish the batteries lasted longer</li>
            <li> I use this on my who hates having his teeth brushed. This lets me so it myself, and gets his teeth sparkly clean!</li>
            <li> Works great and the price was right.  What else can I say.</li>
            <li> I miss my two speed Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush, but I&#x27;m trying to get used to this one.  More chance of splatter with only one speed so I try to remember to brush while still in bathrobe.  The price was right, it gets my teeth clean and it has a timer so it certainly meets my basic needs.  The lower profile charger is nicer than the bigger one my old toothbrush had.  This one has decals that make it look a bit like a kid&#x27;s toothbrush, but it is adult size.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes for the little ones, encourages them to brush regularly!</li>
            <li> Son likes the sonic brush &#x27;like Mom&#x27;s&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second timer buzzes like the adult version to let you know to switch brushing &#x27;quadrants&#x27;. Since we brush together at night it&#x27;s not an issue then. I think he&#x27;s really liked using this over a manual toothbrush. Anything to help him with this is a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> Got one of these at the dentist, then ordered this one for my 4 year old.  Works well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is perfect to start in this whole new world of good cleaning habits. Fits perfectly in hand and does its job very well.</li>
            <li> After many years of service my old Oral-B Rechargeable  Toothbrush stopped working. In my search for a replacement I came across this one and liked what I saw. Loved the little design on it and even though it is a little different than the one I had I am not disappointed in its performance. It has worked just great for me. It seems a little smaller and gentler than my old one which is just fine with me since my gums and teeth have become more sensitive.</li>
            <li> my girl is only 3+ not fit</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I like it.  The dental tech recommended Braun and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  Takes a bit getting used to, but mouth already feels better after not even a week.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to only use this toothbrush, as it is for sensitive teeth, and the bristles are soft. I was not at all disappointed, and I love it so much that I am buying one for my 12 year old son. I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric toothbrushes in the past, but I liked that this one was affordable (including the refills), incredibly effective yet gentle, and doesn&#x27;t have too many &amp;#34;functions&amp;#34; or buttons- I don&#x27;t need a batman utility belt item- just an electric toothbrush. It works great.</li>
            <li> Just like the adult version, does a fine job.</li>
            <li> Never worked after trying to charge. returned item for refund</li>
            <li> I am using it ,it feels good.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and I don&#x27;t have to fight with her to brush anymore.  What&#x27;s more is there to say about how well it works than that?  She loves waiting for the timer and for me, it keeps her bruising better and longer than she would with any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great for a teenager with braces.</li>
            <li> I like the design and the kids are using it.  It works well.  I only wish the brush refills were the same as my oral B refills....nuisance to buy two sizes.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it.  She likes to brush her teeth and finds the electric brush must easier to get the job done.  Charge lasts and the action is great.</li>
            <li> It is a greaat toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My little girl never really liked to brush and she has actually started enjoyed brushing since this purchase.</li>
            <li> my son loves this tooth brush</li>
            <li> Have now had it for two months with no issues except that it tends to die with no warning so need to slum it with a regular brush every 10 days or so. I am lucky to be an old geezer with good genes when it comes to teeth. But, I have a small mouth (only my dentist says so) and don&#x27;t like the hard bristles. SO, this works great for me and is 75% cheaper than the Oral B fancy brush sold through my dentist&#x27;s office. I have noticed that my teeth are much cleaner/brighter/sparkly after 2 mos. of regular use.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product</li>
            <li> Worst packaging that I have ever seen or tried to open on any product.  You need a blowtorch.</li>
            <li> Very good toothbrush. My son&#x27;s teeth are cleaner noe and he understands the importance of having good brushing habits.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old loves it and I like it because</li>
            <li> The last Oral-B I purchased lasted 8 years before the battery was no good. I&#x27;ve never had NiCads last that long before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new one uses Nickel Metal Hydride batteries. With just one person using it, it&#x27;ll go nearly 2 weeks before it needs charged again. That&#x27;s nearly twice as long as my last one.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is the charger has no wall mount for it, but other than that I really like it!</li>
            <li> They work better than regular toothbrushes do. Recommended by our dentist.</li>
            <li> Does the job! Works great</li>
            <li> My 2 year old hates brushing his teeth. Always squirming and trying to leave, this tooth brush mashes me feel and notice that his teeth get cleaned better because of the rotating motion. We accomplish more cleaning, and he likes this brush better than a regular toothbrush, due to the vibrationand massage like sensation.</li>
            <li> My son loves having a toothbrush like mom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Good investment for the money.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old son loves his new toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Works well. Holds a charge. I like the two minute timer.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dentist as a good one that is more gentle than the Sonicare we already have at home. She&#x27;s been using it for several months now and likes it. I like the timer feature. It keeps her brushing longer than she would otherwise.</li>
            <li> Great ,it look good and beautiful</li>
            <li> Son likes it. I like that it uses reusable brush heads, unlike the other kid&#x27;s electric toothbrushes that are disposable.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 8 year old because he wasn&#x27;t brushing his teeth long enough.  Works great for that purpose.  I wish it had the function of making a noise each time he&#x27;s supposed to change quadrants.  It would be helpful.</li>
            <li> We purchased this for  my 4 year old daughter so she could get a better clean. I use Oral-B products for myself. The slower spinning is great for younger kids. The soft brush makes me feel great about using it on her teeth. I feel like it helps kids get used to going to the dentist and having the dentist use the cleaning machine on their teeth. The design on the handle is cute and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> So far I love my new toothbrush. It was time for me to replace my old one, since it wasn&#x27;t keeping it&#x27;s charge for more than 3 days.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised but package didn&#x27;t come with instructions.</li>
            <li> Great product shipped from Canada? But charger is only 110V unsuitable for India! Also invoice shows 31$but I was billed 41$</li>
            <li> Read this description carefully! It turns out that this is a &amp;#34;Gentle Cycle &amp;#34; brush for kids. It turned out that&#x27;s what I needed but you may not. I&#x27;ve been happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works better than the older model it is replacing</li>
            <li> I now understand others&#x27; comments about this toothbrush being too noisy and the vibration too strong. I was leery about purchasing this particular model, but I fell in love with it immediately! The vibration and &amp;#34;noise&amp;#34; are not a problem. And I haven&#x27;t had any problems with odor because, AS ADVISED, I remove the brush from the holder every day. I have brushed my teeth with a manual toothbrush for 50+ years so I finally succumbed to an electric model because I have MS and it was becoming more difficult to brush my teeth properly. I have absolutely NO issues with the&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B Pro-Health For Me Rechargeable Power Toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I  had an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush that lasted for numerous years.  I still had a large package of the brush heads and thought since this looked like the same brush head I would be able to use them with this toothbrush.  I was disappointed to find they do not fit.  If they had been universal as I believed I would have rated a five star.  I guess I should have done more research,</li>
            <li> Love the tooth brushes for the kids. Love the timer for 2 minutes. Now I don&#x27;t have to time each one of the kids when they brush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is more suitable for me to use too, I feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relatively soft bristles will not hurt the gums , and the rotational speed is also very moderate.</li>
            <li> We choose this one because of the small brush head. But the spin speed is really too fast. My son does not like it and we change back to the less expensive ones, like G.U.M.&lt;br /&gt;The overall quality of this product is good, but just not good for my son, who only accept a slower spin speed toothbrush. Maybe we can wait for some time and use it again.</li>
            <li> We have been using these for a little over a month and really like how they make your mouth feel clean.  In the time we have been using these toothbrushes we have made a trip to the dentist office for teeth cleaning and our dental techs say our teeth are very well taken care of and most of all clean.  We would buy again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I have owned a number of Oral B power toothbrushes.  They have all been essentially the same and this looks identical to the one it replaced.  It works well so far with good battery power.  The real test is how long the battery will last - not between charges, but until it doesn&#x27;t take a charge;</li>
            <li> I have owned Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years.  They are great ! ! !  The only issue I have with this model is that black stars and circles on the handle.  When I bought it I thought it was part of the packaging, but it&#x27;s actually on the handle of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had Oral B toothbrushes years ago and loved them, so I was thrilled to find this for my son.  Unfortunately it only lasted less than 2 minutes... The motor locked up and that was the end of it.  It is going back to Amazon and I am still searching for a good kids&#x27; rechargeable brush :(</li>
            <li> This product is great for cleaning braces, and I would definitely order it again the price can not be beat and my daughter loves it!!</li>
            <li> this is a great motivation  for tweens to brush teeth long enough to clean them well.  Great way to help  kids properly clean teeth. love it</li>
            <li> There is no dearth of good reviews. However my personal experience was just opposite. I ordered his brush , it quit after two days and I returned it. Amazon of course madee a quick refund. i ordered another hoping the previous one was just a bad piece. I had the same experience.</li>
            <li> My seven year old&#x27;s dentist asked we not have her use this regularly until she&#x27;s a teenager, he feels younger children aren&#x27;t dextrous enough to clean well with these.</li>
            <li> I was prepared to hate this toothbrush.  I disliked a similar adult toothbrush I tried an electric toothbrush a number of years ago and was not thrilled to have to get another one. But with a warning from my dentist that I am damaging my teeth by brushing too hard, I decided to take his recommendation and try again. I am glad I did. This toothbrush is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed two things--the right size and a very gentle brush for my sensitive teeth. This one offers both. I have a small mouth and teeth--I needed children&#x27;s size braces on my adult teeth--and the head of the brush is small. I do not know if it is smaller than the adult brushes, but this one is easy to maneuver in my small mouth and around my individual teeth. And the soft bristled head is so comfortable. I exposed some nerve tissue by brushing too hard and two teeth were hurting when I brushed. They do not hurt with this brush because you don&#x27;t need to scrub--you can let the toothbrush glide gently on your teeth and it does the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect such a gentle brush would clean my teeth better than my hard scrubbing, but it does. My teeth are whiter after just a couple of days. I love it. I can&#x27;t stop smiling. I don&#x27;t care if the battery burns out in a year--I will definitely but another one because it feels good to brush and my smile is prettier. This one is not just for kids.</li>
            <li> Lots of power. Embarrasses battery brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my 8 year old daughter because she really dislikes brushing teeth!! So has now found a new love for this triple daily activity and I am very happy about that.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the brush and the way it cleans but unfortunately I have discovered what seems to be a design flaw that negatively affects use in damp climates. In the holes on the front and back of the brush head, I noticed something black. Accustomed to the rapid growth of mold and mildew in our city, I inserted an inter-proximal brush (very thin) in the holes and withdrew black mold. I poured hydrogen peroxide down the brush and collected the dirty liquid in a glass. The mold had collected although, after use, I habitually shake and clean the brush in running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the above said, it is still true that the brush cleans well, never-the-less I will no longer let my grandchildren use the brushes and I will leave mine soaking in a strong mouthwash  day and night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an Oral B brush for yours (so many years that it cost $20 when I bought it and came with 3 brush heads at Walmart).  I like the job the toothbrush does, and I love the price.  I&#x27;ve had a more expensive unit, which didn&#x27;t last long or perform nearly as well.  After about 8 years, my Oral B bit the dust, while I was away visiting friends.  I immediately went online to reorder, and found it was no longer available except in this model, which, according to reviews, is intended for kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, when I got the product and used it, I realized I should have replaced my old unit a few years ago.  This thing is like power-washing your teeth.  It does a great job.  I especially appreciate the soft heads, because my mouth and teeth are sensitive. I would advise, however, you go easy in breaking this in. Soft brush or not, it can sandblast your teeth and take some skin off the roof of your mouth if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets my 5 stars because it does the job of the much more expensive models for a great low price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was a bit cheaper than what seemed like the equivalent adult toothbrush.  Now that i have it, it seems to work the same as the one I&#x27;d had (which stopped charging) and the one my husband still has.  The only differences we&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;- Looks different ... the colors / pattern&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t have a blinking light to show it&#x27;s charging&lt;br /&gt;- Came with a soft-head toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a great toothbrush, just like all my previous Oral-B toothbrushes.  We&#x27;ve been using them for many years - they don&#x27;t last for ever.  For us, the batteries always eventually stop charging sufficiently. But we don&#x27;t expect rechargeable batteries to last forever.  So we are very happy with all our Oral-B toothbrushes, this one included.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect.  I ordered three and I can tell the difference with brushing in all of my kids.</li>
            <li> It does the job. Is the right price and lasts years.</li>
            <li> I have bought two actually three of these. One for travel and the others for vacation houses. I love the soft brushes.I have the more expensive unit at my home. But in my opinion you don&#x27;t need all the extra features.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she wanted to be like me and use an electric toothbrush. The toothbrush only has one speed-fast. When my daughter has to spit in the sink, the toothbrush sprays all over the mirror. She says the bristles are hard on her gums. The button is very stiff also. The charge is decent and it fits the bill of being an electric toothbrush for older kids.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the money.  Bought two and still working well. The 2 minute timer is a nice idea.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for kids.  I have very high oral hygiene standards and felt my son just wasn&#x27;t brushing with enough enthusiasm.  This really helped.</li>
            <li> The voltage is 110v, and if you want to use it in China, you need to buy a voltage transformer.&lt;br /&gt;The package was in good state when delivered, and my friend&#x27;s child love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft enough that they don&#x27;t hurt ( and thus cause them to recede) my gums. Blasts away tooth junk, holds a charge very very well and buzzes to let you know how long you&#x27;ve used it at one stretch.</li>
            <li> We were having trouble having our kids brush their teeth for a full 2 minutes as we were using a timer, but that requires that all the kids start brushing their teeth at the same time.  -_-  These brushes are perfect since they buzz when the 2 minutes is up and we don&#x27;t have to watch the timer to make sure they brush for the full time.  Also the brush heads seem to last a long time.  Very very happy with the price, considering I had to buy 3 of them, these are a great purchase!</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun Oral B toothbrushes for over 10 years.  They do get to a point that the rechargeable battery won&#x27;t recharge, so I needed a new one.  I was SO please that this one was 50% of the cost of my previous one that I&#x27;d had for about 5 years.  IT is very rare that something actually goes down in cost and is still the same product with the same excellent brushing motion.</li>
            <li> This more for kids I think so parents can hear kids brushing from another room and know they aren&#x27;t faking it. Other wise its a good product in my opinion. I will upgrade when my two included brushes are in need of replacement and keep this one for travel.</li>
            <li> Got this as a replacement for a more expensive Oral-B version.  The other&#x27;s rechargeable battery finally gave out, and we were going to replace it with the same version.  But the price on this was appealing, so why not?  And what I found is that it fits my hand better, cleans just as well, and the only thing is doesn&#x27;t do that the other did was alert me after 15 seconds to move to another quadrant of teeth.  I don&#x27;t really need to pay twice as much for that little alert, and this one does have a pulse to let me know when my two minutes of brushing are up.  For me, this one makes the most sense.  Why pay for what you don&#x27;t need, when this one does just as well?</li>
            <li> my old one gave out, and this new one is working great. i&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have Oral B Electric toothbrushes and my son was BEGGING for one. I ordered this one for my 8 year old and he loves it! It&#x27;s gentle but effective on his teeth and fun for a kid. Great product! We&#x27;re super happy with our purchase. I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> After less than two months the toothbrush stopped recharging.</li>
            <li> it is a great product . I recommend this product for any body that has a child . . I love it</li>
            <li> Great on cleaning your teeth but it is easily knocked over. Be careful where you place it.The base it small and tips .</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush...identical to the adult model except for the price and funny stickers....cheapr price, The brush head is a bit softer but I changed to my other one which died.  Highly recommend.  Actually spins a lot faster too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in March 2015 .. it has now ceased to operate.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly this is beyond the return period so I have no recourse other than to state that THIS IS A REALLY LOUSY PRODUCT: :HAS FAILED TOTALLY AFTER ONLY THREE MONTHS. Perhaps I have received that very rare faulty item that slips through QA. I have had a very similar  .. if not identical Oral B Pro-Health brush that lasted at least a couple of years. I am very disappointed and had just bought a set of replacement brushes.. I was looking forward to continuing brushing with Oral B for a few years ... and now I GET A DUD.&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;Since I cannot give zero stars. One star...&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE July 2015&lt;br /&gt;I now have a replacement that so far is working fine. Since I had kept the defective brush and charging base I have established that its the charging base that is defective. The original brush works fine. Given that the brush is a pretty complex piece of engineering with lots of moving parts its pretty sad that this otherwise fine product fails due to a simple solid state defective charger. There is a long list negative reviews for this product. Many of them clearly with the same problem..  THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD ATTEND TO THIS ASAP.  Great support from Amazon but unless the manufacturer cures the problem, and flushes the supply chain... the current product still has a high risk of failure..  .. Therefore: Since the risk of receiving a faulty set still in the supply chain due entirely to  failure of the charger I see no reason to change the rating from one star..&lt;br /&gt; .</li>
            <li> This was the second one we ordered and it died within 30 days.  It would not recharge.  Seller would not replace it, so I called Oral-B to get a replacement</li>
            <li> I have a bad shoulder, brushing my teeth can be painful...with his toothbrush I only have to use just my fingertips.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 6 year old and he loves it. He enjoys brushing his teeth more now! Timer setting works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Works great. Way better the battery ones!!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a sonicare kids tooth brush for my 5 year son and it was too much for him.  So I purchase this as another option and it is a much better option for him.  He is 7 years old now and he is still enjoying his spin brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using this ptoduct for years, is really excellent! My odontologist had always recomended this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for.  It works great.  Came packaged well.  I have been very happy with Oral B products in the past so I suspect this will be the same.</li>
            <li> Great product. I wanted something for our kids that was as good as the Oral-B my wife and I use. This is it exactly. The on button is somewhat hard to turn on, but I think that may be by design. It allows us to monitor how, and who is using it. It is made very well and the head oscillates, instead of some of the kids toothbrushes where they just vibrate.</li>
            <li> My daughter can use this toothbrush on her own and it does such a great job compared to hand brushing.  My 5 year old needs help but it does better than when I help him with a hand brush.  All children could benefit from the better cleaning of an electric brush.  Also, this is an electric tooth brush not a battery operated cheepo!</li>
            <li> Great.  Cute design and larger grip for tween age kids.  Perfect for my 9 year old daughter.  Never need to remind her to brush now…..</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a round brush with soft to medium bristles. I couldn&#x27;t find any toothbrushes that specified the softness of the brushes, so I chose this one because it&#x27;s suitable for kids. It was delivered quickly. I&#x27;m happy with everything about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a plain rechargeable power toothbrush, nothing special, I like the one with timer and seperate on/off button better.</li>
            <li> Love it! My dentist recommended this toothbrush for my gums. Very soothing. A great value!</li>
            <li> Very afforadable and works very well for the price I paid for.</li>
            <li> The description is somewhat misleading. It states that it comes with two refill heads. There is only 2 total, not 2 extras. Still a good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter 11 months ago for her 7th birthday and I LOVED it when we got it.  However, 6 months after we bought it we had to replace it with a Sonicare because the toothbrush would no longer hold a charge.  I liked the brush head because its small which is perfect for younger children but that&#x27;s about it.  I would NOT recommend this toothbrush to anyone because it is a waste of money seeing that the battery has a life of 6-7 months.</li>
            <li> I get nothing but great dental check-ups, once I started to use the Oral-B. I have gotten over 5 years of daily use out of my current unit. Sent this one to my son.</li>
            <li> It appears to be well made and my daughter does enjoy using it. The description is somewhat misleading. It states that it comes with  two refill heads. There is only 2 total, not 2 extras. Still a good buy.</li>
            <li> It does not have a charging indicator to show if the charging is done! That&#x27;s a bummer! But the brush itself is good</li>
            <li> my child wears braces and lots of gears between the braces which makes brushing teeth very challenging and painful.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this power toothbrush and a water irrigatir for her online.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very effective and the only toothbrush that we have been able to use painlessly and with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> my 7 year old daughter loves it, and it works pretty well!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I enjoy using it very much</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this sensitive Oral-B.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums like the old one could do.  I can also use it on my son.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t get gunky like the regular Oral-B does.  I will stick with the sensitive from now on.  It does not have a working timer like it says it does, or at least mine does not work.  I keep it recharging at all times based on reviews.</li>
            <li> Works well, powerful scrubbing. Easy to use. Make good brushing very quick work</li>
            <li> love my new toothbrush</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is 7. It works and acts just like my more expensive Oral-B brush and has some design on it. The one thing that is different form the more expensive version is the lack of notice when the batteries need to be charged. It just stops working and then you have to plug it in. I just plug it in when I plug mine in and that seems to solve the problem. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it and the small base charging stand.  I think it&#x27;s for kids, but I needed a smaller, soft brush.  Worth the price as I couldn&#x27;t find one in the local Target or Wal-Mart stores.</li>
            <li> I like that the heads are interchangeable with the adult handle.  The handle on this unit is shorter and easier to hold than our older model from Sonicare.  The motor is noisier than the adult models we have.</li>
            <li> works well, ,well designed and quality build.</li>
            <li> so far so good. My nephew loves his new toothbrush</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the kids. The brush is easy to use, cleans well, and comes with replacement heads.  The only thing is that the button is not as easy to operate as other Oral-B electric brushes.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are simple, sanitary (no seems or cracks), and effective (no over brushing anymore, and no plaque).  The batteries last at least two years (which is how long I&#x27;ve had mine) without any reduction in effectiveness.  Charging is via a stand which has no metal contacts (uses induction to charge).  And the price is great.</li>
            <li> Nothing too fancy, but definitely better than a regular tooth brush. Since dental care is becoming so expensive, this is a great way to keep those teeth from decaying! The 2 minute timer thing is also a nice touch.</li>
            <li> A little bit loud when you turn it on.  Works great - has a lot of power\force - I like that for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7yo who was begging for a power toothbrush like mine.  She loves it. The bristles are soft for her enamel and gums. She has no problem holding it and returns it to the charging base without trouble.  Our orthodontist was very impressed by how well she cleaned her teeth without parental assistance. This was one week before her 6-month cleaning at the dentist!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! Great price! Would definately buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I should have asked for a refund when the first of this type stopped working after only 3 months. But I just thought it was coincidence, my own electronic toothbrush lasted forever. But even worse, the second one only lasted 1.5 months. I will give a negative rating for this product if allowed. DON&amp;#34;T buy it!!!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, i have one already, she never felt her teeth feels so clean.</li>
            <li> my son loves it and it make it easier to brush his teeth... we love it</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works great. Certainly encourages children to brush their teeth. Amazon also sells the refills so cheaper than buying a new tooth brush every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this was for kids??! Good strong rotating head!</li>
            <li> Much improved over the earlier Oral-Bs...plus no need for having to changer batteries.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because it was just perfect for my tween boy who is 11 and isn&#x27;t so much into super hero tooth brushes anymore. The tooth brush has the features of a tooth brush for adults, but with a fun design that is perfect. By perfect I mean not for little boys and not for adults. It worked right out of the box and we haven&#x27;t had any issue with it. He just loves it. We actually bought 2 one for my 9 year old, but he still likes is super hero brush for now, so we will put this up in the cupboard.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, You feel your teeth so clean.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 5 yr old son. He loves it. Works well.</li>
            <li> Have you ever tried to brush your kids teeth?  It&#x27;s excruciating.  Given the limited window of opportunity to get in a few brushes, having a power brush is a godsend.  In limited time, these brushes manage to do a pretty good job of powering off all the gunk.  I would note that the heads on these brushes are the standard oral-b heads which mean they might be a tiny bit large for the 6 and under crowd, particularly in the gum line.  Kids loved the graphics and love having their own power brushes that actually work (unlike the battery powered versions which seem woefully underpowered).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A savior of teeth brushing time</li>
            <li> Cleans great, would give 5 stars but vibration is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Great replacement - works perfectly. I did not think it came with a charger, but it does. It&#x27;s the genuine article at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we wanted for our 5 year old.  It has a nice small head which makes it easy for him to use and the timer is great so there are no questions on how long he should brush for.  It is simple to use and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> Has lots of power and holds its charge. The brush snaps in easily.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement of an Oral B unit that I have had for seven years. This one works even better. I&#x27;m sure my dentist will be giving me a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I love new products and when I get them I put them to the ultimate test within the 30 day trial. This toothbrush was charged for the entire recommended charge time, and I left it off the charger every day for 7 days, and it still brushes my teeth just fine. It runs just a little bit weaker since the battery is low on day seven, but runs enough for a good brushing. For the price, it was absolutely worth it. My teeth feel cleaner and I didn&#x27;t have to spend $80-$100 on an electric toothbrush. I think just like with any product,  some people will love it, and some will hate it. I went from a regular toothbrush to this, and it does what I need. If I&#x27;m gone for 4 or 5 days, I don&#x27;t throw the charger in my bag at all, and just bring my brush. If your debating,  I say pull the trigger and try it. It&#x27;s only $30.</li>
            <li> I brought this for myself not realizing it was for a child.  I think the brush could be softer.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I didn&#x27;t take the warnings of other buyers! I clearly need to pay attention. UGH.  My eight year old was so excited to have almost the identical toothbrush to me-- it worked for almost a minute-- then DIED! And will not turn back on.  Unbelievable.  I&#x27;m going to call Oral-B tomorrow.  I purchased 2-- one for each of my kids; the other is still working-- but I want to know what other options are available-- this cannot possibly be the best kids toothbrush they make.</li>
            <li> Love the timer that makes sure you brush enough</li>
            <li> it is gift i did not use it .</li>
            <li> I use this for my 3 year old. It&#x27;s so much easier than trying to rotate a toothbrush around in his mouth, especially since he doesn&#x27;t keep it open well or keep his lips loose as I brush. This is easier to fit in and perfect size for little mouths and teeth. The only changes I&#x27;d make to this product are to include a cover for the brush head for storage and travel, and to advertise more accurately (it says two refill heads included, but there are only two total).</li>
            <li> A review combined with a short funny story.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for nearly 10 years. Had the Sonic 200 for 8 years then recently replaced it with a Pro-3000. Our son is 11. About 5 months ago, our family dentist recommended our 11 year old son get braces. I had braces growing up, but really didn&#x27;t know if they were right for our son. He&#x27;s very inconsistent with brushing. For that matter, he&#x27;s even inconsistent when it comes to taking a shower. Thanks to my old orthodontist having those scare photos in his office. The ones that shows holes in teeth of people who had braces, but didn&#x27;t take care of them, I really was stuck on the fence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and mom talked me into getting the braces. First month checkup: Wife takes him and I hear nothing to make me think anything was wrong. Second month was the same. I was checking them myself, but I&#x27;m not an orthodontist. Third month checkup, my mom took him for his checkup. Mom is around 70 and while she typically will take up for the kids, she also isn&#x27;t as bad as my wife for going overboard and telling &amp;#34;white lies&amp;#34; for the kids. I admit it. I&#x27;m hard on the kids compared to most parents these days. With a history in psychology and being raised by in a lower income single parent home made me realize how hard life can be, but also made me appreciate things I didn&#x27;t think I would appreciate as a kid ... like when my mom worked double shifts to pay for my braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tells me the orthodontist was pretty upset with our son and said he&#x27;s been fussing at him every month for not brushing enough and not brushing good enough. I talked to our son that night and told him he had a month to get things turned around. I would be taking him for his fourth month checkup. I honestly believe he really tried. He brushed after each meal and before going to bed, but the orthodontist said it wasn&#x27;t enough improvement. We were driving home. I asked our son what he wanted for his birthday. He of course named off a dozen different video games on the Xbox 360 and the big one &amp;#34;Or you could get me an Xbox One&amp;#34;. I nodded, &amp;#34;So pretty much anything electronic?&amp;#34; He nodded back, &amp;#34;Now you&#x27;re getting it!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, this toothbrush was his electronic birthday present. He couldn&#x27;t believe it. Neither could my wife. I also added the ortho head replacement to make it easier to brush around the brackets. I thought he was going to become stubbon(er) and yes, as most parents will tell you, stubboner is a word. Then he tried the toothbrush. He liked it. I would even say he loved it. I told my wife he can&#x27;t be trusted. There&#x27;s some kind of ulterior motive going on. But there wasn&#x27;t. I had taken him fishing a few days later. We were right near his orthodontist so we stopped in and had him check his progress. The orthodontist was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;It charges well. A note that I left on my review of my Pro-3000 is to wipe the brush handle off after every use. It at least slows the build-up of gunk on the charging base.&lt;br /&gt;The ortho-head is worth it if you&#x27;re buying it for someone with braces. It has more of an open area in the middle to fit around braces to clean around the edges of the brackets.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a few questions about the sound of this model. It&#x27;s a little louder than my Pro-3000. I can hear our son using it, but it&#x27;s not that loud.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it especially for those, like our son, who believes teeth clean themselves. He uses it 4 times a day and hasn&#x27;t complained a single time. You really can see the difference. I think I saw the difference when he used it a few times and kept talking about how &amp;#34;nice and clean&amp;#34; his mouth felt. Now if we can figure out a body wash to take care of the avoiding showers problems we will be set.course named off a dozen different video games on the Xbox 360 and the big one &amp;#34;Or you could get me an Xbox One&amp;#34;.

            <li> My kid loves it. It&#x27;s not too sensitive for 2 year olds.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is geared for kids but works perfectly for adults.  I needed an electric brush for travel and this one  has a compact charger so it works well for  me.  What I don&#x27;t like is that I have to really push hard on the on switch/button to turn it on.  My unit at home is an Oral B and does not have this issue.</li>
            <li> My son loves this toothbrush.  Much better than the throw away toothbrushes that we have been buying at the local box store.  Much more powerful and the battery life is great.  A great purchase!</li>
            <li> We purchased this for our 7yr old daughter.  She likes having one &amp;#34;like mom and dad&amp;#34;.  The two minute timer is great, although for her it seems like &amp;#34;forever!&amp;#34;  Wish that it buzzed at 30-second intervals like the higher end adult models.  Also wish there  was a charge indicator light.  No way to tell if the charge is completed.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the product yesterday and after 2 uses, it will not turn on!! I feel so bad because my son LOVED it and he felt like a big boy (8 years old). Sad to see such a poor product from oral-B. I guess I should have read these reviews before buying it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works well.  I rotates at a constant high speed until the battery energy is almost depleted.  I think this is the standard toothbrush that Oral-B sells, and the name &amp;#34;Pro-Health For Me&amp;#34; with stars on the handle are marketing ploys.  The battery lasts a couple of weeks for me, and then it recharges easily in the brush.  I particularly like the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brushes that are packaged with this unit.  The outer bristles are soft and message the gums without scratching them.  However, a drawback to this toothbrush is that the battery is not replaceable.  I believe that Oral-B was forced by the government to make the battery accessible for recycling, but Oral-B chose to retain the feature that removing the battery almost surely destroys the toothbrush.  In other words, when the battery goes bad, you must purchase a new electric toothbrush.  This is a bad situation, but I don&#x27;t see a competitive rechargeable toothbrush with a replaceable battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for twelve years.  My old one simply wore out.  Since using it I have never had a cavity.  It it superior to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I THINK MINE IS DEFECTIVE ONE BECAUSE SOMETIME WORK BUT SOMETIME NOT WORKING SEEM WEAK. I LIKE IT AND NEED FOR MY SENSITIVE TEETH . IT IS NOT ONLY FOR BABY TEETH AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter instead of the competing Sonicare kids product. My wife loves her Sonicare, but it does take some getting used to and I&#x27;m not sure my 4 year-old would have the patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is fine, although it needs more than one speed. It spins way too fast, which both hurts my daughter&#x27;s mouth and creates a toothpaste-y mess. If they design it with a high *and* a low speed this product would fare much better. The bristles are noticeably softer than adult brushes, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front of the package indicates it is appropriate for 8 year-olds and above, although the accompanying instructions simply say not to use it on kids under 3. If you&#x27;re like me and tired of shelling out $7 a month on a disposable princess spin brush (the bristles never seem to hold up for a full 3 months), this and Sonicare are pretty much your only options for rechargeable kids brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re child is 6 or 7 (or older) I would go with this product. If his/her mouth is tender/sensitive I would continue shelling out money for battery-powered spin brushes a couple more years. Or use this brush every third day and more gentle spin brushes the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  My 9yos teeth are much cleaner. His teethe actually got worse tartar build up initially. His gums were sensitive and took a while to adjust so make sure they are brushing right for the first few months.</li>
            <li> Once you change to an electric toothbrush, you will never go back to a manual one.</li>
            <li> Very very good toothbrush. Exactly what I wanted. Great battery life and easy to recharge. This is the best toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li> Pretty good my teeth are really white. Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as I would have hoped though.</li>
            <li> Great kids toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is the first motorized toothbrush I have used, and I love it. Although it is marketed towards children, it works fine for adults as well. The head attachments that come with it are sort of small, but in my experience this is a good thing so you can reach back teeth easier. I&#x27;ve never had this thing run out of battery or slow down while using it, and I&#x27;ve only been charging it about once a week and using it 1-2 times a day for around 2 1/2 minutes. The handle pulses 3 or 4 times to let you know when it&#x27;s been running for 2 minutes, which is very helpful. I purchased this in May, and I have yet to replace the head (although they recommend replacing it every 3 months) because the one it came with is still in very good shape. The only downside is that it is a bit noisy, but because this is the first motorized brush I&#x27;ve used, I cannot compare the noise to other products.</li>
            <li> My kids had the Sonicare toothbrush for a few years and other than the replacement heads being expensive, it worked very well. After it died I decided to save a few $$ and bought this one and I regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;1. There is only 1 speed and it is crazy fast! My 9 year old daughter hates it, 6 year old doesn&#x27;t seem to mind. Yes, the smaller round spinning heads seem to be effective, but it is very aggressive. (Sonicare had 2 speeds)&lt;br /&gt;2. It runs for a full 2 minutes with no indicator as to when to switch parts of your mouth. When the 2 minutes are up, it sputters a few times then keeps going. When they take it out of their mouths it sprays toothpaste everywhere because it doesn&#x27;t turn off after 2 mins. (Sonicare had 30 second indicators and either 1:30 on low speed for younger /sensitive mouths, 2:00 for older mouths)&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s loud and cheap sounding. It can be intimidating for a child who is new to electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a week and I am going to see what my return options are since I had to destroy the plastic packaging to open it. We may be stuck with it, but I definitely regret not sticking with a Sonicare. They are well worth the money IMO.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it every day. Gives your teeth a clean feeling every time.</li>
            <li> Charged over 16 hours initially per instructions and used it for about a minute before it stopped.  It will not charge so I think the charger is defective. It is deserving of zero stars rather than 1 star as I noted that others have the same problem.  Poor quality control.</li>
            <li> This Oral B works very well and the best part is I don&#x27;t have to worry about not having batteries on hand.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  I bought one 5 yrs ago and it finally died (would not hold a charge anymore).  So I replaced my old one with the exact same model.  This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned and is extremely affordable.  Works just as good as those $80 brushes.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is hard to find in stores so we bought through Amazon. I have two of these toothbrushes for both my kids, they both love it. They would never go back to a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Brush is quite strong and does the  job Like my other tooth brush, which was a Vitality Braun, lasted 6 years, until the battery&lt;br /&gt;went out. I expecting this new Oral B  do the same..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great item</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  Its pretty powerful for younger kids.  I have an 8 and 11 year old and my 8 year old was a little scared of it.  Plus he turned it on without it being in his mouth and toothpaste went flying all over the bathroom.  It took a few tries but they are both getting use to it.  They cant quite do it for the full 2 min yet, but we are working on it. I wish it came in other colors or had color wraps to tell them apart.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush for the kids especially the 2min timer that helps ensure kids have proper brush time</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it! She continuously gets praised on her awesome brushing skills when she goes to the dentist to get her braces checked.</li>
            <li> Kids love them. Not as rough as I had heard.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Our dentist put us on one of these and my gums have recovered normal depths, and, of course our teeth are really clean. The one we bought from the dentist had the battery go out due to being used for several years.  This is a replacement, and with the decent battery a new lease on dental care excellence.  We did try to go with a Phillips Sonicare, and I still use it when I need a real power-brushing, but my wife couldn&#x27;t stand that singing vibration - it &#x27;shocked&#x27; her teeth. This brush (with the extra gentle head) is kind to your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Works great!!  Just like a dentist visit, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and myself. It was cheaper than the adult versions and I like it fine. I Like the small head and the timer. It doesn&#x27;t look childish, and no one sees it it my bathroom anyway.</li>
            <li> Works well, but my child&#x27;s sensitive gums bleed from this.</li>
            <li> I got these for my 2 kids 7 &amp; 8 yrs old they been wanting one of these for a long time and they are little expensive but so far so good cleans their teeth very well. Good buy :)</li>
            <li> Sorry most of my reviews are based on delivery time but when you buy something you want it as soon as possible. This toothbrush works great. I actually bought it to replace one lost in my luggage while travelling and was a lot less than the original Oral B one I had. I chose this one as it was he cheapest but still uses the same toothbrush heads as the more expensive one..... In my opinion the base is a motor and battery it&#x27;s the head that makes the difference. Save money and time and get this one. Delivered quickly and works as good as the one I paid nearly three times for.</li>
            <li> I like it very much my new rechargeable toothbrush, I charge it and can use it for 5 or 6 days.</li>
            <li> We bought 2 of these brushes - one for each kid.  My children are actually pretty young.  4 and 6 yrs old but with a little instruction they are doing very well with these brushes.  The timer on the brushes has been working very well in telling them how long they should really be brushing.  We have had the brushes for several months now and they still work great.  Very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> Loving this for my kids.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised.  My granddaughter was excited!</li>
            <li> Good for kids. I will recommend it to my freinds.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and it has been great at keeping her teeth clean!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product and service!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no for me is for my Husband, but is good</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last 1 minute when the motor just stopped working! Very disappointed because now I have to pay to return it and find another toothbrush ...</li>
            <li> This is a smaller sized brush with the soft bristles.  It is great of children and those of us with tender gums.  It is quiet and we like the two minute timer.  Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> great brush......I like it better than former snooker....this one is easier to clean</li>
            <li> I like this tooth brush a lot! I bought it to replace one I&#x27;ve had for many years. I was happy to find it on Amazon. It was especially nice because I got an Amazon gift card for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Simple. Affordable. Easy for my daughter to use. And the budget-friendly price makes this a winner.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes for 15-20 years and would not think about switching to another brand.  This one works very well for me!</li>
            <li> The item shipped quickly and arrived on time. It is well made and my daughter enjoys the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Fun design. Compact. Comfy brush.</li>
            <li> I got two of these for my grandchildren.  They absolutely love it and I think they like brushing their teeth now, at the very least, it motivates them to get it done and I don&#x27;t worry as much about them doing it right, because the toothbrush takes care of that for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shorter than the other electric toothbrushes in the Oral B line [that I&#x27;ve purchased]. It&#x27;s also slightly wider, and has a rubber backing. Both are nice features for smaller, more clumsy, hands. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the toothbrush, is that it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light that flashes when it&#x27;s due to be recharged. It hasn&#x27;t died yet, because I place it on the charger myself after several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the transaction, from purchase to arrival, everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li> Virtually identical to more expensive models. Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> My kids love them, as much as they can love a toothbrush, so that works for me! I&#x27;m glad the brushheads aren&#x27;t too big and it works much better than the battery powered ones.</li>
            <li> I like it. In the future I would like to be able to purchase the toothbrush without the base. I still have my base, after years the button on the brush give out.</li>
            <li> A manual toothbrush simply cannot clean as effectively as an Oral-B electric.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great starter electric for a child.&lt;br /&gt;Since my child began using this, the oral hygienist and dentist have seen marked improvement in her teeth and gums...no cavities!&lt;br /&gt;It does provide the 2 minute vibration change, which is important so that the child knows to brush the full two minutes as dentists recommend.  It does not, however, come with a clock/timer and vibrate every 30 seconds like the adult Oral-B electric brushes.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased one of these for my oldest daughter for Christmas.  She loved it so much that we actually had to buy a second one for our youngest daughter. They both wear braces &amp; they love this toothbrush.  I like the fact that comes with a plug-in charger so no need for batteries!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this kind of brush over 10 ten years and am surprised to find this very good priced model, especially with two extra soft brush heads included</li>
            <li> Pros: rechargeable,  cleans well, timer, durable, a little tooth paste goes a long way,good price,&lt;br /&gt;Cons: a bit to fast which makes it messy, my gums still bleed (painless), no cover on the brush to keep the bristles clean, could be a bit quieter&lt;br /&gt;Some solutions: put the toothpaste on and brush your teeth with the power off for a little bit then turn it on, try to keep your mouth closed when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are small enough to keep the rate up.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for &amp;#34;toothbrush for braces&amp;#34; but this brush came up first. It&#x27;s not designed for braces. A braces head is mentioned, but it&#x27;s not part of this package. So if you&#x27;re looking for a toothbrush head that is designed for braces, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> got this for my daughter it works great&lt;br /&gt;and she loves the stars design on it. Great&lt;br /&gt;item for the price</li>
            <li> There all good products</li>
            <li> First of all, these clean your teeth far better than can be achieved with a manual brush. Using the Oral B has allowed me to go much longer between professional cleanings. Secondly it is a durable and reliable product. Typically I get three or four years out of one of these before water gets inside or the battery starts getting weak. The last one I used so much I wore a hole through the rubber over the switch. Several months later enough water had gotten in to corrode the motor. Sometimes I just replace one because it gets ugly. When the batteries are new I can go on two week camping trips without a charging. I bought this one because the battery in my old one had weakened to the point of only lasting three days off the charger. Braun builds a quality tooth brush that is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;PS The cheapest power head, such as this one is built just as well as the expensive models.</li>
            <li> wonderful brush. even my 5 years old can use the small head to brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Light weight and compact. Stays charged for a whole week.</li>
            <li> it workds really good and replaces my old toothbrush</li>
            <li> It works nicely to clean my teeth with stars printed on it!  Although it is sold for young people, I am using it as an adult and loving it.</li>
            <li> Reliable, good price, effective, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Really good for the kids. Good quality.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter loves this - and no need to buy a new brush every few months - just exchange the head.  I would not buy it if your child is under 7.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  I was using a battery charged tooth brush prior to this, but the batteries always wore out too quickly.  This is always ready to go, and my teeth are noticeably cleaner.  My dental hygienist even noticed the difference!  I bought the same one for my husband, and he likes it, too.</li>
            <li> Pretty good toothbrush. It took some time for my daughter to get used to the smaller brush. Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light for charging. That bugged me out at 1st, but it hasn&#x27;t died, so I guess it&#x27;s charging ;)</li>
            <li> One of the oral b pro health for me did not have the spare refill which I sent a email about amnd did not get a reply to, very disappointed .</li>
            <li> I bought this power toothbrush for my wife and she is very impressed with it.  She says that it is easy to use and does a great job cleaning her teeth.</li>
            <li> The best! Very happy.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with a storage for the brush heads.  Otherwise its awesome and the kids can&#x27;t wait to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised that we got a defective unit as every other item by oral B has been outstanding. This one will be returned and I will chalk this up to just a rare defective unit.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my daughter perfect for children to remind them how long they should be brushing</li>
            <li> Exceeded my esdpectations.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using one of these Braun toothbrushes for years now and loves it. I&#x27;ve been watching him with it and wondering about it. I finally decided there must be something good about it or he would have abandoned it long ago, so I got one for me. His is the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; version. I&#x27;ve had mine for two days. The only difference between them is their age and mine has stars. He wants to trade. When his wears out I&#x27;ll have to hunt him down a &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; one like mine. That may take a while. They&#x27;re pretty hardy brushes. His has hit the floor a few times and you&#x27;d never know it. One thing you can say about Braun. Their stuff is usually built to last. The battery needs about 16 hours to get a full charge, but if you set it on its stand in the morning it&#x27;s ready for you by bedtime and should hold that charge for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to using it. You can feel the buzz in your hand when you turn it on, but it&#x27;s not a bad vibration. I&#x27;ve used battery operated brushes that felt like all the action was in the handle and nothing at the bristles. This brush puts the action where it belongs - on the teeth. It&#x27;s got some heft but it&#x27;s not a heavy thing. And the feel while you brush? What the heck was I doing to my mouth before this thing?! It&#x27;s easier to work the technique the dentist describes with one of these. You know it. That swirling motion you&#x27;re supposed to brush with. And the head of one of these is just the right size to get those back molars. That buzz I mentioned encourages you to slow down and move gently. No more sawing at your teeth and jamming the head into the back of your jaw. I&#x27;m decent with a toothbrush, but I finally feel like I&#x27;m doing it right. I didn&#x27;t think the softest head was really necessary either, until I had it in my mouth. It felt so nice I worked it over my gums all around my mouth after it pulsed to tell me time was up since it was still running. It runs until you push the button again to turn it off. My teeth feel clean and my gums don&#x27;t feel sanded. They feel massaged. Wish I&#x27;d had one of these when I had braces. Ok, I&#x27;m hooked. No wonder my husband is still using this thing. If you&#x27;re thinking about it, get one.my gums don&#x27;t feel sanded. They feel massaged. Wish I&#x27;d had one of these when I had braces. Ok, I&#x27;m hooked. No wonder my husband is still using this thing. If you&#x27;re thinking about it, get one.</li>
            <li> Have to teach child to clean tooth manually first . This is great gift for child as a reward to regular brushing of teeth.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Rechargeable Power Toothbrush is the best thing that ever happened to brushing your teeth with an electric device.  I once bought a battery operated toothbrush which I promptly discarded because of its construction!  It was also an Oral-B but the battery compartment was at the bottom of the holder with a screw-on/off cap that held the batteries in place.  Water and toothpaste residue would get into the threads of that cap and it was very difficult to clean, maintain and keep dry!  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up on the idea of an electric toothbrush, however, because I need the round head for my teeth!  This one has great power and is a dream to keep clean.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a simple design with small footprint .  It works well and there are no complicated \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Great brush, virtually identical to the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; model but for less than half the price. Only other difference than the price is that this brush handle has a small graphic design. It uses the same replacement heads as the adult brush. If you can find the &amp;#34;For Me&amp;#34; brush heads, they are less expensive.</li>
            <li> Our 9 year old son has had a few cavities, even after brushing twice a day. We bought him this toothbrush after his last dentist visit (and cavity), and he&#x27;s been using it 6 months. This week at his appointment the hygienist said he has one of the cleanest 9 year old mouths she&#x27;s ever seen!! He brushes for the full two minutes at night and uses it in the morning too, but just brushes every tooth, not necessarily for two minutes. In the beginning two minutes seemed like forever for him, but it quickly became the norm. I&#x27;m back to buy our 7 year old one too now!! Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Amazing for the price&lt;br /&gt;At this price my kids have 1 each :)</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush! Leaves my teeth really nice and clean!</li>
            <li> Works great and I love it.</li>
            <li> When you have a toddler who defends herself against tooth brushing as if she&#x27;s being probed by aliens, this thing really helps. If you can get in there, swish around, make some contact, and buzz most teeth, you&#x27;re far better off than trying to use a manual one. The spin is your friend. So far no cavities.</li>
            <li> awesome product and perfect fit for my dad</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 10 year old, she love it!&lt;br /&gt;Good and convenient for kids, comes with one spare brush.</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)</li>
            <li> My 5 &amp; 3 year old love brushing their teeth now. I feel like their teeth are cleaner and it&#x27;s great not having the brush battle every time. This also got them to stop chewing on the bristles. I thought the price point was really good as well.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 10 year old with braces. He loves it and this toothbrush has really helped keep his teeth cleaner. I was hesitant to buy one of the more expensive rechargeables for him, so this is a great alternative. Very similar to my more expensive one. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Received quickly and am very happy with it.  My teeth feel much cleaner than when using a regular hand brush.</li>
            <li> great easy to use the timer is great, stand well designed. Always good in an Oral B product  could use a brush head protector  so do not have to wrap in kleenex should I use it for travel.</li>
            <li> Very functional, no complaints</li>
            <li> It is very good.But I want to known I should choose what kind of toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> The youthful decals are worth the savings. Replaced the 10 year old predecessor.</li>
            <li> dont know why this is advertised as a kids brush it&#x27;s the same size as my old Oral b  Great brush plenty of power and long lasting charge!</li>
            <li> Purchased two of these; one for our daughter who is 9 and one for our son who is 6.  They have been using them at least twice a day for nearly six months now.  We only use one of the chargers and they just rotate (day/night) for charging their toothbrushes.  They do seem to brush longer with these over the manual toothbrushes.  There is a slight &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; if you are new to electric toothbrushes but the kids caught on quickly.  I would definitely recommend these to other children - especially ones who don&#x27;t like to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old is scared of it so my 3 year old uses it with a big smile every day</li>
            <li> Wow, Oral-B apparently hasn&#x27;t changed the head design in 20 years!  My old heads fit onto my kid&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This item works better then I expected. Love it</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It&#x27;s very affordable compared to others out there. It&#x27;s very easy for me to brush my back teeth without gagging like I do with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Our kids love those. They make a vibrating noise that the kids can hear and feel after 2 minutes and they kids just love to use this over a regular tooth brush. The battery lasts about a week before we have to recharge. Since this is a basic model it doesn&#x27;t show how much battery is left, like Oral-B for grown ups do. But honestly, the kids know when the battery is almost empty or empty and it charges so quickly that this is not a problem. We use it for a 4 year old and 7 year old</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Oral B Plaque Control electric toothbrush. Works great, cleans teeth very well, and I have experienced no issues. Great value for money, especially as it incudes 2 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This one does a good job.</li>
            <li> After using the brush 10 times I decided to not use it any more. I did&#x27;t feel comfortable using it and my teeth seemed more sensitive afterward.</li>
            <li> I bought the toothbrush for my granddaughter for her birthday. She wanted one because I have one. I am sure she will love it.</li>
