            <li>good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had lots of people walk by and then ask me what smells so good.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but has no staying power.</li>
            <li>Great price for a nice size bottle of this fruity scented fragrance.</li>
            <li>Both loved them, and loved the bottle it came in.</li>
            <li>And no one ever comments on how good it smells, unless I&#x27;ve just put it on.</li>
            <li>Good luck trying to fix it</li>

            <li>This perfume has a unique smell to it and its awesome</li>
            <li>Remember perfumes mix with ones own scent, so it may not be wonderful on everyone, but from the reviews, it seems to be well liked by most.</li>
            <li>It wasnt a knock off,authentic Lady Gaga for an exceptional price.</li>

            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>it was a tester, so I spritz the air, liked the scent so decided to spritz some on my wrist.</li>
            <li>I ran into this on a cruise ship and liked it - but didn&#x27;t buy it then.  </li>
            <li>Of course Lady Gaga has launched the perfume, so it has its own uniqueness and specialty to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice  fragrance</li>

            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to smell this amazing, but I enjoy it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s elegant and powdery, warm and yummy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfume smell super good</li>
            <li>I have always lightly spritzed skin pulse points and then added more to clothing for a layered scent that lasts!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful scent but not very long duration.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>What more can I write?</li>

            <li>I absolutely love lady gaga.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it sexy as I think a lot of men would find it too floral and overpowering.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>This is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>However, even if you goof and use more than you need, it does not become overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I feel it is appropriate for work or night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I remembered it smelling a bit more fruity in the store.  </li>
            <li>Wife and I LOVES this perfume, it is now my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter had wanted this for 2 years.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s just another artist among many that I listen to once in awhile...</li>
            <li>:) Based on his feedback I have purchased the largest bottle.</li>
            <li>I shopped all over San Diego for a good price on this fragrance and Amazon had the best pricing for this size when I couldn&#x27;t find it for a Christmas present and as promised I received it right before the day.</li>
            <li>Very unique like I&#x27;ve stated in the title.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a warm, sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Its kind of sweet as well.</li>
            <li>My husband is the one who originally picked it out and he loves it too!</li>
            <li>I really love LadyGaga, but not her perform which is strong smell and make me headache.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t imagine people who are sensitive to perfume would be greatly affected, if at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mysterious, intriguing, and most importantly delicious smelling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s trendy but most of all it actually smells good.  </li>
            <li>I think most people will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Bought this on a whim and thanks to good reviews.</li>
            <li>Will strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Everyone says its a nice scent, so I&#x27;m very very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>So I bought the biggest bottle and a a really cheap price.</li>
            <li>The incense that comes through it just wonderful and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I use it primarily</li>
            <li>love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next tim</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because like I said it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is smell like cheap product.</li>
            <li>and i would tell everyone i know to buy it and enjoy it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got light floral scent to it and lightens up throughout the day .</li>
            <li>i know it&#x27;s the REAL THING!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a burst of confidence and subtle sexiness that just makes you feel great! :) 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Love this scent good sized bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet and light flowery scent without being cloying or overpowering.</li>
            <li>i was so excited to buy stuff</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that I could sufficiently murder someone with the cap though.</li>
            <li>It is very very sexy, but still soft and feminine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leave it to Lady Gaga to give something so unique and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so maybe it&#x27;s a great compromise from something hip and young and a bit classic.</li>
            <li>My point being, great fragrance minus the name.</li>
            <li>I really like being able to get a whiff of it all day.</li>
            <li>cool</li>
            <li>I cannot stand girly, overly fruity or flowery scents, but this Gaga perfume is actually quite good.  </li>
            <li>VERY dreamy scent, love it, I&#x27;d recommend it to any one, infact I have.</li>
            <li>Im sure you will be really intrigued by this perfume.</li>
            <li>I super like the perfume</li>
            <li>Last year I paid $95/00 for this same bottle, what a savings from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase for Great fragrance!</li>
            <li>While I love Lady Gaga&#x27;s music, I am still hesitant to buy any perfume that carries a celebrity&#x27;s name... mainly because they&#x27;re celebrities.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice though for it to be such a light scent because it isn&#x27;t overpowering, so</li>
            <li>She said she likes to collect fragrances of super stars.  </li>
            <li>The price on Amazon was much better than retail, so I was glad that I could finally spring for Le Masterpiece.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very exotic and romantic........</li>
            <li>will definitely be buying more when I run out!</li>
            <li>:) Based on his feedback I have purchased the largest bottle.times I &#x27;smelled good&#x27; and this time was all the same stuff, but he is not a perfume-loving guy, so this apparently has some sort of man-attractant property, if that matters to you.</li>
            <li>After arriving home after all my errands, a couple hours worth, I found the scent still lingered and still had that intoxicating quality.  </li>
            <li>I am a woman that tends towards vanilla/earthy scents-they tend to mix well with my own chemistry and bring numerous compliments from all, men and women.</li>
            <li>Its everything I expected and more, I love it.</li>
            <li>This perfume wasn&#x27;t what I expected but I still loved it.</li>
            <li>It was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I own this Lady GAGA perfume but definitely wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a honey undertone to it, which I LOVE, but also has an almost incense-like undertone that makes it more mature and womanly than girly.</li>
            <li>Never the less, it still smells good</li>
            <li>This is a Christmas gift for someone special, I purchased a bottle last year for them not only do they love it, but WOW do I love the scent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful smell , very sultry and classy ,but only wear it on dates highly flirty perfume.</li>
            <li>I was expected something much more original.</li>
            <li>Smells a bit different then the one I smelled in the mall which makes me question if it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li>Wearing this perfume is like when you wear your favorite pair of lingerie under your regular clothes.</li>
            <li>I really like this perfume!</li>
            <li>but I love it so much overall.</li>
            <li>It smells almost like honey amber or something when you first spray it, then it smells sort of fruity as time goes on.</li>
            <li>Love the bottle and overall look of the product though.</li>
            <li>It does smell a bit alcohol based at first</li>
            <li>this is my first time order anything off the internet...</li>
            <li>so I tried one of these first [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>BTW-per the small print ingredient labeling on the bottle, the color is derived by a combination of blackberry juice and added colors, so if sprayed lightly does NOT show up on skin-(I&#x27;m very fair skinned Scotch/Irish), I would however be careful spritzing it onto liqht colored clothing.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this perfume and I am certain that I will receive numerous compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li>Plus the fact that it sprays clear is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Only downfall was the top was broke when arrived so I couldn&#x27;t spray the perfume, however the company switched it out for me and had it arrive really fast</li>
            <li>It is a light scent but powerful enough to smell.</li>
            <li>All collage students have those &#x27;not wearing real clothes today&#x27; days haha!)</li>
            <li>The product is really good, but I&#x27;m personally not in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>The initial scent is a bit strong and has a bit of an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell to it.  </li>
            <li>I love the price (a LOT cheaper than the store) and it shipped without a single problem.</li>
            <li>I gave up perfume for many years because at the time, every single one was either food-scented or smelled like Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s boudoir.</li>
            <li>I love the smell but is very soft and is short</li>
            <li>They really need to make this in a pure perfume but this as it is doesn&#x27;t have much alcohol in it</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>There are rumors this won&#x27;t be around for very</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering another very soon.</li>
            <li>I actually quite enjoy it</li>
            <li>fast, well packaged and in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and my husband loves it too, really recommended.</li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and in good conditions, I don&#x27;t have any complaint about the seller.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully for casual situations, even with a hoodie and jeans as I&#x27;ve learned!</li>
            <li>I also bought the cool toothbrush and actually like the song that&#x27;s on it....</li>
            <li>I actually received a sample of this perfume from a different store and I loved it so had to purchased the big bottle</li>
            <li>The let down is much better.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really delicious, I buy it without smelling it first, but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li>i smell i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I have issues with perfume normally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sexy smelling but with only one or two spritzes, it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly so.</li>
            <li>I sent it back right away.</li>
            <li>Also Belladona is a poisonous plant, so I will be careful how much I spray onto my skin at one time, since what goes on your skin can be absorbed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may spray slightly off-color at first, but t dries clear, quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smells exactly the same</li>
            <li>What my mom and sisters like about it is that although when you first spray it, it smells quite fruity, the smell gradually changes throughout the day and you smell the different layers of the perfume.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;I need to know what black perfume looks like when you spray it\\&quot;, followed by \\&quot;I wonder what Lady Gaga thinks smells good\\&quot;, thinking it was likely to be pretty bizarre.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the black liquid staining, but that does not seem to be an issue even on light colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not certain he has connected the dots that those other times I &#x27;smelled good&#x27; and this time was all the same stuff, but he is not a perfume-loving guy, so this apparently has some sort of man-attractant property, if that matters to you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for nearly two years now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just dilute enough when you spray it on that you don&#x27;t notice the colour much.  </li>
            <li>to the scent though:  it struck me as a bit \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;-ish.  </li>
            <li>A friend said it smelled like old lady</li>
            <li>Girlfriend loves it and she is 45 years old and is NOT a fan of Lady Gaga.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised; it&#x27;s a pleasing scent, assertive but not aggressive, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>recent years it seems like perfumers have really expanded their horizons and moved away from making everything smell like a Mother&#x27;s Day bouquet.</li>
            <li>I believe this is genuine, however, it smelled differently than other times when I smelled in the stores.  </li>
            <li>A very romantic fragrance,  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>First I am 58, not a real fan of Lady Gaga-but I will say I like some of her music.  </li>
            <li>What annoys me is that in all of the ad copy for this product they talk about a unique fluid technology through which black fluid turns clear when you spray it.</li>
            <li>was a little worried about other reviews saying that its VERY unique</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle in store at a military base and LOVED it!</li>
            <li>It smells AWFUL in the bottle, but I get so many compliments on this fragrance, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on and you could easily see in the slight drip that it had black pigment in it:  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a fine suspension, and it&#x27;s still black outside the bottle, it&#x27;s just that the particles are dispersed so widely in a mist that you can&#x27;t tell with the naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I think the claim about some sort of new technology that makes it black in the bottle and clear on your skin are balderdash.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> great buy, &amp; the Femmes love this stuff !</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lots of people walk by and then ask me what smells so good.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but has no staying power.</li>
            <li> Great price for a nice size bottle of this fruity scented fragrance.</li>
            <li> Both loved them, and loved the bottle it came in.</li>
            <li> And no one ever comments on how good it smells, unless I&#x27;ve just put it on.</li>
            <li> Good luck trying to fix it</li>

            <li> It smells really good</li>
            <li> This perfume has a unique smell to it and its awesome</li>
            <li> Remember perfumes mix with ones own scent, so it may not be wonderful on everyone, but from the reviews, it seems to be well liked by most.</li>
            <li> It wasnt a knock off,authentic Lady Gaga for an exceptional price.</li>
            <li> so I have ordered 3 more since Christmas lol.....</li>
            <li> Worth waiting for it and not having to pay the dept store prices was the BEST!</li>

            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> it was a tester, so I spritz the air, liked the scent so decided to spritz some on my wrist.</li>
            <li> I ran into this on a cruise ship and liked it - but didn&#x27;t buy it then.  </li>
            <li> Of course Lady Gaga has launched the perfume, so it has its own uniqueness and specialty to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice  fragrance</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and was available at a great price.</li>

            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to smell this amazing, but I enjoy it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s elegant and powdery, warm and yummy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfume smell super good</li>
            <li> I have always lightly spritzed skin pulse points and then added more to clothing for a layered scent that lasts!  </li>
            <li> Wonderful scent but not very long duration.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> What more can I write?</li>

            <li> I absolutely love lady gaga.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it sexy as I think a lot of men would find it too floral and overpowering.  </li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> This is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li> However, even if you goof and use more than you need, it does not become overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I feel it is appropriate for work or night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I remembered it smelling a bit more fruity in the store.  </li>
            <li> Wife and I LOVES this perfume, it is now my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter had wanted this for 2 years.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s just another artist among many that I listen to once in awhile...</li>
            <li> :) Based on his feedback I have purchased the largest bottle.</li>
            <li> I shopped all over San Diego for a good price on this fragrance and Amazon had the best pricing for this size when I couldn&#x27;t find it for a Christmas present and as promised I received it right before the day.</li>
            <li> Very unique like I&#x27;ve stated in the title.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a warm, sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Its kind of sweet as well.</li>
            <li> My husband is the one who originally picked it out and he loves it too!</li>
            <li> I really love LadyGaga, but not her perform which is strong smell and make me headache.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t imagine people who are sensitive to perfume would be greatly affected, if at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mysterious, intriguing, and most importantly delicious smelling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s trendy but most of all it actually smells good.  </li>
            <li> I think most people will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim and thanks to good reviews.</li>
            <li> Will strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Everyone says its a nice scent, so I&#x27;m very very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> So I bought the biggest bottle and a a really cheap price.</li>
            <li> The incense that comes through it just wonderful and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I use it primarily</li>
            <li> love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next tim</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because like I said it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is smell like cheap product.</li>
            <li> and i would tell everyone i know to buy it and enjoy it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got light floral scent to it and lightens up throughout the day .</li>
            <li> i know it&#x27;s the REAL THING!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a burst of confidence and subtle sexiness that just makes you feel great! :) 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this scent good sized bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet and light flowery scent without being cloying or overpowering.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to buy stuff</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that I could sufficiently murder someone with the cap though.</li>
            <li> It is very very sexy, but still soft and feminine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leave it to Lady Gaga to give something so unique and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so maybe it&#x27;s a great compromise from something hip and young and a bit classic.</li>
            <li> My point being, great fragrance minus the name.</li>
            <li> I really like being able to get a whiff of it all day.</li>
            <li> cool</li>
            <li> I cannot stand girly, overly fruity or flowery scents, but this Gaga perfume is actually quite good.  </li>
            <li> VERY dreamy scent, love it, I&#x27;d recommend it to any one, infact I have.</li>
            <li> Im sure you will be really intrigued by this perfume.</li>
            <li> I super like the perfume</li>
            <li> Last year I paid $95/00 for this same bottle, what a savings from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase for Great fragrance!</li>
            <li> While I love Lady Gaga&#x27;s music, I am still hesitant to buy any perfume that carries a celebrity&#x27;s name... mainly because they&#x27;re celebrities.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice though for it to be such a light scent because it isn&#x27;t overpowering, so</li>
            <li> She said she likes to collect fragrances of super stars.  </li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was much better than retail, so I was glad that I could finally spring for Le Masterpiece.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very exotic and romantic........</li>
            <li> will definitely be buying more when I run out!</li>
            <li> :) Based on his feedback I have purchased the largest bottle.times I &#x27;smelled good&#x27; and this time was all the same stuff, but he is not a perfume-loving guy, so this apparently has some sort of man-attractant property, if that matters to you.</li>
            <li> After arriving home after all my errands, a couple hours worth, I found the scent still lingered and still had that intoxicating quality.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman that tends towards vanilla/earthy scents-they tend to mix well with my own chemistry and bring numerous compliments from all, men and women.</li>
            <li> Its everything I expected and more, I love it.</li>
            <li> This perfume wasn&#x27;t what I expected but I still loved it.</li>
            <li> It was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I own this Lady GAGA perfume but definitely wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a honey undertone to it, which I LOVE, but also has an almost incense-like undertone that makes it more mature and womanly than girly.</li>
            <li> Never the less, it still smells good</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas gift for someone special, I purchased a bottle last year for them not only do they love it, but WOW do I love the scent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful smell , very sultry and classy ,but only wear it on dates highly flirty perfume.</li>
            <li> I was expected something much more original.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit different then the one I smelled in the mall which makes me question if it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li> Wearing this perfume is like when you wear your favorite pair of lingerie under your regular clothes.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume!</li>
            <li> but I love it so much overall.</li>
            <li> It smells almost like honey amber or something when you first spray it, then it smells sort of fruity as time goes on.</li>
            <li> Love the bottle and overall look of the product though.</li>
            <li> It does smell a bit alcohol based at first</li>
            <li> this is my first time order anything off the internet...</li>
            <li> so I tried one of these first [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> BTW-per the small print ingredient labeling on the bottle, the color is derived by a combination of blackberry juice and added colors, so if sprayed lightly does NOT show up on skin-(I&#x27;m very fair skinned Scotch/Irish), I would however be careful spritzing it onto liqht colored clothing.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume and I am certain that I will receive numerous compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> Plus the fact that it sprays clear is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Only downfall was the top was broke when arrived so I couldn&#x27;t spray the perfume, however the company switched it out for me and had it arrive really fast</li>
            <li> It is a light scent but powerful enough to smell.</li>
            <li> All collage students have those &#x27;not wearing real clothes today&#x27; days haha!)</li>
            <li> The product is really good, but I&#x27;m personally not in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> The initial scent is a bit strong and has a bit of an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell to it.  </li>
            <li> I love the price (a LOT cheaper than the store) and it shipped without a single problem.</li>
            <li> I gave up perfume for many years because at the time, every single one was either food-scented or smelled like Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s boudoir.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but is very soft and is short</li>
            <li> They really need to make this in a pure perfume but this as it is doesn&#x27;t have much alcohol in it</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> There are rumors this won&#x27;t be around for very</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering another very soon.</li>
            <li> I actually quite enjoy it</li>
            <li> fast, well packaged and in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and my husband loves it too, really recommended.</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and in good conditions, I don&#x27;t have any complaint about the seller.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully for casual situations, even with a hoodie and jeans as I&#x27;ve learned!</li>
            <li> I also bought the cool toothbrush and actually like the song that&#x27;s on it....</li>
            <li> I actually received a sample of this perfume from a different store and I loved it so had to purchased the big bottle</li>
            <li> The let down is much better.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really delicious, I buy it without smelling it first, but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> i smell i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have issues with perfume normally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super sexy smelling but with only one or two spritzes, it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly so.</li>
            <li> I sent it back right away.</li>
            <li> Also Belladona is a poisonous plant, so I will be careful how much I spray onto my skin at one time, since what goes on your skin can be absorbed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may spray slightly off-color at first, but t dries clear, quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smells exactly the same</li>
            <li> What my mom and sisters like about it is that although when you first spray it, it smells quite fruity, the smell gradually changes throughout the day and you smell the different layers of the perfume.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;I need to know what black perfume looks like when you spray it\\&quot;, followed by \\&quot;I wonder what Lady Gaga thinks smells good\\&quot;, thinking it was likely to be pretty bizarre.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the black liquid staining, but that does not seem to be an issue even on light colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain he has connected the dots that those other times I &#x27;smelled good&#x27; and this time was all the same stuff, but he is not a perfume-loving guy, so this apparently has some sort of man-attractant property, if that matters to you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for nearly two years now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just dilute enough when you spray it on that you don&#x27;t notice the colour much.  </li>
            <li> to the scent though:  it struck me as a bit \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;-ish.  </li>
            <li> A friend said it smelled like old lady</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it and she is 45 years old and is NOT a fan of Lady Gaga.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised; it&#x27;s a pleasing scent, assertive but not aggressive, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> recent years it seems like perfumers have really expanded their horizons and moved away from making everything smell like a Mother&#x27;s Day bouquet.</li>
            <li> I believe this is genuine, however, it smelled differently than other times when I smelled in the stores.  </li>
            <li> A very romantic fragrance,  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> First I am 58, not a real fan of Lady Gaga-but I will say I like some of her music.  </li>
            <li> What annoys me is that in all of the ad copy for this product they talk about a unique fluid technology through which black fluid turns clear when you spray it.</li>
            <li> was a little worried about other reviews saying that its VERY unique</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle in store at a military base and LOVED it!</li>
            <li> It smells AWFUL in the bottle, but I get so many compliments on this fragrance, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on and you could easily see in the slight drip that it had black pigment in it:  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a fine suspension, and it&#x27;s still black outside the bottle, it&#x27;s just that the particles are dispersed so widely in a mist that you can&#x27;t tell with the naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I think the claim about some sort of new technology that makes it black in the bottle and clear on your skin are balderdash.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how sharp the scent is:  </li>
            <li> I was in Walmart of all places when I noticed this WILD looking perfume bottle outside of the locked cabinets-who could miss that black looking bottle with the claws-</li>
            <li> A lot of people say the scent doesn&#x27;t last long, but I say otherwise.  </li>
            <li> If you find that certain perfumes just make it hard to breathe, my advice is to find a local store which sells this and try a sample.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t last for very long</li>
            <li> enough that I was careful not to get it on white clothes.  </li>
            <li> DOES NOT STAY LONG</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received a few compliments while I was wearing it and everyone gets surprised when I tell them what it is</li>
            <li> it didnt even take long to come and</li>
            <li> The smells last a lot longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> This does not smell the same nor does it last all day like my previous one not bought on line.</li>
            <li> Its so different from any other perfume</li>
            <li> Very reminiscent of a watered down version of Dior&#x27;s Poison.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last very long , such a small container.</li>
            <li> No problem with the black fluid staining my clothes.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t linger as long as I want it to, but I also haven&#x27;t tried the Eau de Parfum, only the Eau de Toilet/Perfume which is a weaker strength.  </li>
            <li> long-? due to its ingredients?, don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Found a few days later</li>
            <li> I never purchase celebrity anything, at least not due to it being linked to a celebrity.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is long-lasting, and doesn&#x27;t require marination (a little goes a long way, in other words).  </li>
            <li> I am starting to feel uncomfortable and may be looking for new friends soon.</li>
            <li> This one is somewhat different than the small bottle.</li>
            <li> enough to give you a small headache...</li>
            <li> \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot; over the past several months, and the other night noticed this in the cabinet and inspected the bottle, commenting on the color, turning it over to read the name.</li>
            <li> If you, like me, are sensitive to scents but are tired of always smelling like cookies, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I like the design of the bottle, and the fact that the perfume is black and comes out colorless (half the reason I bought it).  </li>
            <li> The problem is it is gone in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> it is a slightly gagging scent..</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the package is a little bit squished, so I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that I was going to like this fragrance but bought it because of the reviews and a little spritz I tried in a dept. store.</li>
            <li> Heavy.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells just like the green Palmolive liquid dishwashing detergent/!!!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It is NOT an old-lady scent in my book, nor is it a heavy floral.</li>
            <li> spray at least 6-8 inches away from clothing though because it is black liquid.</li>
            <li> really got me disappointed and not worth any money at all.</li>
            <li> I started out with the small 1oz bottle</li>
            <li> Not sure why they bother saying</li>
            <li> To me that just translates as non juvenile .</li>
            <li> THe black colour of the liquid makes you think that it is a dark and sinister perfume, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the smell</li>
            <li> My friends are addicted to sniffing me.</li>
            <li> AM NOT HAPPY WITH IT .IT</li>
            <li> Seriously one of my favourite perfumes ever!</li>
            <li> I know it sounds silly, but this scent reminds me of Daenerys from Game of Thrones.  </li>
            <li> the package seemed to be unopened, but the fragrance has a very weak plumage compared to the bottle I bough from Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> you guys sold me a fake spray, this spray doesn&#x27;t last for 5mins, i am very disappointed with guys..</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost gone, so sad..</li>
            <li> Something wrong.  </li>
            <li> Knowing what a nut job Lady Gaga is, I half-expected this perfume to smell like a coked up train wreck with a nasty case of blue waffles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guilty of reapplying though often</li>
            <li> I smell expensive even tho</li>
            <li> fake</li>
            <li> bottle reminds me of SNow White&#x27;s evil stepmother.  </li>
            <li> CRAZY</li>
            <li> i wasnt disappointed</li>
            <li> I felt bad getting my finger prints all over!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this scent good sized bottle lasts a long time. Heavy.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim and thanks to good reviews. Obviously this is cheaper then getting it at Macy&#x27;s or something. It smells the same as the ones in store.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of Lady Gaga, I bought this as a gift. The recipient was very happy with it, and I have to admit it is a great scent. I was worried about the black liquid staining, but that does not seem to be an issue even on light colors.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a unique smell to it and its awesome i love it my mom gave it to me as a gift and i get a lot of compliments whenever i wear it people always tell me hoe good i smell i highly recommend this product you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> got it for my mother for mothers day. She Loves it and id recommend especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Lady Gaga Fame as a gift. What more can I write? Gina loves her Lady Gaga, and love always gets five stars.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of lady gaga for my wife. I love the price (a LOT cheaper than the store) and it shipped without a single problem. Will continue to order!</li>
            <li> Thank u so much I super like the perfume&lt;br /&gt;And arrived on time..&lt;br /&gt;Perfume smell super good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Smells a bit different then the one I smelled in the mall which makes me question if it&#x27;s authentic. It does smell okay but I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas gift for someone special, I purchased a bottle last year for them not only do they love it, but WOW do I love the scent! Very exotic and romantic........Last year I paid $95/00 for this same bottle, what a savings from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase for Great fragrance!</li>
            <li> Love the scent but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> I have issues with perfume normally. Most perfumes cause me to have an asthma attack. I tried a sample of this perfume and fell in love with it. My husband bought it for me and I wear it daily without any issues.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Yes, I am a lady Gaga fan so that is why i initially wanted to try this scent. I started out with the small 1oz bottle and I love it. It always gets me compliments!  So I bought the biggest bottle and a a really cheap price. 100% satisfied :)</li>
            <li> So perfect!! Love it!</li>
            <li> While I love Lady Gaga&#x27;s music, I am still hesitant to buy any perfume that carries a celebrity&#x27;s name... mainly because they&#x27;re celebrities.  This perfume is perfection though! It has a sweet and light flowery scent without being cloying or overpowering. The incense that comes through it just wonderful and not too heavy.  I know it sounds silly, but this scent reminds me of Daenerys from Game of Thrones.  GRRM describes the different flower oils she wears, and the incense can&#x27;t help but remind me of the fire from her Dothraki tents... AND DRAGONS!  If you can&#x27;t tell, I am highly in love with it.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t linger as long as I want it to, but I also haven&#x27;t tried the Eau de Parfum, only the Eau de Toilet/Perfume which is a weaker strength.  It&#x27;s nice though for it to be such a light scent because it isn&#x27;t overpowering, so I don&#x27;t imagine people who are sensitive to perfume would be greatly affected, if at all.</li>
            <li> Once I got this and opened it and smelled it I realized it smells nothing like it is supposed to. I sent it back right away. ICK!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume! It&#x27;s super sexy smelling but with only one or two spritzes, it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly so. You can wear it on the daily or for a date. It&#x27;s mysterious, intriguing, and most importantly delicious smelling. I really like being able to get a whiff of it all day. I&#x27;ve had lots of people walk by and then ask me what smells so good. Wearing this perfume is like when you wear your favorite pair of lingerie under your regular clothes. It&#x27;s a burst of confidence and subtle sexiness that just makes you feel great! :) 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a lady gaga fan but my uncle bought me this for Christmas and I have been running through it and ordering it ever since. I use it primarily so I have ordered 3 more since Christmas lol.....I&#x27;m addicted to the smell and my BF is too. I also bought the cool toothbrush and actually like the song that&#x27;s on it....cool</li>
            <li> I bought this for my oldest great niece for Christmas 2013.  It was on her list.  I asked her this Christmas, 2014, if she had any left.  She never opened it!  She said she likes to collect fragrances of super stars.  If she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy, and she&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and was available at a great price.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume! It smells wonderful and makes you feel sexy.  The packaging of this product is beauitful, too. I felt bad getting my finger prints all over! I feel for the size I got it was a great price! Thank you! :D</li>
            <li> A lot of people say the scent doesn&#x27;t last long, but I say otherwise.  I like the design of the bottle, and the fact that the perfume is black and comes out colorless (half the reason I bought it).  I love the scent, I think it lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I hade a smaller version of this product and when i ran out i was so up set. when i cam over to america i was so excited to buy stuff online but i was warned to be carful. i found this product and when i got it i fell in love with it &gt;XD it&#x27;s smells exactly the same so i know it&#x27;s the REAL THING!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, the smell is amazing! My husband is the one who originally picked it out and he loves it too!</li>
            <li> you guys sold me a fake spray, this spray doesn&#x27;t last for 5mins, i am very disappointed with guys..I need to be compensated</li>
            <li> I heard it has a mixture of her blood, some semen from God knows who and something poisonous....uh no thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my LADY CAUSE I LOVE THE SMELL IT ATTRACTS ME LIKE CRAZY I LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS FOR THE SELLERS THANKS</li>
            <li> The scent is awesome, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the package is a little bit squished, so I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> My friends are addicted to sniffing me. I am starting to feel uncomfortable and may be looking for new friends soon.</li>
            <li> Very reminiscent of a watered down version of Dior&#x27;s Poison. It smells good, but has no staying power. I was expected something much more original.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent but not very long duration.</li>
            <li> love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next tim</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and I get lots of compliments on it.  A very romantic fragrance,  I highly recommend it. Love it.</li>
            <li> First I am 58, not a real fan of Lady Gaga-but I will say I like some of her music.  I never purchase celebrity anything, at least not due to it being linked to a celebrity. Well, I purchased this perfume.  I was in Walmart of all places when I noticed this WILD looking perfume bottle outside of the locked cabinets-who could miss that black looking bottle with the claws-it was a tester, so I spritz the air, liked the scent so decided to spritz some on my wrist. Found myself continually sniffing my wrist while I shopped. After arriving home after all my errands, a couple hours worth, I found the scent still lingered and still had that intoxicating quality.  Found a few days later the idea of that scent kept popping into my mind, so I went online, googled Lady Gaga Fame perfume and found the best price here on Amazon. Purchased the 3.4oz bottle. Awesome scent! Remember perfumes mix with ones own scent, so it may not be wonderful on everyone, but from the reviews, it seems to be well liked by most. I am a woman that tends towards vanilla/earthy scents-they tend to mix well with my own chemistry and bring numerous compliments from all, men and women. This scent works very similar on me. VERY happy I purchased, enough so I have purchased another 2 bottles from the same seller. BTW-per the small print ingredient labeling on the bottle, the color is derived by a combination of blackberry juice and added colors, so if sprayed lightly does NOT show up on skin-(I&#x27;m very fair skinned Scotch/Irish), I would however be careful spritzing it onto liqht colored clothing. Also Belladona is a poisonous plant, so I will be careful how much I spray onto my skin at one time, since what goes on your skin can be absorbed. I have always lightly spritzed skin pulse points and then added more to clothing for a layered scent that lasts!  There are rumors this won&#x27;t be around for very long-? due to its ingredients?, don&#x27;t know. Just very happy I purchased enough to last awhile. Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter is totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great price for a nice size bottle of this fruity scented fragrance.</li>
            <li> Man where to begin. I bought this for myself. It arrived and I put it on it smells so delicious and sexy. The problem is it is gone in less than an hour. Not even a trace. I don&#x27;t even attempt to wear this outside of the house because it has no staying power. It&#x27;s a shame because like I said it is fantastic. I even tried layering it nope that didn&#x27;t work either. I buy it though because I wear it for myself around the house. I&#x27;m thankful it is priced so well because I go through a bottle a month. They really need to make this in a pure perfume but this as it is doesn&#x27;t have much alcohol in it so I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t last for very long and I see I&#x27;m not the only one.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mother (age 50s) and my 2 sisters (age 30s), and they all love it.  It&#x27;s trendy but most of all it actually smells good.  I&#x27;m a guy, and even I like the smell - most of the time I cannot stand girly, overly fruity or flowery scents, but this Gaga perfume is actually quite good.  What my mom and sisters like about it is that although when you first spray it, it smells quite fruity, the smell gradually changes throughout the day and you smell the different layers of the perfume.  Plus the fact that it sprays clear is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> was very impressed on the smell, ladies this is a must have. You will not be sorry. Words can not express must smell for your self</li>
            <li> Awesome deal on the price for this size of bottle!  Authentically packaged, no flaws.  I will be buying all my perfume online!</li>
            <li> seen my girl checking this out at department store with great interest. I bought two of these gifts, for my girl and my niece for xmas. Both loved them, and loved the bottle it came in. Put a smile on both there faces, great product at a great price</li>
            <li> This is a must by. buy it for someone, or for yourself. definitely will be purchasing it again sometime soon</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend who loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Was listed at a great price, so I had to order it...</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT IT UNDER COMMERCIAL INFLUENCE .I AM NOT HAPPY WITH IT .IT SMELLS LIKE PALMOLIVE  SOAP .IT DOES NOT STAY LONG AND YOU SMELL IT COUPLE OF MINUTES, AND THEN IT IS GONE.</li>
            <li> Seriously one of my favourite perfumes ever! I&#x27;ve had mine for nearly two years now and it&#x27;s almost gone, so sad.. I plan on ordering another very soon. Cannot get enough of the scent, although I do wish it&#x27;d last a bit longer. Seems like I just put it on and I can&#x27;t smell it anymore. And no one ever comments on how good it smells, unless I&#x27;ve just put it on. Kind of disappointing in that sense but I love it so much overall.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom and she loves it! Great perfume!</li>
            <li> ...and affordable enough to wear every day. I&#x27;ve received a few compliments while I was wearing it and everyone gets surprised when I tell them what it is</li>
            <li> I actually received a sample of this perfume from a different store and I loved it so had to purchased the big bottle and I absolutely love love love it and it&#x27;s smells great.</li>
            <li> the package seemed to be unopened, but the fragrance has a very weak plumage compared to the bottle I bough from Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I really love LadyGaga, but not her perform which is strong smell and make me headache. It is smell like cheap product.</li>
            <li> Bottle does not spray!  Something wrong.  Good luck trying to fix it,  won&#x27;t come out.  Maybe it smells good, I wouldn&#x27;t know since the bottle is faulty.</li>
            <li> Knowing what a nut job Lady Gaga is, I half-expected this perfume to smell like a coked up train wreck with a nasty case of blue waffles. Thankfully, it does not. I actually quite enjoy it and it&#x27;s not overpowering. I am pretty sure that I could sufficiently murder someone with the cap though. Not even going to lie.</li>
            <li> I bought this a christmas gift and it was perfect. Got it the day after christmas, but it was still a great gift to give.</li>
            <li> i love it, even my mom love it and i gave it as a gift to her. i will order another one.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume! It smells almost like honey amber or something when you first spray it, then it smells sort of fruity as time goes on. I would say overall it&#x27;s a warm, sweet scent. spray at least 6-8 inches away from clothing though because it is black liquid. will definitely be buying more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I love the packaging alot...would do as a gift. Love the fragrance too.</li>
            <li> I shopped all over San Diego for a good price on this fragrance and Amazon had the best pricing for this size when I couldn&#x27;t find it for a Christmas present and as promised I received it right before the day.</li>
            <li> It smells AWFUL in the bottle, but I get so many compliments on this fragrance, I absolutely love it! I will buy this one again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume and I am certain that I will receive numerous compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I love the package. This one just delivers everything I want in a perfume. Must have!</li>
            <li> The product is really good, but I&#x27;m personally not in love with the smell. I think most people will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Its everything I expected and more, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance but bought this bottle as a gift.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Assumed I was getting the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; after seeming like product checked out; but this is not the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; at all. I bought my first bottle in store at a military base and LOVED it! This does not smell the same nor does it last all day like my previous one not bought on line. Would not recomend or buy again.</li>
            <li> Very unique like I&#x27;ve stated in the title. It has a honey undertone to it, which I LOVE, but also has an almost incense-like undertone that makes it more mature and womanly than girly. It works wonderfully for casual situations, even with a hoodie and jeans as I&#x27;ve learned! (I&#x27;m a collage student. All collage students have those &#x27;not wearing real clothes today&#x27; days haha!) I love this perfume! Though, it does need reapplied halfway through the day. Still a wonderful scent though.</li>
            <li> This started out as a  gift for my wife.. Its become an obsession!! We Love the scent and We Love Lady GaGa so its a Win Win..</li>
            <li> I ran into this on a cruise ship and liked it - but didn&#x27;t buy it then.  Very happy now!</li>
            <li> I dont use that stuff and would not buy it if my niece did not wear it. this review is a pain in the butt</li>
            <li> Smells so strong and beautiful I loved it</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, and enjoying item with NO problems :)</li>
            <li> i got this for christmas and i love it and i would tell everyone i know to buy it and enjoy it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love lady gaga. This perfume wasn&#x27;t what I expected but I still loved it. It smells great! !</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how sharp the scent is:  I didn&#x27;t find it sexy as I think a lot of men would find it too floral and overpowering.  What annoys me is that in all of the ad copy for this product they talk about a unique fluid technology through which black fluid turns clear when you spray it. No, it does not.  It&#x27;s just dilute enough when you spray it on that you don&#x27;t notice the colour much.  I sprayed it on and you could easily see in the slight drip that it had black pigment in it:  enough that I was careful not to get it on white clothes.  Not sure why they bother saying otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the scent though:  it struck me as a bit \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;-ish.  Love the bottle and overall look of the product though.</li>
            <li> Love this. A friend told me about this Spray.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent that&#x27;s a great conversation starter. Lol. That or my ice breakers need work. Always received compliments on the softness of the scent. I bought the body wash once but it didn&#x27;t last very long , such a small container. I&#x27;m looking to buy the soap sometime. Best to buy online  because they no longer sell it in Mexico . It&#x27;s got light floral scent to it and lightens up throughout the day . I&#x27;m guilty of reapplying though often so maybe I couldn&#x27;t tell you if lasts all day without being biased. It does smell a bit alcohol based at first so if you&#x27;re looking for an oil based perfume this isn&#x27;t it. A friend said it smelled like old lady but she prefers mens cologne so meh. To me that just translates as non juvenile . My teenaged nieces love it but so do my aunts so maybe it&#x27;s a great compromise from something hip and young and a bit classic.</li>
            <li> I make sure my girlfriend has a stock of this perfume at all times. I love it.</li>
            <li> Its for a Christmas gift, looks like a $200 perfume. Everyone says its a nice scent, so I&#x27;m very very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;Came fast, well packaged and in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could keep it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but is very soft and is short</li>
            <li> Looks great! Only downfall was the top was broke when arrived so I couldn&#x27;t spray the perfume, however the company switched it out for me and had it arrive really fast so I was very happy about that. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that I was going to like this fragrance but bought it because of the reviews and a little spritz I tried in a dept. store. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I waited to order this on Amazon. Worth waiting for it and not having to pay the dept store prices was the BEST! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It is a light scent but powerful enough to smell. I found it on here way cheaper than any store!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to smell this amazing, but I enjoy it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumes.  The fragrance is long-lasting, and doesn&#x27;t require marination (a little goes a long way, in other words).  However, even if you goof and use more than you need, it does not become overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since flowery perfumes tend to give me a headache, I appreciate that this perfume does not have that sort of aroma.  If you find that certain perfumes just make it hard to breathe, my advice is to find a local store which sells this and try a sample.  If you like it, Amazon will keep you hooked up with larger bottle sizes which will last even longer.  Mine arrived within a week of having ordered it, just in time to turn it into a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> my girl loved it...it didnt even take long to come and this is my first time order anything off the internet...i wasnt disappointed</li>
            <li> VERY dreamy scent, love it, I&#x27;d recommend it to any one, infact I have.</li>
            <li> It was a surprise gift for my wife so the size was great.It wasnt a knock off,authentic Lady Gaga for an exceptional price.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome, it smells really fresh and has a unique fragrance. Will strongly recommend it. And the product was shipped on time. Do give it a try. Of course Lady Gaga has launched the perfume, so it has its own uniqueness and specialty to it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, smells fantastic. It took over a month to get to my house, though. The perfume does gives me mother a headache, but doesn&#x27;t give me one at all.</li>
            <li> Got as a gift for a friend, and she loves it.  Some celebs just throw their name on any POS to make a buck, but this is a quality product.</li>
            <li> My daughter was so happy and loves this perfume.  thank you. thank you thank you from my daughter Michelle Nicole</li>
            <li> I loved it !  It&#x27;s a beautiful smell , very sultry and classy ,but only wear it on dates highly flirty perfume.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume. Its so different from any other perfume Ive ever smelled. It is very very sexy, but still soft and feminine. Its kind of sweet as well. I love it. The word that comes to mind is electrifying. I started wearing it to work about a week ago, and I have gotten a lot of compliments from women and men. I feel it is appropriate for work or night.&lt;br /&gt;Leave it to Lady Gaga to give something so unique and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried about other reviews saying that its VERY unique so I tried one of these first [[ASIN:B00B218HC4 Lady Gaga Fame Perfume Oil: Lady Gaga Perfume Women type .5 Ounce Roll-on Perfume]] and was hooked, my hubby too. Im sure you will be really intrigued by this perfume. I absolutely love it. Love!</li>
            <li> I believe this is genuine, however, it smelled differently than other times when I smelled in the stores.  The initial scent is a bit strong and has a bit of an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell to it.  The let down is much better.  I remembered it smelling a bit more fruity in the store.  No problem with the black fluid staining my clothes.  Never the less, it still smells good and I use it back and forth with my regular perfume.  Good for day and night but I think best for night.</li>
            <li> I smell expensive even tho it&#x27;s not. lol.</li>
            <li> Got it  in a good amount of time, and my daughter loves it. It was a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice  fragrance</li>
            <li> it was damaged !!! fake</li>
            <li> My lady likes Lady Gaga and she wanted her cologne for the longest. Thank you for the speedy delivery and I look forward to giving it to her as a present.</li>
            <li> This one is somewhat different than the small bottle. It&#x27;s elegant and powdery, warm and yummy.  The price on Amazon was much better than retail, so I was glad that I could finally spring for Le Masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;It may spray slightly off-color at first, but t dries clear, quickly. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The strength of this perfume faded in couple of months. After 2 months, the perfume lasted for about 10 mins after application.&lt;br /&gt;I use perfumes like Gucci Envy Me, Dior Poison, DKNY Cashmere mist and even after 2 years their strength hasn&#x27;t faded which goes to speak about the originality of the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The strength of this perfume fading in 2 months really got me disappointed and not worth any money at all. Could be that I got a faulty product and maybe not everyone will experience this.</li>
            <li> The smells last a lot longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Wife and I LOVES this perfume, it is now my all time favorite. I will be buying the larger bottle soon.</li>
            <li> great buy, &amp; the Femmes love this stuff !</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift.  My grand daughter had wanted this for 2 years.  She loves the fragrance.  It was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it and she is 45 years old and is NOT a fan of Lady Gaga. My point being, great fragrance minus the name.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells just like the green Palmolive liquid dishwashing detergent/!!!&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion....if you can&#x27;t afford it...just wash yourself with the detergent. I own this Lady GAGA perfume but definitely wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;/To me it is a slightly gagging scent..enough to give you a small headache...&lt;br /&gt;THe bottle reminds me of SNow White&#x27;s evil stepmother.  THe black colour of the liquid makes you think that it is a dark and sinister perfume, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and in good conditions, I don&#x27;t have any complaint about the seller. About the parfum it&#x27;s really delicious, I buy it without smelling it first, but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It smells really good and my husband loves it too, really recommended.</li>
            <li> I do not dislike Lady Gaga, but by no means do I consider myself a &#x27;fan&#x27;. She&#x27;s just another artist among many that I listen to once in awhile...so I don&#x27;t feel that my review is influenced by the need to prop up Lady Gaga.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What intrigued me was the color. I used a tester thinking \\&quot;I need to know what black perfume looks like when you spray it\\&quot;, followed by \\&quot;I wonder what Lady Gaga thinks smells good\\&quot;, thinking it was likely to be pretty bizarre. I was pleasantly surprised; it&#x27;s a pleasing scent, assertive but not aggressive, if that makes sense. It is NOT an old-lady scent in my book, nor is it a heavy floral. I LOATHE FLORALS. They give me headaches and make me sneeze/stuff my nose up. I gave up perfume for many years because at the time, every single one was either food-scented or smelled like Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s boudoir. No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In recent years it seems like perfumers have really expanded their horizons and moved away from making everything smell like a Mother&#x27;s Day bouquet. While this does have obvious floral elements, it is not overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t give me headaches. Notes are said to be belladonna, tiger orchid, saffron,incense, apricot and honey. If you, like me, are sensitive to scents but are tired of always smelling like cookies, give this a try. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I think the claim about some sort of new technology that makes it black in the bottle and clear on your skin are balderdash. It&#x27;s just a fine suspension, and it&#x27;s still black outside the bottle, it&#x27;s just that the particles are dispersed so widely in a mist that you can&#x27;t tell with the naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12-3-2013:&lt;br /&gt;My guy has commented several times \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot; over the past several months, and the other night noticed this in the cabinet and inspected the bottle, commenting on the color, turning it over to read the name. I sprayed some on my arm and he said again \\&quot;That smells good\\&quot;. I&#x27;m not certain he has connected the dots that those other times I &#x27;smelled good&#x27; and this time was all the same stuff, but he is not a perfume-loving guy, so this apparently has some sort of man-attractant property, if that matters to you. :) Based on his feedback I have purchased the largest bottle.times I &#x27;smelled good&#x27; and this time was all the same stuff, but he is not a perfume-loving guy, so this apparently has some sort of man-attractant property, if that matters to you. :) Based on his feedback I have purchased the largest bottle.</li>
