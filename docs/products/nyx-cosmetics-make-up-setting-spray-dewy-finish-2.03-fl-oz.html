            <li>This is a good setting spray.</li>
            <li>This product works really good with the born to glow illuminator</li>
            <li>I like to use a good primer before I put this on help it set longer.</li>
            <li>My makeup looks as good when I get home after 8 hours at the office as it does when I leave in the morning.  </li>
            <li>its not that good for oily skin.</li>
            <li>I had never used a setting spray before and this one provides good coverage and keeps my foundation and powder in place all day.  </li>
            <li>but this one works just as good.</li>
            <li>It lasted a good 4-5 hours in 99% humidity.  </li>
            <li>It truely did make my makeup look flawless and stag that way.</li>
            <li>This is a great inexpensive make up spray, though I like the matte version better.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased...  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery, nice product, great seller!</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Dewy Skin, still matte holds makeup in place for more than 12 hours!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for cheap.</li>
            <li>And boy do I look amazingly dewy(healthy shine).</li>
            <li>I found this and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>Kind of counterproductive, that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a nice finish to my makeup routine</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of a matte finish.</li>
            <li>Thanks for an excellent product!</li>
            <li>Love the way this feels on my face, very cool and sets my makeup great.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice shine after powder instead of suffering the matte finish...but would like a more cooling, calming effect.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this spray!</li>
            <li>and it works! :)</li>
            <li>I prefer the elfs spray better</li>
            <li>It seems much more suited to drier skin types than to normal/oily ones.</li>
            <li>As someone with oily skin, it gives me a healthy glow without being too shiny.</li>
            <li>Love it...recommended to many friends</li>
            <li>Love the dew-like finish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll reach your eyelids better and won&#x27;t accidentally cause your mascara to run.&lt;br</li>
            <li>she likes the matte make up setting spray better.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes you look dewy</li>
            <li>but not a nasty dewy :)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my makeup look and stay put, but it leaves my face a bit sticky feeling and my hair keeps sticking to my face.</li>
            <li>I like the fix+ by MAC more because it smells better</li>
            <li>This is a good purchase and worth the investment.</li>
            <li>love it will order again...</li>
            <li>love this product, made my face glisten</li>
            <li>I love this product with all my heart.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure this goes with anything that you spray on your face).  </li>
            <li>but I was extremly pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Gives you that dewy sun kissed look, I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I get a lot more life out of my makeup application when I apply this over the top.  </li>
            <li>I got sooo many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I ended up abandoning this bottle for one that I made myself out of glycerin and water, which ended up working better.</li>
            <li>the Elf mist way better.</li>
            <li>and i was shock my make up lasted better.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>In which case, the Matte Setting Spray might be a better option but YMMV.</li>
            <li>product is one of my top five products of all time,wouldnt hesitate in buying again</li>
            <li>There is not dewy finish and my make up does not stay in place any better or longer</li>
            <li>Really love this so much!!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li>pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>I wanted a dewy finish and used it with a matte foundation, thinking it would ultimately give me the ideal satin finish.  </li>
            <li>And if you are one of those people who want to try it out but aren&#x27;t sure if you&#x27;ll like it or not then try and get it while it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>This spray does give your skin a nice sheen, make up stays fresh longer fewer touch ups needed.</li>
            <li>and my wife emailed me and told me that she loved it and it was very helpful being that she is a makeup artist</li>
            <li>Easy to spray, doesn&#x27;t feel drying, and does help get a dewy look.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, makes me look amazing, not shiny, more like a natural gloooow..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered and was packed nicely.</li>
            <li>In normal conditions it has lasted a good 12 hours.  </li>
            <li>That said, it smells fine and feels fine.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived in 2 days was very happy it came so quickly , also I have very dry skin</li>
            <li>and this made my makeup look very nice and not dry at all</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and it works.</li>
            <li>I do not want to shine, but after a light powder, I need moisture.</li>
            <li>Scent is light.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t help my makeup stay on longer, the spray is way too strong and I have to hold this a full arms length away from my face.</li>
            <li>I cant use matte because I have dry skin, but the dewy is sensational!</li>
            <li>It also helps to keep my makeup in place and it can be used before foundation or after your makeup is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and very reasonable price:-)</li>
            <li>Was worth the money!</li>
            <li>, me touching my face, and when its hot.</li>
            <li>It feels pretty refreshing.</li>
            <li>this is a great product the effect lasts all day long</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 out of 5 because on hot summer days I feel like it could of stayed a little better, so not the best for days where you&#x27;ll be in the hot sun sweating.</li>
            <li>Gives an amazing Dewey finish, my skin looks alive all day</li>
            <li>true--</li>
            <li>and leave my skin really dewy and glowing :)</li>
            <li>It does not seem to hold my face on much longer than without it, it does give it a better finished look though.</li>
            <li>Shipping is really :)</li>
            <li>This spray has my makeup lasting a 12 hour work filled day and keeping me look fabulous!!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s normally the case with most amazon items, though not all of them.</li>
            <li>Very much I recommend to get!</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday use, just make sure you let it dry so you can clean up any under-eye smudges the misting</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast and easy and the packaging was good.-XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for bringing out highlighters and cream blushes, or if you have dry skin and have that powdery look.</li>
            <li>and really works!!</li>
            <li>I recently started using the setting spray after I was experiencing difficulty with my foundation staying on, and I have to say that I love it!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the $7 I paid for it</li>
            <li>It also sets your makeup so it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>I think I may try to make my own next time around.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin with such a nice dewy not oily finish.</li>
            <li>so I switched to this more natural makeup setting spray:  </li>
            <li>This help me look more natural while still keeping my make up from sweating off.</li>
            <li>and I have found myself rarely having to reapply my foundation throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference in how fresh my makeup looks at the end of the day!</li>
            <li>I would buy another one right now</li>
            <li>Right now the price is about nine dollars</li>
            <li>Would recommend for any skin type, but def helps dry skin look more hydrated!</li>
            <li>Great option to more expensive options on the market.</li>
            <li>I actually bought it because my favorite makeup blogger (Maskcara) recommended it.</li>
            <li>Excellent product  just wish not quite as expensive.</li>
            <li>but it could be more cooling &amp; last longer.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It smudged my mascara the first time i used it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make it look caked on and it really leaves a dewy finish!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly give any noticeable &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; appearance, but it did help makeup resist fading.</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s better than the Mac fix+ and the urban decay.</li>
            <li>The spray that comes with this sprits too much on ur face which will ruin your makeup so dont use it!</li>
            <li>First time buyer have nothing to compare it with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly not sure if it truly works as a setting spray, but i do use it every day and feel more confident when I leave for work.</li>
            <li>I am an avid user of another setting spray but when it was sold out at the moment I decided to try this stuff out.</li>
            <li>works pretty well, would recommend it.</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed it on I felt like my makeup was being washed off, but it was not.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Definitely gives a dewy finish, which is great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>like the matte version better because I have oily skin and the dewy finish can make my oily skin look really oily by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li>Delivers on its promise, long lasting, makeup setting &amp; a beautiful natural dewy look to the skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure what this is really good for.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li>A couple spritzes and one is ready for a glowing day or night on the town.</li>
            <li>This, however, was a much appreciated change.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my skin very dewy, but it works for wetting my beauty blender</li>
            <li>If you apply too much powder, this fixes it without taking it all off.</li>
            <li>straight</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really feel that it works</li>
            <li>Overall though It is definitely worth the price I definitely reccomend :)</li>
            <li>and I really do like it.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t always set my eye makeup, but it sets face makeup really, really well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for me except maybe hydrate/refresh the skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice that it&#x27;s helped with the length of time that my makeup stays put, either.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to test it and see if it really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Change it with another 1.It works really well now</li>
            <li>and I am really liking.</li>
            <li>I really like the dewy finish on this setting spray, it freshens the makeup and makes it stay longer.  </li>
            <li>Straight up, read the ingredients.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t spray it much anyway.</li>
            <li>The price and quality at high level!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like the matte look</li>
            <li>And fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Ill be buying it again</li>
            <li>Either I will keep making my own, or I&#x27;ll try a different brand next time around.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day - when I&#x27;m ready to remove my makeup - it come off easily with my normal facial scrub and water.  </li>
            <li>My first complaint was that the spray bottle did not spray a fine mist like setting sprays should, more like large droplets that you could actually see on your face right after spraying it.</li>
            <li>After around 3 hours I checked and my makeup was separating in places it normally doesn&#x27;t even budge!</li>
            <li>Usually my make up wears off pretty quick, but i put it on at 8 am and wore it all day and night until around 10 or 11pm and it stayed fresh looking!</li>
            <li>I prefer the dewy finish over the matte because I have dry skin, but both work fine.</li>
            <li>I was hestant at first because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this kind of product, so it is difficult to really say how good it is, but I do know that my makeup stay on my face longer than usual.</li>
            <li>also made it last all night will most likely repurchase again .</li>
            <li>Makeup has been a thing for me since I was in Jr. High.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth fixing once at the beginning than the entire rest of the time you have make up on.</li>
            <li>My skin type is normal</li>
            <li>Helps my makeup last longer and looks freshly applied.</li>
            <li>I did later buy the product from a store where I could test it, and for the price, I still don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li>I used it with covergirls outlast 3 in 1 liquid foundation just to see how it worked because normally this makeup will start separating within 4 hours for me.</li>
            <li>It does get the job done&amp;#62; I would use it everyday and my makeup lasts for more than 7 hours.</li>
            <li>Recently I was out and about in humid 80 degree weather and felt the heat, but to my surprise my makeup still looked fresh even after 3 hours of the sun.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin and use a bb cream as foundation</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, where we have 62% humidity</li>
            <li>I live in Texas and with the humidity I can&#x27;t look to matte with my makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get too much on my eye lids which made it feel like I sprayed a whole can of extra hold hair spray on my eyes...</li>
            <li>But overall I really like it!</li>
            <li>I use it with every makeup application for a natural and dewy finish!</li>
            <li>It was just the cool wet mist doing</li>
            <li>I dont wear full make up usually, so I used it for the first time on my birthday.</li>
            <li>Have only used a couple of times, but I really like it so far!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need this accidentally reactivating my natural frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of weeks so far</li>
            <li>And the product is not heavy on my face.</li>
            <li>I like this product, did not like waiting nearly one month for it to arrive.</li>
            <li>This is like dew in a bottle makes you look radiant and young.</li>
            <li>but you only need a couple of sprays, too much will make ur skin look oily.</li>
            <li>Powder plus this equal a face that looks real, supple, and the benefit is you will stay that way all day until you take off your makeup.</li>
            <li>I have very oily acne prone skin and am always looking for ways to make my makeup last longer.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I sprayed to much or not enough</li>
            <li>The only setting spray I really like.</li>
            <li>but I can honestly say that if anything it ended up making my makeup worse.</li>
            <li>Although I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say it gives a &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; finish, it does definitely help my makeup stay put for much longer, which is what I mainly bought it for.</li>
            <li>Refreshing, but I&#x27;m not positive it actually does anything in the long run.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this (seeing as it was only six dollars)</li>
            <li>It seems like a normal setting spray only.</li>
            <li>If you get a little too much in any area you can gently blot it off with a tissue.</li>
            <li>It seemed to set up the mascara, eye shadow and such but the spray was quite vigorous -- getting on much of the rest of my upper face and even my hair.</li>
            <li>All you need to do is hold the bottle a few inches away from your face and do a couple quick squirts after you finish applying your make up.</li>
            <li>At least the ELF spray doesn&#x27;t make my makeup sink into my pores and fine lines/creases.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any increase in breakouts related to using the spray, and my bottle&#x27;s nearly empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spray it 3 times on my face after applying all my makeup and it makes is last all day while making the makeup completely even.</li>
            <li>http://goo.gl/NuO81f&lt;br /&gt;It works the same and with the benefit of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Not remotely close to a dewy look.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that although your makeup lasts more than without a setting spray it is not super long lasting after several hours it starts to fade</li>
            <li>NOT DRY AND</li>
            <li>Apparently you can&#x27;t transform the finish of such a formula with a dewy setting spray.  </li>
            <li>Summer can be harsh and I wanted something that would help my makeup from disappearing at the first sight of humidity.  </li>
            <li>and I have used other high end products that have not done as well as this.</li>
            <li>As summer approaches though, this might be less favorable for me (or anyone who lives in a very sunny environment) as it might make me look sweaty vs glowy.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I have trouble with is directing the spray consistently and that could be me and not the product.</li>
            <li>its definitely not long lasting.</li>
            <li>.. can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s bad.. but can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s good, either.  </li>

            <li> This is a good setting spray.</li>
            <li> This product works really good with the born to glow illuminator</li>
            <li> I like to use a good primer before I put this on help it set longer.</li>
            <li> My makeup looks as good when I get home after 8 hours at the office as it does when I leave in the morning.  </li>
            <li> its not that good for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I had never used a setting spray before and this one provides good coverage and keeps my foundation and powder in place all day.  </li>
            <li> but this one works just as good.</li>
            <li> It lasted a good 4-5 hours in 99% humidity.  </li>
            <li> It truely did make my makeup look flawless and stag that way.</li>
            <li> This is a great inexpensive make up spray, though I like the matte version better.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased...  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery, nice product, great seller!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!</li>

            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Dewy Skin, still matte holds makeup in place for more than 12 hours!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for cheap.</li>
            <li> And boy do I look amazingly dewy(healthy shine).</li>
            <li> I found this and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> Kind of counterproductive, that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a nice finish to my makeup routine</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of a matte finish.</li>
            <li> Thanks for an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels on my face, very cool and sets my makeup great.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice shine after powder instead of suffering the matte finish...but would like a more cooling, calming effect.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this spray!</li>
            <li> and it works! :)</li>
            <li> I prefer the elfs spray better</li>
            <li> It seems much more suited to drier skin types than to normal/oily ones.</li>
            <li> As someone with oily skin, it gives me a healthy glow without being too shiny.</li>
            <li> Love it...recommended to many friends</li>
            <li> Love the dew-like finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll reach your eyelids better and won&#x27;t accidentally cause your mascara to run.&lt;br</li>
            <li> she likes the matte make up setting spray better.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes you look dewy</li>
            <li> but not a nasty dewy :)</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my makeup look and stay put, but it leaves my face a bit sticky feeling and my hair keeps sticking to my face.</li>
            <li> I like the fix+ by MAC more because it smells better</li>
            <li> This is a good purchase and worth the investment.</li>
            <li> love it will order again...</li>
            <li> love this product, made my face glisten</li>
            <li> I love this product with all my heart.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure this goes with anything that you spray on your face).  </li>
            <li> but I was extremly pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Gives you that dewy sun kissed look, I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I get a lot more life out of my makeup application when I apply this over the top.  </li>
            <li> I got sooo many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I ended up abandoning this bottle for one that I made myself out of glycerin and water, which ended up working better.</li>
            <li> the Elf mist way better.</li>
            <li> and i was shock my make up lasted better.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li> In which case, the Matte Setting Spray might be a better option but YMMV.</li>
            <li> product is one of my top five products of all time,wouldnt hesitate in buying again</li>
            <li> There is not dewy finish and my make up does not stay in place any better or longer</li>
            <li> Really love this so much!!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I wanted a dewy finish and used it with a matte foundation, thinking it would ultimately give me the ideal satin finish.  </li>
            <li> And if you are one of those people who want to try it out but aren&#x27;t sure if you&#x27;ll like it or not then try and get it while it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> This spray does give your skin a nice sheen, make up stays fresh longer fewer touch ups needed.</li>
            <li> and my wife emailed me and told me that she loved it and it was very helpful being that she is a makeup artist</li>
            <li> Easy to spray, doesn&#x27;t feel drying, and does help get a dewy look.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes me look amazing, not shiny, more like a natural gloooow..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered and was packed nicely.</li>
            <li> In normal conditions it has lasted a good 12 hours.  </li>
            <li> That said, it smells fine and feels fine.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived in 2 days was very happy it came so quickly , also I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> and this made my makeup look very nice and not dry at all</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and it works.</li>
            <li> I do not want to shine, but after a light powder, I need moisture.</li>
            <li> Scent is light.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t help my makeup stay on longer, the spray is way too strong and I have to hold this a full arms length away from my face.</li>
            <li> I cant use matte because I have dry skin, but the dewy is sensational!</li>
            <li> It also helps to keep my makeup in place and it can be used before foundation or after your makeup is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and very reasonable price:-)</li>
            <li> Was worth the money!</li>
            <li> , me touching my face, and when its hot.</li>
            <li> It feels pretty refreshing.</li>
            <li> this is a great product the effect lasts all day long</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 out of 5 because on hot summer days I feel like it could of stayed a little better, so not the best for days where you&#x27;ll be in the hot sun sweating.</li>
            <li> Gives an amazing Dewey finish, my skin looks alive all day</li>
            <li> true--</li>
            <li> and leave my skin really dewy and glowing :)</li>
            <li> It does not seem to hold my face on much longer than without it, it does give it a better finished look though.</li>
            <li> Shipping is really :)</li>
            <li> This spray has my makeup lasting a 12 hour work filled day and keeping me look fabulous!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s normally the case with most amazon items, though not all of them.</li>
            <li> Very much I recommend to get!</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday use, just make sure you let it dry so you can clean up any under-eye smudges the misting</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast and easy and the packaging was good.-XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for bringing out highlighters and cream blushes, or if you have dry skin and have that powdery look.</li>
            <li> and really works!!</li>
            <li> I recently started using the setting spray after I was experiencing difficulty with my foundation staying on, and I have to say that I love it!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the $7 I paid for it</li>
            <li> It also sets your makeup so it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> I think I may try to make my own next time around.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin with such a nice dewy not oily finish.</li>
            <li> so I switched to this more natural makeup setting spray:  </li>
            <li> This help me look more natural while still keeping my make up from sweating off.</li>
            <li> and I have found myself rarely having to reapply my foundation throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference in how fresh my makeup looks at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> I would buy another one right now</li>
            <li> Right now the price is about nine dollars</li>
            <li> Would recommend for any skin type, but def helps dry skin look more hydrated!</li>
            <li> Great option to more expensive options on the market.</li>
            <li> I actually bought it because my favorite makeup blogger (Maskcara) recommended it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product  just wish not quite as expensive.</li>
            <li> but it could be more cooling &amp; last longer.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It smudged my mascara the first time i used it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make it look caked on and it really leaves a dewy finish!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t exactly give any noticeable &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; appearance, but it did help makeup resist fading.</li>
            <li> To me it&#x27;s better than the Mac fix+ and the urban decay.</li>
            <li> The spray that comes with this sprits too much on ur face which will ruin your makeup so dont use it!</li>
            <li> First time buyer have nothing to compare it with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not sure if it truly works as a setting spray, but i do use it every day and feel more confident when I leave for work.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of another setting spray but when it was sold out at the moment I decided to try this stuff out.</li>
            <li> works pretty well, would recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I first sprayed it on I felt like my makeup was being washed off, but it was not.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Definitely gives a dewy finish, which is great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> like the matte version better because I have oily skin and the dewy finish can make my oily skin look really oily by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> Delivers on its promise, long lasting, makeup setting &amp; a beautiful natural dewy look to the skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure what this is really good for.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> A couple spritzes and one is ready for a glowing day or night on the town.</li>
            <li> This, however, was a much appreciated change.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin very dewy, but it works for wetting my beauty blender</li>
            <li> If you apply too much powder, this fixes it without taking it all off.</li>
            <li> straight</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really feel that it works</li>
            <li> Overall though It is definitely worth the price I definitely reccomend :)</li>
            <li> and I really do like it.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t always set my eye makeup, but it sets face makeup really, really well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for me except maybe hydrate/refresh the skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice that it&#x27;s helped with the length of time that my makeup stays put, either.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to test it and see if it really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Change it with another 1.It works really well now</li>
            <li> and I am really liking.</li>
            <li> I really like the dewy finish on this setting spray, it freshens the makeup and makes it stay longer.  </li>
            <li> Straight up, read the ingredients.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t spray it much anyway.</li>
            <li> The price and quality at high level!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really like the matte look</li>
            <li> And fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Ill be buying it again</li>
            <li> Either I will keep making my own, or I&#x27;ll try a different brand next time around.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day - when I&#x27;m ready to remove my makeup - it come off easily with my normal facial scrub and water.  </li>
            <li> My first complaint was that the spray bottle did not spray a fine mist like setting sprays should, more like large droplets that you could actually see on your face right after spraying it.</li>
            <li> After around 3 hours I checked and my makeup was separating in places it normally doesn&#x27;t even budge!</li>
            <li> Usually my make up wears off pretty quick, but i put it on at 8 am and wore it all day and night until around 10 or 11pm and it stayed fresh looking!</li>
            <li> I prefer the dewy finish over the matte because I have dry skin, but both work fine.</li>
            <li> I was hestant at first because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this kind of product, so it is difficult to really say how good it is, but I do know that my makeup stay on my face longer than usual.</li>
            <li> also made it last all night will most likely repurchase again .</li>
            <li> Makeup has been a thing for me since I was in Jr. High.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth fixing once at the beginning than the entire rest of the time you have make up on.</li>
            <li> My skin type is normal</li>
            <li> Helps my makeup last longer and looks freshly applied.</li>
            <li> I did later buy the product from a store where I could test it, and for the price, I still don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I used it with covergirls outlast 3 in 1 liquid foundation just to see how it worked because normally this makeup will start separating within 4 hours for me.</li>
            <li> It does get the job done&amp;#62; I would use it everyday and my makeup lasts for more than 7 hours.</li>
            <li> Recently I was out and about in humid 80 degree weather and felt the heat, but to my surprise my makeup still looked fresh even after 3 hours of the sun.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin and use a bb cream as foundation</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, where we have 62% humidity</li>
            <li> I live in Texas and with the humidity I can&#x27;t look to matte with my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get too much on my eye lids which made it feel like I sprayed a whole can of extra hold hair spray on my eyes...</li>
            <li> But overall I really like it!</li>
            <li> I use it with every makeup application for a natural and dewy finish!</li>
            <li> It was just the cool wet mist doing</li>
            <li> I dont wear full make up usually, so I used it for the first time on my birthday.</li>
            <li> Have only used a couple of times, but I really like it so far!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need this accidentally reactivating my natural frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of weeks so far</li>
            <li> And the product is not heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> I like this product, did not like waiting nearly one month for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> This is like dew in a bottle makes you look radiant and young.</li>
            <li> but you only need a couple of sprays, too much will make ur skin look oily.</li>
            <li> Powder plus this equal a face that looks real, supple, and the benefit is you will stay that way all day until you take off your makeup.</li>
            <li> I have very oily acne prone skin and am always looking for ways to make my makeup last longer.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I sprayed to much or not enough</li>
            <li> The only setting spray I really like.</li>
            <li> but I can honestly say that if anything it ended up making my makeup worse.</li>
            <li> Although I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say it gives a &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; finish, it does definitely help my makeup stay put for much longer, which is what I mainly bought it for.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, but I&#x27;m not positive it actually does anything in the long run.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this (seeing as it was only six dollars)</li>
            <li> It seems like a normal setting spray only.</li>
            <li> If you get a little too much in any area you can gently blot it off with a tissue.</li>
            <li> It seemed to set up the mascara, eye shadow and such but the spray was quite vigorous -- getting on much of the rest of my upper face and even my hair.</li>
            <li> All you need to do is hold the bottle a few inches away from your face and do a couple quick squirts after you finish applying your make up.</li>
            <li> At least the ELF spray doesn&#x27;t make my makeup sink into my pores and fine lines/creases.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any increase in breakouts related to using the spray, and my bottle&#x27;s nearly empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spray it 3 times on my face after applying all my makeup and it makes is last all day while making the makeup completely even.</li>
            <li> http://goo.gl/NuO81f&lt;br /&gt;It works the same and with the benefit of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Not remotely close to a dewy look.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that although your makeup lasts more than without a setting spray it is not super long lasting after several hours it starts to fade</li>
            <li> NOT DRY AND</li>
            <li> Apparently you can&#x27;t transform the finish of such a formula with a dewy setting spray.  </li>
            <li> Summer can be harsh and I wanted something that would help my makeup from disappearing at the first sight of humidity.  </li>
            <li> and I have used other high end products that have not done as well as this.</li>
            <li> As summer approaches though, this might be less favorable for me (or anyone who lives in a very sunny environment) as it might make me look sweaty vs glowy.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I have trouble with is directing the spray consistently and that could be me and not the product.</li>
            <li> its definitely not long lasting.</li>
            <li> .. can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s bad.. but can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s good, either.  </li>
            <li> It works well with a small spritz on a facial sponge to lightly dab on if my face powder looks too heavy or my makeup starts to look &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Living in the Pacific NW and we get a lot of humidity and flat out rain.</li>
            <li> The NYX dewy setting spray brings the soft &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; back to your face; often powders leave us a little too matte and mask-like.</li>
            <li> It stings and my face is not sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so after putting on my foundation</li>
            <li> guess i didnt wait till they got dry</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> As someone with dry skin, this is a blessing for me.</li>
            <li> Because of this I&#x27;ve had trouble keeping my &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; from slipping off my well over 30 dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> let me down, and this is no different.  </li>
            <li> 30 minute later my make up was already melting down my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Let dry and there you have it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as long add some other products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t really gives you a dewy glow as such.</li>
            <li> the only complaint she had was that she wishes the bottle came in a bigger size</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> With that said, it does give me a dewy finish, probably because my face is soaking wet.</li>
            <li> they felt tight, dry and itchy...all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as pricey as some of the other though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice my makeup lasting any longer than usual, and there&#x27;s no noticeable dewy effect after the spray dries.  </li>
            <li> I wanted  dewier youthful look and got only ugliness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t let down.</li>
            <li> DEAD LOOKING LIKE ALOT OF OTHER SETTING SPRAYS.</li>
            <li> Maybe this spray isn&#x27;t formulated to go with a long wearing matte finish foundation, but I was hesitant to try it again because the results were so bad the first time.  </li>
            <li> but it is not obvious just subtle fading.</li>
            <li> and I got it for less then six...</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t mess up your makeup, and every finishing spray will smudge a teensy bit mascara-</li>
            <li> but not good enough.</li>
            <li> .You can never go wrong with this over your makeup ,its long lasting and doesnt make your makeup runny when sprayed</li>
            <li> I feel like it dries my face a little</li>
            <li> I think it helps my eyes &amp; brows a little too, though I always use eye primer.</li>
            <li> and I put this on a beauty sponge and dab it on and my skin looks a little dewy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a makeup setting spray for a while and found this little gem.  </li>
            <li> This is a little pricey but does the job.</li>
            <li> A little spray is all you need and your make up will say on all day, no need to retouch.</li>
            <li> Sets makeup for a few hours.</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s inexpensive compared to others); here are a few tips to help it work for</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;m all made up I toss a hand towel over my hair, close my eyes and give my face a few spritzes.</li>
            <li> After a few hours, makeup decays.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why I been trying mist and few primers.</li>
            <li> I looked like a greasy, oily mess!  </li>
            <li> I live in a tropical climate, was skeptical based on some of the negative reviews, but it works.</li>
            <li> and  usually I don&#x27;t need primers</li>
            <li> only thing I didn&#x27;t like was when I sometimes went a little too crazy spraying my face (trying to add a lil&#x27; dew)</li>
            <li> such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Avoid this spray if your skin is the least bit oily.  </li>
            <li> (at least it feels that way..</li>
            <li> so I ordered it on here, expecting it to take at least a week to arrive.</li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars because the spray part of the bottle does not work, a little frustrating to wait for it to find it is non-functional!</li>
            <li> It was not a good look at all.  </li>
            <li> Not very impressed.  </li>
            <li> it makes eye make-up run like crazy.</li>
            <li> this made my face break out terribly.</li>
            <li> but i already have a matte base primer and setting spray!.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This finishing spray is great. A couple spritzes and one is ready for a glowing day or night on the town. Perfect for everyday use, just make sure you let it dry so you can clean up any under-eye smudges the misting may have inevitably caused. You won&#x27;t mess up your makeup, and every finishing spray will smudge a teensy bit mascara- but it&#x27;s worth fixing once at the beginning than the entire rest of the time you have make up on. Would recommend for any skin type, but def helps dry skin look more hydrated!</li>
            <li> This is a good setting spray. I didn&#x27;t feel like it added a whole-lotta-dew, but it held my makeup in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was when I sometimes went a little too crazy spraying my face (trying to add a lil&#x27; dew) I&#x27;d get too much on my eye lids which made it feel like I sprayed a whole can of extra hold hair spray on my eyes...they felt tight, dry and itchy...all day.</li>
            <li> Have only used a couple of times, but I really like it so far! I actually bought it because my favorite makeup blogger (Maskcara) recommended it. I&#x27;m going to Universal Studios this August and it will definitely be put to the test then. The price is great!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this kind of product, so it is difficult to really say how good it is, but I do know that my makeup stay on my face longer than usual.</li>
            <li> Very good a lot like elfs version. Didn&#x27;t make me greasy or break me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Model In a Bottle for awhile and it always dries out my makeup and skin by the end of the day. This, however, was a much appreciated change. Easy to spray, doesn&#x27;t feel drying, and does help get a dewy look.</li>
            <li> It definitely helped my make up last longer in my opinion. I gave it 4 out of 5 because on hot summer days I feel like it could of stayed a little better, so not the best for days where you&#x27;ll be in the hot sun sweating. But overall I really like it! I feel like I didn&#x27;t have to use my primer when I used this and it gave me that dewy look. Was worth the money!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t really gives you a dewy glow as such. It seems like a normal setting spray only.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin very dewy, but it works for wetting my beauty blender lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly just splurge for the Fix+, it actually makes your skin dewy and lasting.</li>
            <li> This product works really good with the born to glow illuminator</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, where we have 62% humidity and it makes my makeup melt off my face. This spray keeps my makeup in check without clogging my pores or feeling sticky</li>
            <li> Very happy with everything</li>
            <li> pretty good for the price. I feel like it dries my face a little but otherwise, really great.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this spray! it makes makeup last longer! and really works!! I would buy another one right now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great stuff and it works! :)</li>
            <li> this made my face break out terribly. such a disappointment. I prefer the elfs spray better it&#x27;s cheap and it works.</li>
            <li> This spray made my foundation totally sink into my pores.  It was not a good look at all.  I wanted a dewy finish and used it with a matte foundation, thinking it would ultimately give me the ideal satin finish.  No way!  I looked like a greasy, oily mess!  My skin type is normal so oil breakthrough shouldn&#x27;t have been an issue.  I wanted  dewier youthful look and got only ugliness.  Maybe this spray isn&#x27;t formulated to go with a long wearing matte finish foundation, but I was hesitant to try it again because the results were so bad the first time.  I think I&#x27;ll stick with my ELF setting spray.  At least the ELF spray doesn&#x27;t make my makeup sink into my pores and fine lines/creases.  I returned the NYX spray to Ulta.  It wasn&#x27;t worth the $7 I paid for it so it had to go back.  If I want a dewy finish in the future, I&#x27;ll try the Urban Decay setting spray.  I know for a fact that UD doesn&#x27;t make you look like someone has been refining oil on your face, lol!  My final word is to skip this spray if you&#x27;re thinking of using it over a matte foundation.  Apparently you can&#x27;t transform the finish of such a formula with a dewy setting spray.  Avoid this spray if your skin is the least bit oily.  It seems much more suited to drier skin types than to normal/oily ones.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, nice product, great seller!</li>
            <li> It does seem to set my make-up longer, but there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;dewy factor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> as always best dewy skin with this stuff !</li>
            <li> Love this setting spray !!</li>
            <li> Works well, although I&#x27;m still in the &amp;#34;trying out&amp;#34; phase. Definitely gives a dewy finish, which is great for my dry skin. No complaints as to the sender, however I would have prefered a sealed container although NYX may not even sell them that way, so it may not be up to them.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product. As someone with oily skin, it gives me a healthy glow without being too shiny. It also helps to keep my makeup in place and it can be used before foundation or after your makeup is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and very reasonable price:-)</li>
            <li> Works great. If you apply too much powder, this fixes it without taking it all off. I use this before I do my mascara and lipstick and it gets rid of the &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; look, keeps me from looking cakey, and keeps my makeup on all day.</li>
            <li> Great setting spray. Makes your skin feel great and makes you look dewy!! It makes me feel like I&#x27;m wearing no makeup at all after spraying... and is just a great finishing touch to any makeup application. Wish the bottle was bigger.. But for $7.. I will happily purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Delivers on its promise, long lasting, makeup setting &amp; a beautiful natural dewy look to the skin. Love it...recommended to many friends</li>
            <li> Excellent product  just wish not quite as expensive.</li>
            <li> Sets makeup for a few hours. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the dew-like finish. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Living in the Pacific NW and we get a lot of humidity and flat out rain. Because of this I&#x27;ve had trouble keeping my &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; from slipping off my well over 30 dry sensitive skin. Before using the NYX dewy setting spray I tried the MUFE setting spray and found it too matte for me. This NYX dewy setting spray keeps my colors true-- my blush used to fade and foundation used to wear off without it. I think it helps my eyes &amp; brows a little too, though I always use eye primer. I haven&#x27;t noticed any increase in breakouts related to using the spray, and my bottle&#x27;s nearly empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin you may prefer a matte setting spray. NYX dewy setting spray works well for me (and it&#x27;s inexpensive compared to others); here are a few tips to help it work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Powder your face before applying this spray. The NYX dewy setting spray brings the soft &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; back to your face; often powders leave us a little too matte and mask-like. Use a powder puff and press powder over your visible pore areas. Use a powder brush only to sweep away excess powder- buffing your powder in can make your face shiny. :-|. Kind of counterproductive, that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply everything *except* mascara before you use it. It&#x27;ll reach your eyelids better and won&#x27;t accidentally cause your mascara to run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Cover your hair- After I&#x27;m all made up I toss a hand towel over my hair, close my eyes and give my face a few spritzes. If you get a little too much in any area you can gently blot it off with a tissue. I figure I put enough hair product in my hair and after blow-drying my hair straight I don&#x27;t need this accidentally reactivating my natural frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let dry and there you have it!</li>
            <li> Bought this since it was a well-recommended substitute for a more expensive brand I&#x27;ve used for years... and that was a mistake. Won&#x27;t make it again!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so after putting on my foundation and I put this on a beauty sponge and dab it on and my skin looks a little dewy. Sometimes I put it on my hand and dab on face with my hand. I like to use a good primer before I put this on help it set longer.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really feel that it works</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter she likes the matte make up setting spray better.</li>
            <li> Love it but it could be more cooling &amp; last longer.  Gives a nice shine after powder instead of suffering the matte finish...but would like a more cooling, calming effect.  Also, it can&#x27;t match the Wall Street work day.  After a few hours, makeup decays.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a makeup setting spray for a while and found this little gem.  It keeps my makeup at a matte finish and in place.  My makeup looks as good when I get home after 8 hours at the office as it does when I leave in the morning.  I do have a shine problem in my t-zone - I just use blotting papers - and the makeup still doesn&#x27;t budge.  At the end of the day - when I&#x27;m ready to remove my makeup - it come off easily with my normal facial scrub and water.  I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. Works perfectly! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes you look dewy but not a nasty dewy :) It also sets your makeup so it looks more natural. The only thing is that although your makeup lasts more than without a setting spray it is not super long lasting after several hours it starts to fade but it is not obvious just subtle fading. Overall though It is definitely worth the price I definitely reccomend :)</li>
            <li> its not that good for oily skin. it made my skin cachy and the makeup didnt stay, i thought it would give a matte finish but didn. its definitely not long lasting. its okay but not good enough.</li>
            <li> This spray has my makeup lasting a 12 hour work filled day and keeping me look fabulous!! Love it!!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of weeks so far and I really do like it. It gives a dewey look to my makeup. I have yet to wear makeup without this setting spray since purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I had never used a setting spray before and this one provides good coverage and keeps my foundation and powder in place all day.  The dewy look is not too shiny or &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; looking.  The only thing that I have trouble with is directing the spray consistently and that could be me and not the product.</li>
            <li> I spray it 3 times on my face after applying all my makeup and it makes is last all day while making the makeup completely even. I recommend!!</li>
            <li> this setting spray is great. it leaves a dewy finish and hydrates the skin. i use it after i apply my makeup. the shipping was fast and easy and the packaging was good.-XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this spray. I love the way it makes my makeup look and stay put, but it leaves my face a bit sticky feeling and my hair keeps sticking to my face.</li>
            <li> It smudged my mascara the first time i used it.&lt;br /&gt;I guess i didnt wait till they got dry&lt;br /&gt;i cant tell if it&#x27;s doing its job</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as long add some other products.</li>
            <li> Works well! Does what it says. Helps my makeup last longer and looks freshly applied. Doesn&#x27;t make it look caked on and it really leaves a dewy finish!</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like I was worried about. Just a nice finish to my makeup routine</li>
            <li> I like the fix+ by MAC more because it smells better but this one works just as good.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, but I&#x27;m not positive it actually does anything in the long run.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t always set my eye makeup, but it sets face makeup really, really well. This is a great product for cheap.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!! IT MAKES YOUR MAKE UP LOOK LIKE SUPPLE SKIN....NOT DRY AND DEAD LOOKING LIKE ALOT OF OTHER SETTING SPRAYS.</li>
            <li> Gives me the perfect dewy finish.</li>
            <li> This is a great inexpensive make up spray, though I like the matte version better. I use this spray after my foundation and the MAC setting spray after I&#x27;m done with everything. Using the two this way makes my make up and my foundation stay on all day through work at a restaurant, me touching my face, and when its hot. This is a good purchase and worth the investment. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to spend time and money putting make up on when it doesn&#x27;t stay and this product makes it stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the matte version better because I have oily skin and the dewy finish can make my oily skin look really oily by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference in my makeup wear.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff! Keeps my makeup on all day! and leave my skin really dewy and glowing :)</li>
            <li> Great product...leaves skin dewy and luminous.</li>
            <li> I use an illuminator mixed with my liquid makeup or bb cream and then set it with this spray. It helps my makeup stay on for about 5-10hrs. And boy do I look amazingly dewy(healthy shine).</li>
            <li> love it will order again...llong lasting</li>
            <li> Great product...  I can really tell a difference in how fresh my makeup looks at the end of the day! I am very pleased...  Even tho this is the dewy finish it just feels moisturizer not at all oily! I would say if you are over 25 you should buy the dewy finish!</li>
            <li> love this product, made my face glisten</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels on my face, very cool and sets my makeup great.  I recommend this and I have used other high end products that have not done as well as this.</li>
            <li> I love this product with all my heart. It gives me the touches I wanted. I noticed my foundation and makeup stay on longer. It is picture perfect</li>
            <li> My makeup stays on noticeably longer. And the product is not heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> Looks good,but leaves a sweaty feeling on you eyelids. Kinda bothersome.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for me except maybe hydrate/refresh the skin (at least it feels that way.. but I&#x27;m sure this goes with anything that you spray on your face).  Has a smell to it.. can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s bad.. but can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s good, either.  Doesn&#x27;t make me &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve tried before, after, and before &amp; after of makeup application.  I don&#x27;t really notice that it&#x27;s helped with the length of time that my makeup stays put, either.  Not sure what this is really good for.  I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at CVS for 50%off it was $4.49.&lt;br /&gt;It kept my make-up matte and in place for 8 hrs+ but i already have a matte base primer and setting spray!. I bought this to test it and see if it really works.&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT a dewy finish at all. I will still use it to set my foundation,powder,blush and bronzer as a back up but i was quite disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I was hestant at first because I have sensitive skin but I was extremly pleased with the outcome. I will definitly buy it again!</li>
            <li> Takes away some of the powdery look if I overdo my powder.  Did not look dewy and definitely didn&#x27;t make makeup last longer.  Alcohol is the 2nd ingredient.  No thanks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t exactly give any noticeable &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; appearance, but it did help makeup resist fading.</li>
            <li> This is a little pricey but does the job. It&#x27;s not as pricey as some of the other though. The one thing I didn&#x27;t get from this is the &amp;#34;dewy finish&amp;#34;. Once it&#x27;s dry it&#x27;s kind of a matte finish. I think I may try to make my own next time around. I do recommend this product just the same.</li>
            <li> This spray does give your skin a nice sheen, make up stays fresh longer fewer touch ups needed. The actual size is 2.03 fl.oz.&lt;br /&gt; not 4 fl.oz.  I like this product, did not like waiting nearly one month for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this setting spray! If you want a dewy look, you have to use a highlight or luminizer with this product! otherwise, it will just work as a setting spray. I also spray my brushes with this to help with makeup product pickup and for staying power. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. To me it&#x27;s better than the Mac fix+ and the urban decay. This is like dew in a bottle makes you look radiant and young. I feel like there is actually gold and sunshine in each spray. It gives you that just came from Jamaica and I&#x27;m feeling my glow type of glow lol.</li>
            <li> Gives you that dewy sun kissed look, I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I changed the spray and then it worked perfectly. The spray that comes with this sprits too much on ur face which will ruin your makeup so dont use it! Change it with another 1.It works really well now but you only need a couple of sprays, too much will make ur skin look oily. Although this has no oil in it. It&#x27;ll make your skin look &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s really good for bringing out highlighters and cream blushes, or if you have dry skin and have that powdery look.</li>
            <li> First time buyer have nothing to compare it with.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d taken a before picture. I&#x27;m honestly not sure if it truly works as a setting spray, but i do use it every day and feel more confident when I leave for work.</li>
            <li> If anyone says this doesn&#x27;t work then the world is ending. I live in a tropical climate, was skeptical based on some of the negative reviews, but it works. I sweat, and my make-up stays put. Great option to more expensive options on the market.</li>
            <li> I like it. It feels pretty refreshing. It does the job its suppose to do. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars because the spray part of the bottle does not work, a little frustrating to wait for it to find it is non-functional! I did later buy the product from a store where I could test it, and for the price, I still don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s completely worth it. It does not seem to hold my face on much longer than without it, it does give it a better finished look though.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my go-to for a finishing spray but I do like it to refresh my makeup.  It works well with a small spritz on a facial sponge to lightly dab on if my face powder looks too heavy or my makeup starts to look &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34;.  I also use it to spritz on my foundation and blending brushes.  It makes blending easier, gives my foundation a bit of a dewy look and it&#x27;s not sticky feeling on my skin.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it made my makeup last longer but I did like it for freshening my face.</li>
            <li> I saw this project on http://www.maskcara.com/.  I have yet to have one of her recommendations let me down, and this is no different.  I get a lot more life out of my makeup application when I apply this over the top.  Sometimes I overdo it, and have to blot off the extra but it always looks great.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a make-up fix before and this was the one I did try. Not very impressed.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference if I wear it or not. If you do wear it, be careful not to pray anywhere near your eyes bc it makes eye make-up run like crazy.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly! I cant use matte because I have dry skin, but the dewy is sensational! I dont wear full make up usually, so I used it for the first time on my birthday. Usually my make up wears off pretty quick, but i put it on at 8 am and wore it all day and night until around 10 or 11pm and it stayed fresh looking! Also, my face didnt look powdery or anything. I got sooo many compliments. It truely did make my makeup look flawless and stag that way. I will certainly buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> this is a great product the effect lasts all day long</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes me look amazing, not shiny, more like a natural gloooow..</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this product does anything.  I don&#x27;t notice my makeup lasting any longer than usual, and there&#x27;s no noticeable dewy effect after the spray dries.  That said, it smells fine and feels fine.  It&#x27;s just underwhelming.</li>
            <li> I was trained in esthetics. Makeup has been a thing for me since I was in Jr. High. So when I say great stuff, I know great stuff. I am 50 and don&#x27;t wear anything but BB-cream for cover. I do not want to shine, but after a light powder, I need moisture. I used to use Evian. I found this and the difference is amazing. Powder plus this equal a face that looks real, supple, and the benefit is you will stay that way all day until you take off your makeup. HA!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! I use it with every makeup application for a natural and dewy finish! Delivery was prompt and packaging was perfect!</li>
            <li> Although I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say it gives a &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; finish, it does definitely help my makeup stay put for much longer, which is what I mainly bought it for. So, if you&#x27;re looking for something to keep your makeup set in place, definitely give this a try!</li>
            <li> I love this product. A little spray is all you need and your make up will say on all day, no need to retouch. I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used it around my eyes. It seemed to set up the mascara, eye shadow and such but the spray was quite vigorous -- getting on much of the rest of my upper face and even my hair. I might cut a hole in some paper to keep it confined to the target area.</li>
            <li> Love it. Leaves skin with such a nice dewy not oily finish. Prevents makeup transfer so I don&#x27;t have to worry about makeup on my tops. Lasts all day. Only draw back is the crappy spray bottle that doesn&#x27;t deliver an even mist.</li>
            <li> I received this product for Christmas and was already running low so I ordered it on here, expecting it to take at least a week to arrive. It only took about 2 days! Everything is perfect. It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered and was packed nicely. So pleased!</li>
            <li> This product arrived in 2 days was very happy it came so quickly , also I have very dry skin and this made my makeup look very nice and not dry at all also made it last all night will most likely repurchase again .</li>
            <li> I ended up abandoning this bottle for one that I made myself out of glycerin and water, which ended up working better. Either I will keep making my own, or I&#x27;ll try a different brand next time around. For me, it didn&#x27;t seem to keep the makeup from moving.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of another setting spray but when it was sold out at the moment I decided to try this stuff out. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and I am really liking. I wouldn&#x27;t say it necessarily gives me that glowing dewy finish but it definitely helps my make up stay put!</li>
            <li> works pretty well, would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money the Elf mist way better. I had hope about this product , it&#x27;s like spraying alcohol in your face. It stings and my face is not sensitive at all. Not worth the money. Plus the elf one is about 3 dollars and i was shock my make up lasted better. This one i put my make up on testing it going to the mall and 30 minute later my make up was already melting down my face. And I do not have such a oily skin and  usually I don&#x27;t need primers but it&#x27;s summer time so that&#x27;s why I been trying mist and few primers.</li>
            <li> I really like the dewy finish on this setting spray, it freshens the makeup and makes it stay longer.  The only con is smells like alcohol which isn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THE WAY MY MAKEUP LOOKS AFTER I USE THE SETTING SPRAY.</li>
            <li> Really love this so much!!!!&#x27; thank you</li>
            <li> NYX Dewy Setting Spray holds my makeup in place and gives my skin a bit of a glowing appearance. As someone with dry skin, this is a blessing for me. As summer approaches though, this might be less favorable for me (or anyone who lives in a very sunny environment) as it might make me look sweaty vs glowy. In which case, the Matte Setting Spray might be a better option but YMMV.</li>
            <li> I have very oily acne prone skin and am always looking for ways to make my makeup last longer. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this (seeing as it was only six dollars) but I can honestly say that if anything it ended up making my makeup worse. I used it with covergirls outlast 3 in 1 liquid foundation just to see how it worked because normally this makeup will start separating within 4 hours for me. My first complaint was that the spray bottle did not spray a fine mist like setting sprays should, more like large droplets that you could actually see on your face right after spraying it. But I kept it on and saw how it went (I put it on after doing my makeup not before). After around 3 hours I checked and my makeup was separating in places it normally doesn&#x27;t even budge! I thought maybe I sprayed to much or not enough so I tried it out for the rest of the week with the same results. I think this is definitely for people who have dry/normal skin especially because it has a &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; finish. My only suggestion is that if you want to buy this keep checking the price (or get one of those apps that monitor it) because I noticed that it does fluctuate A LOT. And if you are one of those people who want to try it out but aren&#x27;t sure if you&#x27;ll like it or not then try and get it while it&#x27;s cheap. That&#x27;s normally the case with most amazon items, though not all of them. Right now the price is about nine dollars and I got it for less then six...</li>
            <li> Make up stays on all day !</li>
            <li> Too shiny. Makes you look like sweat</li>
            <li> Ok. This is alcohol. Straight up, read the ingredients. This doesn&#x27;t help my makeup stay on longer, the spray is way too strong and I have to hold this a full arms length away from my face. With that said, it does give me a dewy finish, probably because my face is soaking wet.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! My makeup looks great all day. I just cant believe it.</li>
            <li> This setting spray is definetly one of my all time favorites for dewy makeup .You can never go wrong with this over your makeup ,its long lasting and doesnt make your makeup runny when sprayed .This product is one of my top five products of all time,wouldnt hesitate in buying again</li>
            <li> Love this product! I actually use this on my makeup brush before I put my foundation or powder brush and it gives quite a dewy finish. It&#x27;s definitely one of those products you have to figure out how you like to you it to get your dewy look. Bottle is pretty small but I don&#x27;t spray it much anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my forehead sweats and my makeup comes off.  I tried this NYX Makeup Setting Spray over makeup, under makeup, and both at same time. I could not tell ANY difference with the product on, none at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the ingredients of the spray:  Water, Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, PVP, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, Niacinamide</li>
            <li> I love the item but sadly aramex dispose it saying they not allowed send to my country</li>
            <li> Thanks for an excellent product! Very much I recommend to get! Excellent thing! The price and quality at high level! To use very simply!</li>
            <li> The only setting spray I really like. I have oily skin and the makeup I use is matte but I don&#x27;t really like the matte look so adding this spray make it look like skin again with the oily finish at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Gives an amazing Dewey finish, my skin looks alive all day</li>
            <li> bought it while i was out at work and my wife emailed me and told me that she loved it and it was very helpful being that she is a makeup artist the only complaint she had was that she wishes the bottle came in a bigger size</li>
            <li> the best to get you that dewy look</li>
            <li> Just got it today, can&#x27;t wait to try out! Shipping is really :)</li>
            <li> It does get the job done&amp;#62; I would use it everyday and my makeup lasts for more than 7 hours. But then I am concerned with the ingredient list especially that I am spraying it on my face, I also inhale the particles so I switched to this more natural makeup setting spray:  http://goo.gl/NuO81f&lt;br /&gt;It works the same and with the benefit of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Summer can be harsh and I wanted something that would help my makeup from disappearing at the first sight of humidity.  NYX  Dewy Finish does a great job of doing that.  Recently I was out and about in humid 80 degree weather and felt the heat, but to my surprise my makeup still looked fresh even after 3 hours of the sun.  When I first sprayed it on I felt like my makeup was being washed off, but it was not.  It was just the cool wet mist doing it&#x27;s job to set it.  I didn&#x27;t blot any excess off and I did get a dewy look which I loved.&lt;br /&gt;It did wear off by the end of the day, but this was a 10 hour day in the heat.  Without it my makeup would have been gone within an hour or two.  It lasted a good 4-5 hours in 99% humidity.  In normal conditions it has lasted a good 12 hours.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Works as a setting spray.  Not remotely close to a dewy look.</li>
            <li> Love it! And fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Ill be buying it again</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted. I had high expectations and I wasn&#x27;t let down. Great product. I live in Texas and with the humidity I can&#x27;t look to matte with my makeup. This help me look more natural while still keeping my make up from sweating off.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the setting spray after I was experiencing difficulty with my foundation staying on, and I have to say that I love it! It definitely works well and I have found myself rarely having to reapply my foundation throughout the day. I prefer the dewy finish over the matte because I have dry skin, but both work fine. All you need to do is hold the bottle a few inches away from your face and do a couple quick squirts after you finish applying your make up. Scent is light. Definitely would recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> I dont get they hype over this setting spray stuff.  There is not dewy finish and my make up does not stay in place any better or longer</li>
            <li> Perfection, nyx has done it again! Dewy Skin, still matte holds makeup in place for more than 12 hours! I have normal skin and use a bb cream as foundation</li>
