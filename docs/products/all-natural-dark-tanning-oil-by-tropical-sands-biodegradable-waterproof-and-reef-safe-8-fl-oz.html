            <li>great for tanning, very good</li>
            <li>but I had a BEAUTIFUL tan - and, the oil conditioned my skin like nothing I had EVER used.  </li>

            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>very good product - happy that it is coral safe and biodegradable!</li>
            <li>Awesome product recommended as being the safest of all tnnibg oils,  by www.ewg.org which is an environmental group that tests what you put on your skin, no harmful chemicals here :)</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the environment</li>
            <li>This product was good if you remember to put sunscreen on after 10 mins..</li>
            <li>Everyone that tried it loved it.  </li>
            <li>rash, good for the skin, all around very satisfied.</li>
            <li>love love love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>just love it!</li>
            <li>Well, I tried it and FELL IN LOVE!  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>BUT IT WAS NOT  MY OWN FAULT FOR NOT PAYING ATTENTION</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Mexitan &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>it is very smooth to apply on skin.</li>
            <li>She claimed it was the best tanning oil, all natural, organic - before &#x27;organic&#x27; was cool!  </li>
            <li>My max continual exposure:  3 hours at the pool (12pm-3pm).</li>
            <li>IT WAS OK</li>
            <li>Love, Love Love this tanning oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like water.  </li>
            <li>#34;that you can use as an after sun product&amp;#34;, I may try that to see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t love the smell or the spray.</li>
            <li>I ended up just taking the top off after I covered my patio with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Hopefully in they&#x27;ll figure out how to make it smell better.</li>
            <li>Not only was effective, but I&#x27;m happy to be protecting our water source and marine life...</li>
            <li>It works fine and all.</li>
            <li>Works good and really does make you tan quickly.</li>
            <li>I even use it sometimes lightly on my legs when not in the sun.</li>
            <li>I most highly recommend this product - and would rate it a 10 star if I could!</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>It has no sunscreen in it - do be aware of that.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately this is mandatory for Maya Riviera visits as it&#x27;s reef safe, that part is good.</li>
            <li>Not too much of the greasy feel after application..</li>
            <li>Highly commend the product and anyone who chose to spend a little more to start riding or water source of the residual impact of the chemicals and toxin you find in drug store brands!</li>
            <li>Much more waterproof &amp; sweatproof than any other oil i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Got some serious good tan, no scent, missed that &amp;#34;tropical oil&amp;#34; scent, BUT didn&#x27;t miss any bugs that might be attracted to that scent.</li>
            <li>I live on a lake now and keep this tanning oil as a staple for me and my guest - everyone who has used it - loves it.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>so I searched for an all natural product and this is ideal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin moisturized and soft and is in line with my natural approach to skin care.</li>
            <li>I started using this Tanning Oil when the &#x27;inventor&#x27; made it in her house and sold it as a &#x27;natural tanning oil&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>- it is ALL Natural.  </li>
            <li>I only wish it has some coconut or other summer smell because it seems like fragrance free.</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s not a traditional suntan oil scent (main ingredient sunflower oil, I believe).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dark complected white boy, who tans easily &amp; was already pretty dark when I used this.</li>
            <li>Just bought a new supply for our next trip to Mexico!&lt;br</li>

            <li> Very soft and moisturizing. I only wish it has some coconut or other summer smell because it seems like fragrance free. However, some customers may even like it.</li>
            <li> This product was hard to apply as well as seeing no results with uses at 4 times an hour each, in direct sunlight. Moreover, the smell is something that just made me not want to use this product alone. Not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Used alone &amp; with a 4spf dry oil. Perfect viscosity for my taste. Much more waterproof &amp; sweatproof than any other oil i&#x27;ve used. Pleasant scent even though it&#x27;s not a traditional suntan oil scent (main ingredient sunflower oil, I believe).  My max continual exposure:  3 hours at the pool (12pm-3pm). Reapplied every 40 minutes or so. No burn. FYI:  I&#x27;m a dark complected white boy, who tans easily &amp; was already pretty dark when I used this. Only gripe is the pump spray bottle. It works fine and all. I just don&#x27;t like pump spray bottles, personally. Other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other oil again, don:t have to worry about foreign chemicals going through my pores. You get a great tan too!</li>
            <li> Got some serious good tan, no scent, missed that &amp;#34;tropical oil&amp;#34; scent, BUT didn&#x27;t miss any bugs that might be attracted to that scent.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff !!  My daughter breaks out in a rash from every &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; product so I searched for an all natural product and this is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;No rash, good for the skin, all around very satisfied.</li>
            <li> IT WAS OK THE BOTTLE LOOKED LIKE A SPRAY WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED BUT IT WAS NOT  MY OWN FAULT FOR NOT PAYING ATTENTION</li>
            <li> It is so awesome, not too oily that it gets all over everything but it moisturizes so well. I even use it sometimes lightly on my legs when not in the sun.</li>
            <li> Love, Love Love this tanning oil.  Works good and really does make you tan quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Mexitan &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores. happy to find it on line. Do  wish it was a tad less expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the environment and it&#x27;s oily it is very smooth to apply on skin. i would recommend it!</li>
            <li> love love love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an oil at all.  It&#x27;s more like water.  Doesn&#x27;t have a smell.  It reads &amp;#34;that you can use as an after sun product&amp;#34;, I may try that to see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> Awesome product recommended as being the safest of all tnnibg oils,  by www.ewg.org which is an environmental group that tests what you put on your skin, no harmful chemicals here :)</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.  Just bought a new supply for our next trip to Mexico!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Like the color I got with this product but I didn&#x27;t love the smell or the spray. I ended up just taking the top off after I covered my patio with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is mandatory for Maya Riviera visits as it&#x27;s reef safe, that part is good. Hopefully in they&#x27;ll figure out how to make it smell better.</li>
            <li> just love it! I still have the ten lines from December travel even though had only tree days to ten... Awesome!</li>
            <li> This product was good if you remember to put sunscreen on after 10 mins..I got burned pretty bad using this.  Not too much of the greasy feel after application..</li>
            <li> very good product - happy that it is coral safe and biodegradable!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Not only was effective, but I&#x27;m happy to be protecting our water source and marine life... Highly commend the product and anyone who chose to spend a little more to start riding or water source of the residual impact of the chemicals and toxin you find in drug store brands!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Have been using it over my spf over the weekend and I am brown as a berry!!! Keeps my skin moisturized and soft and is in line with my natural approach to skin care. There will always be a bottle of this around our house.</li>
            <li> great for tanning, very good</li>
            <li> I started using this Tanning Oil when the &#x27;inventor&#x27; made it in her house and sold it as a &#x27;natural tanning oil&#x27;.  That was years...I mean YEARS ago.  She claimed it was the best tanning oil, all natural, organic - before &#x27;organic&#x27; was cool!  Well, I tried it and FELL IN LOVE!  I lived in Florida at the time but I had a BEAUTIFUL tan - and, the oil conditioned my skin like nothing I had EVER used.  My sister tried it - (stole it from me) and loved it too!  Everyone that tried it loved it.  I moved.  I ran out of tanning oil.  Then the internet was invented (I told you it was years ago!) and I had an empty bottle and searched for the Inventers name.  I think I wrote her a letter (wrote her a letter!  remember when people did that?)  Anyway, turns out she sold the formula - I guess - but...I managed to find it - and buy it!  I also found it at my local Co-Op.  Every ingredient in this product is awesome.  It has no sunscreen in it - do be aware of that.  And no sweet smelling coconut smell - it is ALL Natural.  I live on a lake now and keep this tanning oil as a staple for me and my guest - everyone who has used it - loves it.  I most highly recommend this product - and would rate it a 10 star if I could!</li>
