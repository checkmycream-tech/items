            <li>it worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li>This worked awesome!!!!</li>
            <li>The best part is nothing plastic needs to be glued to my face.</li>
            <li>Great detail, but you will need to cut it into sections to get it on perfectly.</li>
            <li>Awesome...  Looked really good.</li>
            <li>Excellent received in Good condition</li>
            <li>Win win.</li>
            <li>In the pictures this looks AMAZING!</li>
            <li>So easy and awesome looking.</li>
            <li>and i loved it</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never look as good as the guy on the package - with the tattoo that is.</li>
            <li>Worked great for halloween, but make sure to get some face paint to fill in the gaps.</li>
            <li>When applied it looks FANTASTIC!!  </li>
            <li>Wow! looked awesome for an adventure run</li>
            <li>This facial tattoo is excellent.</li>
            <li>This turned out great for my teenage boys - they loved it</li>
            <li>While the tattoo gives a great outline for the whole skull look, there are still some places that will need to be painted in (Like around the eyes) and in between the tattoo areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Upon application you realize how much more work you have to put into it.</li>
            <li>Way better than my efforts to make skull face.  </li>
            <li>The tattoos, which I will use for our All Souls Procession, look amazingly real and the instructions are good and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>i will buy more in the future because its a great product as well</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Did not come out perfect and had to use black eyeliner to perfect a few areas...</li>
            <li>Very hard to take off--but stays on perfect the whole day at least!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I will find better ways after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>got many complements on the final product!</li>
            <li>He received many compliments on it, as when properly appied it looks like it is painted.  </li>
            <li>Tattoo was not dark enough to use alone, good if you want to use as an outline to paint darker lines and shading, I am a girl so the tattoo was to large for my face and had to cut out, not use some parts.</li>
            <li>The good news is that it arrived early enough that I was able to find out that it was too much trouble to do again.</li>
            <li>I cut around the different areas of the tattoo to make it fit well on my face.</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate it.</li>
            <li>Would have bee better to be broken up for better placement.</li>
            <li>*** out of the littles and the older students</li>
            <li>Then it made my whole face red after I removed it with the baby oil and water</li>
            <li>After application, I drew in between the tattoo sections with a white face crayon and over the actual tattoo with a black face crayon to really make it stand out.</li>

            <li> This facial tattoo is excellent. I cut around the different areas of the tattoo to make it fit well on my face. I dabbed white makeup in the inbetween areas. Takes about 30 minutes to apply and remove with adhesive remover and soap. Patience is a must when applying this. I would definitely recommend this if you are going for a skeleton costume.</li>
            <li> Awesome...  Looked really good. Got a lot of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not come out perfect and had to use black eyeliner to perfect a few areas...</li>
            <li> This turned out great for my teenage boys - they loved it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teacher. Dressed for middle school halloween party. I scared the s*** out of the littles and the older students thought I looked awesome. Win win. Hard to apply. I had to cut the skeleton face into sections to put on. Thank goodness they give you two face tattoos incase you mess up, and you will. After application, I drew in between the tattoo sections with a white face crayon and over the actual tattoo with a black face crayon to really make it stand out. Oh I stood out. Fun and scary. Came off with rubbing alcohol and make-up remover.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it.  Instructions are almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> it was awesome and i loved it i will buy more in the future because its a great product as well</li>

            <li> Got this for my daughter for halloween......it worked out perfectly. So easy and awesome looking. Would totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Tattoo was not dark enough to use alone, good if you want to use as an outline to paint darker lines and shading, I am a girl so the tattoo was to large for my face and had to cut out, not use some parts.</li>

            <li> Did not look like the picture ! Then it made my whole face red after I removed it with the baby oil and water</li>
            <li> This worked awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and within 3 days I had it. It was packaged well and not bent at all. I look forward to using it. I will post pictures</li>
            <li> One piece tattoo that had to be placed over entire face. Would have bee better to be broken up for better placement.</li>
            <li> Great detail, but you will need to cut it into sections to get it on perfectly. Also, have some black and white eyeliner to fill in some areas. Very hard to take off--but stays on perfect the whole day at least!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Good detail&lt;br /&gt;-Great price&lt;br /&gt;-Stays on well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to take off/apply&lt;br /&gt;-Need black and white application makeup/paint to tune it up</li>
            <li> My husband wore this tattoo for a day of the dead look.  When applied it looks FANTASTIC!!  He received many compliments on it, as when properly appied it looks like it is painted.  Plan on an hour to apply, and use baby oil to remove.</li>
            <li> Wow! looked awesome for an adventure run I did.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it for Halloween.  Little hard to take off, but I&#x27;m sure I will find better ways after a few uses.  Totally will buy again.  Way better than my efforts to make skull face.  The best part is nothing plastic needs to be glued to my face.</li>
            <li> This looked so simple but it wasn&#x27;t. You still had to do a lot of shading and try to soften the lines. Not for the novice makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Excellent received in Good condition</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Hard to get off but if it wasn&#x27;t then it would have wiped off.</li>
