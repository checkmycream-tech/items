            <li>This is a warm, comforting scent.</li>
            <li>but I am sure it&#x27;s a great oil once I am able to use it after the baby is born.</li>
            <li>I use these oils for making my own fragrance mixtures.  </li>
            <li>I used it to make my own air freshner and also apply it on my scalp over night</li>
            <li>i use this for tooth aches if use straight it will burn inside of mouth best to dilute w/ olive,almond or some type of oil or water.</li>
            <li>They send a nice pamphlet with every order.</li>
            <li>It will be nice for a fall holiday themed soap or a Thanksgiving soap.</li>
            <li>Their oils are of the highest quality and absolutely the best prices around.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell</li>

            <li>:)</li>
            <li>, I know I&#x27;m using something healthy, and I&#x27;m also killing bacteria.</li>
            <li>clove oil is awesome, especially if you have a toothache.</li>
            <li>but this has become my favorite oil for stomach/gas pains.</li>
            <li>Works better than the oils that&#x27;s made specifically for stomach issues.</li>
            <li>Great prices and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But I have to say, the bottle I received smelled more like rotten cloves than anything else.</li>
            <li>(For many more details search for GAB&#x27;s article.)</li>
            <li>Love these oils.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent...perfect for diy products.</li>
            <li>I will keep it as a numbing agent for teeth for the family and love the trick I saw posted to soothe bee stings when combined with Witch Hazel!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the the smell helped me with my tooth acke</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love your product will be returning for more.</li>

            <li>and at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>and so this combined with a couple more oils</li>
            <li>GOOD OILS, GOOD PRICES, THANKS SO MUCH , HAVE A GOOD ONE</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love Eden Garden oils and love this clove oil.</li>
            <li>It has many uses and I look forward to all of the uses</li>
            <li>and I am sure I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils.  </li>
            <li>Gave it one more star.</li>
            <li>Some love it.</li>
            <li>I love Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils.  </li>
            <li>Wanted more of a cookie smell.</li>
            <li>the smell of alcohol is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It smells more like turpentine than clove.</li>
            <li>Strong, very strong.</li>
            <li>Great with olive oil as the main oil and can use it on your skin once you do mix and blend it.</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing when diffused with sweet orange oil.</li>
            <li>They are an amazing company and I am a loyal fan.</li>
            <li>Awesome,  thanks for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Good oil,nice smell and pure</li>
            <li>The oils are good, maybe not quite as good as the really high cost stuff, but good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>so far i am happy</li>
            <li>My mouth feels nice and fresh</li>
            <li>The Clove essential Oil is a very good strong smell,</li>
            <li>Whether you&#x27;re putting them in a diffuser or using them for other purposes, they are the best.</li>
            <li>that was cool!</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li>so you can easily use and not spill.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They even email you personally to check up and make sure you are happy with the product.</li>
            <li>it with water because it is a strong scent.</li>
            <li>I tried it on myself without diluting it and it was way too strong.</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of beautiful girls smoking cloves outside the goth club, it reminds me of thanksgiving dinners, it reminds me of a lovers skin under the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edens</li>
            <li>Pure and potent!</li>
            <li>Might be best to slightly dilute.</li>
            <li>This one seems just fine if you&#x27;re looking for clove.</li>
            <li>luckily I was able to return it for a refund.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s none of that with this oil - it smells exactly the way it should: warm, rich and spicy.</li>
            <li>This oil is very very veryyyy strong!</li>
            <li>I purchased this essential oil from Eden&#x27;s Garden and it arrived promptly and in great condition.</li>
            <li>Customer service is nice and replies very timely.</li>
            <li>Beware, the liquid is a amber color, so use caution when using with light color towels or sheets.</li>
            <li>I do not use this one much but it is effective.  </li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>I use a few drops of this with coconut oil in my scent warmer...smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and strong, but not too strong, I use few drops in cotton balls and distribute them all around my house, and always get compliments of how good my house smells.</li>
            <li>I love the rich deep smell of the clove, and was very pleased with EG version.</li>
            <li>I have bought many different scents &amp; love them!</li>
            <li>so I am quite familiar with what clove smells like.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really believe in the &amp;#34;healing powers&amp;#34; in essential oils and whatnot, but I love this scent and I am happy with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li>The scent is VERY strong, sweet, and VERY pungent.</li>
            <li>This smells perfect and takes me right back to high school when we&#x27;d have mulled cider around a campfire in the fall.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this oil.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks given.</li>
            <li>I used this with the sweet orange oil for soap</li>
            <li>The bottle suggests sweet orange, which I don&#x27;t yet own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is great blended with other oils (cinnamon, peppermint, spearmint, etc.)</li>
            <li>Great oil can mix and blend with other oils.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t smell like what I&#x27;d imagined and when I read how to avoid when pregnant I put it to one side.  </li>
            <li>The oil was shipped with adequate padding to prevent breakage of the glass bottle and came with a 59-page product guide from the company that describes each oil&#x27;s properties and uses along with tips for use and descriptions of assorted blends.</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and who well it mixes with other oils to make an amazing, useful product.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and who well it mixes with other oils to make an amazing, useful product.</li>
            <li>great product, rich aroma, as expected, high quality, will do business again!</li>
            <li>This works wonders for our teether though, and it arrived very quickly, and with much information.</li>
            <li>The oil is strong and you do not need much at all.</li>
            <li>Do NOT apply to hot lightbulbs!  </li>
            <li>Smells exactly like cloves!</li>
            <li>FOR A FEW DAYS WHEN IWAS SO DRUGGED UP LOL.</li>
            <li>Every oil has their distinct aroma.</li>
            <li>I love Edens Garden and recommend ordering directly from their website.</li>
            <li>I heard about how powerful this oil was</li>
            <li>so it s worth the money!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I threw it right in the trash</li>
            <li>i am finding out that the EO&#x27;s from eden garden are very pure therapeutic grade EO&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Edens Garden oils are very pure and burn well in diffusers.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>OH you can distinctly smell that it is a pure lavender oil.</li>
            <li>My first purchase of Edens Garden Oils was the lavender.</li>
            <li>Once you open that top</li>
            <li>This was pretty stinky and smelled like cloves with cod liver oil...</li>
            <li>I love all of Edens Garden essential oils!</li>
            <li>Love Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils.</li>
            <li>oil is exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li>Clove is one of my favorite essential oils of all and this Clove gets an A</li>
            <li>Top quality oils- made a room spray with water and hours later still can smell.</li>
            <li>I ordered several bottles of different oil and they included an awesome booklet with all their scents with description and a 101 uses for essential oils pamphlet...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>There are many uses for the essential oils.</li>
            <li>I received Eden&#x27;s Garden (clary sage, lemon, cinnamon bark, ylang ylang, clove, aphrodisiac synergy blend) as a gift after I expressed interest in learning more about and using essential oils.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve had an opportunity to use this oil for a longer period of time since my first review.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more from them in the future, just clove oil wasn&#x27;t exactly for me.</li>
            <li>Love these essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I love these 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils!</li>
            <li>one is also effective against nausea and other gastro upsets.</li>
            <li>The price is great too, for such a powerful little oil</li>
            <li>The company offers a great assortment of different scents that can be mixed.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li>Garden 100% Pure Clove is just that...</li>
            <li>I ordered this product expecting it to be pure 100% clove oil.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell of the clove essential oil.</li>
            <li>Not so much for spring/summer...  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend clove, cinnamon, and orange!</li>
            <li>A very distinctive clove scent.</li>
            <li>To add this sultry fragrance in any room, place one drop on a incandescent (regular) light bulb, then turn on.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Edens Garden.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>THANKS, RB</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But i did have very Lana del Rey looking lips for a while.</li>
            <li>Smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend and also this seller ships immediately.</li>
            <li>So much for the medicinal/anti bacterial properties of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice it doing a whole lot for the pain either.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>LOVE using essential oils as natural alternatives.</li>
            <li>it seems to be missing that warm, earthy scent that is clove.</li>
            <li>It has different natural healing remedies but should sell in larger bottles and to everyone you will makie a good choice in buying his product</li>
            <li>As for the product itself, and the company that sells it, it comes in a very nice little bottle, with all kinds of literature (and catalog) to get you started with essential oil therapy.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased other brands before but was looking for a good deal online, I have even smoked clove cigarettes with the actual buds inside</li>
            <li>sure enough, this oil barely smells like real cloves.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased the Oil of Cloves for my medical kit, in case of a dental emergency.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the diffuser with other oils to make a lovely holiday scent.</li>
            <li>I highly believe the retailer when they label 100% pure.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you use a very little dose on a q-tip when applying for the first time  because it tends to irritate the gum if you put too much.</li>
            <li>It smells like clove, sweet and spicy at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a neat book as described that gives you a background of each particular oil and its uses.</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are high quality.  </li>
            <li>I think the shipping price is alittle high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a little lid on the inside where I can do the drops from the bottle instead of a separate dropper.</li>
            <li>When you get into this kind of stuff it hard to find.</li>
            <li>For a toothache, wow this stuff works fast....</li>
            <li>And, of course, always consult your health care provider before adding any new product to your health regimen.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I wanted for an essential oil.  </li>
            <li>You have to go by gutt feeling and the positive reviews which plays a big role on online purchasing.</li>
            <li>Very strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>While I love Edens Garden, this particular oil is not good.</li>
            <li>My brother has had tooth aches for most of his life, and its hard to watch him in agony when he is going through it, so i read up on home remedies and</li>
            <li>My son suffers from eczema and these oil mixes have been a great use.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for sending this oil, my fault though, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I got this for a natural mouthwash for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>Always dilute clove oil, as it can cause irritation to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>WOW-</li>
            <li>I use these for soaps, that&#x27;s it so far</li>
            <li>I have used Do-Terra and Young Living.  </li>
            <li>Gave it 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t really started using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>This essential oil needs to be used very carefully like most essential oils</li>
            <li>This leaves a nice spicy scent, I mix with a few other oils in my diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is potent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible that maybe this is extracted from a particular type of clove</li>
            <li>Worked to calm down discomfort for 5mth old baby</li>
            <li>its a reasonable low price and that well come on-purchasing online is not the same as in person.</li>
            <li>I bought it for dental pain and other first aid</li>
            <li>Apparently clove has lots of uses</li>
            <li>It can also be used to calm the most painful tooth achache</li>
            <li>I was also surprised that a day later I recieved a phone call from the actual retailer asking how I felt about the product</li>
            <li>We dilute it with a little evoo and rub it on his gums, it absolutely works!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of cloves, so I decided to buy clove 100% pure therapeutic grade essential to use in my cold process soaps.  </li>
            <li>I bought Clove to mix with other essential oils &amp; it blends very well.</li>
            <li>The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing.</li>

            <li> This is a warm, comforting scent.</li>
            <li> but I am sure it&#x27;s a great oil once I am able to use it after the baby is born.</li>
            <li> I use these oils for making my own fragrance mixtures.  </li>
            <li> I used it to make my own air freshner and also apply it on my scalp over night</li>
            <li> i use this for tooth aches if use straight it will burn inside of mouth best to dilute w/ olive,almond or some type of oil or water.</li>
            <li> They send a nice pamphlet with every order.</li>
            <li> It will be nice for a fall holiday themed soap or a Thanksgiving soap.</li>
            <li> Their oils are of the highest quality and absolutely the best prices around.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell</li>

            <li> It is superb @ is great for aromatherapy/detox/stress relief, and too many other things to mention.</li>

            <li> Good product,works as a antiseptic and mild pain killer for tooth and</li>
            <li> As always this is great and pure oil.</li>
            <li> I pleased I followed my gutt.</li>
            <li> It has a built in droplet top</li>
            <li> and if I was pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then I have purchased Ylang Ylang which blends lovely with my Lavender.</li>
            <li> love my oils</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> , I know I&#x27;m using something healthy, and I&#x27;m also killing bacteria.</li>
            <li> clove oil is awesome, especially if you have a toothache.</li>
            <li> but this has become my favorite oil for stomach/gas pains.</li>
            <li> Works better than the oils that&#x27;s made specifically for stomach issues.</li>
            <li> Great prices and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> But I have to say, the bottle I received smelled more like rotten cloves than anything else.</li>
            <li> (For many more details search for GAB&#x27;s article.)</li>
            <li> Love these oils.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent...perfect for diy products.</li>
            <li> I will keep it as a numbing agent for teeth for the family and love the trick I saw posted to soothe bee stings when combined with Witch Hazel!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the the smell helped me with my tooth acke</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love your product will be returning for more.</li>
            <li> though I know there are many uses.  </li>
            <li> and at a much better price.  </li>
            <li> and so this combined with a couple more oils</li>
            <li> GOOD OILS, GOOD PRICES, THANKS SO MUCH , HAVE A GOOD ONE</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love Eden Garden oils and love this clove oil.</li>
            <li> It has many uses and I look forward to all of the uses</li>
            <li> and I am sure I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils.  </li>
            <li> Gave it one more star.</li>
            <li> Some love it.</li>
            <li> I love Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils.  </li>
            <li> Wanted more of a cookie smell.</li>
            <li> the smell of alcohol is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It smells more like turpentine than clove.</li>
            <li> Strong, very strong.</li>
            <li> Great with olive oil as the main oil and can use it on your skin once you do mix and blend it.</li>
            <li> It also smells amazing when diffused with sweet orange oil.</li>
            <li> They are an amazing company and I am a loyal fan.</li>
            <li> Awesome,  thanks for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good oil,nice smell and pure</li>
            <li> The oils are good, maybe not quite as good as the really high cost stuff, but good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> so far i am happy</li>
            <li> My mouth feels nice and fresh</li>
            <li> The Clove essential Oil is a very good strong smell,</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re putting them in a diffuser or using them for other purposes, they are the best.</li>
            <li> that was cool!</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li> so you can easily use and not spill.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> They even email you personally to check up and make sure you are happy with the product.</li>
            <li> it with water because it is a strong scent.</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself without diluting it and it was way too strong.</li>
            <li> We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of beautiful girls smoking cloves outside the goth club, it reminds me of thanksgiving dinners, it reminds me of a lovers skin under the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edens</li>
            <li> Pure and potent!</li>
            <li> Might be best to slightly dilute.</li>
            <li> This one seems just fine if you&#x27;re looking for clove.</li>
            <li> luckily I was able to return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s none of that with this oil - it smells exactly the way it should: warm, rich and spicy.</li>
            <li> This oil is very very veryyyy strong!</li>
            <li> I purchased this essential oil from Eden&#x27;s Garden and it arrived promptly and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Customer service is nice and replies very timely.</li>
            <li> Beware, the liquid is a amber color, so use caution when using with light color towels or sheets.</li>
            <li> I do not use this one much but it is effective.  </li>
            <li> I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this with coconut oil in my scent warmer...smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and strong, but not too strong, I use few drops in cotton balls and distribute them all around my house, and always get compliments of how good my house smells.</li>
            <li> I love the rich deep smell of the clove, and was very pleased with EG version.</li>
            <li> I have bought many different scents &amp; love them!</li>
            <li> so I am quite familiar with what clove smells like.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really believe in the &amp;#34;healing powers&amp;#34; in essential oils and whatnot, but I love this scent and I am happy with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> The scent is VERY strong, sweet, and VERY pungent.</li>
            <li> This smells perfect and takes me right back to high school when we&#x27;d have mulled cider around a campfire in the fall.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this oil.  </li>
            <li> Many thanks given.</li>
            <li> I used this with the sweet orange oil for soap</li>
            <li> The bottle suggests sweet orange, which I don&#x27;t yet own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is great blended with other oils (cinnamon, peppermint, spearmint, etc.)</li>
            <li> Great oil can mix and blend with other oils.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t smell like what I&#x27;d imagined and when I read how to avoid when pregnant I put it to one side.  </li>
            <li> The oil was shipped with adequate padding to prevent breakage of the glass bottle and came with a 59-page product guide from the company that describes each oil&#x27;s properties and uses along with tips for use and descriptions of assorted blends.</li>
            <li> That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and who well it mixes with other oils to make an amazing, useful product.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and who well it mixes with other oils to make an amazing, useful product.</li>
            <li> great product, rich aroma, as expected, high quality, will do business again!</li>
            <li> This works wonders for our teether though, and it arrived very quickly, and with much information.</li>
            <li> The oil is strong and you do not need much at all.</li>
            <li> Do NOT apply to hot lightbulbs!  </li>
            <li> Smells exactly like cloves!</li>
            <li> FOR A FEW DAYS WHEN IWAS SO DRUGGED UP LOL.</li>
            <li> Every oil has their distinct aroma.</li>
            <li> I love Edens Garden and recommend ordering directly from their website.</li>
            <li> I heard about how powerful this oil was</li>
            <li> so it s worth the money!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I threw it right in the trash</li>
            <li> i am finding out that the EO&#x27;s from eden garden are very pure therapeutic grade EO&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Edens Garden oils are very pure and burn well in diffusers.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> OH you can distinctly smell that it is a pure lavender oil.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of Edens Garden Oils was the lavender.</li>
            <li> Once you open that top</li>
            <li> This was pretty stinky and smelled like cloves with cod liver oil...</li>
            <li> I love all of Edens Garden essential oils!</li>
            <li> Love Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils.</li>
            <li> oil is exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> Clove is one of my favorite essential oils of all and this Clove gets an A</li>
            <li> Top quality oils- made a room spray with water and hours later still can smell.</li>
            <li> I ordered several bottles of different oil and they included an awesome booklet with all their scents with description and a 101 uses for essential oils pamphlet...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> There are many uses for the essential oils.</li>
            <li> I received Eden&#x27;s Garden (clary sage, lemon, cinnamon bark, ylang ylang, clove, aphrodisiac synergy blend) as a gift after I expressed interest in learning more about and using essential oils.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve had an opportunity to use this oil for a longer period of time since my first review.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more from them in the future, just clove oil wasn&#x27;t exactly for me.</li>
            <li> Love these essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I love these 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils!</li>
            <li> one is also effective against nausea and other gastro upsets.</li>
            <li> The price is great too, for such a powerful little oil</li>
            <li> The company offers a great assortment of different scents that can be mixed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li> Garden 100% Pure Clove is just that...</li>
            <li> I ordered this product expecting it to be pure 100% clove oil.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell of the clove essential oil.</li>
            <li> Not so much for spring/summer...  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend clove, cinnamon, and orange!</li>
            <li> A very distinctive clove scent.</li>
            <li> To add this sultry fragrance in any room, place one drop on a incandescent (regular) light bulb, then turn on.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Edens Garden.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> THANKS, RB</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> But i did have very Lana del Rey looking lips for a while.</li>
            <li> Smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend and also this seller ships immediately.</li>
            <li> So much for the medicinal/anti bacterial properties of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it doing a whole lot for the pain either.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> LOVE using essential oils as natural alternatives.</li>
            <li> it seems to be missing that warm, earthy scent that is clove.</li>
            <li> It has different natural healing remedies but should sell in larger bottles and to everyone you will makie a good choice in buying his product</li>
            <li> As for the product itself, and the company that sells it, it comes in a very nice little bottle, with all kinds of literature (and catalog) to get you started with essential oil therapy.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other brands before but was looking for a good deal online, I have even smoked clove cigarettes with the actual buds inside</li>
            <li> sure enough, this oil barely smells like real cloves.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Oil of Cloves for my medical kit, in case of a dental emergency.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the diffuser with other oils to make a lovely holiday scent.</li>
            <li> I highly believe the retailer when they label 100% pure.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you use a very little dose on a q-tip when applying for the first time  because it tends to irritate the gum if you put too much.</li>
            <li> It smells like clove, sweet and spicy at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a neat book as described that gives you a background of each particular oil and its uses.</li>
            <li> Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are high quality.  </li>
            <li> I think the shipping price is alittle high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a little lid on the inside where I can do the drops from the bottle instead of a separate dropper.</li>
            <li> When you get into this kind of stuff it hard to find.</li>
            <li> For a toothache, wow this stuff works fast....</li>
            <li> And, of course, always consult your health care provider before adding any new product to your health regimen.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted for an essential oil.  </li>
            <li> You have to go by gutt feeling and the positive reviews which plays a big role on online purchasing.</li>
            <li> Very strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> While I love Edens Garden, this particular oil is not good.</li>
            <li> My brother has had tooth aches for most of his life, and its hard to watch him in agony when he is going through it, so i read up on home remedies and</li>
            <li> My son suffers from eczema and these oil mixes have been a great use.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for sending this oil, my fault though, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I got this for a natural mouthwash for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Always dilute clove oil, as it can cause irritation to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> WOW-</li>
            <li> I use these for soaps, that&#x27;s it so far</li>
            <li> I have used Do-Terra and Young Living.  </li>
            <li> Gave it 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t really started using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This essential oil needs to be used very carefully like most essential oils</li>
            <li> This leaves a nice spicy scent, I mix with a few other oils in my diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is potent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that maybe this is extracted from a particular type of clove</li>
            <li> Worked to calm down discomfort for 5mth old baby</li>
            <li> its a reasonable low price and that well come on-purchasing online is not the same as in person.</li>
            <li> I bought it for dental pain and other first aid</li>
            <li> Apparently clove has lots of uses</li>
            <li> It can also be used to calm the most painful tooth achache</li>
            <li> I was also surprised that a day later I recieved a phone call from the actual retailer asking how I felt about the product</li>
            <li> We dilute it with a little evoo and rub it on his gums, it absolutely works!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of cloves, so I decided to buy clove 100% pure therapeutic grade essential to use in my cold process soaps.  </li>
            <li> I bought Clove to mix with other essential oils &amp; it blends very well.</li>
            <li> The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, although I&#x27;m a little disappointed that the clove smell isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li> Even if a replacement was received the last time around, it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to fulfill an order properly, the first time around.</li>
            <li> Grab this if you keep fish, it&#x27;s great as an anesthetic to help put your fish to sleep if they are sick and need to be humanely put down, or if you just need to apply something to wounds and need them to not be so squirmy.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t diffused it yet, it&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s more of a cold weather, holiday scent.</li>
            <li> From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for joint pain because its can took my pain away in less than 10 seconds!!</li>
            <li> I have had for a long time a dry socket.</li>
            <li> I heartily recommend this and all of he other essential oils I ordered from this maker.</li>
            <li> Also, other bulbs such as LED, halogen, etc.</li>
            <li> Quality oil...goes a very LONG way.</li>
            <li> Well, the last time I ordered, I filed the same missing product report, and nothing ever received.</li>
            <li> clove oil was on every single site, so i decided to buy it for him.</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
            <li> I made homemade cleaner with a few drops of this and equal parts vinegar and water.</li>
            <li> A few drops of clove oil mixed with salt, then applied to the forehead creates a cooling effect which can relieve your symptoms.  </li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Received quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> This is quite bitter smelling.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the company&#x27;s other offerings, but this one stank.  </li>
            <li> You can mix 5 drops with a tsp of vegetable&lt;br /&gt;oil and swish it around in your mouth and no pain for a longer time than&lt;br /&gt;with other products.</li>
            <li> It is just not as &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; a clove oil as I&#x27;ve had before with other brands but it will do.</li>
            <li> which btw, Amazon will not let you return them because they&#x27;re a &#x27;fire hazard&#x27; due to their alcohol</li>
            <li> And the cost compared to my previous purchases is a blessing.</li>
            <li> I was a little spectacle being that</li>
            <li> and after a little bit of discomfort his toothache subsided.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not familiar with, so</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put my bars of soap down!  </li>
            <li> Add a few drops of clove oil to some witch hazel and dab on sting area (after removing stinger) for relief.  </li>
            <li> I am going to add a few drops to my pumpkin soap to give it a ghostly spice scent.</li>
            <li> Overall, not happy with these oils-</li>
            <li> Works well for tooth pain, added to water for a mouth wash, or even added into a small spray bottle to use as a household disinfectant.</li>
            <li> even if bottle it is too small for price</li>
            <li> Not sure if it  is working or not.  </li>
            <li> after using chamomile from eden garden i had a dull pain on the gum line.  </li>
            <li> the dull pain went away.  </li>
            <li> Weak Smell to it.</li>
            <li> So dumb.</li>
            <li> and my scar is getting lighter and the swelling has drastically decreased with the mix of clove with tumeric</li>
            <li> Have about 20 different oils and have yet to be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It stinks to high heaven and tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> Stank as in &amp;#34;send this stuff to Al-Quaeda headquarters and wait outside with guns and claymores for them to flee the nasty smell of this stuff&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eeuwwww.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately whomever fulfills the orders does an absolutely terrible job... each time we&#x27;ve ordered quite a few, and every time we&#x27;ve received the wrong ones.</li>
            <li> This product smells like a mix of molasses, cinnamon, a hint of clove (very small), and something downright disgusting - I threw the vial away after smelling it.</li>
            <li> any bad germs or bacteria at bay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesitant to give this a bad review.  </li>
            <li> it was so bad.</li>
            <li> I got sick.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible sinuses</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased for my mother to help her protect the house from snakes.</li>
            <li> Great product at a very reasonable price!  Shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of Edens Garden Oils was the lavender. I was looking for a 100% pure oil. I was a little spectacle being that its a reasonable low price and that well come on-purchasing online is not the same as in person. You have to go by gutt feeling and the positive reviews which plays a big role on online purchasing. Well OH am I pleased I followed my gutt. This is why I am writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I recieved my lavender, which came two days of ordering. Once you open that top OH you can distinctly smell that it is a pure lavender oil. It comes with a neat book as described that gives you a background of each particular oil and its uses. It has a built in droplet top so you can easily use and not spill. I was also surprised that a day later I recieved a phone call from the actual retailer asking how I felt about the product and if I was pleased. She also asked for an email for discounts on future purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have purchased Ylang Ylang which blends lovely with my Lavender. Tumeric, Patchouli and Clove have been added to my collection. I highly believe the retailer when they label 100% pure. My son suffers from eczema and these oil mixes have been a great use. I also have had recent surgery and my scar is getting lighter and the swelling has drastically decreased with the mix of clove with tumeric and I dilute with 100% coconut oil that I purchased elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I love my oils and I thank god I followed my gutt and found Edens Garden Essential Oils. My next purchase will be the 14 bottle of 10ml synergy blends. I cant wait for that.&lt;br /&gt;All in all 5stars on delivery, customer service and product. For those who complain about scent its all on self opinion. Scents vary from person to person. Every oil has their distinct aroma. Whatever oil you purchase that is what it will smell like. Like my clove yea it smells just like clove as does tumeric smells of tumeric. Your getting what your purchasing.</li>
            <li> This was pretty stinky and smelled like cloves with cod liver oil... luckily I was able to return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> Great item, great vendor, have already used them again!</li>
            <li> I got this for a natural mouthwash for my boyfriend. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell of the clove essential oil. I put it in my diffuser with the tea tree oil to&lt;br /&gt;keep any bad germs or bacteria at bay.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of cloves, so I decided to buy clove 100% pure therapeutic grade essential to use in my cold process soaps.  Oh...my...goodness!  I am so glad that I did!  I can&#x27;t put my bars of soap down!  What wonderful high quality oils!  :)</li>
            <li> Great quality clove oil. Works well for tooth pain, added to water for a mouth wash, or even added into a small spray bottle to use as a household disinfectant. This leaves a nice spicy scent, I mix with a few other oils in my diffuser.  I love all of Edens Garden essential oils!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the company&#x27;s other offerings, but this one stank.  Literally stank, not stank as in &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t like it&amp;#34;. Stank as in &amp;#34;send this stuff to Al-Quaeda headquarters and wait outside with guns and claymores for them to flee the nasty smell of this stuff&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eeuwwww.</li>
            <li> I am a LMT &amp; Love these oils! I mixed this in with the lemon essential oil&amp;evoo carrier. It is superb @ is great for aromatherapy/detox/stress relief, and too many other things to mention. great quality!</li>
            <li> Love Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils. I bought Clove to mix with other essential oils &amp; it blends very well. Happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re putting them in a diffuser or using them for other purposes, they are the best.</li>
            <li> This is a warm, comforting scent. It is great blended with other oils (cinnamon, peppermint, spearmint, etc.) for topical use for sore muscles. While I haven&#x27;t diffused it yet, it&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s more of a cold weather, holiday scent. Not so much for spring/summer...  Update: I&#x27;ve diffused it now and it is amazing... I highly recommend clove, cinnamon, and orange!</li>
            <li> I have tried using clove oil before, but every clove oil I purchased had a pungent, acrid smell - nothing at all like actual cloves. There&#x27;s none of that with this oil - it smells exactly the way it should: warm, rich and spicy. I haven&#x27;t had time to blend it yet, but I&#x27;m already looking forward to blending it with vanilla and orange. Heaven!</li>
            <li> I purchased this essential oil from Eden&#x27;s Garden and it arrived promptly and in great condition. I use clove oil as an antibacterial mouthwash...it works great! My mouth feels nice and fresh, I know I&#x27;m using something healthy, and I&#x27;m also killing bacteria. My mouth is kissable! LOVE using essential oils as natural alternatives.</li>
            <li> I purchase Clove Oil and like to use it as perfume. I am fond of the company who makes it, Edens Garden and their products are quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is exactly what I was expecting and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this oil.  You&#x27;ll see that it is a pure product and that works excellently.  I heartily recommend this and all of he other essential oils I ordered from this maker.</li>
            <li> clove oil is awesome, especially if you have a toothache. It turned my husband into a believer when he woke up with excruciating tooth pain in the middle of the night.  I had him apply it with a q tip and after a little bit of discomfort his toothache subsided. It is a great oil to have on hand for this reason. It also smells amazing when diffused with sweet orange oil.</li>
            <li> A very distinctive clove scent. Very nice to add to colognes or perfume for that musky woodsy combo.</li>
            <li> This smells good and it keeps the house smelling good as well.</li>
            <li> For a toothache, wow this stuff works fast.... Great product for my use..</li>
            <li> I had no idea what I would use the clove oil for when I bought it besides occasional mouth pain but this has become my favorite oil for stomach/gas pains. Works better than the oils that&#x27;s made specifically for stomach issues. Love it and will buy again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the products! Have about 20 different oils and have yet to be disappointed! Great prices and fast shipping. Customer service is nice and replies very timely. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Clove essential Oil is a very good strong smell, Im using it on indoor car scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I&#x27;m experimenting daily.</li>
            <li> I have had for a long time a dry socket. I had had a root canal way back and&lt;br /&gt;still where it had been hurts on and off. I had noted online that so many&lt;br /&gt;people reccommended clove oil. You can mix 5 drops with a tsp of vegetable&lt;br /&gt;oil and swish it around in your mouth and no pain for a longer time than&lt;br /&gt;with other products. I always wondered when I went to the dentist what that&lt;br /&gt;smell was and it was cloves; even dentists have sometimes to reach way back&lt;br /&gt;in history for something to ease pain.</li>
            <li> very happy with this price and smell. works wonderful. I made homemade cleaner with a few drops of this and equal parts vinegar and water. Makes my kitchen smell and look great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that maybe this is extracted from a particular type of clove I&#x27;m not familiar with, so I&#x27;m hesitant to give this a bad review.  But I have to say, the bottle I received smelled more like rotten cloves than anything else. I threw it right in the trash it was so bad. The scent is VERY strong, sweet, and VERY pungent. I even ran to the kitchen and opened a bag of cloves I keep for cooking... sure enough, this oil barely smells like real cloves. While I love Edens Garden, this particular oil is not good.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Oil of Cloves for my medical kit, in case of a dental emergency.  However, when I began researching the uses for clove oil, I learned just how versatile it can be.  To add this sultry fragrance in any room, place one drop on a incandescent (regular) light bulb, then turn on.  As the bulb heats, the scent is released into the room.  Do NOT apply to hot lightbulbs!  Also, other bulbs such as LED, halogen, etc. do not generate heat and I do not recommend using any product with those type bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a headache?  A few drops of clove oil mixed with salt, then applied to the forehead creates a cooling effect which can relieve your symptoms.  Bee sting?  Add a few drops of clove oil to some witch hazel and dab on sting area (after removing stinger) for relief.  Always dilute clove oil, as it can cause irritation to sensitive skin.  And, of course, always consult your health care provider before adding any new product to your health regimen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Great Christmas scent.</li>
            <li> This smells perfect and takes me right back to high school when we&#x27;d have mulled cider around a campfire in the fall. I use this in my deodorant and it stands up to the heat of being mixed into melted coconut oil. I love Edens Garden and recommend ordering directly from their website. Only thing I&#x27;d change is that they send me the same booklet with every purchase about the uses of various essential oils and it feels wasteful.</li>
            <li> Not only am I big fan of this company, but the scent of cloves is one of my all-time favorites. Unfortunately, this smells like Jack Daniels more than it does cloves. It smells like whiskey or scotch...it seems to be missing that warm, earthy scent that is clove.</li>
            <li> Quality clove oil (syzgium aromaticum). Comes in tiny (10 ml), tinted glass container with a neat built-in dropper. Works as fish anesthetic (for euthanasia of sick/dying fish only): 8-12 drops per 1 gallon, emulsified. (For many more details search for GAB&#x27;s article.) Thanks Edens Garden.</li>
            <li> Worked to calm down discomfort for 5mth old baby</li>
            <li> Love these oils.  Will purchase more!</li>
            <li> Love the scent...perfect for diy products.</li>
            <li> Wonderful in the diffuser.  Smells like Christmas.</li>
            <li> after using chamomile from eden garden i had a dull pain on the gum line.  i applied some clove and the dull pain went away.  i am finding out that the EO&#x27;s from eden garden are very pure therapeutic grade EO&#x27;s.  i will order from eden garden for my EO&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The fragrance of these oils is good. It is just about what one would expect. The cost/performance ratio is good and the bottles dispense drops easily and with regularity. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for sending this oil, my fault though, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  The smell doesn&#x27;t smell like what I&#x27;d imagined and when I read how to avoid when pregnant I put it to one side.  I will keep it as a numbing agent for teeth for the family and love the trick I saw posted to soothe bee stings when combined with Witch Hazel!&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars only based on smell but I am sure it&#x27;s a great oil once I am able to use it after the baby is born.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful smell, will use it near kitchen</li>
            <li> A great oil at a great price!</li>
            <li> Helpful for any mouth pain. Might be best to slightly dilute.</li>
            <li> I use these oils for making my own fragrance mixtures.  They are high quality.  I like them and I recommend them.</li>
            <li> As expected.  Quality product.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time as promised, packaged well in perfect condition. The quality of the oil is exceptional and was used immediately. I am extremely happy with this product line and will continue to purchase them as needed.</li>
            <li> I love these 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils! I have bought many different scents &amp; love them! Edens Gardens has a lifetime customer in me. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Item as descried.  Fast delivery.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS THE BEST THING EVER</li>
            <li> The smell of this oil it is very strong I used it to make my own air freshner and also apply it on my scalp over night it promotes circulation and it helps to grow my hair at a faster pace. It can also be used to calm the most painful tooth achache I&#x27;m very satisfied with quality even if bottle it is too small for price it is still a good value</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Clove is one of THE scents that make me roll my eyes up into my head. It reminds me of beautiful girls smoking cloves outside the goth club, it reminds me of thanksgiving dinners, it reminds me of a lovers skin under the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edens Garden 100% Pure Clove is just that...100% ...nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cloves are supposed to be an aphrodisiac, and I believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil in an oil diffuser,,,diluting it with water because it is a strong scent.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, however it is very strong. A little goes a long way. Beware, the liquid is a amber color, so use caution when using with light color towels or sheets.</li>
            <li> I love the the smell helped me with my tooth acke that&#x27;s all I can say about it thank you</li>
            <li> A friend in medical school recommended this to me for our teething baby. We dilute it with a little evoo and rub it on his gums, it absolutely works! I tried it on myself without diluting it and it was way too strong. This works wonders for our teether though, and it arrived very quickly, and with much information.</li>
            <li> Very strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I got sick.  Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I do not use this one much but it is effective.  I bought it for dental pain and other first aid uses... it&#x27;s ok in some applications and great for others.  No complaints about quality... I can&#x27;t gush about it because it&#x27;s clove oil.  Ha.  Just not an oil you can get overly giddy about.  But clove is a great oil to have in your EO collection.  This one seems just fine if you&#x27;re looking for clove.</li>
            <li> My brother has had tooth aches for most of his life, and its hard to watch him in agony when he is going through it, so i read up on home remedies and clove oil was on every single site, so i decided to buy it for him. So according to him it works ok but not great, but whew!!! the smell is vverrry strooong. I had to watch my hands several times to get it off but it still lingered. I read you can use it as an aroma too.</li>
            <li> I have ordered from Eden&#x27;s Garden three times, and all three times they have messed up my order. The oils are good, maybe not quite as good as the really high cost stuff, but good enough for the price. Unfortunately whomever fulfills the orders does an absolutely terrible job... each time we&#x27;ve ordered quite a few, and every time we&#x27;ve received the wrong ones. The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing. Well, the last time I ordered, I filed the same missing product report, and nothing ever received. Even if a replacement was received the last time around, it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to fulfill an order properly, the first time around. It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way. Word of warning to those looking to purchase from this seller!</li>
            <li> great product, rich aroma, as expected, high quality, will do business again!</li>
            <li> I love the rich deep smell of the clove, and was very pleased with EG version. The price is great too, for such a powerful little oil</li>
            <li> One word....SPICY!  Thats my best warning. Use sparingly. Quality oil...goes a very LONG way. LOL</li>
            <li> i use this for tooth aches if use straight it will burn inside of mouth best to dilute w/ olive,almond or some type of oil or water.</li>
            <li> Great item; helps me with my toothaches, as well as repelling ants. Pure and potent!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, awesome product. Clove is one of my favorite essential oils of all and this Clove gets an A +</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted for an essential oil.  Great product to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Strong, very strong. Will help your tooth pain and overall dental health.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR A TOOTHACHE. AFTER A PROCEDURE I WAS GETTNG  HORRID MIGRAINES AND THIS SOOTHED ME . FOR A FEW DAYS WHEN IWAS SO DRUGGED UP LOL.</li>
            <li> WOW- Top quality oils- made a room spray with water and hours later still can smell. I ordered several bottles of different oil and they included an awesome booklet with all their scents with description and a 101 uses for essential oils pamphlet... awesome! I recommend this company and their products!</li>
            <li> Love it. I have quite a collection now and I would recommend Edens Garden to everyone. They send a nice pamphlet with every order. They even email you personally to check up and make sure you are happy with the product. I ordered about 6 oils at once and that prompted the email. But nice product from a good company.</li>
            <li> Perfect product it met and went beyond my expectations.  Love your product will be returning for more. Many thanks given.</li>
            <li> It smells like clove, sweet and spicy at the same time.  It will be nice for a fall holiday themed soap or a Thanksgiving soap. I use these for soaps, that&#x27;s it so far though I know there are many uses.  Nice size and packaging was good. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Very pleasant oil. Very nice bottle!</li>
            <li> Nice product..real clove fragrance!  Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I heard about how powerful this oil was but when I finally tried it, it blew me away! I highly recommend this for joint pain because its can took my pain away in less than 10 seconds!!</li>
            <li> learning how to properly use these oils. so far i am happy</li>
            <li> I ordered this product expecting it to be pure 100% clove oil. I have purchased other brands before but was looking for a good deal online, I have even smoked clove cigarettes with the actual buds inside so I am quite familiar with what clove smells like. This product smells like a mix of molasses, cinnamon, a hint of clove (very small), and something downright disgusting - I threw the vial away after smelling it.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT . THANKS, RB</li>
            <li> wonderful!! this stuff smells amazing! I am going to add a few drops to my pumpkin soap to give it a ghostly spice scent. I am also going to use this in my lip balm.</li>
            <li> I have used Do-Terra and Young Living.  I find these oils to be wonderful too and at a much better price.  This is not the only oil I have from this company.  I find them all to be really good.</li>
            <li> It has different natural healing remedies but should sell in larger bottles and to everyone you will makie a good choice in buying his product</li>
            <li> This clove oil smells wonderful, bought it to make my own toothpaste. Works wonders.</li>
            <li> This oil is perfect for what I use it for. I have terrible sinuses and so this combined with a couple more oils is so potent and awesome for my steam inhalations. And the cost compared to my previous purchases is a blessing. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> As always this is great and pure oil. We only buy the best and this is always the best. Thanks</li>
            <li> I would strongly urge you to take the dropers out!!! GOOD OILS, GOOD PRICES, THANKS SO MUCH , HAVE A GOOD ONE</li>
            <li> Does not smell like cloves-disappointed</li>
            <li> It is just not as &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; a clove oil as I&#x27;ve had before with other brands but it will do.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Love the fragrance and who well it mixes with other oils to make an amazing, useful product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I use it in the diffuser with other oils to make a lovely holiday scent.</li>
            <li> This oil is very very veryyyy strong! Seriously, this stuff is potent. I used this with the sweet orange oil for soap and it was heavenly. I opened this bottle once and the entire room still smells like clove the day after (:  I had some questions about shipping and got a response from the company within the same day! I am very happy with this oil and with this company.</li>
            <li> Good prices and such a wonderful scent. These oils are real good quality and you don&#x27;t have to go broke to have a variety of them.</li>
            <li> This essential oil needs to be used very carefully like most essential oils but it does wonders for tooth ache. Just make sure that you use a very little dose on a q-tip when applying for the first time  because it tends to irritate the gum if you put too much.</li>
            <li> Love Eden Garden oils and love this clove oil. The oil is strong and you do not need much at all.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and as always shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li> Great for toothaches and aroma therapy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Love the fragrance and who well it mixes with other oils to make an amazing, useful product.</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil, and the company is amazing. The scent is nice and strong, but not too strong, I use few drops in cotton balls and distribute them all around my house, and always get compliments of how good my house smells.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, reminds me of my youth!</li>
            <li> I do not not  have it yet, but I will have it soon. I look forward to all of the benefits I have heard from using this ancient clove. It has many uses and I look forward to all of the uses and I am sure I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> Weak Smell to it. Have to use a lot and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils.  Their oils are of the highest quality and absolutely the best prices around.  I could not afford to use essential oils if it weren&#x27;t for Eden&#x27;s Garden.  They have excellent customer service and the oils arrive within a matter of days.  I will only use another company if I need an oil that EG doesn&#x27;t provide.  They are an amazing company and I am a loyal fan.</li>
            <li> Great oil can mix and blend with other oils. Great with olive oil as the main oil and can use it on your skin once you do mix and blend it.</li>
            <li> Good product,works as a antiseptic and mild pain killer for tooth and gum.&lt;br /&gt;  Always see a dentist if problems warrant !</li>
            <li> very good helped me alot will order again.</li>
            <li> Smells really good. I used it in my remineralizing toothpaste recipe. I love that it has a little lid on the inside where I can do the drops from the bottle instead of a separate dropper.</li>
            <li> Awesome,  thanks for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good oil,nice smell and pure</li>
            <li> Edens Garden oils are very pure and burn well in diffusers. The company offers a great assortment of different scents that can be mixed. There are many uses for the essential oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the purpose of easing tooth pain (orjael never worked for me)&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works pretty great! Mix this with a couple Advil and a heating pad and tooth pain is bye bye. Apparently clove has lots of uses so it s worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T GET IT ON YOU :LIPS. Burns like hell.....But i did have very Lana del Rey looking lips for a while. that was cool!</li>
            <li> Use it for thyroid with lemongrass oil and myrrh.  Not sure if it  is working or not.  Still trying it out</li>
            <li> I am experimenting with essential oils. I have 2 dogs and was told dogs do not like the smell of cloves and they will stay away. My dogs it doesn&#x27;t bother them. I added it to water and use to fragrance my home. Smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend and also this seller ships immediately. I think the shipping price is alittle high but the service is great. When you get into this kind of stuff it hard to find.</li>
            <li> Grab this if you keep fish, it&#x27;s great as an anesthetic to help put your fish to sleep if they are sick and need to be humanely put down, or if you just need to apply something to wounds and need them to not be so squirmy. Shake in a jar before hand to mix or it will just separate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really believe in the &amp;#34;healing powers&amp;#34; in essential oils and whatnot, but I love this scent and I am happy with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I received Eden&#x27;s Garden (clary sage, lemon, cinnamon bark, ylang ylang, clove, aphrodisiac synergy blend) as a gift after I expressed interest in learning more about and using essential oils. The oil was shipped with adequate padding to prevent breakage of the glass bottle and came with a 59-page product guide from the company that describes each oil&#x27;s properties and uses along with tips for use and descriptions of assorted blends. It also came with an insert titled &amp;#34;101 Ways to Use Essential Oils&amp;#34; that includes how to use essential oils for home, aroma, health, beauty, kids, emotions, spiritual needs, and travel. I am just beginning to learn about essential oils so I appreciate having both guides. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Love!  Has an aroma similar to Cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Gave it 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t really started using it on a regular basis. The times that I did use it was for pain in a pocket in my gum that didn&#x27;t heal properly after dental surgery. The tissue didn&#x27;t grow back in so I have a hole there. I can&#x27;t take antibiotics. I remember my grandmother using clove oil over 50 years ago for toothaches. I mixed it with toothpaste and brushed in the area of the pocket in my gum. It did somewhat take the aching away. I also want to prevent infection. I think it&#x27;s a product you should keep in your medicine cabinet like you would neosporin or campho-phenique.  Update on clove oil: I&#x27;ve had an opportunity to use this oil for a longer period of time since my first review. It works great for me. Took away my pain and that&#x27;s with me using it only twice a week. Gave it one more star.</li>
            <li> They say this works for toothache, that&#x27;s what I bought it for. Wound up with a raging jaw/mouth infection that was life threatening. So much for the medicinal/anti bacterial properties of this stuff. It stinks to high heaven and tastes terrible. I didn&#x27;t notice it doing a whole lot for the pain either.  Eh. Some love it. I just didn&#x27;t. As for the product itself, and the company that sells it, it comes in a very nice little bottle, with all kinds of literature (and catalog) to get you started with essential oil therapy.  I plan to buy more from them in the future, just clove oil wasn&#x27;t exactly for me. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this with coconut oil in my scent warmer...smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell. Good price. Received quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> All i can say it I love Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils.  thanks</li>
            <li> Works great. Arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> We use this in olive oil as a teething remedy, and it seems to be of good quality! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not quite the fragrance I was hoping for. Wanted more of a cookie smell. This is quite bitter smelling.  Will not buy again for shampoo making.</li>
            <li> Came in on time love it!</li>
            <li> Love these essential oils.  Nice smell</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like cloves! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no clove smell to it- the smell of alcohol is overwhelming. It smells more like turpentine than clove. I&#x27;m comparing this to some clove oil I bought at a drug store (Humco brand), which doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol smell to it. Overall, not happy with these oils- which btw, Amazon will not let you return them because they&#x27;re a &#x27;fire hazard&#x27; due to their alcohol content- yet somehow, they can ship TO customers? So dumb.</li>
            <li> terrific for relieving toothache, or gum pain.</li>
            <li> If you use for aromatherapy, make sure you dilute or cut it with another oil! It&#x27;s got a very strong character. The bottle suggests sweet orange, which I don&#x27;t yet own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is also effective against nausea and other gastro upsets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, although I&#x27;m a little disappointed that the clove smell isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
