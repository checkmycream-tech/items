            <li>i sometimes used it to trim my body hair, and it works great, i recommended to everybody</li>
            <li>This product is great i have used a clipper before</li>
            <li>At the beginning everything was great the clippers cut well, but after a year it hurts when i cut my hair</li>

            <li>it worked great on me...</li>
            <li>it worked great on my dog...</li>
            <li>We have used this clippers four times now and all four times my son proudly proclaimed afterwards, \\&quot;I did not cry!\\&quot;, and he didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Great product for trimming men&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>He pronounced them great and will use them on his head when the time comes.</li>
            <li>the scissors are not that great; however I did not buy this for the scissors.</li>
            <li>Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i look at it as a win.</li>
            <li>This is a great, inexpensive shaver kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, lesson learned, worked great for shaving my head, but keep it away from your roommates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These clippers are fantastic!!!  </li>
            <li>VERY NICE HAIRCUT SET.</li>
            <li>great price and works good</li>
            <li>and successfully it is a breeze.    </li>
            <li>Since I bought it, more than 1 year ago, it has been flawless.</li>
            <li>This is probably the fifth or sixth clipper I&#x27;ve ever purchased (over 25 - 30 years) and it is easily the best.  </li>
            <li>Remington was a good brand I thought.</li>
            <li>My advice is get it &amp; take good care of it.</li>
            <li>I just threw it away and got a good quality clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect a really good quality item in this price range.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is really nice, it trims great and it has attachments for just about anything you want to do to your hair or beard.</li>
            <li>They have always given good service, I hope this Remington lives up to its brethren&#x27;s reliability.    </li>
            <li>I do not look good that way.  </li>
            <li>The 1/8 comb does not fade in too good with the 1/4.</li>
            <li>Good set.</li>
            <li>I have used a Remington before and had good service.  </li>
            <li>though it could be a good investment.</li>
            <li>The product was in good condition.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>So, I got the bright idea of getting this item on sale and doing my own hair.  </li>
            <li>It was powerful with sturdy guide combs and incredibly noisy, but I loved the thing, but can&#x27;t find another one of it.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is pretty much flawless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a disposable product!</li>
            <li>It has a very nice design that is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>There is some really cheap oil on amazon that works just great.    </li>
            <li>and I can honestly tell you I literally cut my own hair once a week.</li>
            <li>Also the metal itself, if exposed, will give you a nice slice.    </li>
            <li>If you need a nice razor to trim or shave your head this is a MUST buy.</li>
            <li>I honestly wish I had a video review for this clipper.</li>
            <li>They are nicely made but tat is a problem.</li>
            <li>I inherited it when my own son was born in the seventies, and have used it ever since.  </li>
            <li>just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have never used or own one before,</li>
            <li>I bought this a while ago to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent service, really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I liked this model as it does not need oil to use.  </li>
            <li>Plenty of cut lengths to choose from and very easy to change lengths.  </li>
            <li>This is a very easy haircut set to use and I like all the attachments that come with it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>$1/yr is OK by me! :)</li>
            <li>A cheap good men&#x27;s hair cut will run you $10-$15 &amp; that is before the tip.</li>
            <li>but i am very happy with the two jobs it did so far.</li>
            <li>You can make a mistake easily and have to get a balled head!</li>
            <li>, I have used this 5 more times with great success</li>
            <li>For those that might use this maybe a couple times a year and clean it out after each use these might be a good choice</li>
            <li>I will admit though that I didn&#x27;t oil the blade after use, I just clean them and call it good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with these clippers for the 2.5 years that I&#x27;ve owned them.  </li>
            <li>For the first year, it worked great.</li>
            <li>Good product, quickly delivered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very complete with plenty of attachments and additions to help you give a good haircut!</li>
            <li>i got a huge kick out of it , but, Hello!</li>
            <li>Given one cut for our two miniatures would cost $80-90 or more, this is a bargain.  </li>
            <li>the others were okay however.</li>
            <li>Everything was ok, and the shiping on time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more robust than some models I&#x27;ve purchased elsewhere</li>
            <li>Enjoy it!</li>
            <li>The guides cost more than the clippers.  </li>
            <li>They do an okay job for the $10 on sale</li>
            <li>Otherwise, go for a unit with better made accessories.</li>
            <li>I have used it more then a couple times with no problems at all.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use lubricating oil before &amp; after each use.</li>
            <li>I cannot say how this shaver would work for haircuts, but I can&#x27;t imagine it would be any better.</li>
            <li>Spend more money for a better shaver.</li>
            <li>I ended up here because I was looking for replacement combs like many others.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the fact that it does not need to be oiled.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;reduced vibration\\&quot; also becomes nullified if you use them more than 8 or 9 times.</li>
            <li>I love the Remington line of clippers.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the kit.  </li>
            <li>: it feels like it pulls more hair than it cuts (probably a strength issue, not sharpness) and 2:</li>
            <li>However the light weight, and rather ergonomic shape allows me to trim my own hair.  </li>
            <li>So I am returning it in the hopes that I can find one that works better.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it more than lived up to its claims.  </li>
            <li>This product is OK for the price.  </li>
            <li>I have much better service and products from companies on Amazon that I&#x27;ve never even heard of.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  satisfied.</li>
            <li>Everything was ok, and the shiping on time</li>
            <li>and I thought I was already satisfied with it until I lost it in the moving and had to buy another one.</li>
            <li>It was infinitely better when the product is in use.</li>
            <li>on top of its elegant looks.</li>
            <li>love these clippers.</li>
            <li>The attachments that come with the clippers are cheap and flimsy!</li>
            <li>too.:-)</li>
            <li>I will be looking for a better clipper...</li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>Even a nice sized brush to clean off clippings with.</li>
            <li>I had expectations that it would be decent, and at first I was impressed.</li>
            <li>It is nice and quiet unlike some others and cuts great.</li>
            <li>this machine works very good and very quiet and cats your hair  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find an identical replacement and would recommend this product in a heartbeat, price is right too!</li>
            <li>Overall an incredible product.</li>
            <li>I have been using my old remington haircut set for 10 year with great result.</li>
            <li>If you really want a good quality hair clipper buy oster.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much :) see ya!</li>
            <li>User friendly and safe.  </li>
            <li>i WAS TRULY AMAZED AT HOW EASY IT WAS TO USE.</li>
            <li>So buying this product was an easy decision to make.</li>
            <li>When I put the clippers to my head using one of the guide combs, I noticed two things very quickly.</li>
            <li>just cut your hair very quickly, and you can hear the motor struggling to cut the hair.    </li>
            <li>Heat from the blades easily is felt on your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is despite the fact that the screws can be easily removed on the blades, allowing for replacement.</li>
            <li>works ok if your cheap but wont cut as precise and smooth as an andis</li>
            <li>it pulls hair and you have to go back and forth on your head like 40 minutes to get a good cut, If you want to save money go for something better, I am thinking about throwing them away and getting one with better quality.</li>
            <li>Just take care of it &amp; it should do fine.</li>
            <li>You can easily buy some cheap lubricating oil onamazon.</li>
            <li>then its fine...</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t find our super glue!  </li>
            <li>I already own this set and would not have bought a second if I wasn&#x27;t really happy with the first.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair, and the cord can be a nuisance when directing certain angle cuts.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and \\&quot;whisper\\&quot; quiet, unlike any I&#x27;ve experienced.  </li>
            <li>The blades move freely, side to side, and never felt sharper.    </li>
            <li>I got two day S/H for free.</li>
            <li>If you want a cheap hair cutter that works.</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer for my face and chest hair primarily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cheap -</li>
            <li>And do not believe the maintenance free pitch.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made and pulls on the hair.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I use the clippers without any guards, and it has always given me an even haircut.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy ripping your hair out rather than trimming it, this set is for you.  </li>
            <li>It does not work as smooth as the one I brought from Japan, but it works.  </li>
            <li>and I need a more powerful clipper, like the Wahl Senior.     </li>
            <li>The sectioning clips are cheap as could be.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>That Oster is a leftover from my own Mom who got it to cut my own hair back in the fifties.</li>
            <li>These hair clippers would certainly be able to cut right through hair (time-consumingly) without scaring the animal getting the haircut.    </li>
            <li>Very stable, very accurate cut, very safe and very durable.</li>
            <li>I recommend this kit, it is very useful.</li>
            <li>Huge pain to clean out the clippers themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I found was that there was a significant amount of friction that increased after the sharpening in which I had to compensate with veggie oil.</li>
            <li>I am told it will take many brownies to make up for the pain (the son not the husband he - being married for 25 years -</li>
            <li>I compared the guides from my original razor and the now one</li>
            <li>I cant believe i own 2 brand new remington hair trimmers.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I didn&#x27;t expect a master-series set of blades, but these are more Fischer Price than any of the 4 different sets of clippers I own.    </li>
            <li>But there is literally no way to clean hair out of it.</li>
            <li>brush to clean it, etc.</li>
            <li>Clean cuts and after you have used it twice</li>
            <li>You will be reasonably happy with your final haircut if you just take you time and read the directions first on how to give yourself a haircut from the enclosed brochure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li>I guess it is true that you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li>That will set you back a good amount of money.    </li>
            <li>the thing that prompted me to write a review is the ultimate-in-lameness \\&quot;full length cape\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I now have a trimmer that&#x27;s only good for doing hair Vin Diesel style.  </li>
            <li>I really doubt you can get a better clipper for this price.</li>
            <li>Unless you can really work some magic with fading.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li>Again, you have to take time for it to get all the hair to cut, but not a bad home product if you can persevere with it.</li>
            <li>Things went fairly smoothly with it right up to the 5 year mark.</li>
            <li>This unit does the job very nicely, if one isn&#x27;t careful however the guide shields can be a bit tricky to get attached.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, Great buy.</li>
            <li>Only good for the first 5-10 times; after that, you will get your hair pulled away from your head!</li>
            <li>it gave my husband a fine crew cut and with that first cut it paid for itself.</li>
            <li>If the comb breaks there is always super glue.</li>
            <li>Does your barber cut it that quickly?</li>
            <li>I seem to remember Remington being a class brand - OK mainly from ads in the 70s and 80s but still a household name</li>
            <li>But for the price I think it&#x27;s worthy.</li>
            <li>Lucky?  </li>
            <li>it pulls hair and heats up quick it belong on the trash</li>
            <li>es la mejor maquina que he comprado una marca excelente el vendedor super responsdable y con entrega segura en un minimo de tiempo</li>
            <li>The very first thing I noticed after plugging it in and powering it up was the noise, or lack thereof.</li>
            <li>Its pretty cheaply made...</li>
            <li>very good precision, the motor is not too strong, to pass from long hair to very short</li>
            <li>Like I said, the only thing I really didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t come with its own lubricating oil, which is really needed in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Be ready to easily spend $100</li>
            <li>First off the \\&quot;lube for life\\&quot; blades are complete bull, after 8 or 9 uses they started catching on my hair</li>
            <li>It gets hot very fast and jams easily.</li>
            <li>so much  !!</li>
            <li>The clipper unit itself has been very good with my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>THAT MUCH FOR CLIPPERS.A truly fine product.</li>
            <li>You absolutely need to have huge time on your hands and a patient partner who would agree to do this.</li>
            <li>Replaced my old clippers with this kit and it comes with many accessories.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t understand why some people complaint about this product, it is a great product,it has all the things that like every barbers has, all size and numbers, and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for &amp; I think this gives your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a good and reliable haircut set.</li>
            <li>I liked this purchase, it comes with several accessories, it does its work</li>
            <li>Kind of a big oversight.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine who has always cut/clipped his own hair recently had</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d return it too the manufacturer, but I&#x27;d have to pay for shipping, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it, just to get a replacement.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the whole purchase process and the success of the whole operation</li>
            <li>The second time we used it, it start pulling on the hair and catching because it wasn&#x27;t cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Guides breaking: While this makes sense if you force everything onto the main cutter blade and expect the guide to be perfect for the way you use the trimmer, really it makes little sense.</li>
            <li>Just a fluke, right?  </li>
            <li>If you get it &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>getting it put right.  </li>
            <li>(though luckily I am not in a position that I absolutely need to be substituting my haircuts at Great Clips with this).</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a namby-pamby set of clippers that still gets the job done perfectly well if you don&#x27;t cut hair military fast.</li>
            <li>Normally, this would not be a huge deal, except that the owner&#x27;s manual states that you can contact customer service for a quote for replacement blades.</li>
            <li>My advice is to pay a little more for something with a better quality</li>
            <li>Will be ordering the 2 new comb guides cheaply (&lt; $10 w/ shipping).  </li>
            <li>I have cut my own hair for the past 14 years and I&#x27;ve never had a set of clippers break so easily.  </li>
            <li>I doubt very much.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>If you did break them you can put some glue on them with a hot glue gun and that will hold them in place.  </li>
            <li>and it never failed or got clogged.</li>
            <li>The first shave started to pull the hair out and his scalp was bleeding.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe someone inspected this product and thought that it was actually sell able.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to dish out the extra 30 or 40 dollars for a machine that can handle the load.</li>
            <li>I have used one my neighbor had and for the price this one so far is fantastic.</li>
            <li>was pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>Being married for 25 years  I just told him to shut up and stop being a wimp -</li>
            <li>I threw this thing off the balcony immediately after using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>and it is not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>It get soooooo hot..........</li>
            <li>However, after exactly 9 months, it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to with plenty of attachments.</li>
            <li>However, after I order this one I found one exactly like it in K-Mart a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>These clippers could not even make 4 passes through the first head it was used on.</li>
            <li>Not the most powerful but if you keep your really hair short and cut it every1-2 weeks you shouldn&#x27;t have an issue.</li>
            <li>you have to use many different size, you have to do it step by step,otherwise is pulling your hair</li>
            <li>The horrendous customer service retraction is what prevents me from rating this any higher.</li>
            <li>Clippers are much quieter than previous models, but efficiency is just as good.  </li>
            <li>It worked great the first couple of times, but even though I oiled the blades, they went dull fast  </li>
            <li>Sure the first time it may be fine, even the second, third, forth and fifth</li>
            <li>Only the cord at the point of joing machine worn out, I enjoyed that so much.</li>
            <li>It required some vegetable oil to keep it lubed up and running smoothly, but no other complaints.</li>
            <li>Now the positive.</li>
            <li>Since I could not find the previous brand, I opted for Remington HC 8017B due to its many good features as published.</li>
            <li>make sure you put one of those plastic combs on the trimmer before you use it because it is sharp and it is powerful.</li>
            <li>I will probably rarely to never use the attachments but there nice to have with it</li>
            <li>By the time I start my lining the blades are hot and irriate my skin, so with these clippers I line first then cut the main area.</li>
            <li>I have an old pair of \\&quot;cheapies\\&quot; that have lasted me a long time that cost about the same, but they are great.    </li>
            <li>great cutting, sooooo easy on the hand- virtually no vibration.</li>
            <li>and everything fits nicely in the little box.</li>
            <li>Spend the money to get a decent clippers, and in the long run you will be better off.</li>
            <li>If you go gentle (or if you have someone who can cut your hair gently), then there aren&#x27;t any real problems with this.</li>
            <li>My wife cuts my hair very often and this machine is smooth, silent and practical.</li>
            <li>Huge pain putting the clippers back together after cleaning.</li>
            <li>If you go to fast you end up pulling your hair out.    </li>
            <li>Highly recomended!</li>
            <li>Performance is better than expected.</li>
            <li>Normally, I would cut my hair first then afterwards line up the edges.</li>
            <li>We all ready owned one and we really like the way it cut hair .</li>
            <li>Be ready to spend $50 just for a oster clippers alone.</li>
            <li>Plus if I really want the product fast.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I can just wait an extra day &amp; get S/H free.</li>
            <li>I bought mine 2 yrs ago because I was intrigued by the whole maintenance-free deal.  </li>
            <li>Very  usefull,  </li>
            <li>Smooth, quiet and efficient.  </li>
            <li>I primarily use the 1/8 &amp; 1/4 inch attachments which only had three to four extensions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the hair is too much for the motor.</li>
            <li>Just plug it  and is ready for the job.</li>
            <li>thanks and congratulations.</li>
            <li>They worked very well; however, they&#x27;re worn out.</li>
            <li>are my list of reason why i dislike it so much...</li>
            <li>/&gt;You are better off spending a few extra bucks and getting yourself a better quality pair of hair clippers.</li>
            <li>Works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>Overall not bad, but the blade gets really hot after about a minute of operation.</li>
            <li>The actual \\&quot;buzzer\\&quot; is very powerful.</li>
            <li>I tried these a couple of times but we finally decided to bite the bullet and buy a different set (Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit - used yesterday for the first time - so much better!)</li>
            <li>They fell apart the first time I used them, luckily I&#x27;ve had clippers before and knew how to put em back together.</li>
            <li>I think it needs a little more motor power - a little more oomph!</li>
            <li>It cuts clean, evenly, quietly.  </li>
            <li>First few cuts seems ok.</li>
            <li>No hard feeling!</li>
            <li>This is a perfect example of a company that&#x27;s only survived this long on their Past Reputation;    REMINGTON &#x3D;</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was on my 7 year old son, and he was screaming in pain.</li>
            <li>I doubt it was ever used before, because of the whole kit&#x27;s NEW appearance, but, the shavings make me think otherwise.</li>
            <li>The teeth on this particular model will cut poodle hair.  </li>
            <li>The main problem I found in my case was at one point the hair was literally being pulled out.</li>
            <li>OK, so I bought a Newer MORE EXPENSIVE Model, with SELF SHARPENING BLADES...     </li>
            <li>I ever thought it was able to cover all my body, so that, hair will only fall on the ground finally.</li>
            <li>That Remington continued to sell this model without remedying the flaw should be adequate warning to potential customers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m replacing it now only because I&#x27;ve finally dropped it one too many times.  </li>
            <li>It would pull his hair out and he became so scared of home cuts I would only be able to do one side of his hair and then head to the hair salon the next day to finish his cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent clipper to start barbering.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the complaints on attachments breaking as I only use the shortest setting with no guide but the blades stay sharp and cut clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>WARNING: don&#x27;t call their &#x27;Customer Service&#x27; if you have high blood pressure</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and if my clippers ever do wear out I will not even consider another brand beside Remington.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need new blades soon, but REMINGTON wants you to buy a new unit, so REMINGTON DOES NOT SELL NEW BLADES.      </li>
            <li>heavier duty machine than i expected for the money, but the accessories are definitel;y cheap.</li>
            <li>I really like the electric trimmer and still have my old one I bought four years ago.</li>
            <li>He did a few more clips and it continued to rip the hair out.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a rare occasion that they actually clip some hair.</li>
            <li>The extra cost is worth it &amp; will prolong the life of the product.</li>
            <li>If you normally go to a stylist for a hair cut, this is not for you, but if you usea barber to do a 6/4, 4/2, crew cut, etc.</li>
            <li>Obviously not intended for professional use and wear, but for the once a week trim it should last many years.</li>
            <li>a few times before I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li>I am especially thankful for the light weight, as I am an older fellow with only one truly functional arm.  </li>
            <li>I only marked 3 stars because I cut my own hair, CORDLESS is a plus, Ceramic blades (HC 363 model) are better than metal blades, and the blade heat after 10 or mintues is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Even if it only worked a few times (Works way more then that, if taken care of) it pays for itself in savings the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>Brand new packaging and sealed.</li>
            <li>Every piece of this looks new.</li>
            <li>It looks brand new (as listed)</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I am going to shop for a new clipper instead.  </li>
            <li>and so I had to buy a new pair - so</li>
            <li>Shopping for a new one now.</li>
            <li>After moving to the US I had to get a new set that will work on 110V</li>
            <li>We decided it was about time to get a new one, and my husband picked this set up.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m going to look for something new.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one today for $5.00.  </li>
            <li>Instead of replacing the blades, I think I&#x27;ll be looking for a new razor that&#x27;s not a Remington.</li>
            <li>complete waste of money - upgrade to a better unit or pay a barber!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have been warned - my family have now turned against me and my son has put the shears in the recycling box.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s old haircut kit was missing many pieces and had the tendency to \\&quot;bite\\&quot; at your neck.  </li>
            <li>well using this clippers is the exact opposite.  </li>
            <li>like I&#x27;d stuck him with a red hot poker saying/screaming \\&quot;they pull!\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The combs - the parts that come with the clipper in general - are absolute trash.  </li>
            <li>and they are exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, these clippers give a clean cut, are very quiet, and have enough assesories included.</li>
            <li>The cut is a clean one; I&#x27;ve never had my hair get caught in the blades as I have with other models.</li>
            <li>These cutters are cheaply put together and the plastic \\&quot;bites\\&quot; into your skin with very sharp edges.</li>
            <li>Very little vibration, but a very shard and smooth cut.  </li>
            <li>It took way to long to make it look right again.</li>
            <li>I trimmed my beard and hair and it worked okay, not great the first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years with no problems, just that a little tab on the 3/4 comb broke off, still clips on fine tho.</li>
            <li>The blades do get dull, no surprise there, but honestly it literally just needs a simple sharpening.</li>
            <li>My old ones yanked my hair out of my head.</li>
            <li>As far as the brittle combs.</li>
            <li>The hair cutter is quieter than my old one, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li>I got this set of hair clippers because my old one broke after being dropped.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old had freaked out every time I took him to get his hair cut and ever freaked out when I tried to clip it myself.  </li>
            <li>I shave my husbands head every couple of weeks and my old clippers were just getting worn out.  </li>
            <li>Horrid product, we had an old Remington set which lasted us 5 years.  </li>
            <li>: I did not buy these clippers from amazon, but I included 2 pictures to prove I own the razor to back up this negative review.)</li>
            <li>While this is not intended to be a dog cutter, it works on poodle hair which is different then other dog hair - more like human hair.  </li>
            <li>I mean you cannot use this product to do hair cuts in more than two persons in a row.</li>
            <li>Since I had success with my previous pair, I decided to buy a new set.</li>
            <li>This was purchased as a replacement for the exact same model I have used for the past three or four years - the original clippers still worked but the blades were becoming dull.  </li>
            <li>We have tried other cutters without success.  </li>
            <li>Not as smooth as previous clippers I have bought of the same brand.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t force them when they can be snapped on with slight pressure and removed with light pressure by the tab opposite the guide</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cool, takes a long time to heat up maybe around or more than 30 minutes of non stop cutting.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it is a pain, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for a cheap razor that&#x27;s lasted me years.</li>
            <li>my hair is very fine and thin.</li>
            <li>The poor kid honestly looks like I cut it with the kitchen scissors, which I did because the scissors in the kit are as blunt as the actual shears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because we loved the old Remington set, we purchase this one, what a disappointment.  </li>
            <li>This one gets a lower grade mark from me than my HC 363 because after 10-15 minutes of use, the blades become HOT due to the self sharping feature.</li>
            <li>It comes with a great sort of accessories but the main unit is really worthless.  </li>
            <li>I have to remove the blades before every use, clear the hair, oil the blades, then screw it back together.</li>
            <li>Hit does work,but just barely.</li>
            <li>a couple of weeks later I come to cut my 10 year old son&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;He wanted some as close as possible to the old ones and chose these this model from the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old set finally bit the dust.....</li>
            <li>The blades went dull very quickly, and the length of time required jumped to almost (but not quite) double.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as well or robustly constructed as my old Oster clipper, but if it lasts half as long it will be worth twice the price.    </li>
            <li>Nice presentation, hard black plastic case, several guides combs, scissors,</li>
            <li>The floxite hand mirror I purchased to see the back of my head seems much easier than the other two I tried.</li>
            <li>That might be the reason some people complain of the blades going dull so quickly.</li>
            <li>The blades dull really quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also when you first get used to cutting your own hair trim only part of the hair length off, this allows for trying it out and will let you fix it in case you screw up a little on the length somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s their fault they can&#x27;t read directions), and the guards are measured with actual measurements in 1/8ths of an inch, not flat numbers like 0, 1, 2, etc.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, most of these bad reviews are customers thinking what they bought was a Ferrari, for the price of a Smart Car.</li>

            <li> We have used this clippers four times now and all four times my son proudly proclaimed afterwards, \\&quot;I did not cry!\\&quot;, and he didn&#x27;t.  </li>

            <li> i look at it as a win.</li>
            <li> This is a great, inexpensive shaver kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, lesson learned, worked great for shaving my head, but keep it away from your roommates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These clippers are fantastic!!!  </li>
            <li> VERY NICE HAIRCUT SET.</li>
            <li> great price and works good</li>
            <li> and successfully it is a breeze.    </li>
            <li> Since I bought it, more than 1 year ago, it has been flawless.</li>
            <li> This is probably the fifth or sixth clipper I&#x27;ve ever purchased (over 25 - 30 years) and it is easily the best.  </li>
            <li> Remington was a good brand I thought.</li>
            <li> My advice is get it &amp; take good care of it.</li>
            <li> I just threw it away and got a good quality clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect a really good quality item in this price range.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is really nice, it trims great and it has attachments for just about anything you want to do to your hair or beard.</li>
            <li> They have always given good service, I hope this Remington lives up to its brethren&#x27;s reliability.    </li>
            <li> I do not look good that way.  </li>
            <li> The 1/8 comb does not fade in too good with the 1/4.</li>
            <li> Good set.</li>
            <li> I have used a Remington before and had good service.  </li>
            <li> though it could be a good investment.</li>
            <li> The product was in good condition.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> So, I got the bright idea of getting this item on sale and doing my own hair.  </li>
            <li> It was powerful with sturdy guide combs and incredibly noisy, but I loved the thing, but can&#x27;t find another one of it.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is pretty much flawless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a disposable product!</li>
            <li> It has a very nice design that is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> There is some really cheap oil on amazon that works just great.    </li>
            <li> and I can honestly tell you I literally cut my own hair once a week.</li>
            <li> Also the metal itself, if exposed, will give you a nice slice.    </li>
            <li> If you need a nice razor to trim or shave your head this is a MUST buy.</li>
            <li> I honestly wish I had a video review for this clipper.</li>
            <li> They are nicely made but tat is a problem.</li>
            <li> I inherited it when my own son was born in the seventies, and have used it ever since.  </li>
            <li> just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have never used or own one before,</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Excellent service, really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I liked this model as it does not need oil to use.  </li>
            <li> Plenty of cut lengths to choose from and very easy to change lengths.  </li>
            <li> This is a very easy haircut set to use and I like all the attachments that come with it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> $1/yr is OK by me! :)</li>
            <li> A cheap good men&#x27;s hair cut will run you $10-$15 &amp; that is before the tip.</li>
            <li> but i am very happy with the two jobs it did so far.</li>
            <li> You can make a mistake easily and have to get a balled head!</li>
            <li> , I have used this 5 more times with great success</li>
            <li> For those that might use this maybe a couple times a year and clean it out after each use these might be a good choice</li>
            <li> I will admit though that I didn&#x27;t oil the blade after use, I just clean them and call it good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with these clippers for the 2.5 years that I&#x27;ve owned them.  </li>
            <li> For the first year, it worked great.</li>
            <li> Good product, quickly delivered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very complete with plenty of attachments and additions to help you give a good haircut!</li>
            <li> i got a huge kick out of it , but, Hello!</li>
            <li> Given one cut for our two miniatures would cost $80-90 or more, this is a bargain.  </li>
            <li> the others were okay however.</li>
            <li> Everything was ok, and the shiping on time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more robust than some models I&#x27;ve purchased elsewhere</li>
            <li> Enjoy it!</li>
            <li> The guides cost more than the clippers.  </li>
            <li> They do an okay job for the $10 on sale</li>
            <li> Otherwise, go for a unit with better made accessories.</li>
            <li> I have used it more then a couple times with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use lubricating oil before &amp; after each use.</li>
            <li> I cannot say how this shaver would work for haircuts, but I can&#x27;t imagine it would be any better.</li>
            <li> Spend more money for a better shaver.</li>
            <li> I ended up here because I was looking for replacement combs like many others.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the fact that it does not need to be oiled.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;reduced vibration\\&quot; also becomes nullified if you use them more than 8 or 9 times.</li>
            <li> I love the Remington line of clippers.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the kit.  </li>
            <li> : it feels like it pulls more hair than it cuts (probably a strength issue, not sharpness) and 2:</li>
            <li> However the light weight, and rather ergonomic shape allows me to trim my own hair.  </li>
            <li> So I am returning it in the hopes that I can find one that works better.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it more than lived up to its claims.  </li>
            <li> This product is OK for the price.  </li>
            <li> I have much better service and products from companies on Amazon that I&#x27;ve never even heard of.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  satisfied.</li>
            <li> Everything was ok, and the shiping on time</li>
            <li> and I thought I was already satisfied with it until I lost it in the moving and had to buy another one.</li>
            <li> It was infinitely better when the product is in use.</li>
            <li> on top of its elegant looks.</li>
            <li> love these clippers.</li>
            <li> The attachments that come with the clippers are cheap and flimsy!</li>
            <li> too.:-)</li>
            <li> I will be looking for a better clipper...</li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Even a nice sized brush to clean off clippings with.</li>
            <li> I had expectations that it would be decent, and at first I was impressed.</li>
            <li> It is nice and quiet unlike some others and cuts great.</li>
            <li> this machine works very good and very quiet and cats your hair  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to find an identical replacement and would recommend this product in a heartbeat, price is right too!</li>
            <li> Overall an incredible product.</li>
            <li> I have been using my old remington haircut set for 10 year with great result.</li>
            <li> If you really want a good quality hair clipper buy oster.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much :) see ya!</li>
            <li> User friendly and safe.  </li>
            <li> i WAS TRULY AMAZED AT HOW EASY IT WAS TO USE.</li>
            <li> So buying this product was an easy decision to make.</li>
            <li> When I put the clippers to my head using one of the guide combs, I noticed two things very quickly.</li>
            <li> just cut your hair very quickly, and you can hear the motor struggling to cut the hair.    </li>
            <li> Heat from the blades easily is felt on your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is despite the fact that the screws can be easily removed on the blades, allowing for replacement.</li>
            <li> works ok if your cheap but wont cut as precise and smooth as an andis</li>
            <li> it pulls hair and you have to go back and forth on your head like 40 minutes to get a good cut, If you want to save money go for something better, I am thinking about throwing them away and getting one with better quality.</li>
            <li> Just take care of it &amp; it should do fine.</li>
            <li> You can easily buy some cheap lubricating oil onamazon.</li>
            <li> then its fine...</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t find our super glue!  </li>
            <li> I already own this set and would not have bought a second if I wasn&#x27;t really happy with the first.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair, and the cord can be a nuisance when directing certain angle cuts.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and \\&quot;whisper\\&quot; quiet, unlike any I&#x27;ve experienced.  </li>
            <li> The blades move freely, side to side, and never felt sharper.    </li>
            <li> I got two day S/H for free.</li>
            <li> If you want a cheap hair cutter that works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for my face and chest hair primarily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cheap -</li>
            <li> And do not believe the maintenance free pitch.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made and pulls on the hair.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I use the clippers without any guards, and it has always given me an even haircut.  </li>
            <li> If you enjoy ripping your hair out rather than trimming it, this set is for you.  </li>
            <li> It does not work as smooth as the one I brought from Japan, but it works.  </li>
            <li> and I need a more powerful clipper, like the Wahl Senior.     </li>
            <li> The sectioning clips are cheap as could be.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> That Oster is a leftover from my own Mom who got it to cut my own hair back in the fifties.</li>
            <li> These hair clippers would certainly be able to cut right through hair (time-consumingly) without scaring the animal getting the haircut.    </li>
            <li> Very stable, very accurate cut, very safe and very durable.</li>
            <li> I recommend this kit, it is very useful.</li>
            <li> Huge pain to clean out the clippers themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I found was that there was a significant amount of friction that increased after the sharpening in which I had to compensate with veggie oil.</li>
            <li> I am told it will take many brownies to make up for the pain (the son not the husband he - being married for 25 years -</li>
            <li> I compared the guides from my original razor and the now one</li>
            <li> I cant believe i own 2 brand new remington hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I didn&#x27;t expect a master-series set of blades, but these are more Fischer Price than any of the 4 different sets of clippers I own.    </li>
            <li> But there is literally no way to clean hair out of it.</li>
            <li> brush to clean it, etc.</li>
            <li> Clean cuts and after you have used it twice</li>
            <li> You will be reasonably happy with your final haircut if you just take you time and read the directions first on how to give yourself a haircut from the enclosed brochure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> I guess it is true that you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li> That will set you back a good amount of money.    </li>
            <li> the thing that prompted me to write a review is the ultimate-in-lameness \\&quot;full length cape\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I now have a trimmer that&#x27;s only good for doing hair Vin Diesel style.  </li>
            <li> I really doubt you can get a better clipper for this price.</li>
            <li> Unless you can really work some magic with fading.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li> Again, you have to take time for it to get all the hair to cut, but not a bad home product if you can persevere with it.</li>
            <li> Things went fairly smoothly with it right up to the 5 year mark.</li>
            <li> This unit does the job very nicely, if one isn&#x27;t careful however the guide shields can be a bit tricky to get attached.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, Great buy.</li>
            <li> Only good for the first 5-10 times; after that, you will get your hair pulled away from your head!</li>
            <li> it gave my husband a fine crew cut and with that first cut it paid for itself.</li>
            <li> If the comb breaks there is always super glue.</li>
            <li> Does your barber cut it that quickly?</li>
            <li> I seem to remember Remington being a class brand - OK mainly from ads in the 70s and 80s but still a household name</li>
            <li> But for the price I think it&#x27;s worthy.</li>
            <li> Lucky?  </li>
            <li> it pulls hair and heats up quick it belong on the trash</li>
            <li> es la mejor maquina que he comprado una marca excelente el vendedor super responsdable y con entrega segura en un minimo de tiempo</li>
            <li> The very first thing I noticed after plugging it in and powering it up was the noise, or lack thereof.</li>
            <li> Its pretty cheaply made...</li>
            <li> very good precision, the motor is not too strong, to pass from long hair to very short</li>
            <li> Like I said, the only thing I really didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t come with its own lubricating oil, which is really needed in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Be ready to easily spend $100</li>
            <li> First off the \\&quot;lube for life\\&quot; blades are complete bull, after 8 or 9 uses they started catching on my hair</li>
            <li> It gets hot very fast and jams easily.</li>
            <li> so much  !!</li>
            <li> The clipper unit itself has been very good with my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> THAT MUCH FOR CLIPPERS.A truly fine product.</li>
            <li> You absolutely need to have huge time on your hands and a patient partner who would agree to do this.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old clippers with this kit and it comes with many accessories.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t understand why some people complaint about this product, it is a great product,it has all the things that like every barbers has, all size and numbers, and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for &amp; I think this gives your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a good and reliable haircut set.</li>
            <li> I liked this purchase, it comes with several accessories, it does its work</li>
            <li> Kind of a big oversight.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who has always cut/clipped his own hair recently had</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d return it too the manufacturer, but I&#x27;d have to pay for shipping, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it, just to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the whole purchase process and the success of the whole operation</li>
            <li> The second time we used it, it start pulling on the hair and catching because it wasn&#x27;t cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Guides breaking: While this makes sense if you force everything onto the main cutter blade and expect the guide to be perfect for the way you use the trimmer, really it makes little sense.</li>
            <li> Just a fluke, right?  </li>
            <li> If you get it &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> getting it put right.  </li>
            <li> (though luckily I am not in a position that I absolutely need to be substituting my haircuts at Great Clips with this).</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a namby-pamby set of clippers that still gets the job done perfectly well if you don&#x27;t cut hair military fast.</li>
            <li> Normally, this would not be a huge deal, except that the owner&#x27;s manual states that you can contact customer service for a quote for replacement blades.</li>
            <li> My advice is to pay a little more for something with a better quality</li>
            <li> Will be ordering the 2 new comb guides cheaply (&lt; $10 w/ shipping).  </li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for the past 14 years and I&#x27;ve never had a set of clippers break so easily.  </li>
            <li> I doubt very much.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> If you did break them you can put some glue on them with a hot glue gun and that will hold them in place.  </li>
            <li> and it never failed or got clogged.</li>
            <li> The first shave started to pull the hair out and his scalp was bleeding.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe someone inspected this product and thought that it was actually sell able.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better to dish out the extra 30 or 40 dollars for a machine that can handle the load.</li>
            <li> I have used one my neighbor had and for the price this one so far is fantastic.</li>
            <li> was pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> Being married for 25 years  I just told him to shut up and stop being a wimp -</li>
            <li> I threw this thing off the balcony immediately after using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> and it is not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> It get soooooo hot..........</li>
            <li> However, after exactly 9 months, it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to with plenty of attachments.</li>
            <li> However, after I order this one I found one exactly like it in K-Mart a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> These clippers could not even make 4 passes through the first head it was used on.</li>
            <li> Not the most powerful but if you keep your really hair short and cut it every1-2 weeks you shouldn&#x27;t have an issue.</li>
            <li> you have to use many different size, you have to do it step by step,otherwise is pulling your hair</li>
            <li> The horrendous customer service retraction is what prevents me from rating this any higher.</li>
            <li> Clippers are much quieter than previous models, but efficiency is just as good.  </li>
            <li> It worked great the first couple of times, but even though I oiled the blades, they went dull fast  </li>
            <li> Sure the first time it may be fine, even the second, third, forth and fifth</li>
            <li> Only the cord at the point of joing machine worn out, I enjoyed that so much.</li>
            <li> It required some vegetable oil to keep it lubed up and running smoothly, but no other complaints.</li>
            <li> Now the positive.</li>
            <li> Since I could not find the previous brand, I opted for Remington HC 8017B due to its many good features as published.</li>
            <li> make sure you put one of those plastic combs on the trimmer before you use it because it is sharp and it is powerful.</li>
            <li> I will probably rarely to never use the attachments but there nice to have with it</li>
            <li> By the time I start my lining the blades are hot and irriate my skin, so with these clippers I line first then cut the main area.</li>
            <li> I have an old pair of \\&quot;cheapies\\&quot; that have lasted me a long time that cost about the same, but they are great.    </li>
            <li> great cutting, sooooo easy on the hand- virtually no vibration.</li>
            <li> and everything fits nicely in the little box.</li>
            <li> Spend the money to get a decent clippers, and in the long run you will be better off.</li>
            <li> If you go gentle (or if you have someone who can cut your hair gently), then there aren&#x27;t any real problems with this.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair very often and this machine is smooth, silent and practical.</li>
            <li> Huge pain putting the clippers back together after cleaning.</li>
            <li> If you go to fast you end up pulling your hair out.    </li>
            <li> Highly recomended!</li>
            <li> Performance is better than expected.</li>
            <li> Normally, I would cut my hair first then afterwards line up the edges.</li>
            <li> We all ready owned one and we really like the way it cut hair .</li>
            <li> Be ready to spend $50 just for a oster clippers alone.</li>
            <li> Plus if I really want the product fast.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I can just wait an extra day &amp; get S/H free.</li>
            <li> I bought mine 2 yrs ago because I was intrigued by the whole maintenance-free deal.  </li>
            <li> Very  usefull,  </li>
            <li> Smooth, quiet and efficient.  </li>
            <li> I primarily use the 1/8 &amp; 1/4 inch attachments which only had three to four extensions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the hair is too much for the motor.</li>
            <li> Just plug it  and is ready for the job.</li>
            <li> thanks and congratulations.</li>
            <li> They worked very well; however, they&#x27;re worn out.</li>
            <li> are my list of reason why i dislike it so much...</li>
            <li> /&gt;You are better off spending a few extra bucks and getting yourself a better quality pair of hair clippers.</li>
            <li> Works really well for me.  </li>
            <li> Overall not bad, but the blade gets really hot after about a minute of operation.</li>
            <li> The actual \\&quot;buzzer\\&quot; is very powerful.</li>
            <li> I tried these a couple of times but we finally decided to bite the bullet and buy a different set (Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit - used yesterday for the first time - so much better!)</li>
            <li> They fell apart the first time I used them, luckily I&#x27;ve had clippers before and knew how to put em back together.</li>
            <li> I think it needs a little more motor power - a little more oomph!</li>
            <li> It cuts clean, evenly, quietly.  </li>
            <li> First few cuts seems ok.</li>
            <li> No hard feeling!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect example of a company that&#x27;s only survived this long on their Past Reputation;    REMINGTON &#x3D;</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was on my 7 year old son, and he was screaming in pain.</li>
            <li> I doubt it was ever used before, because of the whole kit&#x27;s NEW appearance, but, the shavings make me think otherwise.</li>
            <li> The teeth on this particular model will cut poodle hair.  </li>
            <li> The main problem I found in my case was at one point the hair was literally being pulled out.</li>
            <li> OK, so I bought a Newer MORE EXPENSIVE Model, with SELF SHARPENING BLADES...     </li>
            <li> I ever thought it was able to cover all my body, so that, hair will only fall on the ground finally.</li>
            <li> That Remington continued to sell this model without remedying the flaw should be adequate warning to potential customers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing it now only because I&#x27;ve finally dropped it one too many times.  </li>
            <li> It would pull his hair out and he became so scared of home cuts I would only be able to do one side of his hair and then head to the hair salon the next day to finish his cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent clipper to start barbering.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the complaints on attachments breaking as I only use the shortest setting with no guide but the blades stay sharp and cut clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> WARNING: don&#x27;t call their &#x27;Customer Service&#x27; if you have high blood pressure</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and if my clippers ever do wear out I will not even consider another brand beside Remington.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need new blades soon, but REMINGTON wants you to buy a new unit, so REMINGTON DOES NOT SELL NEW BLADES.      </li>
            <li> heavier duty machine than i expected for the money, but the accessories are definitel;y cheap.</li>
            <li> I really like the electric trimmer and still have my old one I bought four years ago.</li>
            <li> He did a few more clips and it continued to rip the hair out.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a rare occasion that they actually clip some hair.</li>
            <li> The extra cost is worth it &amp; will prolong the life of the product.</li>
            <li> If you normally go to a stylist for a hair cut, this is not for you, but if you usea barber to do a 6/4, 4/2, crew cut, etc.</li>
            <li> Obviously not intended for professional use and wear, but for the once a week trim it should last many years.</li>
            <li> a few times before I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li> I am especially thankful for the light weight, as I am an older fellow with only one truly functional arm.  </li>
            <li> I only marked 3 stars because I cut my own hair, CORDLESS is a plus, Ceramic blades (HC 363 model) are better than metal blades, and the blade heat after 10 or mintues is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Even if it only worked a few times (Works way more then that, if taken care of) it pays for itself in savings the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> Brand new packaging and sealed.</li>
            <li> Every piece of this looks new.</li>
            <li> It looks brand new (as listed)</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I am going to shop for a new clipper instead.  </li>
            <li> and so I had to buy a new pair - so</li>
            <li> Shopping for a new one now.</li>
            <li> After moving to the US I had to get a new set that will work on 110V</li>
            <li> We decided it was about time to get a new one, and my husband picked this set up.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going to look for something new.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one today for $5.00.  </li>
            <li> Instead of replacing the blades, I think I&#x27;ll be looking for a new razor that&#x27;s not a Remington.</li>
            <li> complete waste of money - upgrade to a better unit or pay a barber!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have been warned - my family have now turned against me and my son has put the shears in the recycling box.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s old haircut kit was missing many pieces and had the tendency to \\&quot;bite\\&quot; at your neck.  </li>
            <li> well using this clippers is the exact opposite.  </li>
            <li> like I&#x27;d stuck him with a red hot poker saying/screaming \\&quot;they pull!\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The combs - the parts that come with the clipper in general - are absolute trash.  </li>
            <li> and they are exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, these clippers give a clean cut, are very quiet, and have enough assesories included.</li>
            <li> The cut is a clean one; I&#x27;ve never had my hair get caught in the blades as I have with other models.</li>
            <li> These cutters are cheaply put together and the plastic \\&quot;bites\\&quot; into your skin with very sharp edges.</li>
            <li> Very little vibration, but a very shard and smooth cut.  </li>
            <li> It took way to long to make it look right again.</li>
            <li> I trimmed my beard and hair and it worked okay, not great the first time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years with no problems, just that a little tab on the 3/4 comb broke off, still clips on fine tho.</li>
            <li> The blades do get dull, no surprise there, but honestly it literally just needs a simple sharpening.</li>
            <li> My old ones yanked my hair out of my head.</li>
            <li> As far as the brittle combs.</li>
            <li> The hair cutter is quieter than my old one, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li> I got this set of hair clippers because my old one broke after being dropped.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old had freaked out every time I took him to get his hair cut and ever freaked out when I tried to clip it myself.  </li>
            <li> I shave my husbands head every couple of weeks and my old clippers were just getting worn out.  </li>
            <li> Horrid product, we had an old Remington set which lasted us 5 years.  </li>
            <li> : I did not buy these clippers from amazon, but I included 2 pictures to prove I own the razor to back up this negative review.)</li>
            <li> While this is not intended to be a dog cutter, it works on poodle hair which is different then other dog hair - more like human hair.  </li>
            <li> I mean you cannot use this product to do hair cuts in more than two persons in a row.</li>
            <li> Since I had success with my previous pair, I decided to buy a new set.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a replacement for the exact same model I have used for the past three or four years - the original clippers still worked but the blades were becoming dull.  </li>
            <li> We have tried other cutters without success.  </li>
            <li> Not as smooth as previous clippers I have bought of the same brand.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t force them when they can be snapped on with slight pressure and removed with light pressure by the tab opposite the guide</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cool, takes a long time to heat up maybe around or more than 30 minutes of non stop cutting.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it is a pain, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for a cheap razor that&#x27;s lasted me years.</li>
            <li> my hair is very fine and thin.</li>
            <li> The poor kid honestly looks like I cut it with the kitchen scissors, which I did because the scissors in the kit are as blunt as the actual shears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because we loved the old Remington set, we purchase this one, what a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> This one gets a lower grade mark from me than my HC 363 because after 10-15 minutes of use, the blades become HOT due to the self sharping feature.</li>
            <li> It comes with a great sort of accessories but the main unit is really worthless.  </li>
            <li> I have to remove the blades before every use, clear the hair, oil the blades, then screw it back together.</li>
            <li> Hit does work,but just barely.</li>
            <li> a couple of weeks later I come to cut my 10 year old son&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;He wanted some as close as possible to the old ones and chose these this model from the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old set finally bit the dust.....</li>
            <li> The blades went dull very quickly, and the length of time required jumped to almost (but not quite) double.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as well or robustly constructed as my old Oster clipper, but if it lasts half as long it will be worth twice the price.    </li>
            <li> Nice presentation, hard black plastic case, several guides combs, scissors,</li>
            <li> The floxite hand mirror I purchased to see the back of my head seems much easier than the other two I tried.</li>
            <li> That might be the reason some people complain of the blades going dull so quickly.</li>
            <li> The blades dull really quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also when you first get used to cutting your own hair trim only part of the hair length off, this allows for trying it out and will let you fix it in case you screw up a little on the length somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s their fault they can&#x27;t read directions), and the guards are measured with actual measurements in 1/8ths of an inch, not flat numbers like 0, 1, 2, etc.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, most of these bad reviews are customers thinking what they bought was a Ferrari, for the price of a Smart Car.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it right away, and when I finally did, it was too late to get money back.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get every single hair on the first go round.</li>
            <li> Cut Time: Think about how long the barber or stylist takes to cut your hair properly if you are a guy, 15-20 minutes --not including travel time there and back.</li>
            <li> If you move the clippers through your hair slowly and don&#x27;t press it too firmly onto your head, the guide comb won&#x27;t buckle and the clippers move through easily.</li>
            <li> First off, the negative.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how long it is going to last</li>
            <li> how long I was using this, I got it as a Christmas present because I shave my head</li>
            <li> I got this sucker and it did the job fine - for a few months.</li>
            <li> The clippers are very quiet, I usually cut my hair in the early morning whilst everyone is asleep, BUT the teeth move!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see the relatively low overall score and the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long once i took it apart to clean it never went back the way it was and later stopped cutting all together</li>
            <li> I purchased 1 remmington about 3 years ago that lasted me a long time.  </li>
            <li> the same model razor previously and the only hair guide out of the bunch that came with it that I use broke.  </li>
            <li> I originally got it to shave my head, but now use it for my beard instead (the head shaving was a failed experiment).    </li>
            <li> I have been cutting my son and husband&#x27;s hair for a number of years with the same pair of clippers - just cheap ones can&#x27;t even remember the name of them.  </li>
            <li> but with only 3 heads to clip, I only use them a few times a month.</li>
            <li> I saw most negative reviews seem to address the poor quality attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked for 3 or 4 hair cuts and it started running really slowly, like 1/10 of the normal power...  </li>
            <li> Just wouldn&#x27;t buy in case you loose or break one of the guides.</li>
            <li> I had the SAME Problem, the little tabs that hold the combs in  break after 2-3 uses.  </li>
            <li> Spend a little extra money</li>
            <li> Only breaks were 1/4\\&quot; comb-guide little lock tab after 4-5yrs;</li>
            <li> Rather than making them of a relatively soft (as in flexible) plastic, they made them with a brittle, hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> My old clippers were hard to use from the start.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, but maybe the bad reviews here speak to a lack of consistency in their products.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really justify paying for haircuts when they all look bad regardless of how much I pay.  </li>
            <li> The first cut had no power, and I generally felt like it was barely cutting.  </li>
            <li> I suggest taking you time when installing these guides, and use minimal pressure...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s scalp is red and sore by the time he&#x27;s done trimming Because he has to do 10 passes just to get a serviceable and still patchy and uneven trim.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience, I would have expected this to be a top-rated clipper.  </li>
            <li> Do scissors cut any faster when you drag them through paper</li>
            <li> thinking I&#x27;ll be really careful.  </li>
            <li> But if your gonna carefully use it and dont plan on dropping it any time soon...</li>
            <li> Product was received as expected.  </li>
            <li> Literally, on the 4th pass the clippers jammed and pulled the hair.</li>
            <li> After clearing the blade the next pass wouldn&#x27;t even &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Incredible waste of money.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, there are no real issues.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my own head for almost 20 years now and this is by far the WORST pair of clippers I have ever</li>
            <li> The other ones I&#x27;ve owned have at least lasted a year or two, but this one is only a few months old.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this from his Mom yesterday, his hair was about an inch and a half long.</li>
            <li> I even tried to cut his inch and half long hair with scissors so it was even shorter.</li>
            <li> Well, the first time we used them the blades didn&#x27;t move at all until I shook the unit a little, then they did and my poor husband jumps out of his chair</li>
            <li> Unless their quality has gone down over the years, which I can&#x27;t speak to, the bad reviews almost sound like they&#x27;re talking about a totally different product.</li>
            <li> Read the directions and use common sense, and this razor should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Then, polish with the other side until you can&#x27;t see</li>
            <li> They break off on other brands as well.  </li>
            <li> the other is HC-363 model.</li>
            <li> I have not had the problems that some have had with the combs, but aren&#x27;t combs from other units interchangeable?</li>
            <li> See my other review of that item if you can&#x27;t find one by searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then other units we&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> So I was very careful attaching them, when I used them.</li>
            <li> his very aged Remington clippers die, mid-clip.</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars if Remington sold the hair guides separately because I know that unless we are very careful with it this guide will break too.  </li>
            <li> It does not cut cleanly, it does not have enough power to manage thick hair and is a painfull expreience for both the person cutting the hair and the person receiving a hair cut.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few months back and after a few cuts the 1/2\\&quot; guide broke.  </li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head with these and they never get all the hair on the 1st pass and he has to turn it off after 5-10 mins to let it cool down before he can finish cutting.</li>
            <li> The ones I received had a limited number of &#x60;fingers&#x27; or extensions that extend from the trimmer which can cause an uneven cut.</li>
            <li> I hope this Remington will last at least 4 years as did the other one.</li>
            <li> They do sell replacement blades but not worth it.  </li>
            <li> sucks that one only gets hair 3-4 weeks, else we would have returned, but the return policy was 30 days,</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m switching it for another clipper is because it is getting too slow for my needs</li>
            <li> Put some Veggie Oil on the block, and sand down the interior side of the blade with the course side of the stone until you can visibly see scratches.  </li>
            <li> You are suppose to pull the tab away from the trimmer and down.  </li>
            <li> If you cut other people&#x27;s hair then I would advise you about the blades getting too hot while cutting.</li>
            <li> We used the more expensive pet hair cutters a couple of times but they go dull quickly (as does this one) and are quite expensive and difficult to get sharpened.  </li>
            <li> The clippers were cutting my son&#x27;s hair pretty well, then all of a sudden the blades became really dull.</li>
            <li> Have you ever seen video clips of the military barbers shaving heads in few a few sweeps?</li>
            <li> The whole apparatus us clunky and not very well put together, I am afraid.    </li>
            <li> Even at half an inch the shaver was still ripping out hair.</li>
            <li> That being said, the clippers tended to pull at the hair, and I had to go over the spots previously shaven</li>
            <li> So why does anyone think it will take you less time doing it yourself when you are using mirrors?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tabs on the smaller combs broke off on the second hair cut and now this is useless as they do not sell replacement guides for this set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tabs on the smaller combs broke off on the second hair cut and now this is useless as they do not sell replacement guides for this set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasted a little over a year, but not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to buy another kit a few months (or less) down the road.</li>
            <li> I had my son in tears with the first hair cut until I lubricated the cutting blades.</li>
            <li> It pulls your hair and bogs down as if it were a battery powered device with batteries almost dead.</li>
            <li> lots of little parts to use on this trimmer...</li>
            <li> But this one tugged a little.  </li>
            <li> It keeps steady in your hand without heavy vibration, and it makes hardly a whisper, which makes it incredibly useful pranking drunk friends and cutting animal hair without scaring the pets.</li>
            <li> Quiet and without vibration, but a weak set of clippers.</li>
            <li> Even with my little experience</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for a little over 5 years now.</li>
            <li> I end up cutting my son&#x27;s hair with scissors and the comb we use for grooming the dogs - tomorrow will see us likely at the local barber shop</li>
            <li> it still only has enough life to cut my hair about 4-5 times until it starts to pull and pinch my hair as i&#x27;m cutting it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.</li>
            <li> When I kept my beard a bit longer, I used two of the guides, and a few teeth broke off.</li>
            <li> This worked for a few uses, but now the blades no longer move at all.</li>
            <li> and he ends up crying and flinching like it is an instrument of torture, which in effect it is.  </li>
            <li> After a few months, it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> The attachments have this tiny, thin, plastic tab that is suppose to hold them on to the cutter.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of Remington clippers a few years ago.</li>
            <li> waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made from sharp edged, brittle, hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> At times, I shave through thick hair, sometimes down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed after the first time the little tab broke, but decided what the heck, i&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
            <li> but after a closer inspection, it appears that there are very small black shavings coming out of the blade area</li>
            <li> We bought these to save money and instead ended up wasting money on a useless pair of clippers that can&#x27;t even trim short hair.</li>
            <li> I have no clue how they got past quality control.</li>
            <li> Try putting on an attachment a couple of times, and they all break off, rendering the attachment (and the entire kit) useless.</li>
            <li> the cape is 100% a drawstring black hefty bag!!</li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned, the sides of the smaller clips have broken off and since you can&#x27;t buy replacements, it can be frustrating.  </li>
            <li> hard time to fix in the shaver</li>
            <li> We use these razors  until they are dull then toss them out.  </li>
            <li> It pulls your hair ridiculously hard with no efficient outcome.</li>
            <li> After four haircuts, the blade was dull as can be.</li>
            <li> The biggest complaint I have is that one of the razors was dull when we got it...</li>
            <li> I have had mine for 3 years and use it at least twice a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a negative star if I could.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d return it, but it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> By the third haircut, it felt like it was yanking all my hair out instead of cutting it.  </li>
            <li> Would give negative stars if I was allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean it is the cheapest hair cutter on here.</li>
            <li> they arrived he tried them, removing a small patch of tummy hair!</li>
            <li> I am sad to say this is the once of the worse purchases I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> Every hair guide comb that clips onto the trimmer has very small tabs which break if you look at them cross-eyed.  </li>

            <li> attachments were very poorly packed. The teeth were damaged. hard time to fix in the shaver, The shaver itself is good, bet the durability! I doubt very much.I had one before this that lasted 12 years.Only the cord at the point of joing machine worn out, I enjoyed that so much. Iwas under the impression that it might last for my life. I am going to request the company that they might send me the same one as I had it before. No hard feeling!</li>
            <li> great price and works good</li>
            <li> The teeth on this particular model will cut poodle hair.  We have tried other cutters without success.  While this is not intended to be a dog cutter, it works on poodle hair which is different then other dog hair - more like human hair.  We used the more expensive pet hair cutters a couple of times but they go dull quickly (as does this one) and are quite expensive and difficult to get sharpened.  We use these razors  until they are dull then toss them out.  Given one cut for our two miniatures would cost $80-90 or more, this is a bargain.  The biggest complaint I have is that one of the razors was dull when we got it...the others were okay however.</li>
            <li> Have you ever seen video clips of the military barbers shaving heads in few a few sweeps? well using this clippers is the exact opposite.  After cutting into about an inch of hair, it stops cutting.  If you go to fast you end up pulling your hair out.    Hit does work,but just barely. you just have to really take your time, and even after doing as thorough a job as I could, upon close inspection there are still a few stray hairs that escaped the blades.    If you are only looking to cut your hair once or twice a year and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot, then this might be for you.  However, I would recommend against it.  Spend the money to get a decent clippers, and in the long run you will be better off.</li>
            <li> This is saddest set of clippers I have ever owned. The clippers have no power,when you turn them on you can&#x27;t even tell they are on. They fell apart the first time I used them, luckily I&#x27;ve had clippers before and knew how to put em back together.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, most of these bad reviews are customers thinking what they bought was a Ferrari, for the price of a Smart Car. I have had this for a year now and I can honestly tell you I literally cut my own hair once a week. The blades do get dull, no surprise there, but honestly it literally just needs a simple sharpening. This is how you fix the blades.    Problem: The clipper feels like you are pulling your hair out (very painful, you will know when you get to this point)  Reason: The blades are dull/not moving side to side (they just vibrate)    Solution:  You will need:    1. Home Depot - Bench Stone $4.98    FYI it is in the tools section if you decide to go to the store yourself.  [...]    2. Lubricating oil - Also can be purchased there, but I used vegetable oil that I never use... until today!    Steps:  Remove blades by unscrewing the screws.  Put some Veggie Oil on the block, and sand down the interior side of the blade with the course side of the stone until you can visibly see scratches.  Then, polish with the other side until you can&#x27;t see \\&quot;deep grooves\\&quot;  With a Q-tip, apply some oil to the inner bodies of the blades and place them back onto the clipper.    The main problem I found in my case was at one point the hair was literally being pulled out. I decided to sharpen the blades and place them back. What I found was that there was a significant amount of friction that increased after the sharpening in which I had to compensate with veggie oil. The blades move freely, side to side, and never felt sharper.    Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Everything was ok, and the shiping on time</li>
            <li> Everything works as advertised. I only need 2 or 3 of the attachments but they work well. It&#x27;s more robust than some models I&#x27;ve purchased elsewhere so I expect it to last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> These clippers are fantastic!!!  My old ones yanked my hair out of my head.And they come with tons of attachments.Highly recomended!</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend these clippers to anyone.    For the money, of course, I did not expect a barber shop style cutter.    I have an old pair of \\&quot;cheapies\\&quot; that have lasted me a long time that cost about the same, but they are great.    These cutters are cheaply put together and the plastic \\&quot;bites\\&quot; into your skin with very sharp edges. Also the metal itself, if exposed, will give you a nice slice.    The whole apparatus us clunky and not very well put together, I am afraid.    Like I said, I didn&#x27;t expect a master-series set of blades, but these are more Fischer Price than any of the 4 different sets of clippers I own.    Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Just got the Remington today April 7 that i ordered TWO DAYS ago, April 5! Great Job, Amazon! Brand new packaging and sealed. Every piece of this looks new. The actual \\&quot;buzzer\\&quot; is very powerful. It looks brand new (as listed) but after a closer inspection, it appears that there are very small black shavings coming out of the blade area once i turned it on... I doubt it was ever used before, because of the whole kit&#x27;s NEW appearance, but, the shavings make me think otherwise. So, i \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; one star off for this reason. Other than that, Great buy. Enjoy it!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong at this price.  Performance is better than expected.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need new blades soon, but REMINGTON wants you to buy a new unit, so REMINGTON DOES NOT SELL NEW BLADES.      OK, so I bought a Newer MORE EXPENSIVE Model, with SELF SHARPENING BLADES...     It lasted for FOUR HAIRCUTS- then the motor locked up.  !#@$*&amp;!  Just a fluke, right?  So I called &#x27;customer service&#x27;... WHAT?  THE WARRANTY IS JUST THIRTY DAYS???      WARNING: don&#x27;t call their &#x27;Customer Service&#x27; if you have high blood pressure; they&#x27;ll just hang up on you.  When I tried to contact a supervisor, they were always \\&quot;in a meeting\\&quot; : no wonder they&#x27;re going out of business.  This is a perfect example of a company that&#x27;s only survived this long on their Past Reputation;    REMINGTON &#x3D; poor products and worse service!</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of people complaining about the clips breaking off.  They break off on other brands as well.  You are suppose to pull the tab away from the trimmer and down.  They shouldn&#x27;t break if done properly.  If you did break them you can put some glue on them with a hot glue gun and that will hold them in place.  Atleast for me.  My problem is I lost my comb guide.  I only use one.  None of the others.  They do sell replacement blades but not worth it.  Like $12 for the set after shipping.  That is why you shouldn&#x27;t buy.  The guides cost more than the clippers.  They do an okay job for the $10 on sale I bought it for.  Just wouldn&#x27;t buy in case you loose or break one of the guides.</li>
            <li> i WAS TRULY AMAZED AT HOW EASY IT WAS TO USE. WITH ALL&lt;br /&gt;THE ATTACHEMENT AND WHAT A WONDERFUL PRICE. USUALLY&lt;br /&gt;i SPEND TWICE THAT MUCH FOR CLIPPERS.A truly fine product.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old clippers with this kit and it comes with many accessories. Even a nice sized brush to clean off clippings with. Very quiet operation and no pulling. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple... JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item. I used it once and it worked great. I just used it for the second time and it would even cut short hair. I went to file a return and the return window expired on Jan 31st. I guess it is true that you pay for what you get. Remington was a good brand I thought.</li>
            <li> I have two Remington Clippers... the other is HC-363 model. This one gets a lower grade mark from me than my HC 363 because after 10-15 minutes of use, the blades become HOT due to the self sharping feature. Normally, I would cut my hair first then afterwards line up the edges. By the time I start my lining the blades are hot and irriate my skin, so with these clippers I line first then cut the main area. I cut my own hair, and the cord can be a nuisance when directing certain angle cuts. An CORDLESS feature, such as my HC 363, void this issue. Otherwise, these clippers give a clean cut, are very quiet, and have enough assesories included. I did not break any of my guides though. I suggest taking you time when installing these guides, and use minimal pressure... they are plastic. I only marked 3 stars because I cut my own hair, CORDLESS is a plus, Ceramic blades (HC 363 model) are better than metal blades, and the blade heat after 10 or mintues is uncomfortable. If you cut other people&#x27;s hair then I would advise you about the blades getting too hot while cutting.</li>
            <li> Worst hair clipper I have ever owned. It took over ten minutes to go over my beard one time because it is so underpowered. It was extremely painful as the hair would constantly get caught between the blade and the guard. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I have been buying crap razors from Target or Walmart for years that just break after a few uses. All those were $20 so when i saw $12.99 i thought i would take a chance and I am glad I did! It has a very nice design that is easy to hold and use. It is nice and quiet unlike some others and cuts great. I will probably rarely to never use the attachments but there nice to have with it and everything fits nicely in the little box. If you need a nice razor to trim or shave your head this is a MUST buy. I almost cant wait for my hair to grow just so I can use it again.  Just an update, I have used this 5 more times with great success and I even shaved my Pomeranian for the summer with it and it never failed or got clogged. It still works perfectly!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  For something like plastic blanket or cover in the kit. I ever thought it was able to cover all my body, so that, hair will only fall on the ground finally. However, it is never bigger than an apron, and do not try to use it to keep your body away from hair.</li>
            <li> I honestly wish I had a video review for this clipper. My boyfriend got this from his Mom yesterday, his hair was about an inch and a half long. He&#x27;s been shaving his head for over ten years. He read the instruction booklet, let it run for a minute and started to attempt to shave his head. The first shave started to pull the hair out and his scalp was bleeding. He did a few more clips and it continued to rip the hair out. I even tried to cut his inch and half long hair with scissors so it was even shorter. Even at half an inch the shaver was still ripping out hair. It claims that it is self sharpening and I have never seen a blade so dull! I can&#x27;t believe someone inspected this product and thought that it was actually sell able. My boyfriend&#x27;s head is covered in red spots and cuts from the hair being ripped out.     THIS PRODUCT IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this to save money on haircuts since my boyfriend usually keeps his hair pretty low. They don&#x27;t even begin to get the job done. They&#x27;re great at clumping up, jamming, and pulling your hair out but it&#x27;s a rare occasion that they actually clip some hair. My boyfriend&#x27;s scalp is red and sore by the time he&#x27;s done trimming Because he has to do 10 passes just to get a serviceable and still patchy and uneven trim. We bought these to save money and instead ended up wasting money on a useless pair of clippers that can&#x27;t even trim short hair. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> We all ready owned one and we really like the way it cut hair . The best clippers ever  Thank you</li>
            <li> Silenciosa, casi sin vibración, es una excelente máquina de afeitar para propósitos personales.  Lo mejor de todo es que viene que sus accesorios, no necesitas comprar más. Estoy esperando el año que viene para regalarle una a mi padre!!!</li>
            <li> poor blades.  erratic quality.  lots of pinching after just a short period of time.  I&#x27;d go with something else if i were you</li>
            <li> These were horrible!  I have been using clippers for 12 years to cut my husband and boys hair and I have never had a problem before.  I had to make multiple passes on each section of hair, the hair pulled each time I made a pass and the ends of the guards are pointy and kept getting complaints of hurting.  I tried these a couple of times but we finally decided to bite the bullet and buy a different set (Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit - used yesterday for the first time - so much better!) I just realized maybe I should try to return these but the time to return expired 3 days ago.  Very annoying.  I should have given up on them sooner but with only 3 heads to clip, I only use them a few times a month.</li>
            <li> I originally got it to shave my head, but now use it for my beard instead (the head shaving was a failed experiment).    Overall not bad, but the blade gets really hot after about a minute of operation.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t understand why some people complaint about this product, it is a great product,it has all the things that like every barbers has, all size and numbers, and it&#x27;s cheap. i sometimes used it to trim my body hair, and it works great, i recommended to everybody</li>
            <li> I agree with some others reviewing this item. The trimmer itself is pretty much flawless. When I kept my beard a bit longer, I used two of the guides, and a few teeth broke off. These days I just keep my beard short and I have no issues because I don&#x27;t use the plastic guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... If you keep your facial hair short enough that you don&#x27;t need the guides, this may be the trimmer for you. Otherwise, go for a unit with better made accessories.</li>
            <li> This product is great i have used a clipper before but this one comes with everything  you could possibly need.great value for 13 dallors!</li>
            <li> At the beginning everything was great the clippers cut well, but after a year it hurts when i cut my hair it pulls hair and you have to go back and forth on your head like 40 minutes to get a good cut, If you want to save money go for something better, I am thinking about throwing them away and getting one with better quality.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price. I have owned this product before &amp; it was accidentally thrown out while cleaning. So buying this product was an easy decision to make. Even if it only worked a few times (Works way more then that, if taken care of) it pays for itself in savings the first time you use it. A cheap good men&#x27;s hair cut will run you $10-$15 &amp; that is before the tip. I paid $12.99 &amp; since I have Amazon Prime. I got two day S/H for free. So I already saved money buying this item. You can&#x27;t beat that. I have used it more then a couple times with no problems at all. Just make sure to use lubricating oil before &amp; after each use. Unfortunately, you don&#x27;t get any oil with it. That might be the reason some people complain of the blades going dull so quickly. It is also why it didn&#x27;t get the 5th star. So my advice is to buy some lubricating oil with this product. There is some really cheap oil on amazon that works just great.    As far as the brittle combs. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with them. Of course I read these reviews before I bought it. So I was very careful attaching them, when I used them. If you want a cheap hair cutter that works. This will do the job for you. If the comb breaks there is always super glue. Just take care of it &amp; it should do fine. I don&#x27;t understand all the complaining for the price. I mean it is the cheapest hair cutter on here. You get what you pay for &amp; I think this gives your money&#x27;s worth. If these clippers were $30 pr $40. I could understand the complaining, but it was 13 bucks.     If you really want a good quality hair clipper buy oster. Be ready to spend $50 just for a oster clippers alone. If you want a kit with everything in it. Be ready to easily spend $100+. If you want all the accessories. That will set you back a good amount of money.    Like I said, the only thing I really didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t come with its own lubricating oil, which is really needed in my honest opinion. You can easily buy some cheap lubricating oil onamazon. The extra cost is worth it &amp; will prolong the life of the product. My advice is get it &amp; take good care of it. You can&#x27;t beat the price. If you get it &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work right. Call amazon &amp; try getting a replacement or your money back. Amazon has some of the best customer service I have ever come across. It is one reason I paid the $79 a year for amazon prime. I buy off here enough that I have already saved money by just buying prime items. Plus if I really want the product fast. I can just pay $3.99 extra &amp; get the item the next day. Otherwise, I can just wait an extra day &amp; get S/H free. I hope this review helps you make a informed decision.</li>
            <li> The machine cuts but it feels like the motor is too weak to handle the work, I got this machine to save money but now I know that was a serious mistake it&#x27;s better to dish out the extra 30 or 40 dollars for a machine that can handle the load.</li>
            <li> If you normally go to a stylist for a hair cut, this is not for you, but if you usea barber to do a 6/4, 4/2, crew cut, etc. this hair trimmer/cutter is all you need.  Plenty of cut lengths to choose from and very easy to change lengths.  Obviously not intended for professional use and wear, but for the once a week trim it should last many years.</li>
            <li> I started with the 1\\&quot; guide comb, the clips on that broke so I switched to the 3/4\\&quot;, when that broke I used the 5/8\\&quot;, but now that&#x27;s broke and I am not going to use the 1/2\\&quot;, it makes me look like a drill sergeant. To think I bought the Remington instead of the Vidal Sassoon because I thought it would be sturdier. It&#x27;s built for very delicate users.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for my face and chest hair primarily. I didn&#x27;t need to use any of the attachments, since I desired the closest trim possible. That being said, the clippers tended to pull at the hair, and I had to go over the spots previously shaven a few times before I was satisfied. I cannot say how this shaver would work for haircuts, but I can&#x27;t imagine it would be any better. Spend more money for a better shaver. It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cheap - It comes with a great sort of accessories but the main unit is really worthless.  It worked for 3 or 4 hair cuts and it started running really slowly, like 1/10 of the normal power...  I just threw it away and got a good quality clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for, I think.  You can&#x27;t expect a really good quality item in this price range.  My advice is to pay a little more for something with a better quality so you don&#x27;t need to buy it again so soon.</li>
            <li> I ended up here because I was looking for replacement combs like many others.  After reading the reviews, I am going to shop for a new clipper instead.  My tabs broke on two different combs.  And do not believe the maintenance free pitch.  I had my son in tears with the first hair cut until I lubricated the cutting blades.</li>
            <li> This is probably the fifth or sixth clipper I&#x27;ve ever purchased (over 25 - 30 years) and it is easily the best.  It is smooth and \\&quot;whisper\\&quot; quiet, unlike any I&#x27;ve experienced.  The cut is a clean one; I&#x27;ve never had my hair get caught in the blades as I have with other models. I LOVE the fact that it does not need to be oiled.  Based on my experience, I would have expected this to be a top-rated clipper.  I was very surprised to see the relatively low overall score and the negative reviews.  I have not had the problems that some have had with the combs, but aren&#x27;t combs from other units interchangeable?</li>
            <li> This product was a great price and included everything I need to give my husband a great haircut.  I have used one my neighbor had and for the price this one so far is fantastic.</li>
            <li> two day shipping... lots of little parts to use on this trimmer... it worked great on me... it worked great on my dog... the price is outrageous... i don&#x27;t know how long it is going to last but i am very happy with the two jobs it did so far. make sure you put one of those plastic combs on the trimmer before you use it because it is sharp and it is powerful. i will update if anything happens to it. i am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> First off the \\&quot;lube for life\\&quot; blades are complete bull, after 8 or 9 uses they started catching on my hair so I oiled them up. If you don&#x27;t oil them you&#x27;ll end up pulling all of your hairs out instead of trimming them. The \\&quot;reduced vibration\\&quot; also becomes nullified if you use them more than 8 or 9 times. Once hair starts getting inside the blade and motor assembly the thing becomes a mini diesel engine. For those that might use this maybe a couple times a year and clean it out after each use these might be a good choice otherwise I&#x27;d go with Wahl or Andis.</li>
            <li> I love the Remington line of clippers.  But this one tugged a little.  Not as smooth as previous clippers I have bought of the same brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really happy with. If was possible I would preffer to return it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is really nice, it trims great and it has attachments for just about anything you want to do to your hair or beard.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short so I use the clippers every 10-14 days.  This was purchased as a replacement for the exact same model I have used for the past three or four years - the original clippers still worked but the blades were becoming dull.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find an identical replacement and would recommend this product in a heartbeat, price is right too!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  Cheaply made and pulls on the hair. I will be looking for an upgrade.</li>
            <li> I cut my husband and my son&#x27;s hair regularly.  I am pleased with the kit.  The hair cutter is quieter than my old one, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Padgett</li>
            <li> I saw most negative reviews seem to address the poor quality attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guides breaking: While this makes sense if you force everything onto the main cutter blade and expect the guide to be perfect for the way you use the trimmer, really it makes little sense. Forcing plastic onto metal will never be something you should do. I have used mine for over a year now and still have yet to break or even come close to breaking a length guide. So next time you snap on a guide think what happens if you dropped a wine glass in the sink every time you were done with it. Sure the first time it may be fine, even the second, third, forth and fifth but it eventually breaks so prevent the problem from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Cut Time: Think about how long the barber or stylist takes to cut your hair properly if you are a guy, 15-20 minutes --not including travel time there and back. So why does anyone think it will take you less time doing it yourself when you are using mirrors?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for users:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guides can break when you force them on so don&#x27;t force them when they can be snapped on with slight pressure and removed with light pressure by the tab opposite the guide teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your time and relax a bit when cutting your hair versus rushing...well unless you like ripping your hair out. Do scissors cut any faster when you drag them through paper, no, they tear what you are cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect a 5 minute hair cut. Does your barber cut it that quickly? Then why should you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a hand mirror. The floxite hand mirror I purchased to see the back of my head seems much easier than the other two I tried. See my other review of that item if you can&#x27;t find one by searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also when you first get used to cutting your own hair trim only part of the hair length off, this allows for trying it out and will let you fix it in case you screw up a little on the length somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end it&#x27;s all about the time and effort you spend. You will be reasonably happy with your final haircut if you just take you time and read the directions first on how to give yourself a haircut from the enclosed brochure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 9/30/12 Still no problems with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Simple use, this is my second one,   I bought one for myself and the second as a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with these clippers for the 2.5 years that I&#x27;ve owned them.  Like others have mentioned, the sides of the smaller clips have broken off and since you can&#x27;t buy replacements, it can be frustrating.  Fortunately, I use the clippers without any guards, and it has always given me an even haircut.  Not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this clipper for about 2 years now. For the first year, it worked great. It required some vegetable oil to keep it lubed up and running smoothly, but no other complaints. For the past several months, this unit has been just awful. I have to remove the blades before every use, clear the hair, oil the blades, then screw it back together. This worked for a few uses, but now the blades no longer move at all. The actual machine oscillates, but as soon as the blade is on, it doesn&#x27;t move. I am an engineer, and I couldn&#x27;t even get it to work. The blades just can&#x27;t tolerate the friction. AVOID this product.</li>
            <li> I got this set of hair clippers because my old one broke after being dropped. I had been using that one for years. It was powerful with sturdy guide combs and incredibly noisy, but I loved the thing, but can&#x27;t find another one of it. So I picked up this set instead, and I have mixed feelings of it.    First off, the negative. When I put the clippers to my head using one of the guide combs, I noticed two things very quickly. 1: it feels like it pulls more hair than it cuts (probably a strength issue, not sharpness) and 2: the guide comb I used was pretty flimsy. I did resolve both of these problems though (sort of). If you move the clippers through your hair slowly and don&#x27;t press it too firmly onto your head, the guide comb won&#x27;t buckle and the clippers move through easily. If you go gentle (or if you have someone who can cut your hair gently), then there aren&#x27;t any real problems with this. If you want to see what I mean by this (and don&#x27;t mind a bad haircut) just cut your hair very quickly, and you can hear the motor struggling to cut the hair.    Now the positive. The very first thing I noticed after plugging it in and powering it up was the noise, or lack thereof. It keeps steady in your hand without heavy vibration, and it makes hardly a whisper, which makes it incredibly useful pranking drunk friends and cutting animal hair without scaring the pets. I haven&#x27;t tried this on an animal, but I&#x27;ve seen some people use hair clippers on their dogs in the summer. These hair clippers would certainly be able to cut right through hair (time-consumingly) without scaring the animal getting the haircut.    Overall, this is a namby-pamby set of clippers that still gets the job done perfectly well if you don&#x27;t cut hair military fast. Quiet and without vibration, but a weak set of clippers.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long once i took it apart to clean it never went back the way it was and later stopped cutting all together</li>
            <li> The clippers are very quiet, I usually cut my hair in the early morning whilst everyone is asleep, BUT the teeth move! You can make a mistake easily and have to get a balled head! They are nicely made but tat is a problem.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned this cutter for about 18 months. The guide comb clips break after 2-3 uses. They&#x27;re made from sharp edged, brittle, hard plastic.  That Remington continued to sell this model without remedying the flaw should be adequate warning to potential customers.  The clipper unit itself has been very good with my fine, thin hair. It is quieter then other units we&#x27;ve used.  I looked for a kit with \\&quot;nylon\\&quot; comb attachments when I settled for this - I&#x27;m still on the lookout for one.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my son and husband&#x27;s hair for a number of years with the same pair of clippers - just cheap ones can&#x27;t even remember the name of them.  They got lost in the move and so I had to buy a new pair - so along I trot to Target and come back the the Remington.  I seem to remember Remington being a class brand - OK mainly from ads in the 70s and 80s but still a household name right?  Well, the first time we used them the blades didn&#x27;t move at all until I shook the unit a little, then they did and my poor husband jumps out of his chair like I&#x27;d stuck him with a red hot poker saying/screaming \\&quot;they pull!\\&quot;.  Being married for 25 years  I just told him to shut up and stop being a wimp - a couple of weeks later I come to cut my 10 year old son&#x27;s hair and he ends up crying and flinching like it is an instrument of torture, which in effect it is.  Poor husband - fancy his wife not believing him!  I end up cutting my son&#x27;s hair with scissors and the comb we use for grooming the dogs - tomorrow will see us likely at the local barber shop getting it put right.  Not only does it pull, it also cuts inconsistently - and hey folks I know I am no Vidal Sassoon but I can do a buzz cut with a pair of shears like a pro.  The poor kid honestly looks like I cut it with the kitchen scissors, which I did because the scissors in the kit are as blunt as the actual shears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A complete waste of money - upgrade to a better unit or pay a barber!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have been warned - my family have now turned against me and my son has put the shears in the recycling box.  I am told it will take many brownies to make up for the pain (the son not the husband he - being married for 25 years - has come to accept the pain).</li>
            <li> Overall an incredible product. I just ordered one for my brother-in-law who is constantly complaining about his more expensive Wahl brand clipper. I have had mine for 3 years and use it at least twice a month and I have never had a problem with it pulling or tugging. I don&#x27;t know about the complaints on attachments breaking as I only use the shortest setting with no guide but the blades stay sharp and cut clean and smooth. I would recommend also getting a Remington spray lubricant for clipper and shaver blades and applying every 3-4 times you use the clippers. I would highly recommend this product and if my clippers ever do wear out I will not even consider another brand beside Remington. Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> This unit does the job very nicely, if one isn&#x27;t careful however the guide shields can be a bit tricky to get attached.  After you have done it once and successfully it is a breeze.    I am especially thankful for the light weight, as I am an older fellow with only one truly functional arm.  However the light weight, and rather ergonomic shape allows me to trim my own hair.  This isn&#x27;t as well or robustly constructed as my old Oster clipper, but if it lasts half as long it will be worth twice the price.    That Oster is a leftover from my own Mom who got it to cut my own hair back in the fifties. I inherited it when my own son was born in the seventies, and have used it ever since.  It finally petered out last fall, so I purchased this Remington.  I already use Remington electric shavers, and have for years.  They have always given good service, I hope this Remington lives up to its brethren&#x27;s reliability.    Clint.</li>
            <li> I admit I haven&#x27;t used these types of things before but the blades do not cut well at all, the combs are crappy. I am just not happy. So I am returning it in the hopes that I can find one that works better. Even with my little experience</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 different hair clippers over the years.  This is one of the best and simplest to use.  It cuts clean, evenly, quietly.  I think it is one of the best products on the market..</li>
            <li> My 3 year old had freaked out every time I took him to get his hair cut and ever freaked out when I tried to clip it myself.  I tried to use the \\&quot;kid designed\\&quot; clippers and they still flipped him out.  We have used this clippers four times now and all four times my son proudly proclaimed afterwards, \\&quot;I did not cry!\\&quot;, and he didn&#x27;t.  Very little vibration, but a very shard and smooth cut.  Several guards to choose from.  Best clippers we&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair very often and this machine is smooth, silent and practical. I recommend this kit, it is very useful.</li>
            <li> I bought mine 2 yrs ago because I was intrigued by the whole maintenance-free deal.  Surprisingly, it more than lived up to its claims.  I&#x27;m replacing it now only because I&#x27;ve finally dropped it one too many times.  Sticking with the same brand.</li>
            <li> I already own this set and would not have bought a second if I wasn&#x27;t really happy with the first. This is a very easy haircut set to use and I like all the attachments that come with it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a good and reliable haircut set.</li>
            <li> heavier duty machine than i expected for the money, but the accessories are definitel;y cheap. it gave my husband a fine crew cut and with that first cut it paid for itself. cord could be a bit longer. the thing that prompted me to write a review is the ultimate-in-lameness \\&quot;full length cape\\&quot;. the cape is 100% a drawstring black hefty bag!! lol!! i got a huge kick out of it , but, Hello! remington,  when a customer pulls out a hefty bag posing as a hair-cutting cape, it won&#x27;t get anyone to come back for seconds!</li>
            <li> I trimmed my beard and hair and it worked okay, not great the first time but now it won&#x27;t cut without pulling hair.</li>
            <li> Got these as a Christmas gift and they literally hurt to use. It pulls your hair ridiculously hard with no efficient outcome. I threw this thing off the balcony immediately after using it for the first time. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I purchased 1 remmington about 3 years ago that lasted me a long time.  so when that one broke, it was obvious i was buying another remington.    Well just like the two other bad reviews  I had the SAME Problem, the little tabs that hold the combs in  break after 2-3 uses.  I was so disappointed after the first time the little tab broke, but decided what the heck, i&#x27;ll buy another. thinking I&#x27;ll be really careful.  3-4 uses later SAME THING. I cant believe i own 2 brand new remington hair trimmers. WHICH ARE NOW USELESS TO ME.  I&#x27;m gonna switch to another brand for now until Remington gets their act together.  Avoid this product for now.  Very Disappointing</li>
            <li> this machine works very good and very quiet and cats your hair  very good excellent yes I will recommended for everybody who works at a shop or cut his hair by himself.</li>
            <li> I liked this purchase, it comes with several accessories, it does its work and it is not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> I shave my husbands head every couple of weeks and my old clippers were just getting worn out.  I went with the Remington and I am very happy I did, great product for the price</li>
            <li> I got this sucker and it did the job fine - for a few months. But there is literally no way to clean hair out of it. Kind of a big oversight. After a few months, it just stopped working. No big surprise there. Don&#x27;t get this. Spend a little extra money so you don&#x27;t have to buy another kit a few months (or less) down the road.</li>
            <li> This product is OK for the price.  If you take your time cutting hair it will do the job, but understand this is not a barber/salon quality hair trimmer.  I think it needs a little more motor power - a little more oomph! It has all the parts needed for different lengths. Again, you have to take time for it to get all the hair to cut, but not a bad home product if you can persevere with it.</li>
            <li> the machine may overheat after a couple of months using it but it&#x27;s not a big deal I mean you cannot use this product to do hair cuts in more than two persons in a row. But for the price I think it&#x27;s worthy.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy ripping your hair out rather than trimming it, this set is for you.  I, however, prefer a pair of trimmers that actually work.  In the trash they go.</li>
            <li> Great product for trimming men&#x27;s hair.  User friendly and safe.  Multiple lengths to choose from.  Would definitely recommend to anyone to start using at home instead of spending money at the salon or barber shop.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who has always cut/clipped his own hair recently had his very aged Remington clippers die, mid-clip. (I wish you could have seen him!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wanted some as close as possible to the old ones and chose these this model from the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they arrived he tried them, removing a small patch of tummy hair! He pronounced them great and will use them on his head when the time comes.</li>
            <li> The blades dull really quickly. The clippers were cutting my son&#x27;s hair pretty well, then all of a sudden the blades became really dull. It would pull his hair out and he became so scared of home cuts I would only be able to do one side of his hair and then head to the hair salon the next day to finish his cut. It lasted a little over a year, but not worth the money at all. I will admit though that I didn&#x27;t oil the blade after use, I just clean them and call it good.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after using for 4 times.</li>
            <li> works ok if your cheap but wont cut as precise and smooth as an andis just spend the extra money . trust me</li>
            <li> Its pretty cheaply made... But if your gonna carefully use it and dont plan on dropping it any time soon... then its fine... a 4/5</li>
            <li> Bought this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. Thought it would be a money-saver (though luckily I am not in a position that I absolutely need to be substituting my haircuts at Great Clips with this). You absolutely need to have huge time on your hands and a patient partner who would agree to do this. It does its job but one needs practice. It saves you money but the time taken to finish the task offsets it.</li>
            <li> Excellent! This is just what we were looking for! My wife lovedit! We received it on time and it was just as it was described. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s old haircut kit was missing many pieces and had the tendency to \\&quot;bite\\&quot; at your neck.  This haircut kit is great for the price and does a wonderful job.  It&#x27;s also very complete with plenty of attachments and additions to help you give a good haircut!</li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head with these and they never get all the hair on the 1st pass and he has to turn it off after 5-10 mins to let it cool down before he can finish cutting. It get soooooo hot..........so he says. Shopping for a new one now.</li>
            <li> IT  was a very  good  shopping.  Very  usefull,  with  a  very  good  quality and  help  in  house so much  !!</li>
            <li> It gets hot very fast and jams easily. Heat from the blades easily is felt on your skin. For a 15 minutes use you should turn it off every 5 mins.</li>
            <li> The clipper itself is excellent.  Smooth, quiet and efficient.  The combs - the parts that come with the clipper in general - are absolute trash.  Rather than making them of a relatively soft (as in flexible) plastic, they made them with a brittle, hard plastic.  Every hair guide comb that clips onto the trimmer has very small tabs which break if you look at them cross-eyed.  I now have a trimmer that&#x27;s only good for doing hair Vin Diesel style.  I do not look good that way.  Neither does my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacements are $5.99 plus shipping and handling.  That total, with tax, is $14.36.  The unit itself costs $14.95.  Both are from the Remington website.</li>
            <li> It does not work as smooth as the one I brought from Japan, but it works.  However, after exactly 9 months, it stopped working.  I don&#x27;t even have a \\&quot;contact seller\\&quot; button to complain.</li>
            <li> corresponde a lo comprado muy bueno, excelente producto</li>
            <li> Very quiet and powerful. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to with plenty of attachments.</li>
            <li> works well with my hair. my hair is very fine and thin. the scissors are not that great; however I did not buy this for the scissors.</li>
            <li> Good product, quickly delivered.</li>
            <li> These clippers didn&#x27;t even make it through one cut.  They are so under powered I have no clue how they got past quality control.</li>
            <li> I have been using my old remington haircut set for 10 year with great result. After moving to the US I had to get a new set that will work on 110V so my obvious choice was remington again. I am sad to say this is the once of the worse purchases I have made in a long time. It does not cut cleanly, it does not have enough power to manage thick hair and is a painfull expreience for both the person cutting the hair and the person receiving a hair cut.</li>
            <li> I really doubt you can get a better clipper for this price. It cost me $15 at Shop-Rite. I&#x27;ve been using it on myself and on friends and family for a while. It&#x27;s a decent clipper to start barbering. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years with no problems, just that a little tab on the 3/4 comb broke off, still clips on fine tho. It&#x27;s very cool, takes a long time to heat up maybe around or more than 30 minutes of non stop cutting. The only reason I&#x27;m switching it for another clipper is because it is getting too slow for my needs and I need a more powerful clipper, like the Wahl Senior.     - Also there is no 1/16 comb or 3/16. DO NOT buy this machine for fades. Unless you can really work some magic with fading. The 1/8 comb does not fade in too good with the 1/4.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few months back and after a few cuts the 1/2\\&quot; guide broke.  The guides are made of brittle, crappy plastic.  I switched to the 3/4\\&quot; and it broke while I was putting it on.  I have cut my own hair for the past 14 years and I&#x27;ve never had a set of clippers break so easily.  The other ones I&#x27;ve owned have at least lasted a year or two, but this one is only a few months old.  I just tried, last night, to use the 3/8\\&quot; (I think it&#x27;s the 3/8\\&quot;, I&#x27;m angry now so I don&#x27;t care) and it broke too.  This is a junk product, Remington continues to sell it knowing it&#x27;s junk, so to me that company is worthless.  I have much better service and products from companies on Amazon that I&#x27;ve never even heard of.  Don&#x27;t buy this product:  I&#x27;d give it a negative star if I could.</li>
            <li> Product was received as expected.  Very happy with this kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  satisfied. Thank you very much :) see ya!</li>
            <li> Everything was ok, and the shiping on time</li>
            <li> I have an older version that was metal and well made, this one is plastic and works like crap!</li>
            <li> My old set finally bit the dust.....well, the add on pieces did anyway.  Sometimes I will use these to trim my stomach or balls and never have gotten my scrotum caught.  Lucky?  Or talent.  Good set.</li>
            <li> I really like the electric trimmer and still have my old one I bought four years ago. However the new style plastic attachments that are included are almost worthless. The ones I received had a limited number of &#x60;fingers&#x27; or extensions that extend from the trimmer which can cause an uneven cut. I primarily use the 1/8 &amp; 1/4 inch attachments which only had three to four extensions.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper set to replace one that I had had for *years* and managed to wear out. It&#x27;s a great clipper set for the price! All of the included pieces and extras make it a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product. After one use, I realized that it&#x27;s either a bad product or it&#x27;s a defective one. The plastic pieces pull the hair, and the motor is very, very weak. I&#x27;d return it, but it&#x27;s too late. I didn&#x27;t use it right away, and when I finally did, it was too late to get money back. I&#x27;d return it too the manufacturer, but I&#x27;d have to pay for shipping, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it, just to get a replacement. I&#x27;d prefer a different model. Extremely disappointing. I hope the manufacturer will respond and correct this problem.</li>
            <li> I have used a Remington before and had good service.  However, after I order this one I found one exactly like it in K-Mart a lot cheaper.  I hope this Remington will last at least 4 years as did the other one.</li>
            <li> Have had and used mine a lot for 10-15 yrs self hair-cuts 2-3 X/wk.  Only breaks were 1/4\\&quot; comb-guide little lock tab after 4-5yrs; now, several yrs later, same thing 3/8\\&quot; comb.  Will be ordering the 2 new comb guides cheaply (&lt; $10 w/ shipping).  Since I got as gift, &lt; $1/yr is OK by me! :)</li>
            <li> Had to oil the blade but still in use after a couple of years.  Doesn&#x27;t get every single hair on the first go round. I notice after a day some sticking out.</li>
            <li> It was just horrible I regret buying this it pulls hair and heats up quick it belong on the trash</li>
            <li> This is the worst set of clippers I have ever owned. It pulls your hair and bogs down as if it were a battery powered device with batteries almost dead.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product was horrible! I don&#x27;t even want to give it 1 star. Just throwing away your money. We have used an Andis clipper set for YEARS. We decided it was about time to get a new one, and my husband picked this set up. The first time I used it was on my 7 year old son, and he was screaming in pain. I could literally feel it yanking his hair! It&#x27;s like the hair is too much for the motor. Used it a 2nd time on my husband, and the same thing! Also noticed that when you put the attachments on, they don&#x27;t go on properly and the combs get all bent up/stretched out. Will be throwing it away and sticking with Andis brand!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. I have never used or own one before, but since I like my hair very short I though it could be a good investment. Since I bought it, more than 1 year ago, it has been flawless. Nice presentation, hard black plastic case, several guides combs, scissors, brush to clean it, etc. You do not need to lubricate the blades, it has no maintenance at all. Just plug it  and is ready for the job. Clean cuts and after you have used it twice it has  been paid for itself.</li>
            <li> The attachments have this tiny, thin, plastic tab that is suppose to hold them on to the cutter. Try putting on an attachment a couple of times, and they all break off, rendering the attachment (and the entire kit) useless. Save your money and avoid like the plague.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to keep my hair cut, as well as my nephews, and brother.  The tabs on the smaller combs broke off on the second hair cut and now this is useless as they do not sell replacement guides for this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been disappointed with Remington before this but, unfortunately this has colored my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago to cut my own hair.  Now that I&#x27;m older, there&#x27;s much less hair to deal with and I can&#x27;t really justify paying for haircuts when they all look bad regardless of how much I pay.  So, I got the bright idea of getting this item on sale and doing my own hair.  It worked great the first couple of times, but even though I oiled the blades, they went dull fast  By the third haircut, it felt like it was yanking all my hair out instead of cutting it.  Ouch!  Plus, I looked totally retarded with clumps of hair sticking out amidst short cut hair.  It took way to long to make it look right again.</li>
            <li> es la mejor maquina que he comprado una marca excelente el vendedor super responsdable y con entrega segura en un minimo de tiempo</li>
            <li> I used another brand of razor before Remington and I thought I was already satisfied with it until I lost it in the moving and had to buy another one. Since I could not find the previous brand, I opted for Remington HC 8017B due to its many good features as published. It was infinitely better when the product is in use. Very stable, very accurate cut, very safe and very durable. on top of its elegant looks. the provider of the product also delivered ahead of time and in perfect condition. thanks and congratulations.</li>
            <li> love these clippers. have had them for 3-4 years. great cutting, sooooo easy on the hand- virtually no vibration. I plan to buy a second pair.</li>
            <li> purchased this set to keep my hair cut, as well as my nephews, and brother. The tabs on the smaller combs broke off on the second hair cut and now this is useless as they do not sell replacement guides for this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been disappointed with Remington before this but, unfortunately this has colored my opinion.</li>
            <li> The product was in good condition. Excellent service, really recommend it. I am satisfied with the whole purchase process and the success of the whole operation</li>
            <li> buying one of these is cheaper than paying for a trim at supercuts, so there&#x27;s definitely value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, even when i cleaned it regularly, and oiled it like they said with their oil- it still only has enough life to cut my hair about 4-5 times until it starts to pull and pinch my hair as i&#x27;m cutting it.  but then again, that&#x27;s 4-5 haircuts at 20 dollars a piece that i saved on, so i look at it as a win.</li>
            <li> Only good for the first 5-10 times; after that, you will get your hair pulled away from your head! It&#x27;s more like a disposable product!</li>
            <li> after just one use, this item wont work as it should! Extremely disappointed. I do not advice nobody to buy it.</li>
            <li> not cut his hair, pulling. Very bad item, throw it in the trash. If I could I would give 0 stars</li>
            <li> They are the worst set of hair clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned! I bought a set of Remington clippers a few years ago. They worked very well; however, they&#x27;re worn out. Since I had success with my previous pair, I decided to buy a new set. That was a big mistake! The attachments that come with the clippers are cheap and flimsy! The clippers pull my hair rather than cut it! I will never buy another set of Remington clippers again!</li>
            <li> My old clippers were hard to use from the start. Required a dozen passes over the same area to get the hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;These only need a couple passes and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, but maybe the bad reviews here speak to a lack of consistency in their products. I bought my clippers in May 2011 (according to my amazon history) and they still work almost 4 years later. You don&#x27;t have to oil the blades (which I&#x27;ve seen bad reviews mention they did, so that&#x27;s their fault they can&#x27;t read directions), and the guards are measured with actual measurements in 1/8ths of an inch, not flat numbers like 0, 1, 2, etc. Cleaning it is a pain, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for a cheap razor that&#x27;s lasted me years. Read the directions and use common sense, and this razor should last you a long time. Unless their quality has gone down over the years, which I can&#x27;t speak to, the bad reviews almost sound like they&#x27;re talking about a totally different product.</li>
            <li> I had around 20 different types of haircut kits, different prices and brands. This is the worst one I ever had.</li>
            <li> These clippers could not even make 4 passes through the first head it was used on. Literally, on the 4th pass the clippers jammed and pulled the hair. After clearing the blade the next pass wouldn&#x27;t even &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Incredible waste of money. And I was a Remington fan ever since my dad let me shave with his razor (w/o a blade) when I was 7.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my own head for almost 20 years now and this is by far the WORST pair of clippers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my list of reason why i dislike it so much...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Ripped hair follicles out of my scalp. The 3-4 times I used this product, my head was left bleeding and sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Huge pain to clean out the clippers themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Huge pain putting the clippers back together after cleaning. Extremely annoying to align the blades while trying to reassemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The sectioning clips are cheap as could be. Broke one on the second use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are better off spending a few extra bucks and getting yourself a better quality pair of hair clippers. Avoid at all costs. Would give negative stars if I was allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: I did not buy these clippers from amazon, but I included 2 pictures to prove I own the razor to back up this negative review.)</li>
            <li> After four haircuts, the blade was dull as can be. Invest in a more expensive product, One gets what one pays for.</li>
            <li> Not the most powerful but if you keep your really hair short and cut it every1-2 weeks you shouldn&#x27;t have an issue. Anything after that it will take you longer to cut your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great, inexpensive shaver kit. It only jams if trying to buzz a lot of hair at once. Otherwise, there are no real issues. They even give you a smock-type thing to wear.</li>
            <li> very good precision, the motor is not too strong, to pass from long hair to very short you have to use many different size, you have to do it step by step,otherwise is pulling your hair</li>
            <li> VERY NICE HAIRCUT SET. I RECOMEND TO BUY IT.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how long I was using this, I got it as a Christmas present because I shave my head an opted to start doing it myself instead of going to a barber to have it done. It seems like it lasted me a while, eventually a roommate decided she was going to cut her cats hair after I told her know. All of a sudden it stopped working. I took it apart and found a lot of hair/fur that didn&#x27;t belong to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, lesson learned, worked great for shaving my head, but keep it away from your roommates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t been the same. Now I&#x27;m going to look for something new.</li>
            <li> Remmington is for ever</li>
            <li> Horrid product, we had an old Remington set which lasted us 5 years.  Because we loved the old Remington set, we purchase this one, what a disappointment.  The first cut had no power, and I generally felt like it was barely cutting.  The second time we used it, it start pulling on the hair and catching because it wasn&#x27;t cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and get something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sucks that one only gets hair 3-4 weeks, else we would have returned, but the return policy was 30 days, and of course, the second time we cut hair was out of the return policy.  Throwing this away instead.</li>
            <li> Excellente product. It arrived when it was told. It is also working perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to cut my kid hair. First few cuts seems ok. But after that, it becomes a pain to cut kid&#x27;s hair. It is a pain for him too.:-) It will pull his hair instead of cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> Description induced me in error. I wanted a product for the beard and not hair. Returned the product and replaced it by Model PG360.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3EDWH8W2ZD1NX]]I have used this product for five years on my face and head.  At times, I shave through thick hair, sometimes down to the skin.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with it at all until a tab broke on the # 3 guard just a week ago.  I ordered a new one today for $5.00.  I considered supergluing the #3 on because it is the only guard I use but I couldn&#x27;t find our super glue!  Good product.</li>
            <li> Works really well for me.  Me wife cuts my hair every two weeks with it.  I liked this model as it does not need oil to use.  It&#x27;s the only one that I could find that does not need oil.  I had (still have) the same model razor previously and the only hair guide out of the bunch that came with it that I use broke.  I would have given this 5 stars if Remington sold the hair guides separately because I know that unless we are very careful with it this guide will break too.  I compared the guides from my original razor and the now one and they are exactly the same.  If this one breaks I will not get a Remington brand razor next time.</li>
            <li> I have owned this clipper set for a while now to use on my son&#x27;s hair.  He always complains and cries about it pulling his hair when I give him a trim.  He never complains or cries when the barbershop trims his hair with their clippers.  I will be looking for a better clipper...these should be listed as a torture device.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for a little over 5 years now. I had expectations that it would be decent, and at first I was impressed. It paid for itself after the second haircut. Things went fairly smoothly with it right up to the 5 year mark. So why give it a 3?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it dropped off horribly. The blades went dull very quickly, and the length of time required jumped to almost (but not quite) double. Normally, this would not be a huge deal, except that the owner&#x27;s manual states that you can contact customer service for a quote for replacement blades. Remington has now reversed their stance, if you check the link below they tell someone that the blades are not replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://answers.remingtonproducts.com/answers/1205-en_us/category/PartsAndAccessories|ForMen|Groomers/men-s-groomer-parts-parts-and-accessories-remington-hair-care-shave-and-grooming-products-questions-answers/questions.htm?page&#x3D;4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is despite the fact that the screws can be easily removed on the blades, allowing for replacement. The horrendous customer service retraction is what prevents me from rating this any higher. Instead of replacing the blades, I think I&#x27;ll be looking for a new razor that&#x27;s not a Remington.</li>
            <li> Clippers are much quieter than previous models, but efficiency is just as good.  Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use them if they gave them to me Will not cut hair no power cheaply made not happy with purchase.</li>
