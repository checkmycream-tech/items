            <li>These are perfectly described in the description.</li>
            <li>perfectly well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome neon</li>
            <li>These goggles are awesome!</li>
            <li>Work great in the tanning bed!</li>
            <li>Love the color too!!!</li>
            <li>, is still very bright with them on</li>
            <li>These worked great,</li>
            <li>looked great when I got the goggles.  </li>
            <li>The elastic is perfect as well, I use a stand up bed and they stay on with no issues :)</li>
            <li>The problem that I have with them is that there are points around the &amp;#34;lens&amp;#34; that isn&#x27;t fully imbedded in the plastic, so I have four spots on each side that are brilliantly bright when I tan.</li>
            <li>These goggles are a good value.</li>
            <li>They are good quality and</li>
            <li>My wife said these are good.</li>

            <li>EVO FLEX Sunnies are very cute, and I love the rubbery material they are made of!</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and keep the light from the tanning bed from my eyes!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and very good material.</li>
            <li>when I go to the tanning bed they have their own.</li>
            <li>Work good, cheap price, and came when I ordered them!</li>
            <li>and they were a good price better than in the salon.</li>
            <li>Otherwise nice and sturdy home goggles</li>
            <li>These are perfect and shipping was SO fast.</li>
            <li>Great price and came right on time!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I am an experienced tanner and know how they should fit, the sealed around my eyes fine.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Thanks super sunnies!!!!</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I feel they are effective and cheap.</li>
            <li>Granted I haven&#x27;t tried on many pairs of these in my life, these seem to work</li>
            <li>These ones kept all the UV light out of my eyes!</li>
            <li>Love the goggles.</li>
            <li>the color is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love my favorite</li>
            <li>They did not block out the light effectively.  </li>
            <li>love these goggles/</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re super cute and comfortable!!</li>
            <li>then it said which was great and super cute pink works great</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs to get their own!</li>
            <li>The only advice I have is to not leave them in a purse like I did, as they got kind of bent up and didn&#x27;t seal as good around my eye.</li>
            <li>Love it and they are pink :)really great product.</li>
            <li>No matter what I do these will let UV light through the corners.</li>
            <li>I bought them cause the ones I had leaked the UV light in around the eyes</li>
            <li>These are great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>they dont feel cheap at all like the ones at salons...................</li>
            <li>I use it with my infrared led light.</li>
            <li>I like them because they don&#x27;t sit right on the nose like most do and doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on it either.</li>
            <li>I really like these, they are very comfortable and flexible.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, they do the job.</li>
            <li>But the string doesn&#x27;t stay on right!</li>
            <li>The bright pink makes them so easy to find as well</li>
            <li>The elastic is long enough for any size head and the goggles fit perfectly over my eyes.</li>
            <li>The soft rubber feel makes them very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>bright pink flexible</li>
            <li>once when I had forgot them and had to use the ones at the salon, I could really tell the difference in the amount of light they block.</li>
            <li>For the price, these are worth it.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Sure they are soft and comfy, but too soft to cup to your eye like they should to offer adequate protection.</li>
            <li>These get the job done and will probably work well for most people, but I&#x27;ve had other pairs that fit better for the same price.</li>
            <li>Some goggle are so uncomfortable but these are great!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Since the string is in one piece so you have to tie it to the goggle first then adjust the length by untying and retying.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever used a tanning machine.</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be really looking through them to see anything crucial I absolutely love them and would recommend them</li>
            <li>i use them in the tanning bed, they&#x27;re flexible and fit just right, ive used them several times since recieving them, def recommend them.</li>
            <li>I love the hot pink color!</li>
            <li>Cute little tanning goggles, soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Love the pink color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for them.</li>
            <li>This product when straight into the trash.  </li>
            <li>I recently started tanning again and my salon no longer offered free use of goggles-</li>
            <li>I use these every time I tan, work just fine &amp; are better quality then the other pair I purchased actually at my salon.</li>
            <li>So much better than any other pair of tanning goggles I have used.</li>
            <li>They also dont sit flat or fit on my eyes.</li>
            <li>the job.&lt;br /&gt;It was worth the money and should last for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>I have used over and over again and still looks and feels like new</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and will work for great for getting my spring break base tan.</li>
            <li>Ready to get back to the booth.</li>
            <li>The edges are quite far away from your eye when you&#x27;re wearing them allowing the UV rays to get into your eye.</li>
            <li>It appears in the picture they offer good protection, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>I bought them in pink, and while the lenses are very dark, the tanning bed lights shine brightly through the pink</li>
            <li>They are very flexible so they actually bend over my eyes to protect even the outside corners.</li>
            <li>Apparently the plastic is not thick enough though because my eyes got burnt!!</li>
            <li>Wanted to use my own goggles instead of the very thin ones provided by the salon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these. The strap isn&#x27;t so tight where it is leaving marks on your face, color vibrant and does what it should. Came sealed in wrapping too. Thanks super sunnies!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for use at tanning salon.  Does the job!!!</li>
            <li> The cat likes to chew on them :(</li>
            <li> These goggles are a good value. They are comfortable and will work for great for getting my spring break base tan.</li>
            <li> These were flexible enough to cover my entire eye and comfy too. The only advice I have is to not leave them in a purse like I did, as they got kind of bent up and didn&#x27;t seal as good around my eye.</li>
            <li> These are perfectly described in the description. The soft rubber feel makes them very comfortable to wear. They do their job!</li>
            <li> These goggles are very thick and sturdy. (I believe they should be to block out uv rays.)I noticed no light in my eye while wearing these in the tanning bed. I feel they are effective and cheap. I would purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Cute little tanning goggles, soft and comfortable. Great price and came right on time! I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs to get their own!</li>

I bought them in pink, and while the lenses are very dark, the tanning bed lights shine brightly through the pink plastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy tanning!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and very good material. I have used over and over again and still looks and feels like new</li>
            <li> So much better than any other pair of tanning goggles I have used. They are very flexible so they actually bend over my eyes to protect even the outside corners. I will never buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> Love them! But the string doesn&#x27;t stay on right!</li>
            <li> For the price, these are worth it.</li>
            <li> No matter what I do these will let UV light through the corners. They also dont sit flat or fit on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like these, they are very comfortable and flexible. I bought them cause the ones I had leaked the UV light in around the eyes and they were hard uncomfortable plastic. These ones kept all the UV light out of my eyes!</li>
            <li> Awesome neon bright pink flexible so if I wanted to wear elastic with it it would form to my face without digging into my eyes one of my lenses has an imperfection in the plastic but I won&#x27;t be really looking through them to see anything crucial I absolutely love them and would recommend them</li>
            <li> EVO FLEX Sunnies are very cute, and I love the rubbery material they are made of! The lenses are dark for max eye protection and they seem to be sturdy enough to not break in your bag.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and keep the light from the tanning bed from my eyes! Plus they&#x27;re super cute and comfortable!!</li>
            <li> They get the Job done, not as soft as I expected but I like them</li>
            <li> These are great, especially for the price! Some goggle are so uncomfortable but these are great! The elastic is perfect as well, I use a stand up bed and they stay on with no issues :)</li>
            <li> They fit weird and I don&#x27;t feel like the dark part is dark enough, is still very bright with them on</li>
            <li> The product came well within thedelivery ETA. I use these at home while laying in the Sun.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Love the pink color. Wear them every time I tan.</li>
            <li> These worked great, once when I had forgot them and had to use the ones at the salon, I could really tell the difference in the amount of light they block.</li>
            <li> Love the goggles. I use them to tan outside...when I go to the tanning bed they have their own. Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Have not used yet. Ready to get back to the booth. Wanted to use my own goggles instead of the very thin ones provided by the salon. Hope the elastic does not break</li>
            <li> They are comfy and get the job done!</li>
            <li> I use these every time I tan, work just fine &amp; are better quality then the other pair I purchased actually at my salon.</li>
            <li> Just what i needed to go tanning in the beds at the gym.  I love the hot pink color! Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> They work.... I like them because they don&#x27;t sit right on the nose like most do and doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on it either. Work good, cheap price, and came when I ordered them!</li>
            <li> These goggles are awesome! They are good quality and the color is fabulous! I would definitely recommend this product! Buy it!</li>
            <li> My head is not big by any measure and yet the string is about 2 inches too short. Since the string is in one piece so you have to tie it to the goggle first then adjust the length by untying and retying. The string has absolutely no give and since it has no give, it digs into the side of the head around the temple area.</li>
            <li> Not really many ways to mess up protective eyewear. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Came earlier then it said which was great and super cute pink works great used it last night when I went tanning and they were a good price better than in the salon.</li>
            <li> Love love love! these are perfectly small around the eyes and the cord is very streatchy and doesnt get caught in my hair. The bright pink makes them so easy to find as well</li>
            <li> they dont feel cheap at all like the ones at salons...................Love it and they are pink :)really great product.Love my favorite</li>
            <li> Work great in the tanning bed! Love the color too!!!</li>
            <li> It appears in the picture they offer good protection, but I was wrong. The edges are quite far away from your eye when you&#x27;re wearing them allowing the UV rays to get into your eye. I don&#x27;t really care for them. Sure they are soft and comfy, but too soft to cup to your eye like they should to offer adequate protection. I would rather have something a little harder than have eye damage.</li>
            <li> I keep them on while tanning but w/o a string attached. The string rubs unpleasantly into my skin. Otherwise nice and sturdy home goggles</li>
            <li> These are basic eye protection for tanning beds.  The problem that I have with them is that there are points around the &amp;#34;lens&amp;#34; that isn&#x27;t fully imbedded in the plastic, so I have four spots on each side that are brilliantly bright when I tan.</li>
            <li> Far too small, and I have small eyes. Most uncomfortable goggles I&#x27;ve ever used in ten years of tanning. Unimpressed.</li>
            <li> Adjustable straps and does  the job.&lt;br /&gt;It was worth the money and should last for quite some time.  I use it with my infrared led light.</li>
            <li> They are standard tanning goggles. Nothing special, they do the job. I would buy them again, especially since the salon I go to sells sub par quality ones for about 8 bucks a pop.</li>
            <li> My wife said these are good.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever used a tanning machine. I usually wait till summer and then go outside and try to deal with the heat and tan.</li>
            <li> These get the job done and will probably work well for most people, but I&#x27;ve had other pairs that fit better for the same price. That&#x27;s not to say these are bad, but for me they were just okay.</li>
            <li> not a good product!! looked great when I got the goggles.  I am an experienced tanner and know how they should fit, the sealed around my eyes fine.  Apparently the plastic is not thick enough though because my eyes got burnt!! They did not block out the light effectively.  This product when straight into the trash.  if you buy this product maybe only get a dark color NOT pink....</li>
            <li> They are tanning goggles, they do their job, they make me look like a bug while protecting my eyes.  I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I recently started tanning again and my salon no longer offered free use of goggles- so I went to amazon to find a pair. These are perfect and shipping was SO fast. The elastic is long enough for any size head and the goggles fit perfectly over my eyes. They are a great pair of goggles and so cheap! I definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> love these goggles/ i use them in the tanning bed, they&#x27;re flexible and fit just right, ive used them several times since recieving them, def recommend them.</li>
