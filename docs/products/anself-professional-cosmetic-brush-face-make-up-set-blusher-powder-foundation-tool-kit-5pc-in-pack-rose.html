            <li> Personally not a big fan of these makeup brushes. Took well over a month for them to get delivered to my door. The bristles on the brush are way too soft to apply powder or blush. Good shape but not sturdy enough to be useful. I suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> These are good quality brushes if you do not want to break the bank. Best dupe for Sigma brushes.</li>

            <li> I recieved these brushes about a week ago, I gave them three stars because I recieved on brush with the black piece broken off, it was no big deal to me though, I do like these brushes, but they do leave little fine hair hairs behind on my face but they&#x27;re still useful for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Just as described. No fall outs.</li>
            <li> I just recieved these today! &amp; i got to say that i fell in love with them!  I got them in pink üòÅ.&lt;br /&gt;For thise wondering if they work or not? THEYY DOOOO WORK! im so glad i ordered them üòäüòÅ‚ù§</li>
            <li> I got them earlier than expected... Maybe a week after I ordered. You can not choose a color so I got the orange ones with I&#x27;m fine with. They remind me of the real technique brushes with the look of them.The packaging when is is is good the is plastic wrap to keep the hairs in place. The brush doesn&#x27;t drop hair and the brush is SOOO soft!!! These are definitely must for face brushes!!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes ! Really good quality. I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> They came quicker than expected so that is a plus. The brushes are more than worth the money the stipple brush had some fall out but all in all I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes and they are super soft I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I love this type of brushes to blend cream doign highlight and contour.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for beginners. They are similar to the real techniques but in a bundle.</li>
            <li> brushes are not dense enough to pick up or blend makeup products. save your money and don&#x27;t buy these!</li>
