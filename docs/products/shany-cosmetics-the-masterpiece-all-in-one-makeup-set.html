            <li>I really enjoy picking out what I&#x27;m going to use for the day because there are just so many options.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants great quality makeup at a great price.</li>
            <li>Colors are great for business and pleasure, and it works good on my dark complexion (something i cant say about alot of products).</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product so far.</li>
            <li>This for me was the most important piece.</li>
            <li>This is great for a professional artist or a make-up addict like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are lots of colors to be creative with, the eye shadows are a good size and the blushes are huge, and my shipping was very timely.</li>
            <li>This kit is great for that, but also comes with so many neutrals that you can get good everyday wear out of it too.  </li>
            <li>Good quality makeup and a very affordable price</li>
            <li>And you really can&#x27;t beat the price for good,  quality makeup.</li>
            <li>but they felt very creamy,over all this would make a good starter kit.</li>
            <li>I loved it really economic .</li>
            <li>THE SHADOWS ARE REALLY PIGMENTED AND IT BRINGS A GOOD SELECTION OF COLORS ..</li>
            <li>super affordable and such great product!!!</li>
            <li>right amazing</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a wonderful array of eyeshadow colors and lip glosses!</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited because I&#x27;ve seen so many reviews about it on YouTube.</li>
            <li>The colours are true!</li>
            <li>I would recommend applying them to the lips to get the full color!</li>
            <li>I love that it is travel friendly.</li>
            <li>You can easily go from day to evening</li>
            <li>Great for those who love to experiment with different looks and aren&#x27;t like me</li>
            <li>They go on easy and do not go on my face nor my clothes when putting them on.</li>
            <li>PROS:&lt;br /&gt;~Very easily goes on brushes.&lt;br /&gt;~Comes</li>
            <li>easy for storage and will protect your eyeshadows from breaking.</li>
            <li>Again these,pots are NICELY sized so you are not paying for just samples put together,They really put thought into giving more for what you pay!The</li>
            <li>The lip colors are also super creamy and easy to work with and the blushes are good - except they aren&#x27;t really flattering to many skin tones.  </li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are strongly pigmented and do not look ashy or powdery.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the eye-shadows in particular, as I have very sensitive eyes and 80% of eye make-up (high-end or not)</li>
            <li>Not as good as high end brands, or even drug store makeup brands.</li>
            <li>The lip colors were very moisturizing and pigmented, the eyeshadow, &amp; concealer were very smooth!</li>
            <li>Great for fellow makeup artist and anyone that loves makeup in general.</li>
            <li>Wow amazing Make up set!</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are great, the lip colors are very pigmented, and my absolute favorite part was the cream concealers/foundations.</li>
            <li>overall not the best but effective once used properly :)</li>
            <li>It tends to stay on counters/dressers as it doesn&#x27;t fit INSIDE anything easily.  </li>
            <li>however looked fine when you brush them into your skin.</li>
            <li>This makeup was fine with my skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine if well blended.</li>
            <li>I am now a loyal Shany Girl!</li>
            <li>Amazingly quick delivery!</li>
            <li>It came very quickly and has such a great quality.</li>
            <li>This little kit is perfect!!!</li>
            <li>finally received and I must say I love love love this!</li>
            <li>so once i put little of that on the concealers it worked perfectly on my skin &amp; it doesnt make lines under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THE BLUSH ARE HUGE.</li>
            <li>the colors range from super bright to classic neutrals.</li>
            <li>this product came so fast and really had great packaging.</li>
            <li>This is a great kit for anyone starting off using makeup...</li>
            <li>This is great for theatrical makeup or going out for a night.  </li>
            <li>This would be great to buy for teenage sisters to keep in the bathroom and share or Mom</li>
            <li>I did not receive my free sample</li>
            <li>The number of colors in the pallets is amazing and they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>this is a great starter kit for someone just starting out in the makeup biz.</li>
            <li>looks with so much fantastic colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>And the free \\&quot;gift\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t included..</li>
            <li>Tried it last night, great quality.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is worth way more that it is sold for</li>
            <li>makeup is also animal cruelty free which is another reason I purchased</li>
            <li>It comes with 4 sets of eye shadow that is light and silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Also goes on smooth and is light and silky to the touch.</li>
            <li>So just remember to dust lightly and tap you brush.</li>
            <li>yet i really like it and honestly bn a cosmetologist</li>
            <li>My daughter is 29 and always used the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get ONE palette this cheap, and this comes with 7 of them.</li>
            <li>The kit itself was securely wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li>worth more than the price listed at $59.95...</li>
            <li>Great starter kit for someone just starting off in makeup.</li>
            <li>The concealer pallet was the important piece for me.</li>
            <li>, THERE ARE 3 LIGHT BLUSHES THAT ARE BEING COVERED.&lt;br /&gt;-!-!-CONS</li>
            <li>USE BLUSH WITH A LIGHT HAND, THE 1ST TIME I USED A BLUSH</li>
            <li>USE BLUSH WITH A LIGHT HAND, THE 1ST TIME I USED A BLUSH</li>
            <li>This turned out to be a great birthday present.</li>
            <li>The only thing that wasn&#x27;t exceptionally great was the concealer--</li>
            <li>No browns, so you have to have a light hand or you will come out looking like a tomato.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic to have.  </li>
            <li>The eye shadows work great over Urban Decay shadow primer.</li>
            <li>and I never had gotten a free gift.</li>
            <li>I know you would enjoy it..</li>
            <li>enjoy your product.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my Daughter who is a semi professional makeup artist and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>I love it the colors are very pigmented and it applys smoothly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with them, I would be able to use them extensively if I were to be a makeup artist again they are made of great quality, and they come in a really nice little folding case.</li>
            <li>The variety of the colors is awesome and the fact that they are vibrant and actually stay on makes this product even more worth it.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more stuff from Shany!!</li>
            <li>very very worth buying.</li>
            <li>My wife loves to experiment with makeups, this was a great way to sample a lot of high quality makeup and then buy more of the stuff she uses frequently.</li>
            <li>Beginner friendly but advanced for makeup artistry  </li>
            <li>The eye shadows and lip colors are all highly pigmented and go on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>the makeup is great, it came in perfect state, not even a single crack, but the case came a little damaged in the front</li>
            <li>My new favorite brand of makeup!</li>
            <li>Eyeshadows are highly pigmented, blush is amazing, and so is lip color.  </li>
            <li>Person I gifted really enjoys both products and she loves the colors and how easily it is applied.</li>
            <li>The colors are so rich I would compare the quality against MAC any day.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment!</li>
            <li>first the set arrived exactly on time not a day later and the packaging was perfect for the distance in which it had to be shipped.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are smooth, true to color, and longlasting.</li>
            <li>MAKE UP IS MY SMILE!</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>the pigments are so rich.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so worth the price!</li>
            <li>I received many compliments the first time I did my eyes using this product.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the color selections and it being a &amp;</li>
            <li>but this way worth taking the time out to brag about it!</li>
            <li>I was pretty upset with that because i paid wayyyy more shopping</li>
            <li>it was well worth my money!</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and very fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i advise you to get the set, you get a very good quality with a good price, i even stop using my expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a great selection of colours and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>SO worth your money, and such great products within it.</li>
            <li>But really didn&#x27;t expect anything better because it is really cheap anyways .</li>
            <li>its amazing especially the blushes love the orange blush also like</li>
            <li>Every layer has its own set of colors, whether it&#x27;s brights, darks, or natural colors, it&#x27;s all there!</li>
            <li>This box is large, and the selection is even more all-encompassing.  </li>
            <li>I love the dark colors, neutral colors and bright colors too.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors and all the make up is highly pigmented some you don&#x27;t even need a primer for and that says a lot!</li>
            <li>They did such a good job of putting together colors that go together, so you can use this kit and nothing else (except your liners and mascara and foundation)</li>
            <li>Lovely set very pigmented gr8 price</li>
            <li>and i noticed how amazing they were and decided to use their cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;i love how they are cruelty free and includes a wide variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>With a good primer, they last all day with zero creasing or fading.</li>
            <li>I love that the whole thing is so portable</li>

            <li>I wish they had more lip gloss - its actually better than the individual lipsticks from Shany that you can buy!</li>
            <li>It arrived quick..</li>
            <li>it is one of the better products that I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve seen the colors are vibrant and flamboyant.</li>
            <li>None of the shadows are chalky, they feel super satiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;~Blush is too bold and falls off brush</li>
            <li>and it is extraordinary.</li>
            <li>The price is very very low for such a great product!</li>
            <li>, I love that it is super high quality and</li>
            <li>Ok I have bought all the high end cosmetics you can think of.</li>
            <li>the eyeshadow&#x27;s are very pretty</li>
            <li>This is the holy grail of make up kits and the price is very reasonable for the amount of product you are getting!</li>
            <li>I am definitely a happy shopper and highly recommend any of the Shany Cosmetics products, especially this one.</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are very creamy and are full pigmented lipsticks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to try out a new look every time it suits my fancy.</li>
            <li>colors are really pigmented and layout is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The YouTube reviews have all been positive and I have had the opportunity to try out a few colors and they all went on nice and true to shade and if you want heavier it will go on nicely too.</li>
            <li>ITS VERY PIGMENTED!!</li>
            <li>WOW! :-)</li>

            <li>I am loving the new eye shadows and can&#x27;t wait to have more fun with them such as a night out!</li>
            <li>great little set according to my wife.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lipstick colors are very bright and thick.</li>
            <li>and I have to wipe it off or risk looking like a fly, but I was able to wear this eye shadow for a full day with no problems (only found one other non-mineral brand that lets me do this).  </li>
            <li>and I really wanted it you get so much for the price and the quality is amazing very highly pigmented and for me it doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my skin</li>
            <li>should I say palette&#x27;s almost everyday and its a great go to palette...</li>
            <li>Its so much easier to carry this then trying to fit 6-7 eyeshadow palettes, a blush palette, a contour palette, a concealer palette..</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and FREE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ concealer palette is very cakey and doesn&#x27;t smooth well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish the concealer was available in a much darker shade.  </li>
            <li>Not only do u get all this but the variety in all the palettes is amazing.</li>
            <li>the blushes are also very pigmented use a light hand when applying</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny</li>
            <li>purchase was worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are everything I hoped they would be, and I am kind of a MAC and Urban Decay girl.  </li>
            <li>It came in perfect condition nothing broken....</li>
            <li>There are so many colors to choose from you can go from a natural look to a night out</li>
            <li>Just the lip palette alone is worth the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>What I love the most is that my make up stays on even after a whole day of running errands with no need for retouching, and that my allergic eyes haven had any reaction to the products which is big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>lets be honest everyone has different expectations and taste... for those who know makeup</li>
            <li>I anticipate hours of fun for my daughter and I.</li>
            <li>Not only can I do my own makeup, I can also do my sisters since it compliments every skin tone.</li>
            <li>This kit is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Just have fun with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great products for professional or personal use.</li>
            <li>Honestly i can buy the same thing off ebay for like 30% off this price.</li>
            <li>COMPLETELY PACKAGED IN STYROFOAM (4 SAFE</li>
            <li>WORTH</li>
            <li>WORTH</li>
            <li>I bought this for $60.00 I gave it as 4 star because I think its worth $50 and</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, colors or great👌</li>
            <li>It let&#x27;s you look fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 15 yr old niece and for the price it was ok.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews of this product before opting to buy it and a lot of people gave it very positive comments.</li>
            <li>The make up is super pigmented and really pretty.</li>
            <li>Colors are rich and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the right name for it.</li>
            <li>There is no need for me to remove makeup from it&#x27;s box, I placed in right in my makeup trunk.</li>
            <li>You get the option of trying on all of those colors without having to &amp;#34;go out and keep buying until you find the right one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The palettes are very functional &amp; will help your inner makeup artist be very creative.</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are very pigmented on dark skin which is great.</li>
            <li>so I will try to make this short and sweet :)&lt;</li>
            <li>But for the price, you cant beat 96 highly pigmented shadows, 6 HUGE blushes, and 32 lipsticks plus all the concealers.  </li>
            <li>lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blushes are super pigmented and probably my favorite part of the entire kit.</li>
            <li>But it was a neat gift for my teenage niece, she enjoyed it tremendously.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday wear!</li>
            <li>Because normal lip palettes are so cheap feeling and the just come out looking like glosses.</li>
            <li>The colors are so rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li>There are beautiful, long lasting colors in a well built case.</li>
            <li>FOUR layers of eye shadows - beautiful, super-pigmented, long lasting colors.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a good thing because you use less product.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>VERY SOFT, SMOOTH &amp; SILKY, GLIDE ON LIKE</li>
            <li>I expected them to be like the cheap glosses that look one way and when you put them on aren&#x27;t as smooth or true to color.</li>
            <li>but I bet this would be amazing for someone with tan or even super dark toned skin.</li>
            <li>The pigments in the 3 blushers are very intense.</li>
            <li>It was very fast shipping and</li>
            <li>It blends very well &amp; is very pigmented !!</li>
            <li>the blush is high pigmented, you must apply PRIMER for the shadow to show and also the lip colors are more like gloss but with a natural effect..</li>
            <li>I woukd most definitely back this pallet!</li>
            <li>Love the color payoff and the different Variety of everything.</li>
            <li>I love that it is relatively self-contained.</li>
            <li>She mostly uses the eye shadow and blush, but she&#x27;s not a big lip gloss gal.</li>
            <li>, i will order one soon for me ;)</li>
            <li>Color is super saturated and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>So this was perfect because it had everything needless to say...</li>
            <li>But it is very pigmented !</li>
            <li>It has all of the basic colors in many shades.</li>
            <li>lastly my expectation on the quality of the makeup was more than I imagined.</li>
            <li>I received the first package and when I opened it I realized that I had 6 eyeshadow palettes and a blush palette.  </li>
            <li>where ever they could fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and they sent me another one to replace the first one.</li>
            <li>are all very pigmented!</li>
            <li>This was exactly as advertised -- bought for my Granddaughter</li>
            <li>Everything is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I first saw this product on YouTube being reviewed</li>
            <li>The foundation and concealer is nice, it reminds me of the heavy, full coverage MAC studio products.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and affordable, you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li>It really is a master piece set, comes with blush, eye shadow, lip palette and foundation and primer and concealer with a lot of choose from!</li>
            <li>You can not go wrong with this. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li>Eye shadows are really pretty</li>
            <li>and I will definitely will be ordering this kit again. :)</li>
            <li>There are some Pros and a Con That I found, But I highly recommend these products to Everyone!!</li>
            <li>Very organized and well packaged!</li>
            <li>FOR THAT EXTRA POP OF COLOR; I REALLY LOVE THESE CONCEALERS</li>
            <li>OK, BUT I PERSONALLY ONLY LIKE SHIMMER IN MY EYESHADOWS.</li>
            <li>IM INTERESTED IN THE NAIL POLISH AND LIPSTICK BOXES</li>

            <li>Order more in the future.</li>
            <li>love the colors so pretty and different</li>
            <li>Thanks Shany and Amazon!</li>
            <li>this is my first review ever...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be using Shany Cosmetics on myself and my clients. :-)</li>
            <li>I received this kit for Christmas, and at first I thought it was way too much -- but now I find myself using it all the time!</li>
            <li>Recommend for anybody that wants color options!</li>
            <li>the foundation colors eyeshadows are ok use them daily</li>
            <li>How many times has the Supervisor called at the last minute and dumped a client to wine and dine on you for the evening.  </li>
            <li>Or, better yet it&#x27;s just before 5:00 and your Hubby, or the man in your life, calls and says he&#x27;s taking you to a romantic Dinner.  </li>
            <li>there was such a wide variety of colors and they were so pigmented and beautiful</li>
            <li>I love all Shany products and this is not any different!</li>
            <li>The powders go on smooth and the creams are soft and dewy.</li>
            <li>The kit is pretty convenient for transportation as well.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented!  </li>
            <li>It comes with everything you would need and so many different colors of eye shadows, lipsticks, concealers, and blushes.</li>
            <li>I will say you get a lot of product for the money, however; be aware you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>i would most differently buy again</li>
            <li>I love how it all fits in the little box, I can travel with it easily.</li>
            <li>so you really don&#x27;t need that much, and again, super pigmented.</li>
            <li>She uses different foundation, but she occasionally enhances it with the powders provided for special occasions (it does provide a nice, matte finish).</li>
            <li>Other than that its well pigmented and  amazing makeup</li>
            <li>The intense pigmentation, consistency and wear of these shadows rivals some of the most expensive ones I own!</li>
            <li>As a professional Cosmologist, I originally purchased this product to help me downsize the amount of makeup I needed to carry with me for Weddings.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this and will probably purchase quite a few as gifts for my makeup loving friends!</li>
            <li>I really love shany products it was worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>The shadows are a little powdery but not chalky and super pigmented!!!</li>
            <li>I love the makeup set just the thing to start a person out with for a new makeup trunk, i would like to see more big set like this and for the same grate price.</li>
            <li>I completed one of my most difficult favorites faces with just the items in the box and it was the best face I&#x27;ve done in a long time!!!</li>
            <li>So every thin I want is in this beautiful makeup set.</li>
            <li>has nearly EVERY color in really cool pull out trays (with a plastic case to cover it too).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and will probably buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Overall love this kit, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The eye colors are very vibrant and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>I was looking high and low for a good red eyeshadow and l</li>
            <li>I love each and every single one.</li>
            <li>Would like a purely Matt pallet.</li>
            <li>I ordered the brushes and I didn&#x27;t realize the kit contained a large variety of sizes and applicators.</li>
            <li>this product delivers in certain departments..</li>
            <li>Large combination of shadows, primers,  lip creams &amp; blushes.</li>
            <li>Great color payoff, however, the lipsticks really need improvement, there aren&#x27;t enough matte or dark brown colors in the palette.</li>
            <li>dark concealers are not easy to apply, but eyeshadows, lip palette and everything else is really great!!</li>
            <li>Very high pigment eyeshadow that stays on forever.</li>
            <li>I liked the convenience of it and not having to pack up a bunch of little things.</li>
            <li>So my standards were already held pretty high.  </li>
            <li>Great colors, use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Flakes a little bit but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>u can just pur on w/o a primer or a little concealer its deffinetley worth the money and anyone can benifit from buying :)</li>
            <li>SHANY is a very high end product just like MAC and the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>Fast collection builder for any makeup lover.</li>
            <li>so makeup often looks very dim/transparent&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they are really glosses</li>
            <li>Packaged very well; no makeup damage.</li>
            <li>is that the blushes seem so much darker than the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the blush too much.</li>
            <li>fast shipping..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to really prime prime prime -- so not a money maker.</li>
            <li>but the shipping was really fast</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>However after reading numerous reviews on SHANY Product line, I was curious to know how good the products really were</li>
            <li>, i really like it</li>
            <li>What really made me buy</li>
            <li>ALL EYESHADOWS VERY PIGMENTED.</li>
            <li>it dries out fast</li>
            <li>comes on very cakey and unnatural, of</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just real for a grate product.</li>
            <li>You MUST use a LITE hand with the blushes... they are really really pigmented.</li>
            <li>the make up is very pigmented and stay on well throughout the day.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much, but I was blown away.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE..</li>
            <li>.. I WOULD MUCH RATHER USE THE COASTAL SCENTS ECLIPSE PALLETE ..</li>
            <li>I now have almost all of the makeup that I need to get ready each day in one compact and convenient place.</li>
            <li>it comes with so much variety</li>
            <li>And you get so much product for a price that you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li>It looks very glossy and waxy.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>VERY pigmented shades..</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>You really have everything you will need to do your makeup here.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are all that I trusted they would be and some of the colors mix very well.</li>
            <li>this is very comparable to CAO....</li>
            <li>I am a MAC lover and was sceptical of this product, however it was much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>VERY BLENDABLE.</li>
            <li>I CAN USE ABOUT 8 OF THESE COLORS IN THIS CONCEALER PALETTE, THEY ARE VERY BLENDABLE.</li>
            <li>I JUST SWIPED MY BRUSH IN 2-3 TIMES AND THE COLOR WAS VERY PIGMENTED, SO</li>
            <li>AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT IS ABSOLUTELY, BEYOND A DOUBT</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Came packed very well</li>
            <li>I swatched but will be using it in a tutorial on YouTube very soon.</li>
            <li>thanks so much I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>I love the wide variety in colors.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re both mothers of multiple children, and I am all about being fabulous and chic on a budget.  </li>
            <li>She has been using it for a couple of weeks and absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Really well packaged...</li>
            <li>&amp; i dont need to apply it again on my skin as it stay the whole day.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t write reviews but upon receiving my Shany 7 layer Masterpiece Kit I decided to write one immediately.</li>
            <li>a MUA andI love this product for adding variety to my kit, all of the colors are very wearable and there is a wide range in this kit.</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend this brand to anyone especially my makeup loving friends.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll be purchasing more products from Shany in the close future, because I&#x27;ve been blown away by the products that I have purchased so far.</li>
            <li>This set offers everything that I need plus it comes in cute compact packaging leaving me space ( which I&#x27;m short on)</li>
            <li>the makeup photographs really well and is not hard to put on and stays without running under hot lights.</li>
            <li>I have a live demonstration on my YouTube channel for people that are interested in  seeing the pigmentation on women of Color.</li>
            <li>lip colors are gorgeous and can be mixed together to create other shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to finally have this!</li>
            <li>Endless looks available for you to discover and create!</li>
            <li>surely recommend to other artists</li>
            <li>I love Shany products and won&#x27;t use any other...</li>
            <li>many colors to choose from that you dont need to buy other eyeshadow</li>
            <li>The brushes were such high quality that I felt comfortable spending money on makeup from them as well.</li>
            <li>concealers  come with diffrent colors that can match all the skin types, but its alittle bit dry, but i found an easy solution i just use the INGLOT duraline , you can get it from inglot stores its an oil for the makepup.</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are highly pigmented, but if you tap your brush, you will not have much fall out.</li>
            <li>Give the full potential of trying all the combination in one box!</li>
            <li>I looked at Sephora Brushes and these are just as soft and densely packed but much cheaper price!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased a complete makeup kit with everything I could ever want.</li>
            <li>This complete set is exactly what you may be looking for.</li>
            <li>quality of Shany&#x27;s makeup hands down can go up with the top cosmetics lines..</li>
            <li>5 stars hands down would purchase more when i can afford to.  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented   easy to blend with other colors   </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the lip-glosses yet, they were not my main concern.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I actually recommended the liners to my sister in law but when we came back to order more they were already out of stock.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of different colors she uses the more traditional colors</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow palets are have vibrant colors and work</li>
            <li>but the colors are vibrant, and an array of colors shades.</li>
            <li>I received it a little earlier than what I expected and the packaging was nice. :)</li>
            <li>Use a light touch when customizing your colors and as a note apply a bit of loose powder before applying these blushers.&lt;br /&gt;The cream concealers can be blend for all but the darkest skin tones.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Because of this (as well as the shockingly low price tag), I was incredibly skeptical about ordering this set from Shany, but finally gave in after hearing so many great reviews on it from fellow</li>
            <li>This is seriously highly recommended for makeup lovers and beginners.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit beginners who want to experiment with makeup and also to anyone wanting to have an All-in-one go-to makeup kit.</li>
            <li>With a little practice you can blend and customize your favorite colors.</li>
            <li>Wow! Layers and layers of make up!</li>
            <li>COLOR A LITTLE MORE.</li>
            <li>COLOR A LITTLE MORE.</li>
            <li>r good a little goes a long way though and</li>
            <li>the colors are gorgeous, and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I Purchased this set partially based on the reviews and for once, the reviews were completely accurate.</li>
            <li>Great Packaging   Peta strict 100%   Easy Storage   Can create everyday looks as well as dramatic night looks   </li>
            <li>It was a pricey purchase for a teenager; however, I&#x27;m pleased with how long it is lasting and the quality.</li>
            <li>Wish there were a few more brown eyeshadow shades</li>
            <li>I have recently been looking into make-up as a hobby and doing it just for fun</li>
            <li>I normally buy MAC, Smashbox, and Bare Minerals cosmetics, so I had higher expectations in terms of quality.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by the extraordinary amount of different products in this selection.</li>
            <li>arrived very quick packaged well and just down</li>
            <li>(I live in Florida and it was in the 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I cant stop playing in my new make up...</li>
            <li>Slip into the restroom wash your face and put on new makeup</li>
            <li>Duck into the restroom, wash your face, put on new makeup.  </li>
            <li>blushes are also nice and big and not too heavy.</li>
            <li>So even though I was a little weary of the price being that inexpensive, cheaper makeup is not good for my skin due to sensitive skin problems, I have tried it all out and am very impressed with the quality, packaging, quick shipping, and the assortment of colors.  </li>
            <li>The lip colours are very bold and they last long.</li>
            <li>unexpectedly found it in this palette!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an orange one that I mix with my BB cream to make a fantastic skin brightener for dark circles though</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for first makeup users as well as experts.</li>
            <li>I received the second one today and, like the first one, the concealer and lip palette are not in the package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m truly disappointed by this company and lack of pride in their best seller.</li>
            <li>The concealers are thick and provide great coverage, they can also be mixed to customize different shades.</li>
            <li>I was still sold on the rest of the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend it to anyone who loves makeup and loves creating different looks without having to spend a lot of money on higher end</li>
            <li>I ordered my My Shany Cosmetics Masterpiece make-up set on May 10, 2013 and recieved exactly one week later.</li>
            <li>( I have extremely sensitive skin!)</li>
            <li>they will eventually become much higher in the future so don&#x27;t hesitate and buy now!!!</li>
            <li>in few words i really recommend this set to all ladies, you can find most of the coluors we use daily (eyeshodows &amp; lip</li>
            <li>I was not sure about purchasing this product, because i have had so many All-in-one sets like this one</li>
            <li>Loooove this product seriously its the whole package and all the colors are lovely 💗</li>
            <li>The possibilities for eye looks are endless and the actual products themselves are highly pigmented and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>I do use the concealers but not the way they come the formula is too sticky, I blend it with a little lotion or primer and they work fine.</li>
            <li>I only took one star off for the concealer palette, just for the formula, it doesn&#x27;t work too well for me, but I am really light and quite a few of those colors blended on me pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I was like a little girl opening a present when I opened theses lovely trays layer by layer.each layer</li>
            <li>Certain eye colors were a little chalky, but overall worth the buy to have Everything you need in one place neatly!</li>
            <li>I just put on balm or clear gloss.</li>
            <li>It was really well protected during delivery, and arrived so much faster than expected.</li>
            <li>and i was surprised with the quality</li>
            <li>What really sealed the deal for me was the red eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I was a professional model &amp; stage actress&amp; makeup artist st both.</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are very pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li>It offers everything needed for a makeup look.</li>
            <li>The products are very pigmented and have lasting power.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They were soft on my skin but have been durable so far.</li>
            <li>The shadows are pigmented only if you swatch then with you finger but not pigmented in your eye, shoose the one that were really pigmented and depoted and put them into a Mac Costmetics pro palette</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;i am a professional make up artist</li>
            <li>It has all the colors she will want to complete her look.</li>
            <li>but I will still surprised by the quality when I received it.</li>
            <li>I would totally get the whole kit JUST for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I do not wear make up frequently or routinely</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow is ok, not fantastic because some of the colours are Chalky and has lots of fall outs , especially the nudes and whites.</li>

            <li>Great but expensive !</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the box these palettes come in is pretty cheap.  </li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t disappointed when I got mine, actually I was really impressed.</li>
            <li>Received kit a day early  excited to crack it open.. package was slightly  beat up when i received it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really want to bore you with long paragraphs</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s exactly what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>But the eyeshadows are very hard to get that gorgeous cut look with due to wishy washy pigmenting.</li>
            <li>The shipment arrived well before its due date and that helped me beable to book appointments that much sooner!</li>
            <li>All 7 layers make it fun to do makeup and does not overwhelm you because they are organized and separeted in a neat little package</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented colors, long lasting, not chalky.</li>
            <li>BTW, the shadows are over a size of a quarter, which is far bigger than the dime sized shadows in the comparable sets.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll look a bit like a clown if I&#x27;m not careful</li>
            <li>It offers a lot of colors giving you a chance to do different looks.</li>
            <li>and this company is only 7 years old and from the quaity of the products</li>
            <li>but it was the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>I am a professional MUA myself, personally I would NEVER use this on a client.</li>
            <li>the blushers come with light, dark pink, bronze &amp; brown.</li>
            <li>I love the idea behind this.</li>
            <li>not many require a primer and a touch of concealer to get full color</li>
            <li>The pigments are vibrant and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Pigment is high quality and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and you have a wide variety of color combs and choices.</li>
            <li>The shipping cost more than the items themselves though, and I&#x27;m annoyed with myself for not double checking.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I have only had this about a week, and my skin has been a little dry lately, so</li>
            <li>and I was surprised by how long it lasted.</li>
            <li>and I use it pretty much everyday.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it pretty much everyday since then</li>
            <li>Everything is right here in a small compact case.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it was worth the entire package or not.</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way with the right setting products etc.</li>
            <li>I have kept mascara, clear lip gloss, lip balm, and loose face face and eyebrow</li>
            <li>Goods arrived together however, shipping costs were outrageous, the goods were received quickly which was good.  </li>
            <li>colors are very saturated, there is little to no fall out</li>

            <li> My favorite item in the box is the blush palette.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure</li>
            <li> Even though I tend to stick to the neutrals, it&#x27;s nice to know that I have brighter options available.</li>
            <li> All my friends are so jealous that I have so many choices now</li>

            <li> This makeup kit is okay.</li>
            <li> I love the eye shadow palettes, but I am not too fond of the blush, concealer, and lipstick palette.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this makeup.</li>

            <li> Love the variety.</li>

            <li> Love all the colors in the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I do find they go on better and brighter with a primer</li>

            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants great quality makeup at a great price.</li>
            <li> Colors are great for business and pleasure, and it works good on my dark complexion (something i cant say about alot of products).</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product so far.</li>
            <li> This for me was the most important piece.</li>
            <li> This is great for a professional artist or a make-up addict like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are lots of colors to be creative with, the eye shadows are a good size and the blushes are huge, and my shipping was very timely.</li>
            <li> This kit is great for that, but also comes with so many neutrals that you can get good everyday wear out of it too.  </li>
            <li> Good quality makeup and a very affordable price</li>
            <li> And you really can&#x27;t beat the price for good,  quality makeup.</li>
            <li> but they felt very creamy,over all this would make a good starter kit.</li>
            <li> I loved it really economic .</li>
            <li> THE SHADOWS ARE REALLY PIGMENTED AND IT BRINGS A GOOD SELECTION OF COLORS ..</li>
            <li> super affordable and such great product!!!</li>
            <li> right amazing</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a wonderful array of eyeshadow colors and lip glosses!</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited because I&#x27;ve seen so many reviews about it on YouTube.</li>
            <li> The colours are true!</li>
            <li> I would recommend applying them to the lips to get the full color!</li>
            <li> I love that it is travel friendly.</li>
            <li> You can easily go from day to evening</li>
            <li> Great for those who love to experiment with different looks and aren&#x27;t like me</li>
            <li> They go on easy and do not go on my face nor my clothes when putting them on.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;~Very easily goes on brushes.&lt;br /&gt;~Comes</li>
            <li> easy for storage and will protect your eyeshadows from breaking.</li>
            <li> Again these,pots are NICELY sized so you are not paying for just samples put together,They really put thought into giving more for what you pay!The</li>
            <li> The lip colors are also super creamy and easy to work with and the blushes are good - except they aren&#x27;t really flattering to many skin tones.  </li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are strongly pigmented and do not look ashy or powdery.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the eye-shadows in particular, as I have very sensitive eyes and 80% of eye make-up (high-end or not)</li>
            <li> Not as good as high end brands, or even drug store makeup brands.</li>
            <li> The lip colors were very moisturizing and pigmented, the eyeshadow, &amp; concealer were very smooth!</li>
            <li> Great for fellow makeup artist and anyone that loves makeup in general.</li>
            <li> Wow amazing Make up set!</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are great, the lip colors are very pigmented, and my absolute favorite part was the cream concealers/foundations.</li>
            <li> overall not the best but effective once used properly :)</li>
            <li> It tends to stay on counters/dressers as it doesn&#x27;t fit INSIDE anything easily.  </li>
            <li> however looked fine when you brush them into your skin.</li>
            <li> This makeup was fine with my skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine if well blended.</li>
            <li> I am now a loyal Shany Girl!</li>
            <li> Amazingly quick delivery!</li>
            <li> It came very quickly and has such a great quality.</li>
            <li> This little kit is perfect!!!</li>
            <li> finally received and I must say I love love love this!</li>
            <li> so once i put little of that on the concealers it worked perfectly on my skin &amp; it doesnt make lines under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE BLUSH ARE HUGE.</li>
            <li> the colors range from super bright to classic neutrals.</li>
            <li> this product came so fast and really had great packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for anyone starting off using makeup...</li>
            <li> This is great for theatrical makeup or going out for a night.  </li>
            <li> This would be great to buy for teenage sisters to keep in the bathroom and share or Mom</li>
            <li> I did not receive my free sample</li>
            <li> The number of colors in the pallets is amazing and they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> this is a great starter kit for someone just starting out in the makeup biz.</li>
            <li> looks with so much fantastic colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> And the free \\&quot;gift\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t included..</li>
            <li> Tried it last night, great quality.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is worth way more that it is sold for</li>
            <li> makeup is also animal cruelty free which is another reason I purchased</li>
            <li> It comes with 4 sets of eye shadow that is light and silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Also goes on smooth and is light and silky to the touch.</li>
            <li> So just remember to dust lightly and tap you brush.</li>
            <li> yet i really like it and honestly bn a cosmetologist</li>
            <li> My daughter is 29 and always used the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get ONE palette this cheap, and this comes with 7 of them.</li>
            <li> The kit itself was securely wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li> worth more than the price listed at $59.95...</li>
            <li> Great starter kit for someone just starting off in makeup.</li>
            <li> The concealer pallet was the important piece for me.</li>
            <li> , THERE ARE 3 LIGHT BLUSHES THAT ARE BEING COVERED.&lt;br /&gt;-!-!-CONS</li>
            <li> USE BLUSH WITH A LIGHT HAND, THE 1ST TIME I USED A BLUSH</li>
            <li> USE BLUSH WITH A LIGHT HAND, THE 1ST TIME I USED A BLUSH</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a great birthday present.</li>
            <li> The only thing that wasn&#x27;t exceptionally great was the concealer--</li>
            <li> No browns, so you have to have a light hand or you will come out looking like a tomato.  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic to have.  </li>
            <li> The eye shadows work great over Urban Decay shadow primer.</li>
            <li> and I never had gotten a free gift.</li>
            <li> I know you would enjoy it..</li>
            <li> enjoy your product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Daughter who is a semi professional makeup artist and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I love it the colors are very pigmented and it applys smoothly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with them, I would be able to use them extensively if I were to be a makeup artist again they are made of great quality, and they come in a really nice little folding case.</li>
            <li> The variety of the colors is awesome and the fact that they are vibrant and actually stay on makes this product even more worth it.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more stuff from Shany!!</li>
            <li> very very worth buying.</li>
            <li> My wife loves to experiment with makeups, this was a great way to sample a lot of high quality makeup and then buy more of the stuff she uses frequently.</li>
            <li> Beginner friendly but advanced for makeup artistry  </li>
            <li> The eye shadows and lip colors are all highly pigmented and go on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> the makeup is great, it came in perfect state, not even a single crack, but the case came a little damaged in the front</li>
            <li> My new favorite brand of makeup!</li>
            <li> Eyeshadows are highly pigmented, blush is amazing, and so is lip color.  </li>
            <li> Person I gifted really enjoys both products and she loves the colors and how easily it is applied.</li>
            <li> The colors are so rich I would compare the quality against MAC any day.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment!</li>
            <li> first the set arrived exactly on time not a day later and the packaging was perfect for the distance in which it had to be shipped.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are smooth, true to color, and longlasting.</li>
            <li> MAKE UP IS MY SMILE!</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> the pigments are so rich.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so worth the price!</li>
            <li> I received many compliments the first time I did my eyes using this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the color selections and it being a &amp;</li>
            <li> but this way worth taking the time out to brag about it!</li>
            <li> I was pretty upset with that because i paid wayyyy more shopping</li>
            <li> it was well worth my money!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and very fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i advise you to get the set, you get a very good quality with a good price, i even stop using my expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a great selection of colours and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> SO worth your money, and such great products within it.</li>
            <li> But really didn&#x27;t expect anything better because it is really cheap anyways .</li>
            <li> its amazing especially the blushes love the orange blush also like</li>
            <li> Every layer has its own set of colors, whether it&#x27;s brights, darks, or natural colors, it&#x27;s all there!</li>
            <li> This box is large, and the selection is even more all-encompassing.  </li>
            <li> I love the dark colors, neutral colors and bright colors too.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors and all the make up is highly pigmented some you don&#x27;t even need a primer for and that says a lot!</li>
            <li> They did such a good job of putting together colors that go together, so you can use this kit and nothing else (except your liners and mascara and foundation)</li>
            <li> Lovely set very pigmented gr8 price</li>
            <li> and i noticed how amazing they were and decided to use their cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;i love how they are cruelty free and includes a wide variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> With a good primer, they last all day with zero creasing or fading.</li>
            <li> I love that the whole thing is so portable</li>

            <li> I wish they had more lip gloss - its actually better than the individual lipsticks from Shany that you can buy!</li>
            <li> It arrived quick..</li>
            <li> it is one of the better products that I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve seen the colors are vibrant and flamboyant.</li>
            <li> None of the shadows are chalky, they feel super satiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~Blush is too bold and falls off brush</li>
            <li> and it is extraordinary.</li>

            <li> , I love that it is super high quality and</li>

            <li> This is the holy grail of make up kits and the price is very reasonable for the amount of product you are getting!</li>
            <li> I am definitely a happy shopper and highly recommend any of the Shany Cosmetics products, especially this one.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are very creamy and are full pigmented lipsticks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be able to try out a new look every time it suits my fancy.</li>
            <li> colors are really pigmented and layout is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The YouTube reviews have all been positive and I have had the opportunity to try out a few colors and they all went on nice and true to shade and if you want heavier it will go on nicely too.</li>
            <li> ITS VERY PIGMENTED!!</li>
            <li> WOW! :-)</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented!!.love the colors!!!</li>

            <li> I am loving the new eye shadows and can&#x27;t wait to have more fun with them such as a night out!</li>
            <li> great little set according to my wife.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lipstick colors are very bright and thick.</li>
            <li> and I have to wipe it off or risk looking like a fly, but I was able to wear this eye shadow for a full day with no problems (only found one other non-mineral brand that lets me do this).  </li>
            <li> and I really wanted it you get so much for the price and the quality is amazing very highly pigmented and for me it doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my skin</li>
            <li> should I say palette&#x27;s almost everyday and its a great go to palette...</li>
            <li> Its so much easier to carry this then trying to fit 6-7 eyeshadow palettes, a blush palette, a contour palette, a concealer palette..</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and FREE.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ concealer palette is very cakey and doesn&#x27;t smooth well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish the concealer was available in a much darker shade.  </li>
            <li> Not only do u get all this but the variety in all the palettes is amazing.</li>
            <li> the blushes are also very pigmented use a light hand when applying</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny</li>
            <li> purchase was worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are everything I hoped they would be, and I am kind of a MAC and Urban Decay girl.  </li>
            <li> It came in perfect condition nothing broken....</li>
            <li> There are so many colors to choose from you can go from a natural look to a night out</li>
            <li> Just the lip palette alone is worth the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> What I love the most is that my make up stays on even after a whole day of running errands with no need for retouching, and that my allergic eyes haven had any reaction to the products which is big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> lets be honest everyone has different expectations and taste... for those who know makeup</li>
            <li> I anticipate hours of fun for my daughter and I.</li>
            <li> Not only can I do my own makeup, I can also do my sisters since it compliments every skin tone.</li>
            <li> This kit is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just have fun with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great products for professional or personal use.</li>
            <li> Honestly i can buy the same thing off ebay for like 30% off this price.</li>
            <li> COMPLETELY PACKAGED IN STYROFOAM (4 SAFE</li>
            <li> WORTH</li>
            <li> WORTH</li>
            <li> I bought this for $60.00 I gave it as 4 star because I think its worth $50 and</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, colors or great👌</li>
            <li> It let&#x27;s you look fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 15 yr old niece and for the price it was ok.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of this product before opting to buy it and a lot of people gave it very positive comments.</li>
            <li> The make up is super pigmented and really pretty.</li>
            <li> Colors are rich and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the right name for it.</li>
            <li> There is no need for me to remove makeup from it&#x27;s box, I placed in right in my makeup trunk.</li>
            <li> You get the option of trying on all of those colors without having to &amp;#34;go out and keep buying until you find the right one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The palettes are very functional &amp; will help your inner makeup artist be very creative.</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are very pigmented on dark skin which is great.</li>
            <li> so I will try to make this short and sweet :)&lt;</li>
            <li> But for the price, you cant beat 96 highly pigmented shadows, 6 HUGE blushes, and 32 lipsticks plus all the concealers.  </li>
            <li> lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blushes are super pigmented and probably my favorite part of the entire kit.</li>
            <li> But it was a neat gift for my teenage niece, she enjoyed it tremendously.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday wear!</li>
            <li> Because normal lip palettes are so cheap feeling and the just come out looking like glosses.</li>
            <li> The colors are so rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li> There are beautiful, long lasting colors in a well built case.</li>
            <li> FOUR layers of eye shadows - beautiful, super-pigmented, long lasting colors.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a good thing because you use less product.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> VERY SOFT, SMOOTH &amp; SILKY, GLIDE ON LIKE</li>
            <li> I expected them to be like the cheap glosses that look one way and when you put them on aren&#x27;t as smooth or true to color.</li>
            <li> but I bet this would be amazing for someone with tan or even super dark toned skin.</li>
            <li> The pigments in the 3 blushers are very intense.</li>
            <li> It was very fast shipping and</li>
            <li> It blends very well &amp; is very pigmented !!</li>
            <li> the blush is high pigmented, you must apply PRIMER for the shadow to show and also the lip colors are more like gloss but with a natural effect..</li>
            <li> I woukd most definitely back this pallet!</li>
            <li> Love the color payoff and the different Variety of everything.</li>
            <li> I love that it is relatively self-contained.</li>
            <li> She mostly uses the eye shadow and blush, but she&#x27;s not a big lip gloss gal.</li>
            <li> , i will order one soon for me ;)</li>
            <li> Color is super saturated and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> So this was perfect because it had everything needless to say...</li>
            <li> But it is very pigmented !</li>
            <li> It has all of the basic colors in many shades.</li>
            <li> lastly my expectation on the quality of the makeup was more than I imagined.</li>
            <li> I received the first package and when I opened it I realized that I had 6 eyeshadow palettes and a blush palette.  </li>
            <li> where ever they could fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and they sent me another one to replace the first one.</li>
            <li> are all very pigmented!</li>
            <li> This was exactly as advertised -- bought for my Granddaughter</li>
            <li> Everything is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I first saw this product on YouTube being reviewed</li>
            <li> The foundation and concealer is nice, it reminds me of the heavy, full coverage MAC studio products.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and affordable, you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> It really is a master piece set, comes with blush, eye shadow, lip palette and foundation and primer and concealer with a lot of choose from!</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> Eye shadows are really pretty</li>
            <li> and I will definitely will be ordering this kit again. :)</li>
            <li> There are some Pros and a Con That I found, But I highly recommend these products to Everyone!!</li>
            <li> Very organized and well packaged!</li>
            <li> FOR THAT EXTRA POP OF COLOR; I REALLY LOVE THESE CONCEALERS</li>
            <li> OK, BUT I PERSONALLY ONLY LIKE SHIMMER IN MY EYESHADOWS.</li>
            <li> IM INTERESTED IN THE NAIL POLISH AND LIPSTICK BOXES</li>
            <li> IM INTERESTED IN THE NAIL POLISH AND LIPSTICK BOXES</li>
            <li> Order more in the future.</li>
            <li> love the colors so pretty and different</li>
            <li> Thanks Shany and Amazon!</li>
            <li> this is my first review ever...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be using Shany Cosmetics on myself and my clients. :-)</li>
            <li> I received this kit for Christmas, and at first I thought it was way too much -- but now I find myself using it all the time!</li>
            <li> Recommend for anybody that wants color options!</li>
            <li> the foundation colors eyeshadows are ok use them daily</li>
            <li> How many times has the Supervisor called at the last minute and dumped a client to wine and dine on you for the evening.  </li>
            <li> Or, better yet it&#x27;s just before 5:00 and your Hubby, or the man in your life, calls and says he&#x27;s taking you to a romantic Dinner.  </li>
            <li> there was such a wide variety of colors and they were so pigmented and beautiful</li>
            <li> I love all Shany products and this is not any different!</li>
            <li> The powders go on smooth and the creams are soft and dewy.</li>
            <li> The kit is pretty convenient for transportation as well.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented!  </li>
            <li> It comes with everything you would need and so many different colors of eye shadows, lipsticks, concealers, and blushes.</li>
            <li> I will say you get a lot of product for the money, however; be aware you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> i would most differently buy again</li>
            <li> I love how it all fits in the little box, I can travel with it easily.</li>
            <li> so you really don&#x27;t need that much, and again, super pigmented.</li>
            <li> She uses different foundation, but she occasionally enhances it with the powders provided for special occasions (it does provide a nice, matte finish).</li>
            <li> Other than that its well pigmented and  amazing makeup</li>
            <li> The intense pigmentation, consistency and wear of these shadows rivals some of the most expensive ones I own!</li>
            <li> As a professional Cosmologist, I originally purchased this product to help me downsize the amount of makeup I needed to carry with me for Weddings.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this and will probably purchase quite a few as gifts for my makeup loving friends!</li>
            <li> I really love shany products it was worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> The shadows are a little powdery but not chalky and super pigmented!!!</li>
            <li> I love the makeup set just the thing to start a person out with for a new makeup trunk, i would like to see more big set like this and for the same grate price.</li>
            <li> I completed one of my most difficult favorites faces with just the items in the box and it was the best face I&#x27;ve done in a long time!!!</li>
            <li> So every thin I want is in this beautiful makeup set.</li>
            <li> has nearly EVERY color in really cool pull out trays (with a plastic case to cover it too).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and will probably buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Overall love this kit, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The eye colors are very vibrant and silky feeling.</li>
            <li> I was looking high and low for a good red eyeshadow and l</li>
            <li> I love each and every single one.</li>
            <li> Would like a purely Matt pallet.</li>
            <li> I ordered the brushes and I didn&#x27;t realize the kit contained a large variety of sizes and applicators.</li>
            <li> this product delivers in certain departments..</li>
            <li> Large combination of shadows, primers,  lip creams &amp; blushes.</li>
            <li> Great color payoff, however, the lipsticks really need improvement, there aren&#x27;t enough matte or dark brown colors in the palette.</li>
            <li> dark concealers are not easy to apply, but eyeshadows, lip palette and everything else is really great!!</li>
            <li> Very high pigment eyeshadow that stays on forever.</li>
            <li> I liked the convenience of it and not having to pack up a bunch of little things.</li>
            <li> So my standards were already held pretty high.  </li>
            <li> Great colors, use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Flakes a little bit but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> u can just pur on w/o a primer or a little concealer its deffinetley worth the money and anyone can benifit from buying :)</li>
            <li> SHANY is a very high end product just like MAC and the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Fast collection builder for any makeup lover.</li>
            <li> so makeup often looks very dim/transparent&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they are really glosses</li>
            <li> Packaged very well; no makeup damage.</li>
            <li> is that the blushes seem so much darker than the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the blush too much.</li>
            <li> fast shipping..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to really prime prime prime -- so not a money maker.</li>
            <li> but the shipping was really fast</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> However after reading numerous reviews on SHANY Product line, I was curious to know how good the products really were</li>
            <li> , i really like it</li>
            <li> What really made me buy</li>
            <li> ALL EYESHADOWS VERY PIGMENTED.</li>
            <li> it dries out fast</li>
            <li> comes on very cakey and unnatural, of</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just real for a grate product.</li>
            <li> You MUST use a LITE hand with the blushes... they are really really pigmented.</li>
            <li> the make up is very pigmented and stay on well throughout the day.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much, but I was blown away.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE..</li>
            <li> .. I WOULD MUCH RATHER USE THE COASTAL SCENTS ECLIPSE PALLETE ..</li>
            <li> I now have almost all of the makeup that I need to get ready each day in one compact and convenient place.</li>
            <li> it comes with so much variety</li>
            <li> And you get so much product for a price that you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> It looks very glossy and waxy.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> VERY pigmented shades..</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> You really have everything you will need to do your makeup here.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are all that I trusted they would be and some of the colors mix very well.</li>
            <li> this is very comparable to CAO....</li>
            <li> I am a MAC lover and was sceptical of this product, however it was much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> VERY BLENDABLE.</li>
            <li> I CAN USE ABOUT 8 OF THESE COLORS IN THIS CONCEALER PALETTE, THEY ARE VERY BLENDABLE.</li>
            <li> I JUST SWIPED MY BRUSH IN 2-3 TIMES AND THE COLOR WAS VERY PIGMENTED, SO</li>
            <li> AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT IS ABSOLUTELY, BEYOND A DOUBT</li>
            <li> I JUST SWIPED MY BRUSH IN 2-3 TIMES AND THE COLOR WAS VERY PIGMENTED, SO</li>

            <li> Came packed very well</li>
            <li> I swatched but will be using it in a tutorial on YouTube very soon.</li>
            <li> thanks so much I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I love the wide variety in colors.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re both mothers of multiple children, and I am all about being fabulous and chic on a budget.  </li>
            <li> She has been using it for a couple of weeks and absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> Really well packaged...</li>
            <li> &amp; i dont need to apply it again on my skin as it stay the whole day.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t write reviews but upon receiving my Shany 7 layer Masterpiece Kit I decided to write one immediately.</li>
            <li> a MUA andI love this product for adding variety to my kit, all of the colors are very wearable and there is a wide range in this kit.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this brand to anyone especially my makeup loving friends.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll be purchasing more products from Shany in the close future, because I&#x27;ve been blown away by the products that I have purchased so far.</li>
            <li> This set offers everything that I need plus it comes in cute compact packaging leaving me space ( which I&#x27;m short on)</li>
            <li> the makeup photographs really well and is not hard to put on and stays without running under hot lights.</li>
            <li> I have a live demonstration on my YouTube channel for people that are interested in  seeing the pigmentation on women of Color.</li>
            <li> lip colors are gorgeous and can be mixed together to create other shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to finally have this!</li>
            <li> Endless looks available for you to discover and create!</li>
            <li> surely recommend to other artists</li>
            <li> I love Shany products and won&#x27;t use any other...</li>
            <li> many colors to choose from that you dont need to buy other eyeshadow</li>
            <li> The brushes were such high quality that I felt comfortable spending money on makeup from them as well.</li>
            <li> concealers  come with diffrent colors that can match all the skin types, but its alittle bit dry, but i found an easy solution i just use the INGLOT duraline , you can get it from inglot stores its an oil for the makepup.</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are highly pigmented, but if you tap your brush, you will not have much fall out.</li>
            <li> Give the full potential of trying all the combination in one box!</li>
            <li> I looked at Sephora Brushes and these are just as soft and densely packed but much cheaper price!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased a complete makeup kit with everything I could ever want.</li>
            <li> This complete set is exactly what you may be looking for.</li>
            <li> quality of Shany&#x27;s makeup hands down can go up with the top cosmetics lines..</li>
            <li> 5 stars hands down would purchase more when i can afford to.  </li>
            <li> Very pigmented   easy to blend with other colors   </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the lip-glosses yet, they were not my main concern.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I actually recommended the liners to my sister in law but when we came back to order more they were already out of stock.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of different colors she uses the more traditional colors</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow palets are have vibrant colors and work</li>
            <li> but the colors are vibrant, and an array of colors shades.</li>
            <li> I received it a little earlier than what I expected and the packaging was nice. :)</li>
            <li> Use a light touch when customizing your colors and as a note apply a bit of loose powder before applying these blushers.&lt;br /&gt;The cream concealers can be blend for all but the darkest skin tones.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Because of this (as well as the shockingly low price tag), I was incredibly skeptical about ordering this set from Shany, but finally gave in after hearing so many great reviews on it from fellow</li>
            <li> This is seriously highly recommended for makeup lovers and beginners.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit beginners who want to experiment with makeup and also to anyone wanting to have an All-in-one go-to makeup kit.</li>
            <li> With a little practice you can blend and customize your favorite colors.</li>
            <li> Wow! Layers and layers of make up!</li>
            <li> COLOR A LITTLE MORE.</li>
            <li> COLOR A LITTLE MORE.</li>
            <li> r good a little goes a long way though and</li>
            <li> the colors are gorgeous, and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I Purchased this set partially based on the reviews and for once, the reviews were completely accurate.</li>
            <li> Great Packaging   Peta strict 100%   Easy Storage   Can create everyday looks as well as dramatic night looks   </li>
            <li> It was a pricey purchase for a teenager; however, I&#x27;m pleased with how long it is lasting and the quality.</li>
            <li> Wish there were a few more brown eyeshadow shades</li>
            <li> I have recently been looking into make-up as a hobby and doing it just for fun</li>
            <li> I normally buy MAC, Smashbox, and Bare Minerals cosmetics, so I had higher expectations in terms of quality.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by the extraordinary amount of different products in this selection.</li>
            <li> arrived very quick packaged well and just down</li>
            <li> (I live in Florida and it was in the 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I cant stop playing in my new make up...</li>
            <li> Slip into the restroom wash your face and put on new makeup</li>
            <li> Duck into the restroom, wash your face, put on new makeup.  </li>
            <li> blushes are also nice and big and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> So even though I was a little weary of the price being that inexpensive, cheaper makeup is not good for my skin due to sensitive skin problems, I have tried it all out and am very impressed with the quality, packaging, quick shipping, and the assortment of colors.  </li>
            <li> The lip colours are very bold and they last long.</li>
            <li> unexpectedly found it in this palette!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an orange one that I mix with my BB cream to make a fantastic skin brightener for dark circles though</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for first makeup users as well as experts.</li>
            <li> I received the second one today and, like the first one, the concealer and lip palette are not in the package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m truly disappointed by this company and lack of pride in their best seller.</li>
            <li> The concealers are thick and provide great coverage, they can also be mixed to customize different shades.</li>
            <li> I was still sold on the rest of the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend it to anyone who loves makeup and loves creating different looks without having to spend a lot of money on higher end</li>
            <li> I ordered my My Shany Cosmetics Masterpiece make-up set on May 10, 2013 and recieved exactly one week later.</li>
            <li> ( I have extremely sensitive skin!)</li>
            <li> they will eventually become much higher in the future so don&#x27;t hesitate and buy now!!!</li>
            <li> in few words i really recommend this set to all ladies, you can find most of the coluors we use daily (eyeshodows &amp; lip</li>
            <li> I was not sure about purchasing this product, because i have had so many All-in-one sets like this one</li>
            <li> Loooove this product seriously its the whole package and all the colors are lovely 💗</li>
            <li> The possibilities for eye looks are endless and the actual products themselves are highly pigmented and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> I do use the concealers but not the way they come the formula is too sticky, I blend it with a little lotion or primer and they work fine.</li>
            <li> I only took one star off for the concealer palette, just for the formula, it doesn&#x27;t work too well for me, but I am really light and quite a few of those colors blended on me pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I was like a little girl opening a present when I opened theses lovely trays layer by layer.each layer</li>
            <li> Certain eye colors were a little chalky, but overall worth the buy to have Everything you need in one place neatly!</li>
            <li> I just put on balm or clear gloss.</li>
            <li> It was really well protected during delivery, and arrived so much faster than expected.</li>
            <li> and i was surprised with the quality</li>
            <li> What really sealed the deal for me was the red eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I was a professional model &amp; stage actress&amp; makeup artist st both.</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are very pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li> It offers everything needed for a makeup look.</li>
            <li> The products are very pigmented and have lasting power.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> They were soft on my skin but have been durable so far.</li>
            <li> The shadows are pigmented only if you swatch then with you finger but not pigmented in your eye, shoose the one that were really pigmented and depoted and put them into a Mac Costmetics pro palette</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;i am a professional make up artist</li>
            <li> It has all the colors she will want to complete her look.</li>
            <li> but I will still surprised by the quality when I received it.</li>
            <li> I would totally get the whole kit JUST for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far they look goregouse.</li>

            <li> I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE THAT LOVES WEARING MAKEUP, OR EVEN SOMEONE WHO IS STARTING OUT &amp; WANTS TO START EXPANDING THIER HORIZONS INTO</li>
            <li> tried the foundation once and never again VERY CHALKY AND WHITE</li>
            <li> I bought this as an early mothers day gift and my wife even gave me a kiss when she find out...</li>
            <li> The lip glosses surprised me.</li>
            <li> I do not wear make up frequently or routinely</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow is ok, not fantastic because some of the colours are Chalky and has lots of fall outs , especially the nudes and whites.</li>
            <li> Holy crap, this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I WILL SLOWLY BUILD UP ONE AT A TIME, MAKING SURE</li>
            <li> I WILL SLOWLY BUILD UP ONE AT A TIME, MAKING SURE</li>
            <li> MEAN love the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Great but expensive !</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the box these palettes come in is pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li> This product came shipped in all original plastic and none of the makeup was cracked or dried out in any of the</li>
            <li> eyeshdows are easy to apply &amp; mix together, it saty for long time as well &amp; it doesn&#x27;t shed around the eye as some of other eyeshadows do.&lt;br /&gt;2-</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s back to new!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed when I got mine, actually I was really impressed.</li>
            <li> Received kit a day early  excited to crack it open.. package was slightly  beat up when i received it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really want to bore you with long paragraphs</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s exactly what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> But the eyeshadows are very hard to get that gorgeous cut look with due to wishy washy pigmenting.</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived well before its due date and that helped me beable to book appointments that much sooner!</li>
            <li> All 7 layers make it fun to do makeup and does not overwhelm you because they are organized and separeted in a neat little package</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented colors, long lasting, not chalky.</li>
            <li> BTW, the shadows are over a size of a quarter, which is far bigger than the dime sized shadows in the comparable sets.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll look a bit like a clown if I&#x27;m not careful</li>
            <li> It offers a lot of colors giving you a chance to do different looks.</li>
            <li> and this company is only 7 years old and from the quaity of the products</li>
            <li> but it was the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> I am a professional MUA myself, personally I would NEVER use this on a client.</li>
            <li> the blushers come with light, dark pink, bronze &amp; brown.</li>
            <li> I love the idea behind this.</li>
            <li> not many require a primer and a touch of concealer to get full color</li>
            <li> The pigments are vibrant and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Pigment is high quality and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant and you have a wide variety of color combs and choices.</li>
            <li> The shipping cost more than the items themselves though, and I&#x27;m annoyed with myself for not double checking.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I have only had this about a week, and my skin has been a little dry lately, so</li>
            <li> and I was surprised by how long it lasted.</li>
            <li> and I use it pretty much everyday.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it pretty much everyday since then</li>
            <li> Everything is right here in a small compact case.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was worth the entire package or not.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way with the right setting products etc.</li>
            <li> I have kept mascara, clear lip gloss, lip balm, and loose face face and eyebrow</li>
            <li> Goods arrived together however, shipping costs were outrageous, the goods were received quickly which was good.  </li>
            <li> colors are very saturated, there is little to no fall out</li>
            <li> Not super high quality</li>
            <li> The blushes are on the red side so a little goes a long way but are very versatile with blending.</li>
            <li> The shadows are very pigmented and a little goes a long way with the concealer palette.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are colourtful and mixed with a lip pencil last a long while.</li>
            <li> Very highly pigmented and very little fallout.</li>
            <li> but i know this will last me for such a long time!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will need to buy anymore eyeshadows for a long time because this will last forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> long lasting.</li>
            <li> gloss palette doesn&#x27;t last long on lips&lt;</li>
            <li> , THEY ARE PRETTY THICK AND CREAMY</li>
            <li> I get to change my eye colors everyday and keep trying new things.</li>
            <li> The only con for me was the concealers, they were on the dry side for my skin</li>
            <li> the palettes are way bigger than i expected especially the blushes.</li>
            <li> on the other hand, looking at all 4 I bought, I can see they all came with completely different assortment of colors... not only eyeshadows but blushes too.</li>
            <li> your getting so much for so little!!</li>
            <li> The colours seem nice and the blushes aren&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> The quality of the makeup looks classy - not cheap.</li>
            <li> The blushes are very red, or pink.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and with the colors being so vibrant</li>
            <li> Lasts long as well!</li>
            <li> Also, the concealers are a bit dry</li>
            <li> but these aren&#x27;t for dry skinned people).  </li>
            <li> BUT I HAVE DRY SKIN AND</li>
            <li> I can only wear for a few hours before my eyes turn red and watery</li>
            <li> Overall this was a great purchase because you get a lot of eye shadows without having to spend outrageous amounts of money on single hues.</li>
            <li> they are some are very opaque some a little less than other</li>
            <li> When I first received this product,  the box that the makeup is hold in, was broken.</li>
            <li> The concealer is not smooth AT ALL - so much so that it nearly ruined my brushes when attempting to apply because you have to press so hard on the product to even get a little bit on the brush.</li>
            <li> Have been experimenting with new colors and makeup styles lately, and my sister-n-law got this for me to try.</li>
            <li> Each tray has a small, clear cover on them and the box stays closed with a magnetic closure.</li>
            <li> A little last all day long!</li>
            <li> I will say be careful when you open the main box I almost open the wrong side.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have such a cluttered mess at your station.</li>
            <li> EACH EYESHADOW POD IS A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN A QUARTER.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and it all arrived in one piece, noting broken.</li>
            <li> There are only a few colors that she never uses (maybe for Halloween?).</li>
            <li> I purchased the Shany red makeup brush set a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> i have absolutely no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> the item arrived way sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> that if you want to do a smokey look its there, if you want to do a mat green eye its there, if you need a white satin, mat or shimmer its there.</li>
            <li> I have had this set for a year now, use it everyday, and still have plenty of use left on it.</li>
            <li> Why then did I receive two separate Masterpiece 7 makeup sets, both missing two essential items that are listed.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow colors have a wide range from brights to neutrals.</li>
            <li> I tried to apply them wet</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Anyway, everything came in just like it describes, no items were broken at all, and they packaged the product very well also.</li>
            <li> I wish I had empty compact cases to put these in</li>
            <li> Very well packed no shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> There should be no horror stories of messy product from shipping because the entire box then is placed in Styrofoam case.</li>
            <li> It came fast and none of the pallets were broken.</li>
            <li> The shadows are not very pigmented, some of them are extremely chalky.  </li>
            <li> If you are a professional, i would use a white base color on my eyelids to really make the colors pop!</li>
            <li> Wow is all I have to say, seriously.</li>
            <li> I was so excited at first but ended up being very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> The blushes are quite pigmented -- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> You may want to purchase a setting spray, also wait to apply foundation due to fall out.</li>
            <li> I am an aspiring makeup artist and I plan on repurchasing and purchasing the other layer kits as well.</li>
            <li> There are an unbelievable amount of different eye shadow pallets, and concealers for every shade.</li>
            <li> I literally threw away all my other makeup from other brands.</li>
            <li> Usually you can get only one 10 eyeshadow palette for this price.</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup artist but do help out other girls.</li>
            <li> it got a heavy texture that stay for long time</li>
            <li> the only down side is that the palette is a little smaller than in the picture and has thin palettes...</li>
            <li> I am now a Shany Cosmetics fanatic and I truly believe that this company is giving MAC a run for their money especially in this economy.</li>
            <li> Color pay-off is insane (in a good way</li>
            <li> n down.</li>
            <li> This set has all the colors you need to complement any outfit, whether dressing up or dressing down.</li>
            <li> The company as assembled the box upside down</li>
            <li> so whenever I need a drawer opened I have to turn it upside down an pray</li>
            <li> I tend to be a make up snob and only got this for the crazy colors, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised with the quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the texture is less oily than my MUFE camo concealer palette...</li>
            <li> no other choice mix a small very small amount of vitamin E oil when mixing</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a complete set of eyeshadows, lip colors, blushes and concealers!!</li>
            <li> Some of the shadows are not true to color which is the reason for the 4-star rating.  </li>
            <li> I love all in one kits for travel because I hate packing a million different things to get lost or broken.  </li>
            <li> The only thing i was a little disappointed in is the blushes seem so much darker than the pictures showed but that could be just the photography.</li>
            <li> Add a touch moisturizer as the cream is a a little</li>
            <li> so it will fall (i give it a year), and in the interior is a little damaged too</li>
            <li> You have it all in this little box lipsticks, blushes, concealers, and eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> creamy concealers, but come off a little ashy on my skin</li>
            <li> THE EYESHADOWS TEND TO HAVE A LITTLE FALL OUT</li>
            <li> I feel like a little kid...</li>
            <li> But, these lipsticks actually have a thick creamy consistency!</li>
            <li> hands down its fab!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the concealer palette, the formula seems a little thick, almost paint like.  </li>
            <li> You never want a concealer that is heavy or feels oily.</li>
            <li> Then I saw a few fingerprints in the makeup</li>
            <li> I just think they should&#x27;ve thought about these things since they are trying to get the everyday wearer to buy it.</li>
            <li> Bought this after a few youtube vids.</li>
            <li> Use them with and eye shadow base and you will get perfect results, you should be using an eye shadow base for all your shadows anyway.</li>
            <li> But that is not a huge deal for me.</li>
            <li> (it was nyx) and it was nearly half the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;*7 PULL OUT TRAYS, WITH PLACTIC COVERS AND A BLACK RIBBON ON THE END.&lt;br /&gt;*112 EYESHADOWS!</li>
            <li> My brushes were very expensive &amp; heavily used, my personal set was looking ruff for wear, I&#x27;m not wealthy, so definitely a bargain hunter.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday whether to go to work or a night out with the girls!</li>
            <li> I may try applying with a small amount of water and see how I like it then.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> and I have used it everyday ever since!</li>
            <li> I USUALLY JUST SWIPE ACROSS ONCE,</li>
            <li> I USUALLY JUST SWIPE ACROSS ONCE,</li>
            <li> But everything came in tact, nothing broken or damaged, and packaged extremely well.  </li>
            <li> So after much anticipation... I bought it and am honestly disappointed...</li>
            <li> , I thought at first it was going to be crap</li>
            <li> The package arrived in time and the kit its just fine,nothing broken even I was afraid of such things due to distance.</li>
            <li> The palettes I received looked like a hodgepodge, almost like single rejected colors just randomly thrown</li>
            <li> being a college student and working on a budget its hard saving up for quality make up.</li>
            <li> You can stack all the layers in little drawers within the packaging so it all keeps neatly together!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard and expensive to piece together makeup from different manufacturers, then I have to do additional blending.  </li>
            <li> The colors are randomly thrown about, no rhyme, reason, or sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even though the item is wrapped in styrofoam, one of the shadows was completely broken and smashed (in the second box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a make up junkie late in life.</li>
            <li> IT STILL HAS NOT STOPPED ME FROM USING AT LEAST 2 OF THE BLUSH SHADES.</li>
            <li> IT STILL HAS NOT STOPPED ME FROM USING AT LEAST 2 OF THE BLUSH SHADES.</li>
            <li> The concealer is thick</li>
            <li> IF YOU TAP OFF YOUR BRUSHES BEFORE APPLYING EYESHADOW.&lt;br /&gt;*ALL 6 OF THE BLUSHES HAVE SHIMMER/SLIGHT SPARKLE TO THEM(NOT THICK</li>
            <li> The concealers are a bit thick</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I have several of the Shany products and trust me when i say that you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> FOR AT LEAST A YEAR IF IM USING IT AT THIS RATE!</li>
            <li> FOR AT LEAST A YEAR IF IM USING IT AT THIS RATE!</li>
            <li> I do not use this for all day looks as I am too addicted to my Lorac pallets</li>
            <li> The foundation pallet has poor quality.</li>
            <li> two of the eye shadows already broke and one was already broken when i opened my package...</li>
            <li> HOWEVER IM NOT HAPPY WITH THE CONCEALERS</li>
            <li> Even though one of my blushes arrived to me all broken and smashed</li>
            <li> I managed to google a remedy to fix broken powders</li>
            <li> CONCEALERS &amp; 1 WHITE EYESHADOW BASE</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;ll spell it out False Advertising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about products which I know not of its reputation.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken!</li>
            <li> off!I was skeptical</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to look in random make-up bags.</li>
            <li> Not good quality! :-(</li>
            <li> I was afraid with after spending all that money that I might have made a mistake.</li>
            <li> Im afraid to put it on because it look like it wont blend correctly without giving me shiny highlighted areas.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;she keeps changing hobbies like crazy...</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Very expensive error on my behalf.</li>
            <li> and I use this thing like crazy!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that I wouldn&#x27;t like this because sometimes what you read is not what you get!</li>
            <li> WHOEVER GIVES A BAD REVIEW ON THIS ITEM IS NUTS!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe you would be disappointed with it!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> The concealer pallet is horrible</li>
            <li> It even has a lip palette, primer, and concealer which is in a cream base!!</li>
            <li> Eye shadow is terrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and I use it pretty much everyday. Excellent quality. The make up is super pigmented and really pretty. Shipping was fast and it all arrived in one piece, noting broken. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Its ok. not the most pigmented eyeshadows, but its ok for me. Price is also ok.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for playing with colors without having to purchase hundreds $$ in eyeshadows. Recommend. Fast collection builder for any makeup lover.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It has a great selection of colours and is gentle on my sensitive skin. So happy</li>
            <li> OMG!!! The colors on this pallet is amazing! Very high pigment eyeshadow that stays on forever. I woukd most definitely back this pallet!</li>
            <li> Give the full potential of trying all the combination in one box! Does reach my expectation perfectly! Just love it!</li>
            <li> If you are a makeup lover like my self this is what you need! It has every color you could dream of and consealers of all shades. I use this makeup daily and I don&#x27;t think I will ever run out. I have had this for about a year and still haven&#x27;t used every color.</li>
            <li> For the price, you cannot beat this. Eyes shadows last me all day in 87 degree weather.  Blush was nice tone.  I haven&#x27;t tried the lip-glosses yet, they were not my main concern.  It would be nice if this set came with some lip and eye applicators thought!</li>
            <li> Love the color payoff and the different Variety of everything. Perfect for beginners and also masters.  Well worth every penny</li>
            <li> OMG...This pallette is awesome. Beautiful colors.&lt;br /&gt;My face is beat!! If I couldn&#x27;t say a word, I&#x27;ll just wave my hand.&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was worth every dollar. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase, and I would absolutely recommend this product for all makeup enthusiast!! Thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love It! Great purchase, the eyeshaow is very pigmented and  virbrant. I use this almost everyday whether to go to work or a night out with the girls!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter last year. She is still using it almost daily and LOVES it! I love that it is relatively self-contained. Each tray has a small, clear cover on them and the box stays closed with a magnetic closure. The box is a bit larger than I&#x27;d prefer. It tends to stay on counters/dressers as it doesn&#x27;t fit INSIDE anything easily.  Other than that, I think it&#x27;s great for my daughter to have so many colors to use. She enjoys mixing colors for a perfect look. There are only a few colors that she never uses (maybe for Halloween?). The quality of the makeup looks classy - not cheap. She uses brushes to apply and blend. She mostly uses the eye shadow and blush, but she&#x27;s not a big lip gloss gal. She uses different foundation, but she occasionally enhances it with the powders provided for special occasions (it does provide a nice, matte finish). It was a pricey purchase for a teenager; however, I&#x27;m pleased with how long it is lasting and the quality.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with the quality of this product. Pigment is high quality and long lasting. I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Shany red makeup brush set a few weeks ago and I was impressed by the quality, packaging and the case it came with. So even though I was a little weary of the price being that inexpensive, cheaper makeup is not good for my skin due to sensitive skin problems, I have tried it all out and am very impressed with the quality, packaging, quick shipping, and the assortment of colors.  The only complaint I have is the concealer palette, the formula seems a little thick, almost paint like.  Which probably works for photo shoot purposes.  I may try applying with a small amount of water and see how I like it then.  But everything came in tact, nothing broken or damaged, and packaged extremely well.  The eye shadows are everything I hoped they would be, and I am kind of a MAC and Urban Decay girl.  So my standards were already held pretty high.  I only took one star off for the concealer palette, just for the formula, it doesn&#x27;t work too well for me, but I am really light and quite a few of those colors blended on me pretty well.  I might still buy the Coastal Scents concealer palette too.  But for the price, you cant beat 96 highly pigmented shadows, 6 HUGE blushes, and 32 lipsticks plus all the concealers.  BTW, the shadows are over a size of a quarter, which is far bigger than the dime sized shadows in the comparable sets.  I would highly recommend this and will probably purchase quite a few as gifts for my makeup loving friends!</li>
            <li> I received it about 4 weeks ago and oh my goodness I am in love!! It came in perfect condition nothing broken....the eyeshadow&#x27;s are very pretty it includes matte&#x27;s, shimmer&#x27;s, and satin&#x27;s which is awesome I have been using this palette or should I say palette&#x27;s almost everyday and its a great go to palette...I plan on using this palette in future makeup tutorials and I can&#x27;t wait!!...I am a makeup artist and this is perfect for me on the go...I do recommend this for any makeup lover! thank you Shany for making this!!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift from a friend, and I love it alot comes with everything I need and it&#x27;s just a wonderful investment for anyone. Pigmention is awesome and you literally have EVERYTHIING!</li>
            <li> I loved this item it is definitely worth buying i have absolutely no complaints about it. I will definitely be buying it again! !</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for anyone starting off using makeup...every thing you need is included...now the colors are not as bright as pictured but they are nice and the assortment is wonderful.  I started off using ELF cosmectics but after purchasing so many I found myself having to buy storage containers and space became an issue. To date every thing is still inside this box...AND this is a good product to upgrade with once you become better with your makeup application because the quality to me is a slightly better grade.</li>
            <li> I just received it... just love it... as I do the makeup brushes... I will have plenty of time to play with the colors... it&#x27;s a wonderful probuct and so worth the money!!! Thanks again!!!</li>
            <li> Not good quality! :-(</li>
            <li> Everything was great for the Price. The shadows are nicely saturated, and I love the Lipsticks. Would like a purely Matt pallet.</li>
            <li> the only down side is that the palette is a little smaller than in the picture and has thin palettes... Other than that its well pigmented and  amazing makeup</li>
            <li> This box is large, and the selection is even more all-encompassing.  So many colors to pick from, and none of them seem like &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; colors. I really enjoy picking out what I&#x27;m going to use for the day because there are just so many options.</li>
            <li> Amazing colors, every color is bright and just leaves your eyes looking gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This makeup kit was the perfect gift from my boyfriend. I love all the colors, they work wonders with my skin tone. I will definitely be buying more stuff from Shany!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!! The quality is great especially the lip colors surprisingly! The lip colors were very moisturizing and pigmented, the eyeshadow, &amp; concealer were very smooth! Certain eye colors were a little chalky, but overall worth the buy to have Everything you need in one place neatly! I&#x27;m a MUA and this was the best thing I&#x27;ve purchased as far as cosmetics for a great value!!!</li>
            <li> Extremly pleased with the product, also the quality that is. Great for pros, but also starters in the makeup artist industry. Definietly gonna be a life time customer</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love The 7 layer masterpiece kit.The eyeshadow and blush are super pigmented and a perfect mix of matte and shimmery colors. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants great quality makeup at a great price.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful set, I orderd this Shany set for my friend in her birthday and i was surprised with the quality, i will order one soon for me ;)</li>
            <li> Color is super saturated and vibrant.  Best cheap makeup that I have ever used, but it is no Lorac or Mac.  This is great for theatrical makeup or going out for a night.  I do not use this for all day looks as I am too addicted to my Lorac pallets but if you are on a budget, I&#x27;d go with this set.  I have very pale skin and with the colors being so vibrant, I&#x27;ll look a bit like a clown if I&#x27;m not careful but I bet this would be amazing for someone with tan or even super dark toned skin.</li>
            <li> When I heard about this kit, I looked up all the tutorials on youtube of women using this kit and what they thought. I am a inspiring makeup artist &amp; trying to establish a makeup kit. So this was perfect because it had everything needless to say... I am in love with this kit!! The first time I used it was for a wedding party &amp; everything turned out absolutely beautiful!!! I will refer &amp; have referred this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great set for the money. Not super high quality but it&#x27;s exactly what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted...the item arrived way sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> I love all in one kits for travel because I hate packing a million different things to get lost or broken.  This has everything you need in a sleek compartment.  Great colors, too!</li>
            <li> If your just starting out or if you are in the makeup business this is the set for you!! Good quality makeup and a very affordable price your getting so much for so little!! There is virtually every color you would ever need to achieve any look you were going for!![[ASIN:B006GTKSHY SHANY COSMETICS The Masterpiece 7 Layers All-in-One Makeup Set]]</li>
            <li> I bought this because I just got into makeup and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. It literally almost comes with everything you need for a flawless makeup look! Check out my YouTube video if you want more of my opinion on this set! Also I did this makeup look in this pic with this set too!&lt;br /&gt;https://youtu.be/PLcmPyOBYSM</li>
            <li> I use this everyday! There are so many colors to choose from you can go from a natural look to a night out look using this set. I love all the colors and all the make up is highly pigmented some you don&#x27;t even need a primer for and that says a lot! I would definelty recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a variety of colors and any make up love out there &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate eyes hadow set for aspiring makeup artists!!! Good quality makeup for practice makeup coz it&#x27;s so affordable. Very pigmented and very fine.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I got this palette may purchase again really love it.  will be using it with my my customers and upon myself.</li>
            <li> Excellent item! I&#x27;ve got darker skin so makeup often looks very dim/transparent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this one has colors that immediately pop even without primer</li>
            <li> This little kit is perfect!!! I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I use this thing like crazy! Its so much easier to carry this then trying to fit 6-7 eyeshadow palettes, a blush palette, a contour palette, a concealer palette.. all into one bag. I just grab this and go! PERFECT I say!</li>
            <li> I love this kit. You may want to purchase a setting spray, also wait to apply foundation due to fall out. But it is very pigmented ! Beautiful purchase!</li>
            <li> Im a MUA andI love this product for adding variety to my kit, all of the colors are very wearable and there is a wide range in this kit. The lipsticks are very creamy and are full pigmented lipsticks! Most kits have what they call lipsticks but they are really glosses,you get creamy opaque lip colors in this palette. Your not going to get anything real bright or unique in this kit I think they did a really good job in designing this kit to have a variety of colors that can me worn on all skin tones for all types of looks, they designed this is such a way that if you want to do a smokey look its there, if you want to do a mat green eye its there, if you need a white satin, mat or shimmer its there.They did such a good job of putting together colors that go together, so you can use this kit and nothing else (except your liners and mascara and foundation) Just the lip palette alone is worth the price The colors are so rich I would compare the quality against MAC any day. The shadows are a little powdery but not chalky and super pigmented!!! Use them with and eye shadow base and you will get perfect results, you should be using an eye shadow base for all your shadows anyway. I do use the concealers but not the way they come the formula is too sticky, I blend it with a little lotion or primer and they work fine. I recommend this to all my clients and if you buy this for any woman on your christmas list especially a teenager you will be a big hit! This would be great to buy for teenage sisters to keep in the bathroom and share or Mom if you have a teen daughter buy this and share it with her you will both get a lot of use out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it five star if it had a better concealer formula and more diversity in the blushes.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife and she loves it</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this for me as a graduation gift a while ago and I have used it everyday ever since! The pigmentation is mind blowing. What really sealed the deal for me was the red eyeshadow. I was looking high and low for a good red eyeshadow and l unexpectedly found it in this palette! And don&#x27;t even get me started on the blushes! Looking forward to purchasing the mini version of this!!</li>
            <li> As a Makeup Artist for more than 20 years. I have to tell you that I love this product. Colors are rich and very pigmented. And the lipsticks are nice. The concealer is thick but I like that. It covers. I highly recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I was a professional model &amp; stage actress&amp; makeup artist st both. My brushes were very expensive &amp; heavily used, my personal set was looking ruff for wear, I&#x27;m not wealthy, so definitely a bargain hunter. I decided to try these brushes because of their excellent quality and extremely low price, they turned out to be exceptional. I&#x27;m very pleased with them, I would be able to use them extensively if I were to be a makeup artist again they are made of great quality, and they come in a really nice little folding case. I looked at Sephora Brushes and these are just as soft and densely packed but much cheaper price!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors and shads. The eye shadows are very pigmented and last all day. I all LOVE LOVE LOVE the blushes. I am loving this product. I recommend this product to all my family ans friends.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this and I am really impressed with the quality and the amount of product for the price. I am now a Shany Cosmetics fanatic and I truly believe that this company is giving MAC a run for their money especially in this economy.I also putchased the eyeliner and the 24 piece  goat brush set as well. I am beyond satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love all the array of colors, so many selections and stays on all day! I wish they had more lip gloss - its actually better than the individual lipsticks from Shany that you can buy!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for any makeup enthusiast. It offers everything needed for a makeup look. The products are very pigmented and have lasting power. I have several of the Shany products and trust me when i say that you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It arrived quick..I&#x27;m so excited to finally have this! Packaged very well; no makeup damage. This 7 Layer kit has everything.</li>
            <li> This makeup set has become my everything.  Colors are great for business and pleasure, and it works good on my dark complexion (something i cant say about alot of products). I am extremely happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this!!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars...there is a lot of fall out when applying the eye shadows. A lot of colors to choose from...</li>
            <li> I have had this set for a year now, use it everyday, and still have plenty of use left on it. The colors are Great!</li>
            <li> I came across this when trying to find  blushes and eyeshadows together in one set, This is even better! There are so many choices and honestly PERFECTLY priced! All 7 layers make it fun to do makeup and does not overwhelm you because they are organized and separeted in a neat little package</li>
            <li> I did not receive my free sample and I spend 94.88 one shany line (the 7layers also the 32brushes and 12 box lipstick) I just go it today</li>
            <li> Loooove this product seriously its the whole package and all the colors are lovely 💗</li>
            <li> Shany products just simply amazing I can&#x27;t believe the price. it is one of the better products that I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve seen the colors are vibrant and flamboyant. I just love it</li>
            <li> I got my 7 layer masterpiece and fell in love. The number of colors in the pallets is amazing and they are very pigmented. The only thing i was a little disappointed in is the blushes seem so much darker than the pictures showed but that could be just the photography. I am an aspiring makeup artist and I plan on repurchasing and purchasing the other layer kits as well.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great service. this is a great starter kit for someone just starting out in the makeup biz. love love love</li>
            <li> OMG I Love it...[[ASIN:B006GTKSHY SHANY The Masterpiece 7 Layers All In One Makeup Set - &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got The Masterpiece 7 Layers All in one makeup set  and i love it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has everything you need :&lt;br /&gt;- 32 lipsticks&lt;br /&gt;- 6 blushes&lt;br /&gt;- 15  concealers and&lt;br /&gt;- 112 eyeshadows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pro: the eye shadows are very pigmented and the colors are  beautiful and is easy Storage and the concealers are just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: for me the only problem  is that the blushes seem so much darker than the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m so happy i have found hight  quality makeup for  cheap  price i highly recommend Shany Cosmetics products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> This product is super awesome.  For a beginner like myself it has everything I need.  The possibilities for eye looks are endless and the actual products themselves are highly pigmented and easy to work with.  My only complaint is that the box these palettes come in is pretty cheap.  Also, the concealers are a bit dry (I guess it wouldn&#x27;t matter for people with normal/oily skin but these aren&#x27;t for dry skinned people).  The lip colors are also super creamy and easy to work with and the blushes are good - except they aren&#x27;t really flattering to many skin tones.  There&#x27;s an orange one that I mix with my BB cream to make a fantastic skin brightener for dark circles though so that&#x27;s a winner.  All in all a great kit for the money.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product so far. It was extremely fast shipping. It has some great colors. It woud be perfect for the wedding makeup that I will be doing this summer.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Highly recommend it.  Great for fellow makeup artist and anyone that loves makeup in general. Well worth the investment! The palettes are very functional &amp; will help your inner makeup artist be very creative. You can easily go from day to evening looks with so much fantastic colors to choose from. SHANY is a very high end product just like MAC and the price is very affordable. Endless looks available for you to discover and create!</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are very pigmented on dark skin which is great. I&#x27;m not a fan of the blush too much. The lip gloss is ok as well. Overall this was a great purchase because you get a lot of eye shadows without having to spend outrageous amounts of money on single hues.</li>
            <li> So every thin I want is in this beautiful makeup set. From blushes to foundations and concelears and then lip colors and of course the must have EYESHADOWS! ::} I think I&#x27;ve died and almost gone to heaven. Lovely kit for anyone thats looking for everything in one place.</li>
            <li> I love this product for the eye shadows and lip gloss! Just beware of the concealer. It is literally like trying to paint play dough on your face. The concealer is not smooth AT ALL - so much so that it nearly ruined my brushes when attempting to apply because you have to press so hard on the product to even get a little bit on the brush. Other than that, it&#x27;s a wonderful array of eyeshadow colors and lip glosses! Seem to last a while, too.</li>
            <li> Lovely set very pigmented gr8 price</li>
            <li> awesome makeup starter kit!! dark concealers are not easy to apply, but eyeshadows, lip palette and everything else is really great!!</li>
            <li> So after much anticipation... I bought it and am honestly disappointed...eye shadows weren&#x27;t as pigmented as I thought...they&#x27;re alright at best...for 60$ I&#x27;d pass... Oh well whatevs. And the free \\&quot;gift\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t included..lol</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of these products and the choices of colors.  It&#x27;s totally worth it.  And you really can&#x27;t beat the price for good,  quality makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this pallet it is so cute and you get alot and the colors are great, I am so glad i took the chance on this item..fast shipping..great thanks</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It came very quickly and has such a great quality. The eye colors are very vibrant and silky feeling. The perfect mixtures of sparkly and plats. The blushes are a bit to bright for my taste however looked fine when you brush them into your skin. The lipsticks and cover-up are also great. Definitely worth the price. Also a spectacular idea for the beginner makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Great buy, tons of looks and hours of fun!!  Im thrilled with the quality!</li>
            <li> I love the idea behind this. You get everything you need to do makeup in one set, and it all fits together perfectly so you don&#x27;t have such a cluttered mess at your station. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this makeup kit by shany cosmetics. Perfect kit starter for anyone building a makeup kit. Many colors and variety of products and good amount sizes. Love, love it a must have.</li>
            <li> This is not as pigmented as I would have hoped. I could never use these for a bridal makeup. I am very disappointed. I do like the creamy concealer set. It&#x27;s almost like they go into a powder finish. But the eyeshadows are very hard to get that gorgeous cut look with due to wishy washy pigmenting. It&#x27;s very nice to have everything in the box, but doesn&#x27;t make me too excited. I&#x27;ll have to really prime prime prime -- so not a money maker.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Daughter who is a semi professional makeup artist and she absolutely loved it. I thought it would take longer for her to get it but the shipping was really fast so I was very happy.</li>
            <li> This kit is nearly perfect. The pigments in the 3 blushers are very intense. Use a light touch when customizing your colors and as a note apply a bit of loose powder before applying these blushers.&lt;br /&gt;The cream concealers can be blend for all but the darkest skin tones. Add a touch moisturizer as the cream is a a little waxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipstick colors are very bright and thick. With a little practice you can blend and customize your favorite colors. I like a lighter more glossy/balm look. I just put on balm or clear gloss. Add a bit of lipstick from the kit and perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyeshadow palette is beautiful. It has all of the basic colors in many shades. It also has a rainbow color palette. If you can imagine the color you can create it. The eyeshadow pigments are not as concentrated, when applied, as are the pigments in the blushers. I think it allows for more color layering, blending and intensity control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since receiving this kit, I dispense with the collection of make-up that I had before. I have kept mascara, clear lip gloss, lip balm, and loose face face and eyebrow powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this kit. For the money it is a great investment.</li>
            <li> I brought this as a gift for my best friend and she just loves it. And I got to keep all the extras they sent. I would definitely recommend this for first makeup users as well as experts.</li>
            <li> Amazing product … I bought this kit because I seen it on YouTube. I read the reviews before I purchased it n they were up n down. Now I&#x27;m not a mua but my mua loves this kit, she was so pleased with everything in this kit she said I had to get it for her.</li>
            <li> this thing has you set for life! so many eye shadows and blushes and highlight concealer and primer! all in one box ahh i love love loveeee this! would highly recommend if you want to invest in  something that is great quality.</li>
            <li> Okay. For this price you get what!? FOUR! eye shadow layers, and I love that they are color concentrated. A lip pallet, a blush pallet, and a face pallet! Come on now! You HAVE to get this product. SO worth your money, and such great products within it.</li>
            <li> I love this box of all in one make up set. I have all i need in one kit and love the assortment of colors. Perfect for any occasion. Try it today!</li>
            <li> BEST MAKEUP EVER. I BROUGHT THIS FOR A PHOTO SHOOT AND THIS WORKED PERFECT. I WILL BUY AGAIN. GREAT PRODUCT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I love this set! It is just perfect to stay neat and organized. Every layer has its own set of colors, whether it&#x27;s brights, darks, or natural colors, it&#x27;s all there!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this item.  It got to my APO address within a week. Tried it last night, great quality.  I&#x27;m now sending to my sisters for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased a complete makeup kit with everything I could ever want. The variety in this kit makes me happy. The kit comes in a well organized box with tabs for each sleeve. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece she is an artist and uses makeup for her drawings. She absolutely loved it!! I was perfect for her art work!</li>
            <li> I was afraid with after spending all that money that I might have made a mistake. Boy was I wrong! There are so many colors and they are all great! You know how some eyeshadow colors don&#x27;t even come out on your eye...well these blend on smooth and the colors pop! So many colors to choose from that I get to change my eye colors everyday and keep trying new things. I don&#x27;t think I will need to buy anymore eyeshadows for a long time because this will last forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with lip, blush and concealers. I haven&#x27;t used the lip palette and probably won&#x27;t; same goes for the concealers. But overall great product!</li>
            <li> Received kit a day early  excited to crack it open.. package was slightly  beat up when i received it but everything  looks in tact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about products which I know not of its reputation. However after reading numerous reviews on SHANY Product line, I was curious to know how good the products really were......first the set arrived exactly on time not a day later and the packaging was perfect for the distance in which it had to be shipped. Secondly all 7 palettes were perfectly intact when I opened the box and lastly my expectation on the quality of the makeup was more than I imagined. I think this product is worth way more that it is sold for but I am grateful for the affordable price attached to it. I will definitely recommend this brand to anyone especially my makeup loving friends.  This is truly an outstanding product line.</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup set,it comes with everything you need,it comes with 4 eyeshadow palettes,one foundation concealer palette and one blush palette and one lip stick palette,the eyeshadows are nice and buttery soft then go on smooth blend well,the blush palette is nice very pigmented,the lip sticks are very nice it comes with a lot of colors to choose from and are pigment as weill,at this time i didn&#x27;t try on the foundations but they felt very creamy,over all this would make a good starter kit.I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> would buy it again, i really like it and it&#x27;s nice make up. love it and i just ordered another set for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality makeup. I have sensitive skin so I cannot use makeup from a drug store. This makeup was fine with my skin. I went out dancing and drinking all night when a friend was in town, the makeup stayed in place the entire night! (I live in Florida and it was in the 90&#x27;s that night)&lt;br /&gt;This makeup is also animal cruelty free which is another reason I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all of my friends!</li>
            <li> I bought the masterpiece along with two more eyeshadow sets, the slim eye/lip liners set, and the chunky eyeshadow/liner set. I love each and every single one. The eyeshadows are smooth, true to color, and longlasting. The pencils and the chuncky crayons are to die for. This set has all the colors you need to complement any outfit, whether dressing up or dressing down. What I love the most is that my make up stays on even after a whole day of running errands with no need for retouching, and that my allergic eyes haven had any reaction to the products which is big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to anyone. I actually recommended the liners to my sister in law but when we came back to order more they were already out of stock. Please bring the back!!!</li>
            <li> I love it the colors are very pigmented and it applys smoothly! I recommend anyone should buy it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Shany through Amazon. I was extremely excited because I&#x27;ve seen so many reviews about it on YouTube. I received the first package and when I opened it I realized that I had 6 eyeshadow palettes and a blush palette.  The lip and concealer palettes were missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadow palettes did not look as pictured.  The colors are all over the place, whereas in the photos they are in a color gradient and grouped by colors. The palettes I received looked like a hodgepodge, almost like single rejected colors just randomly thrown where ever they could fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and they sent me another one to replace the first one. I received the second one today and, like the first one, the concealer and lip palette are not in the package. There are 6 eyeshadow palettes  and a blush palette.&lt;br /&gt;What is going on Shany?!?!? The product description lists: 4 eyeshadow palettes, 1 lip palette, 1 blush palette, and 1 concealer palette. Why then did I receive two separate Masterpiece 7 makeup sets, both missing two essential items that are listed. Also, yet again the eyeshadow colors look nothing like the photos and what I&#x27;ve seen on YouTube. The colors are randomly thrown about, no rhyme, reason, or sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even though the item is wrapped in styrofoam, one of the shadows was completely broken and smashed (in the second box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe whoever is packaging their products are unaware of what is meant to be in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m truly disappointed by this company and lack of pride in their best seller.</li>
            <li> Since finding Shany I have fell in love with all of the products. especially the foundations and now the lip gloss and blush. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> My wife is a Stylist and a Make up artist as well. and she has been using this beautiful set for a while now. She loves it and will continue to invest in this masterpiece.</li>
            <li> LOVEEEEE!!! this is my current obsession . Im so happy with this purchase ! Its a must have in my honest opinion</li>
            <li> You will not find anything else with such variety and quality... Equal to MAC for a fraction of the cost... I cant stop playing in my new make up... What really made me buy it was the reviews on YouTube check them out...Packaging was great no broken shadows...</li>
            <li> THIS IS AMZING AND AWSOME!!! ALL EYESHADOWS VERY PIGMENTED. THE BLUSH ARE HUGE. NICE LIP COLORS ect. The best part of this is that is not heavy and it comes in a case. very very worth buying. I love make up. MAKE UP IS MY SMILE!</li>
            <li> I received my 7 layer n I love it. I really love this colors. I tried the colors n perfect. That&#x27;s awesome!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow is ok, not fantastic because some of the colours are Chalky and has lots of fall outs , especially the nudes and whites. The concealer aren&#x27;t of the best quality either . The colours seem nice and the blushes aren&#x27;t bad either. But really didn&#x27;t expect anything better because it is really cheap anyways . Still a happy buyer.</li>
            <li> great little set according to my wife. Bought this last year for Christmas and she has been very pleased with it. It has a lot of different colors she uses the more traditional colors and my daughter uses some of the more out there colors, generation gap I suppose.</li>
            <li> Great pallett for the price, eye shadows very pigmented and blends well, great colors. The concealer pallet is horrible it dries out fast comes on very cakey and unnatural, of you have no other choice mix a small very small amount of vitamin E oil when mixing</li>
            <li> this set is just the best.. it has everything i need in it.i would definitely recommend this set to my friends.</li>
            <li> The best investment I ever made in make-up. The colours are true! Worth every penny. Doing my make-up every morning is a feast!</li>
            <li> Love all the colors and that I have great quality makeup organized in one place.</li>
            <li> I just got The Masterpiece 7 Layers All in one makeup set and that&#x27;s the right name for it. this set has every thing you need in it to may a beautyful madeup face. you can also see my video review on youtube under valerie granville ck it out it&#x27;s just real for a grate product.The product link is shanycosmetics.com and they are also on facebook</li>
            <li> I ordered the brushes and I didn&#x27;t realize the kit contained a large variety of sizes and applicators. They were soft on my skin but have been durable so far. Their carrying case is also nice to look at and easy to keep organized.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  will definitely be buying it again. The eye shadows blushes and lip colors are all very pigmented! The concealers are thick and provide great coverage, they can also be mixed to customize different shades. However the selection of shade covers the mass variation of tones. It was speedily shipped and everything was intact when I received it. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Wish the colors were a bit more pigmented otherwise it&#x27;s great. I haven&#x27;t personally tried the remix but the review I saw on youtube the remix masterpiece set seems more pigmented.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom , she had been wanting one for a while since she would always grab and use mine, so dicided to get one &amp; she loved it.. as did i , the colors are amazing &amp; very pigminted, And it was extremly affordable !!</li>
            <li> The shadows are pigmented only if you swatch then with you finger but not pigmented in your eye, shoose the one that were really pigmented and depoted and put them into a Mac Costmetics pro palette</li>
            <li> Well to start this product is amazing. I loved it really economic . Color&#x27;s are beautiful and it has everything you need to look flawless. So far the best I have found 5 star.</li>
            <li> Love it. Can&#x27;t be any happier. Great kit to practice your makeup skills or starter kit if you want to be a makeup artist. Quality for price is awesome</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist. This set was a pleasant surprise. When ordering makeup sets online you can never be to sure about the quality of a product your going to get. This was a very very nice set. It comes with 4 sets of eye shadow that is light and silky to the touch.  I did not have a problem with it caking of flaking off and it goes on very smooth. It also came with a pallet of blush which comes in 6 colors and can be custom blended for the look you want.  Also goes on smooth and is light and silky to the touch. Next we have a lipstick pallet which comes in various colors that can also be blended to make a custom color. They are not waxy  or to creamy have a nice texture goes on smooth and lasts very long. I love the gloss factor in some of them. They come in a ray of matte and shimmery colors. Next you have a concealer pallet. This for me was the most important piece. You never want a concealer that is heavy or feels oily. The concealer in this set is a great covers well and you can blend a custom color is great for contouring or as a corrective concealer. This is a winner folks.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by another MUA. Tried it and fell in love. Love the colors and coverage. Received alot of compliments about the product when I wore it. I would definitely recommend this product. Oh and it&#x27;s PETA approved, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product. Shipping was fast and FREE. I was so excited to unbox it as I read all of the great reviews before getting it. It was just as everyone said. The eyeshadow colors have a wide range from brights to neutrals. This is great for a professional artist or a make-up addict like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip colors are gorgeous and can be mixed together to create other shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blushes are also nice and big and not too heavy. Perfect for use all year long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con would be, I wish the concealer palette had all darker colors for darker skin tones. I am brown-skinned with yellow undertones so the lighter colors I can&#x27;t use, except maybe as a highlighter on my face or eyes. But that is not a huge deal for me. I was still sold on the rest of the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend it to anyone who loves makeup and loves creating different looks without having to spend a lot of money on higher end brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would defintely repurchase for myself or as a gift.</li>
            <li> i am a MUA and i love for the shany masterpiece palette the colors are so vibrant and soft and blend able the foundation is a nice consistency i use then and highlight and contour as opposed to foundation the lipstick are shear they are some are very opaque some a little less than other the blushes are nice ass well</li>
            <li> I got the seven piece makeup brush  set was beatiful soft and the best the price really good</li>
            <li> This kit is great for beginners, or even those of us who have been doing make-up for a while. The eye shadows are highly pigmented, but if you tap your brush, you will not have much fall out. You MUST use a LITE hand with the blushes... they are really really pigmented. So just remember to dust lightly and tap you brush. the Lip sticks are amazing. I would recommend applying them to the lips to get the full color!</li>
            <li> saw the review for product on youtude and decided to make a purchase which was totally worth it, would recommend product to anyone into makeup and in need a good product that is affordable.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was worth the entire package or not. I will not purchase this again once it runs out. The foundation pallet has poor quality.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow palets are have vibrant colors and work well when blending them together.&lt;br /&gt;The Lipstick pallet is Awesome with a variety of Sheen &amp; Matte lipstick colors.&lt;br /&gt;I would defintely purchase a 2nd or 3rd one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janelle D. Thomas, MUA</li>
            <li> Love this product. All of the shadows are prigmented. Can literally be used as a one stop shop for mua</li>
            <li> I saw a couple of reviews on YouTube and decided to invest in an all in one make up set. This the best thing ever. I completed one of my most difficult favorites faces with just the items in the box and it was the best face I&#x27;ve done in a long time!!! If you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing, DO IT!!! The pigments are amazing and beautiful. I love this make up set!! Great for everyday wear!</li>
            <li> Love this! Great colors, use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Flakes a little bit but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Great price, colors and ships fast.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, but the storage box is cheap and broke when I first opened it....The company as assembled the box upside down so whenever I need a drawer opened I have to turn it upside down an pray it doesn&#x27;t fall out&lt;br /&gt;Shay</li>
            <li> This makeup is great, I tried a little bit from each section and it all went on great and stayed on all day. I love the lipsticks, they look great and I was surprised by how long it lasted. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Great color choices and nice texture on all makeup. Wish there were a few more brown eyeshadow shades</li>
            <li> Amazing color! Lasts long as well! Love it!!:)</li>
            <li> I started purchaseing Shany cosmetic sets about 4 years ago as Christmas gifts for the girls in the family. One of my nieces always reminds me around the time to start Christmas shopping to make sure she gets her Shany. This year I purchased a set of their makeup brushes too. This set has quite a bit of makeup in it. Great for those who love to experiment with different looks and aren&#x27;t like me--I wear the same colors all the time. My niece loves to get &#x27;made up&#x27; then does the &#x27;selfie&#x27; thing and sends me the photos. She loves the makeup. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Great but expensive !</li>
            <li> two of the eye shadows already broke and one was already broken when i opened my package... bummer !</li>
            <li> Got for my wife she said it isn&#x27;t the best but good for work on clients in big work loads</li>
            <li> I just received my item on the mail and my god i love it.&lt;br /&gt;i am a professional make up artist and I&#x27;ve been using their brushes for awhile and i noticed how amazing they were and decided to use their cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;i love how they are cruelty free and includes a wide variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;will surely recommend to other artists</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by the extraordinary amount of different products in this selection. Everything from eye makeup to concealer is included in this 7 layer kit. I&#x27;ll be able to try out a new look every time it suits my fancy. There are an unbelievable amount of different eye shadow pallets, and concealers for every shade. Hopefully I&#x27;ll be purchasing more products from Shany in the close future, because I&#x27;ve been blown away by the products that I have purchased so far.</li>
            <li> This was exactly as advertised -- bought for my Granddaughter and she loves this makeup and uses it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I really love shany products it was worth the money spent. being a college student and working on a budget its hard saving up for quality make up. This set offers everything that I need plus it comes in cute compact packaging leaving me space ( which I&#x27;m short on) the make up is very pigmented and stay on well throughout the day. I would buy this set again! It offers a lot of colors giving you a chance to do different looks.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot for me to write a review of a product. But this set has impressed me so much I knew immediately after I received it I had to share my excitement.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been working in the beauty industry for 10 years, and have represented some of the most successful, well-known and high-quality brands on the market. Because of this (as well as the shockingly low price tag), I was incredibly skeptical about ordering this set from Shany, but finally gave in after hearing so many great reviews on it from fellow artists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, I won&#x27;t ever need to buy another MAC or Lancôme eyeshadow ever again. No joke. The intense pigmentation, consistency and wear of these shadows rivals some of the most expensive ones I own! The mattes are absolutely beautiful and apply like silk. With a good primer, they last all day with zero creasing or fading. The same goes for the face &amp; lip palettes. I am so impressed by this kit I plan to buy another as backup! I love it!!</li>
            <li> This makeup kit is great for anyone who loves makeup. The pigmentation of all the eyeshadows are amazing &amp; you get a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> This is a good value for the price, I freelance as a makeup artist and this set is a lifesaver. I use every item on it all the time.</li>
            <li> It is excellent quality and packaging of this product with my expectations fulfilled. I am very happy with this. thanks</li>
            <li> lets be honest everyone has different expectations and taste... for those who know makeup well and what to expect from shadows blush,lip and concealer this product delivers in certain departments.. the blush is high pigmented, you must apply PRIMER for the shadow to show and also the lip colors are more like gloss but with a natural effect.. again depends on skin tone... overall not the best but effective once used properly :)</li>
            <li> I buy this makeup set for myself (turns out, my friend takes it hostage from time to time) Lol. We both love this set!!! Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loved it. It has all the colors she will want to complete her look. It was very well packaged and the quality of the product was great. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Everything is exactly as described. The colors are even more beautiful in person. Great Buy!!</li>
            <li> I first saw this product on YouTube being reviewed and I really wanted it you get so much for the price and the quality is amazing very highly pigmented and for me it doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my skin I would recommend this to anyone you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great for the beginning cosmetologist.  Nice quality and each layer can be purchased separately when you use them up.  The color selection was perfect and flexible enough for all skin colors.</li>
            <li> the makeup is great, it came in perfect state, not even a single crack, but the case came a little damaged in the front so it will fall (i give it a year), and in the interior is a little damaged too</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy again</li>
            <li> I read a lot of great reviews of this product before I ordered but I will still surprised by the quality when I received it. I guess for the price I didn&#x27;t expect much, but I was blown away. The eye shadows and lip colors are all highly pigmented and go on nice and smooth. The foundation and concealer is nice, it reminds me of the heavy, full coverage MAC studio products. This product is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I like it alot the colors are nicley pigmented the dc oncealers good the blushes r good a little goes a long way though and the lip palettes nice there not sticky wich i like note i use a primer some colors not many require a primer and a touch of concealer to get full color and u have to buildup the color with some yet i really like it and honestly bn a cosmetologist ive not come across any shadows u can just pur on w/o a primer or a little concealer its deffinetley worth the money and anyone can benifit from buying :)</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! IT HAS ALOT OF COLORS!! ITS VERY PIGMENTED!! STAYS ON ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! BYE IT NOW!!</li>
            <li> This package is all you truly need besides mascara, some eyeliner and brushes. Met all my expectations. Colors are vibrant and you have a wide variety of color combs and choices.</li>
            <li> I bought this for halloween and have been using it ever since.e There are so many colors that are wearable in this set of pallets. I tend to be a make up snob and only got this for the crazy colors, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very saturated, there is little to no fall out and they last all night.</li>
            <li> THE SHADOWS ARE REALLY PIGMENTED AND IT BRINGS A GOOD SELECTION OF COLORS .. THIS IS ONE OF MY BEST MAKEUP PURCHASES , THE LIPSTICKS ARE PIGMENTED AS WELL AND THE BLUSHES AND BRONZERS I REALLY LIKE.. HOWEVER IM NOT HAPPY WITH THE CONCEALERS THEY GET PATCHY AND DONT COVER WELL.. I WOULD MUCH RATHER USE THE COASTAL SCENTS ECLIPSE PALLETE .. OVERALL AWESOME BUY AND A MUST HAVE IF U LOVE MAKEUP OR ARE BUILDING UP YOUR COLLECTION .. XOXO</li>
            <li> My daughter is 29 and always used the cheap stuff. She was thrilled to receive this for Christmas and uses it all the time. There are beautiful, long lasting colors in a well built case.</li>
            <li> this makeup set is amazing. i do my own makeup for photo shoots and the pallets are beautiful and vibrant. the makeup photographs really well and is not hard to put on and stays without running under hot lights.</li>
            <li> I love these products, and this is my favorite, I love that it is super high quality and the pigments are so rich. I literally threw away all my other makeup from other brands. I am now a loyal Shany Girl!</li>
            <li> This set is really awesome! I Purchased this set partially based on the reviews and for once, the reviews were completely accurate. I love every thing about this set, everything included is usable: the concealers, the blushes, and the shadows and the lip color palette are all compatible with my complexion, which was a concern of mine after seeing the pictures. I anticipate hours of fun for my daughter and I.</li>
            <li> Wow is all I have to say, seriously. You can&#x27;t get ONE palette this cheap, and this comes with 7 of them. SO convenient for traveling. You&#x27;re entire face is in one book. This is seriously highly recommended for makeup lovers and beginners.</li>
            <li> This is truly amazing!! I love how I have all my favorite makeup and I can use everything. It so neat and you can organize it the way you want it. You have it all in this little box lipsticks, blushes, concealers, and eyeshadows. Not only can I do my own makeup, I can also do my sisters since it compliments every skin tone. Very pigmented and affordable, you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> My wife loved the quality and all the colors will be a great gift.</li>
            <li> Just perfect. FOUR layers of eye shadows - beautiful, super-pigmented, long lasting colors. None of the shadows are chalky, they feel super satiny. A blush palette - the colors are gorgeous, and a little goes a long way so you really don&#x27;t need that much, and again, super pigmented. A lipstick palette - *droolworthy*. And finally, the concealer-foundation palette - so creamy and perfect. I would totally get the whole kit JUST for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Double thumbs up to Shany!</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing this makeup kit after falling in love with the brushes that I ordered from this company. The brushes were such high quality that I felt comfortable spending money on makeup from them as well. I am so glad that I did because this kit is awesome. I was looking to replace my current makeup set because it was running low, but I did not want to spend an arm and a leg again. This makeup kit is much better than the one that I had (it was nyx) and it was nearly half the price! I now have almost all of the makeup that I need to get ready each day in one compact and convenient place. I am definitely a happy shopper and highly recommend any of the Shany Cosmetics products, especially this one.</li>
            <li> The lip stick and concealer palettes are my favorite.</li>
            <li> if i could give more than five stars, i would. you have everything you&#x27;ll ever need in this set. the colors range from super bright to classic neutrals. the shades of blush are perfect for all skin tones. concealer palette is great for freelancing because you can mix these shades to create custom colors. this is amazing, will suggest to everyone.</li>
            <li> Wow amazing Make up set! It really is a master piece set, comes with blush, eye shadow, lip palette and foundation and primer and concealer with a lot of choose from!</li>
            <li> When it comes to buying makeup, I prefer to buy palettes and \\&quot;All in ones\\&quot; and this is one of my favorites.Its perfect because there are a lot of neutral colors and you can do every type of smokey eye.</li>
            <li> this is a great buy for the beginner makeup artist I just started school and needed to have a basic kit since I didnt wear makeup before starting. It has everything you would need.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A MAKEUP ARTIST...FREELANCE MAKEUP ARTIST DREAM COME TRUE!! THIS SET HAS IT ALL!! BLUSHES..LIPS..EYES..CONCEALER!! OMG!! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND 1000%</li>
            <li> this set it AMAZING! it comes with so much variety and it&#x27;s so worth the price!, i will definitely try to tell my best friend about it!</li>
            <li> Amazingly quick delivery! i received it the very next day!&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was superb! The kit box was protected by a molded styrofoam encasement. The kit itself was securely wrapped in plastic. Every tray was individually wrapped with a plastic tray cover over each one. The products are all intact.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many choices in colors, each categorized on a separate tray. There are shades for every skin tone. Very highly pigmented and very little fallout. The variety of shades in concealers are creamy and go on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;The case that all the trays fit in is magnetic and holds everything nicely and compactly.&lt;br /&gt;Handy for travel. Great for photoshoots.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any make-up enthusiast!</li>
            <li> Must say GREAT brushes!!! super affordable and such great product!!!</li>
            <li> this collection has every color you could imagine. This is another must have by shany. I love this collection. You can not go wrong with this. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> I love the makeup set just the thing to start a person out with for a new makeup trunk, i would like to see more big set like this and for the same grate price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard and expensive to piece together makeup from different manufacturers, then I have to do additional blending.  I love how, in a boxed kit, I have concealer (which I use as foundation), blush, lip colors, and 4 pallets of eye shadow.  I don&#x27;t give it all 5 stars is because I have combination skin, and after a hour of applying makeup I start to shine.  There also is not additional pallet for powdering the face, and I would like to have the names of the colors listed.  Despite that, I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Ok I have bought all the high end cosmetics you can think of. I read the reviews on this item and made my decision soley based on the great reviews. THEY WERE RIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit has everything and I LOVE and MEAN love the eye shadows. They go on easy and do not go on my face nor my clothes when putting them on. The colors are magnificent and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS. It has every color you could possibly. I love that the whole thing is so portable and it even has blushes and neutrals and bright colors. I absolutely LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> this huge pallet has every color you can think of, would work great for any makeup artist beginner or master. great price for how much is in this pallet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not as good as UD, Mac,and others.</li>
            <li> Eye shadows are really pretty</li>
            <li> I use this product every day! This is the holy grail of make up kits and the price is very reasonable for the amount of product you are getting! 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> Everything is awesome...from the highly pigmented and blendable eyeshadow colors, to the excellent coverage concealer, lovely lip shade and beautiful blushes...I love Shany products and won&#x27;t use any other...especially when it comes to there eyeshadows...Can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this kit...worth more than the price listed at $59.95...WOW! :-)</li>
            <li> The 7 layer master piece is awesome.  The eyeshadows has a good pigment and it has all the colors.</li>
            <li> I watched this set for months, and even read all the reviews. So when my husband bought this for me for Christmas I was ecstatic! Let me tell you, this set is more than I could have asked for!! It is absolutely beautiful! And you get so much product for a price that you can&#x27;t beat. It was really well protected during delivery, and arrived so much faster than expected. The kit itself is housed in a beautiful box with pull out trays that are in order by color and product. If you are looking for a good starter kit or just looking to expand your make up collection, I definitely recommend this one. This literally is almost everyting you need. In one box!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product! I have all kinds of eyeshadows to choose and i love doing makeup on others.</li>
            <li> I ordered my My Shany Cosmetics Masterpiece make-up set on May 10, 2013 and recieved exactly one week later. It was very fast shipping and the make-up was absolutely beautiful and very pigmented I have a wedding gig coming up and I cant wait to use it on the ladies. I&#x27;m very satisfied and I will definitely will be ordering this kit again. :)</li>
            <li> I love love this set, the colors are super pigmented, the concealer is nice and runs smooth...over i thought it was a great but</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the set up of this kit, very accessible, sturdy, and you have almost everything you need to create an amazing face. Great starter kit for someone just starting off in makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup set. The colors are beautiful and they feel light and clean on the skin. They last all day on me and they don&#x27;t make my face itch!( I have extremely sensitive skin!) I love all the color options you get for the price. I love how it all fits in the little box, I can travel with it easily. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product!</li>
            <li> My wife loves to experiment with makeups, this was a great way to sample a lot of high quality makeup and then buy more of the stuff she uses frequently. She told me it was the best gift I&#x27;d ever given her and frankly got me a load of brownie points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She looks amazing, it didn&#x27;t cost much; she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars.</li>
            <li> Bulk buying is a great way to save money and this is an awesome brand and product. I  will definitly buy again for our school!</li>
            <li> oh my gosh this stuff is amazing and you get a bunch for the money you spend never buying makeup any where else :)</li>
            <li> Im so inlove with this amazing true to color make up kit. My only concern is the concealer. It looks very glossy and waxy. Im afraid to put it on because it look like it wont blend correctly without giving me shiny highlighted areas. I havent tried the lip gloss yet but so far they look goregouse. This kit is perfect for all woman of color. Thats why I named it forever perfect because you practically have all the colors you need right at your finger tips. If you are a professional, i would use a white base color on my eyelids to really make the colors pop!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  Comes with all kinds of colors that she can mix and create different shades, etc.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this Shany Cosmetics system from Amazon.com. I really Love this system it is so pigmented!!! There are some Pros and a Con That I found, But I highly recommend these products to Everyone!! I have a live demonstration on my YouTube channel for people that are interested in  seeing the pigmentation on women of Color. visit this Link  https://youtu.be/c6XwUbo0g1k  Pros: Very pigmented   easy to blend with other colors   Great Quality but affordable   Great Packaging   Peta strict 100%   Easy Storage   Can create everyday looks as well as dramatic night looks   Beginner friendly but advanced for makeup artistry  Cons: The only con for me was the concealers, they were on the dry side for my skin so I could not use them.I I tried to apply them wet but it still didn&#x27;t work for my skin type. But this may not be a problem for most people as I suffer from Eczema. A person with oily to combination will benefit from these concealers.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented!!.love the colors!!!</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are strongly pigmented and do not look ashy or powdery. The lipsticks are colourtful and mixed with a lip pencil last a long while. Everything you need to enhance your foundation in on place. I am loving my Shany Cosmetic 7 piece masterkit and will be recommending to all my friends.</li>
            <li> One of my fav pallets. So many colors all in one box.</li>
            <li> Wonderful &#x27;starter kit&#x27; for make up beginners. Not as pigmented as I had imagined it would be but it&#x27;s still a great kit to have.</li>
            <li> I love the palettes!! It have great colora and an excellent variety to choose from when working with specific colors.</li>
            <li> VERY pigmented shades..creamy concealers, but come off a little ashy on my skin but it&#x27;s fine if well blended. Nice, buttery eyeshadows! Color pay-off is insane (in a good way lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blushes are super pigmented and probably my favorite part of the entire kit. Even though one of my blushes arrived to me all broken and smashed I managed to google a remedy to fix broken powders/blushes on Youtube now it&#x27;s back to new! I highly recommend this kit beginners who want to experiment with makeup and also to anyone wanting to have an All-in-one go-to makeup kit.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that I wouldn&#x27;t like this because sometimes what you read is not what you get! but the colors are vibrant, and an array of colors shades. Love the package, it has a pull out ribbon that is easy to use. There is no need for me to remove makeup from it&#x27;s box, I placed in right in my makeup trunk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a make up junkie late in life. This kit is well worth the money. The only tray I don&#x27;t see myself using is the lip tray. The eyeshadows are very pigmented I love experimenting with the all the color choices each day.</li>
            <li> Great! Everything I expected. The colors are very pigmented. I received many compliments the first time I did my eyes using this product.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product,  the box that the makeup is hold in, was broken. So that wasnt a good start. Then I saw a few fingerprints in the makeup palettes.&lt;br /&gt;  PROS:&lt;br /&gt;~Very easily goes on brushes.&lt;br /&gt;~Comes in box for organization.&lt;br /&gt;  CONS:&lt;br /&gt;~Makeup is cakey&lt;br /&gt;~eyeshadow falls onto face alot.&lt;br /&gt;~ concealer palette is very cakey and doesn&#x27;t smooth well.&lt;br /&gt;~Blush is too bold and falls off brush&lt;br /&gt;~lip gloss palette doesn&#x27;t last long on lips&lt;br /&gt;.The reviews I saw on YouTube and Amazon made me want to get it . I was so excited at first but ended up being very disappointed in this product. I don&#x27;t know why there are good reviews on this.  I do not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> Holy crap, this is a great deal! You really have everything you will need to do your makeup here. And I love how the packaging is designed - ingenious!</li>
            <li> Wow! Layers and layers of make up! haha. Very good packaging! Nothing was broken! This is the box of makeup that you will ever need! Seriously. I love the blushes! Goes on perfectly on my skin tone! A little last all day long! This makeup box saves a lot of space! A very good investment!</li>
            <li> Everything that you ever wished for in experiementing with color is in this set! Very organized and well packaged! easy for storage and will protect your eyeshadows from breaking. Quality is breathtaking.I feel like a pro. This will last for years for practicing on myself and others &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I bought the SHANY cosmetic masterpiece set just last week and I was impressed with the quality, case and the design of the case. I was worried of the price being inexpensive because cheaper makeup causes issues for my skin, I have tried everything out and am extremely happy how it feels on my skin. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel irritated or breakout when I use it. Anyway, everything came in just like it describes, no items were broken at all, and they packaged the product very well also. The eye shadows are all that I trusted they would be and some of the colors mix very well. The concealer pallet was the important piece for me. I didn&#x27;t want a concealer that is overwhelming or feels sleek. The concealer in this set covers well and you can mix a custom color which good for contouring. I highly recommend this and will probably buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my cosmetics kit, for my clients and myself. The shadows are very pigmented and a little goes a long way with the concealer palette. This is a great buy at an even better price.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the color selections and it being a &amp;#34;one stop shop&amp;#34; for makeup. It&#x27;s definitely good for someone that is starting out to wearing makeup. You get the option of trying on all of those colors without having to &amp;#34;go out and keep buying until you find the right one&amp;#34;. Just have fun with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problems I have is that:&lt;br /&gt;1- what are the color names? - so I can buy it in travel compact form&lt;br /&gt;2- I wish I had empty compact cases to put these in so I can travel with whichever one I&#x27;m wearing for the day (especially the lip gloss).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end it&#x27;s still a good buy I just think they should&#x27;ve thought about these things since they are trying to get the everyday wearer to buy it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit leary of this make up set, but I absolutely love it.  Eyeshadows are highly pigmented, blush is amazing, and so is lip color.  Concealer/foundation is cream so it makes contouring very easy.  The only wish I have is that the Concealer/foundation color include darker shades.  I&#x27;m accustomed and use CAO cosmetics.....this is very comparable to CAO....I just wish the concealer was available in a much darker shade.  Overall love this kit, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> finally received and I must say I love love love this! great products for professional or personal use.</li>
            <li> This complete set is exactly what you may be looking for. I am a MAC lover and was sceptical of this product, however it was much better than I expected. Everything from the shadows to the lipstick it is all good quality stuff. I love the blush. I don&#x27;t believe you would be disappointed with it!</li>
            <li> Honestly i can buy the same thing off ebay for like 30% off this price. Same quality everything. I have to keep layering the bright colors. Not pigmented. Im not picky, I just know my stuff. Although Shany&#x27;s is great for Beginners.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone, It is awesome and perfect for all, just beyond words the best ever and worth every penny! So many colors to choose from, where do I begin!</li>
            <li> I love this set and I tell all my friends about it.  This along with the brushes is the best way to start off trying different make up looks.</li>
            <li> I have recently been looking into make-up as a hobby and doing it just for fun so I purchased this product. It&#x27;s very nice I have played around with it twice since getting it, although I haven&#x27;t tried the lip palette and foundation palette inside I was pleased with the eye shadows. There are lots of colors to be creative with, the eye shadows are a good size and the blushes are huge, and my shipping was very timely. I am loving the new eye shadows and can&#x27;t wait to have more fun with them such as a night out!</li>
            <li> Also purchased this as a gift with the Shany cream foundation and Camouflage set.  Person I gifted really enjoys both products and she loves the colors and how easily it is applied.</li>
            <li> My husband surprised me with this SHANY COSMETICS 7 LAYERS ALL IN 1 MASTERPIECE, I got it the last week of march and I&#x27;ve been using it pretty much everyday since then (today is 4-20-13). I don&#x27;t really want to bore you with long paragraphs so I will try to make this short and sweet :)&lt;br /&gt;---PROS---&lt;br /&gt;*COMES COMPLETELY PACKAGED IN STYROFOAM (4 SAFE TRAVELS)&lt;br /&gt;*MAGNETIC FLIP SIDE OPEN &amp; CLOSE&lt;br /&gt;*7 PULL OUT TRAYS, WITH PLACTIC COVERS AND A BLACK RIBBON ON THE END.&lt;br /&gt;*112 EYESHADOWS!

            <li> My product came on time and in perfect condition. All make up was properly shipped, wrapped, and in tact. No broken make up. Will definitely. Order more in the future. The colors are perfect! This turned out to be a great birthday present.</li>
            <li> I received this kit in great condition and in a timely manner.  I really, really LOVE this set.  I normally buy MAC, Smashbox, and Bare Minerals cosmetics, so I had higher expectations in terms of quality.  I felt the colors were nicely pigmented with a good consistency and variety.  I feel like a little kid... every night when my actual kids go to sleep, I go in the bathroom and play with different looks.  This kit is great for that, but also comes with so many neutrals that you can get good everyday wear out of it too.  The only thing that wasn&#x27;t exceptionally great was the concealer-- I felt like it flaked off my skin.  To be fair, I have only had this about a week, and my skin has been a little dry lately, so I can&#x27;t say its the concealer 100%.  Besides that, this kit is really great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this palette! The colors are super pigmented and are a nice variety.  My favorite things are the blush and concealer palettes.  This is my go to makeup item at the moment.  I received it fast and the packaging was safe.  I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and she is very happy with it. I would recommend this product to any one who is into makeup because my wife is very happy that I got this for her.</li>
            <li> love the colors so pretty and different</li>
            <li> I really love it, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love the colors perfect for my makeup class . Perfect size and Very good quality Product.&lt;br /&gt;review@shanycosmetics.com</li>
            <li> OMG i love this makeup set! My friend has it and i am so jealous....im saving up so i can buy it for myself. You can stack all the layers in little drawers within the packaging so it all keeps neatly together!! This is such a good buy.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in time and the kit its just fine,nothing broken even I was afraid of such things due to distance.Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love Shany products, So when I finally got this package I jumped for Joy! This Case has all you every need to Eye shadow with neon colors to eye shadows that would be perfect for a smoky eye look. When you buy this, You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a complete set of eyeshadows, lip colors, blushes and concealers!! Not only do u get all this but the variety in all the palettes is amazing. Very pigmented and long lasting. If u don&#x27;t want alot of makeup taking over your house this will be perfect as it is all together in one place! The concealers are a bit thick but u won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> This came right on time and the packaging and protection was awesome. The colors are very pigmented and great quality for the price. I am very impressed with sit and hope the other products are just as good. Do not regret this buy:3</li>
            <li> I loved the colors and how easy the pallets are put together. Nice for on the go, or for traveling.</li>
            <li> most of the eye shadows are ok. the lip colours are great. tried the foundation once and never again VERY CHALKY AND WHITE</li>
            <li> My Salon, Omaha Hair Extensions Salon in Omaha, Nebraska ran a \\&quot;Senior Picture Package\\&quot; promotion that included a hairstyle and makeover for their senior pictures. The Shany cosmetics 7-piece set did the trick and made the photos turn out flawless. The photographer was impressed and my clients and their parents were very happy with the results! The shipment arrived well before its due date and that helped me beable to book appointments that much sooner! Thanks Shany and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Everything is right here in a small compact case. Every color you could imagine! Such a bargain buy!! Shany Rules!</li>
            <li> I love all the beautiful colors. The color stays on all day .so many colors to choose from that you dont need to buy other eyeshadow, everything comes on the compact concealer even lip color. Very well packed no shadows were broken. Amazon has everything you need. Fast shipping. I love amazon great job</li>
            <li> this is my first review ever... but this way worth taking the time out to brag about it! hands down its fab! colors are really pigmented and layout is easy to use. I get alot of ppl asking about it. it comes in handy try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used MAC or Mary Kay products. I&#x27;m glad to say that I&#x27;ll be adding Shany Cosmetics to my makeup routine. The pigments are vibrant and last a long time. My favorite item in the box is the blush palette. I&#x27;ll definitely be using Shany Cosmetics on myself and my clients. :-)</li>
            <li> Love it! Very pigmented colors, long lasting, not chalky.</li>
            <li> I received this all in one make up set as a Christmas gift. I wasn&#x27;t too sure if I would like it at first (make up snob), then I fell in love!!!! This make up set has nearly EVERY color in really cool pull out trays (with a plastic case to cover it too). It even has a lip palette, primer, and concealer which is in a cream base!! I love the dark colors, neutral colors and bright colors too. Great quality for great price :)!!!</li>
            <li> arrived very quick packaged well and just down right amazing you have everything you need in one i will start buying shany products more because its better on my skin and leaves a clean finish</li>
            <li> I got a nail art jems for christams and i tried them. The best I have ever used!! :) My nails are great, and i am getting great complements on them!</li>
            <li> I received this kit for Christmas, and at first I thought it was way too much -- but now I find myself using it all the time! The quality is great, and there are lots of fun colors to try out. Even though I tend to stick to the neutrals, it&#x27;s nice to know that I have brighter options available.</li>
            <li> I received this kit today. Came packed very well and the shadows are very nice and pigmented the blushes are also very pigmented use a light hand when applying but that&#x27;s a good thing because you use less product. Concealer is very nice and creamy. I swatched but will be using it in a tutorial on YouTube very soon.</li>
            <li> All my friends are so jealous that I have so many choices now this product is amazing.  For a great price great quality and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Pro- This product came shipped in all original plastic and none of the makeup was cracked or dried out in any of the layers.&lt;br /&gt;  - The colors are amazing. Try to use an eye primer. The lighter colors will pop better ( I don&#x27;t see this as a con some might)&lt;br /&gt;  - My eyes did not fade away through the day and the lipstick was bright and bold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con- The picture provided of the blush is light than what you get but still nice colors for blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with my purchase. I love how strong the box is and has a magnet on the opening lid that is very nice. I could travel with this box and not be worried.  This set would be perfect for someone who loves to play with color and try new things, or as a gift for a friend. I bought this for $60.00 I gave it as 4 star because I think its worth $50 and the because of the blush image does not match.</li>
            <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok I absolutely loved these makeup set!!&lt;br /&gt;They were all perfectly organized into this shany box&lt;br /&gt;all the colors are organized by shades on its own disk</li>
            <li> I just got this as a birthday gift and love it! Have been experimenting with new colors and makeup styles lately, and my sister-n-law got this for me to try. The colors have a shimmer that I love and it last all night! Recommend for anybody that wants color options! don&#x27;t forget EcoTools brushes!!</li>
            <li> had this set for awhile its amazing especially the blushes love the orange blush also like the foundation colors eyeshadows are ok use them daily</li>
            <li> WHOEVER GIVES A BAD REVIEW ON THIS ITEM IS NUTS! LOL dON&#x27;T WANT TO START  A WAR BUT I HAVE BEEN RANTING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT TO MY CLIENTS AND FELLOW MAKEUP ARTISTS. I WAS SOOOO IMPRESSED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First ,let me start off with the packaging.Every tray that you get comes WITH POTS IN  wonderfully sized amounts.They are covered with a plastic sheet then wrapped in plastic individually with care. There should be no horror stories of messy product from shipping because the entire box then is placed in Styrofoam case.I was like a little girl opening a present when I opened theses lovely trays layer by layer.each layer has it&#x27;s own slide in compartment in the box so you can let this case sit on its own on a counter and it will be safe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, QUALITY!!!&lt;br /&gt;The quality of Shany&#x27;s makeup hands down can go up with the top cosmetics lines..mac,sephora,ben nye, graftobian..etc.. i use them all.And the concealers in this palette have great coverage!They feel so creamy and a little goes a long way with the right setting products etc. However even on it&#x27;s own day to day it will last you a good time.Again these,pots are NICELY sized so you are not paying for just samples put together,They really put thought into giving more for what you pay!The eye shadows look gorgeous and give the presentation of the top mac pro palettes and others..I did several swatches of colors on my hand and the product still left stained color when i wiped it off!I was skeptical when i read it had a lip palette.Because normal lip palettes are so cheap feeling and the just come out looking like glosses. But, these lipsticks actually have a thick creamy consistency! tried a nude color and got compliments.The blushes are pigmented as well.I would definitely refer this to anyone looking for alot of quality makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, customer service was superb i got this within three days i appreciate the time put into it.However i went to the shany cosmetics site and was bombed when i saw they had a sell on this offering this makeup set, a caryring  makeupcase, another blush set, brushes and eye gel liners for 198.00!Had i know about that I would&#x27;ve order all of Shany&#x27;s products on their site, rather than doing all my shopping else where to add to my kit.I was pretty upset with that because i paid wayyyy more shopping here.but i am pleased with their products and service I am hoping i get hooked up with this review : ) thanks so much I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I also bought some brushes eta cosmetics,setting spray,setting powders,lipsticks and they work so well with my shany purchase! 5 stars hands down would purchase more when i can afford to.  beautynmor@gmail.com</li>
            <li> I loved this product I was so excited to get it!! Great quality I will buy it again. I received it a little earlier than what I expected and the packaging was nice. :)</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, colors or great👌</li>
            <li> The blushes are very red, or pink.  No browns, so you have to have a light hand or you will come out looking like a tomato.  Lip color is great, very pigmented.  Eye shadow is terrible.  I have to put layer after layer on to get it to show up.</li>
            <li> this has everything you need. foundations, bronzer&#x27;s, blush, lip gloss and eye shadows. I love the wide variety in colors.</li>
            <li> I recieved one of the kits as a gift. Most of my family knows anymore just go on Amozon and look for Shany cosmetics for me for gifts.  I love this line. Anyway, I take this kit with me everywhere I go.  It is fantastic to have.  It let&#x27;s you look fresh all day.  How many times has the Supervisor called at the last minute and dumped a client to wine and dine on you for the evening.  Well you don&#x27;t have time to go home and redo the makeup, this kit becomes the lifesaver.  Slip into the restroom wash your face and put on new makeup, you look fresh and the client is happy.  Or, better yet it&#x27;s just before 5:00 and your Hubby, or the man in your life, calls and says he&#x27;s taking you to a romantic Dinner.  Duck into the restroom, wash your face, put on new makeup.  Your man will definately appreciately the effort, and you will definately appreciate him later on.  A DEFINATE MUST HAVE!! Linda W.</li>
            <li> I got one for myself after seeing some reviews on YouTube.  This is a great kit for my girls that love bright colors at an affordable price.  So I got one for my sister.  We&#x27;re both mothers of multiple children, and I am all about being fabulous and chic on a budget.  There are ways to have quality products at an affordable price; this is one of them.  And with being an amazon shopper, you get it at a discounted price.  Happy Shopping!</li>
            <li> Product is excellent.... very pigmented array of colors; stays on all day. Large combination of shadows, primers,  lip creams &amp; blushes. Definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of this product before opting to buy it and a lot of people gave it very positive comments. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed when I got mine, actually I was really impressed. The lip colours are very bold and they last long. My sister used the blushes and immediately went to order a palette for herself. The eyeshadows are just awesome. Doesn&#x27;t fall out or cake when used. I&#x27;m very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Amazing products! definitely worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> This makeup kit is okay. I love the eye shadow palettes, but I am not too fond of the blush, concealer, and lipstick palette.</li>
            <li> Love it so much thank you.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Cosmetics, which seem to be good.  I also ordered and received a Shany makeup case and trolley together.  Goods arrived together however, shipping costs were outrageous, the goods were received quickly which was good.  The shipping cost more than the items themselves though, and I&#x27;m annoyed with myself for not double checking.  Very expensive error on my behalf.</li>
            <li> best thing ever! i loved this there was such a wide variety of colors and they were so pigmented and beautiful i wont ever think twice about this purchase it was well worth my money! i have repurchased this twice! and won&#x27;t stop!</li>
            <li> ALL ASPIRING MAKE UP ARTIST!!!...you should be buying this!  This is a great beginning to a kit!  The shadows are great, you have your blushes and your lips, all for a great price!  You can not beat this deal!  I love all Shany products and this is not any different! love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing! i loveeeeeee it!</li>
            <li> SHANY Cosmetics is awesomeness! I love, love, love this makeup. The colors are so vibrant and beautiful on my skin. The colors do not fade throughout the day. The powders go on smooth and the creams are soft and dewy. I totally recommend for all skin tones and types.</li>
            <li> We all should get this it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> Being the make-up snob I am, I have to say these are excellent products, especially considering how inexpensive they are. I was impressed with the eye-shadows in particular, as I have very sensitive eyes and 80% of eye make-up (high-end or not) I can only wear for a few hours before my eyes turn red and watery and I have to wipe it off or risk looking like a fly, but I was able to wear this eye shadow for a full day with no problems (only found one other non-mineral brand that lets me do this).  The kit is pretty convenient for transportation as well.</li>
            <li> I honestly could say that this the best kit bought to start my freelance makeup business👍👍</li>
            <li> Love all the color and a great size not too bulky. Superfast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Love this for the price. Very pigmented!  Some of the colors do pop out but I just keep plastic covers on and have no problems!</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of money at Mac and Sephora for great makeup and lo and behold I found this kit at a great price that has everything!!!  The pigments of the shadow is great...and do have some fall out...but so does urban decay lol...the blush is also great and much brighter and gorgeous in person..and very comparable to nars...which is a my go to blush brand!  I like the texture of the concealer, I haven&#x27;t used it yet but the texture is less oily than my MUFE camo concealer palette...You def get bang for your buck here and this company is only 7 years old and from the quaity of the products they will eventually become much higher in the future so don&#x27;t hesitate and buy now!!!</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING u need, greatttt starter!!! 10X10!!!!!</li>
            <li> It all LOOKS great, but I was shorted the tray with all of the concealer in it. I got another tray of shadow instead. As soon as the package arrived I wrote and said what had happened and never heard back. I haven&#x27;t used any of it yet because I planned on exchanging it for one that had the concealer in it, just in case they didn&#x27;t want to just ship that tray out I didn&#x27;t want to use it. It is a shame. I ordered it when I discovered it existed to take on a trip to Europe where I would be wearing  A LOT of makeup. I liked the convenience of it and not having to pack up a bunch of little things. I&#x27;d still like to resolve this issue, and when it is done I&#x27;ll happily fix the review.</li>
            <li> Very great product! My new favorite brand of makeup! I never knew I could find something better than MAC cosmetics!.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love quality of Shany products... beautiful array of eyeshadow colors strongly pigmented; my only problem is I ordered several of these palettes in one purchase (to give them as gifts for some of my friends) and one of them came without lipsticks and concealers tray... on the other hand, looking at all 4 I bought, I can see they all came with completely different assortment of colors... not only eyeshadows but blushes too. It&#x27;s a shame because quality is really awesome! I strongly recommend these products, I would just ask SHANY to take more care when packing them to keep standards and comply with description and photos published</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I DO NOT INCLUDE THE PALETTE LIP, NO layer of foundation and primer and concealer INCLUDES,  ONLY SHADOWS</li>
            <li> Most everything in here has good pigment. Some-what chalky texture to the shadows. Love the variety. Happy with the price. Usually you can get only one 10 eyeshadow palette for this price. I wish the structure the product sits in was a nicer material &amp; that it would have an actual acrylic lid hinged to each &amp;#34;palette&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love this thing but could not give it 5 stars because a couple of the lip gloss are a bit clumpy. Everything is great and I like that everything is there for almost any skin color. I am not a makeup artist but do help out other girls. I love that it is travel friendly. Love all the colors in the eye shadows. I do find they go on better and brighter with a primer but you should always have a primer on before applying eyeshadow. The blushes are on the red side so a little goes a long way but are very versatile with blending. Love this and do and will continue to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product included is awesome! The box and layers are neat, I thought at first it was going to be crap but it was the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> This collection was everything I hoped for and more. It was wonderful to take on my vacation. It arrived in protective packaging so all of the palettes were in tact. I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to makeup lovers.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my girlfriend to give on Valentine&#x27;s Day... She has been using it for a couple of weeks and absolutely loves it.  I will let her go ahead and review the pros of the product: I received this product as a gift and it is extraordinary. The variety of the colors is awesome and the fact that they are vibrant and actually stay on makes this product even more worth it. I would recommend this product to both make-up professionals and lay people alike.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an early mothers day gift and my wife even gave me a kiss when she find out... Wohoo!! for me.&lt;br /&gt;she keeps changing hobbies like crazy... NOW is make up!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But very nice stuff and pricey too...!!!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect item to have rather your a beginner or a pro, I must say I love the fact that it has seven layers with everything u need. You don&#x27;t have to look in random make-up bags.</li>
            <li> I loved it. The colors are so rich and vibrant. The lip glosses surprised me. I expected them to be like the cheap glosses that look one way and when you put them on aren&#x27;t as smooth or true to color. Im so glad I was wrong. Id definitely order another one. This package is a make-up must have.</li>
            <li> YouTube this product. I am just starting to play with eyeshadows and am looking forward to mastering the 3D eyeshadow look I have been seeing online. The YouTube reviews have all been positive and I have had the opportunity to try out a few colors and they all went on nice and true to shade and if you want heavier it will go on nicely too. I do not wear make up frequently or routinely but when I do I make a statement and from what I have seen this will do it.</li>
            <li> Really well packaged... Convenient trays that slide out!  Some of the shadows are not true to color which is the reason for the 4-star rating.  Definitely use the shadows with a primer!</li>
            <li> in few words i really recommend this set to all ladies, you can find most of the coluors we use daily (eyeshodows &amp; lip gloss):&lt;br /&gt;1-  eyeshdows are easy to apply &amp; mix together, it saty for long time as well &amp; it doesn&#x27;t shed around the eye as some of other eyeshadows do.&lt;br /&gt;2- lip gloss colours are nice &amp; colourfull.&lt;br /&gt;3- the blushers come with light, dark pink, bronze &amp; brown. it got a heavy texture that stay for long time, i put it on morning go to work &amp; i dont need to apply it again on my skin as it stay the whole day. you need to apply alittle on you cheeck to get the color.&lt;br /&gt;4- concealers  come with diffrent colors that can match all the skin types, but its alittle bit dry, but i found an easy solution i just use the INGLOT duraline , you can get it from inglot stores its an oil for the makepup. so once i put little of that on the concealers it worked perfectly on my skin &amp; it doesnt make lines under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i advise you to get the set, you get a very good quality with a good price, i even stop using my expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but at the last i would ask SHANY company how we can refill the colours or the item once it finish?</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t write reviews but upon receiving my Shany 7 layer Masterpiece Kit I decided to write one immediately. This product is amazing. I feel like a walking mua because I have everything in this one box to create a stunning look. Not to mention how its all bundled together the box it comes in is well constructed. The pigment of the eye shadow is awesome. I never bought any shadow this pigmented. Overall I give this product 5 stars I will be ordering brushes soon I will do a review on those as well.</li>
            <li> I love love love this set. It comes with everything you would need and so many different colors of eye shadows, lipsticks, concealers, and blushes. The price is very very low for such a great product! The box is also very convenient :)</li>
            <li> Bought this after a few youtube vids. And i still have it over a year later. Great shadows and concealers. Love the pay off and range of shades. Totally reccommend.</li>
            <li> This makeup set is awesome! It&#x27;s everything I&#x27;ve ever wanted in a kit. It came safely packaged in a Styrofoam container, so nothing was damaged. Plus the quality of the makeup is perfect. Well worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> Its perfect for my sister</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. The eye shadows work great over Urban Decay shadow primer. The blushes are quite pigmented -- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Loved the concealer palette so much!</li>
            <li> I bought this all-in-one set to use for wedding make-up for clients.  I used it today on myself, and then on a practice makeover for a client this evening.  I love the colors and everything about this set!  I just ordered some Shany brushes to go with it!  Super fast shipping.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> Excelent product!. I was not sure about purchasing this product, because i have had so many All-in-one sets like this one and I used just 3 or 4 colors, but believe, this colors are just amazing, they are smooth and bright, you will look just perfect!</li>
            <li> I loved it.. It blends very well &amp; is very pigmented !!</li>
            <li> It looks like mine dropped and the lid of the storage box got torn. The layers are not named so a novice in the use of makeup may have difficulty identifying each of them. That not withstanding, I think it&#x27;s great and I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. I purchased this for my 15 yr old niece and for the price it was ok. The shadows are not very pigmented, some of them are extremely chalky.  Not as good as high end brands, or even drug store makeup brands. I will say you get a lot of product for the money, however; be aware you do get what you pay for. Do not expect Mac or Makeup Forever quality shadows at this price. I am a professional MUA myself, personally I would NEVER use this on a client. But it was a neat gift for my teenage niece, she enjoyed it tremendously.</li>
            <li> im in love with this set. this product came so fast and really had great packaging. the palettes are way bigger than i expected especially the blushes. i would most differently buy again but i know this will last me for such a long time!</li>
            <li> For the most part this palette is amazing!! Great color payoff, however, the lipsticks really need improvement, there aren&#x27;t enough matte or dark brown colors in the palette.</li>
            <li> love this Item but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order SHANY from Amazon again. the reason why I say this is because I have order a lot of SHANY products from Amazon and with some Items you buy from Shany and leave feedback you get free gift/gifts beside of being an awesome products I get a free gift and all I have to do is leave a feedback why not do it. Well I never once revived anything I believe my feedback help them bring in more customers and I never had gotten a free gift. well I&#x27;ll spell it out False Advertising. but over all Shany cosmetics are the best and with Shany products I make a lot of Money..you would love this set it has everything you need except the brushes I know you would enjoy it.. It came fast and none of the pallets were broken.I will say be careful when you open the main box I almost open the wrong side. enjoy your product.</li>
            <li> As a professional Cosmologist, I originally purchased this product to help me downsize the amount of makeup I needed to carry with me for Weddings. I always try out my new stuff on myself first to familiarize my self with it and boy, did I fall in love with this makeup! The eye shadows are great, the lip colors are very pigmented, and my absolute favorite part was the cream concealers/foundations. They were excellent for highlighting/contouring. I will be using this daily! I can&#x27;t wait to order more products from Shany.</li>
            <li> I really love this make- up set. Well compact and the the shadows a great quality, good pigment and amazing colour range :)</li>
