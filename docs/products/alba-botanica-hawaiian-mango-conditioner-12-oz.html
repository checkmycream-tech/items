            <li>Not only is the fragrance amazing, but the conditioning effects are wonderful.</li>
            <li>if you know anything about good products like this, it is not the bubbles that clean.</li>

            <li>Smells great and really smooths the hair.</li>

            <li>Was looking for a conditioner that&#x27;s cheap, good-smelling and gets the job done.</li>

            <li>but it still comes out pretty easy.</li>
            <li>It not only helped the damaged hair look better, but is keeping the new growth in good condition.</li>
            <li>At first I really like this product- smells good, moisturizing, and makes the hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found out that products without coconut oil actually work BETTER than with it!</li>

            <li>your hand with this one, and gradually use less of the current shampoo &amp; more of this one till you adjust.</li>
            <li>What a mistake, the first time I attempted to detangle my hair with this conditioner it turned my amazing ringlets into an angry frizzy mess.</li>

            <li> , I need no styling, no extra products, I always let it air dry, but it sometimes needed help from a heat source to make it manageable.</li>
            <li> All of us have Asian hair very thick and black and this product made our hair messy, sticky and more frizzier.</li>
            <li> I have very very thin and fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the new shampoo</li>
            <li> But after using it for about a week, I start to notice a lot more hair in the shower drain - it&#x27;s scary!</li>
            <li> It works just as well as other conditioners that you have to leave in for several minutes.  </li>
            <li> When I went to comb my hair out of the shower my hair had that dry, matted feeling like when you forget to put in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I by no means expected my hair to feel like a million bucks</li>
            <li> careful, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you suffer from hair too oily this would be your thing but for the average person this will leave your hair scentless and dry.</li>
            <li> Some sulfate free shampoos are impossible to rinse out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy hair and often times the smoothing conditioners just flatten my hair, not smooth it with its natural body.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with  tons and tons of tiny ringlets.</li>
            <li> Over time, I noticed that I use less and less volumizing mousse (from 2-3 dollops to just 1).</li>
            <li> the hair stands that are already dead?</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair, frizzy mess which was never a problem, and my hair seems to be thinning if anything!</li>
            <li> but I did expect to at least have some moisture in my hair after stepping out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The mango smell didn&#x27;t even last longer than an hour which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> but I guess there a drawback to it being so thick.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner increases fullness in a subtle way.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>

            <li> Was looking for a conditioner that&#x27;s cheap, good-smelling and gets the job done. It&#x27;s cheap and smells good but hardly gets the job done. When I used it I loved the mango scent and had high hopes for it. When rinsing the conditioner out I noticed my hair didn&#x27;t feel quite smooth or silky like every other conditioner I ever had. When I went to comb my hair out of the shower my hair had that dry, matted feeling like when you forget to put in conditioner. It left my hair feeling like I had never put in conditioner at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering I mentioned wanting a cheap conditioner I by no means expected my hair to feel like a million bucks but I did expect to at least have some moisture in my hair after stepping out of the shower. The mango smell didn&#x27;t even last longer than an hour which was disappointing. Brushing my hair wasn&#x27;t as much hell as I thought by the feel of it but still felt like I never even conditioned it at all. Perhaps if you suffer from hair too oily this would be your thing but for the average person this will leave your hair scentless and dry.</li>
            <li> The volumizing action of Alba Botanica Body Builder shampoo works more efficiently than John Frieda&#x27;s Volume Shampoo and Conditioner IMO. This shampoo and conditioner increases fullness in a subtle way. Over time, I noticed that I use less and less volumizing mousse (from 2-3 dollops to just 1). I have very very thin and fine hair. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Gives my fine hair more body.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT. SEEMS TO WORK ALRIGHT ENOUGH.SEEMS TO HAVE MADE MY HAIR STRONGER. WASHES OUT EASILY, STOPS BREAKAGE IF YOU USE IT WEEKLY.</li>
            <li> Not only is the fragrance amazing, but the conditioning effects are wonderful.</li>
            <li> At first I really like this product- smells good, moisturizing, and makes the hair shiny and soft. But after using it for about a week, I start to notice a lot more hair in the shower drain - it&#x27;s scary! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the new shampoo (I&#x27;m using Aubrey Organics Green Tea Shampoo) or this new conditioner, or maybe it&#x27;s the combination. I&#x27;ll need to experiment and try the conditioner with a different shampoo to find out. However, even though I&#x27;m seeing more hair in the drain and on my brush, I&#x27;m happy to say that there&#x27;s no sign of bald spot or noticeable reduction of hair thickness. Maybe the conditioner is just \\&quot;exfoliating\\&quot; the hair stands that are already dead? I don&#x27;t know....</li>
            <li> Love it! Enough so that I went looking for it online when my local stores stopped carrying it. Definitly makes a&lt;br /&gt;difference in my hair in a positive way. Also have used the body building &amp; that is great, too. You have to get use to&lt;br /&gt;not so much suds, but if you know anything about good products like this, it is not the bubbles that clean. So you have to&lt;br /&gt;be careful, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. If you think you need the bubbles, I would suggest adding a bit of your current shampoo&lt;br /&gt;into your hand with this one, and gradually use less of the current shampoo &amp; more of this one till you adjust. I&#x27;ve used it for 3 - 4 years and I had damaged hair. It not only helped the damaged hair look better, but is keeping the new growth in good condition. Now that I am almost done writing this I see this one is for the conditioner. Oh well, I love it, too!</li>
            <li> Makes no difference if I use this or not, either way my hair feels unconditioned. Not recommended at all. Giovanni makes better silicone-free sulphate-free products.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with these products after using them for a week while staying at a B&amp;B in Hawaii and I&#x27;m still in love.</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair, frizzy mess which was never a problem, and my hair seems to be thinning if anything!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. Smells great and really smooths the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local store thinking I could get volume with hydration. I have thick frizzy hair and often times the smoothing conditioners just flatten my hair, not smooth it with its natural body. Well, I was wrong. I just left my hair feeling thicker and almost like wax. I would recommend for someone with finer hair.</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL  SMELLS  GOOD</li>
            <li> I was looking for a healthier more natural alternative i found this at my local comissary it is like food to my hair, I need no styling, no extra products, I always let it air dry, but it sometimes needed help from a heat source to make it manageable. This conditioner does all the work for me, soft and the perfect amount of volume I&#x27;m so impressed by it. It also smells amazing. No complaints here. I also got a bunch for like $2.50 with a coupon</li>
            <li> I bought this product in Walmart thinking it is natural and works good on my hair. I actually thought this wasn&#x27;t working only on my hair and asked my friends also try when they visited my home. No one liked it. All of us have Asian hair very thick and black and this product made our hair messy, sticky and more frizzier.</li>
            <li> I watched so many reviews on Youtube from other natural ladies and really got so excited about this product that I bought 2 bottles. What a mistake, the first time I attempted to detangle my hair with this conditioner it turned my amazing ringlets into an angry frizzy mess. I tried using more and more of it but it never seemed moisturizing enough. I have thick hair with  tons and tons of tiny ringlets. This just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and another that doesn&#x27;t contain any form of coconut or coconut oil, which I&#x27;ve found out I&#x27;m allergic to.  It&#x27;s easier to find conditioners without it than shampoos, but too many of them still contain coconut which seems to be  everywhere.  I like this conditioner, and I like the way it makes my hair feel.  I&#x27;ve found out that products without coconut oil actually work BETTER than with it!</li>
            <li> The only conditioner I buy</li>
            <li> I love this.  It smells wonderful. It feels thick and effective. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this again. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years now and my hair is significantly healthier with split ends appearing far less frequently or quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I have fine straight hair and I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner every night/ 7 days a week for about 5 months now. I find that I have to rinse my hair for an extra minute or two to get the conditioner out (when comparing to previous conditioners), but it&#x27;s so worth it to me to get the soft supple, tangle free feel to my hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a lovely, fruity scent.  I can apply it, work it through my hair well, and wash it out without waiting.  It works just as well as other conditioners that you have to leave in for several minutes.  Leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use shampoos with sulfates. I have tried more shampoo/conditioner sets than I can count and they have all been meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty fine, straight, oily hair. This shampoo/conditioner makes my hair shiny, soft and I only have to wash my hair every other day with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Plus is it&#x27;s pretty easy to rinse out. Some sulfate free shampoos are impossible to rinse out of my hair. It does take more work than traditional shampoo/conditioner but it still comes out pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Safe for the environment and no questionable chemicals on my skin. Plus, it makes my hair look and feel great. Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Great smell, when I first opened the bottle I couldnt stop sniffing it. Anyway, it was nice and creamy, didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or crunchy in the end, best part- the scent still lingers in my hair which I like. Only thing I cant say I like is that its a hell of a time trying to get the product out the bottle but I guess there a drawback to it being so thick.</li>
