            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Bonus, SAFE FOR COLOR TREATED HAIR!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so grateful for this amazing product</li>
            <li>This was an amazing discovery that solved a longstanding problem.</li>
            <li>I bought this product as the result of reading, in an Internet search, that it is effective in the treatment of wintertime splitting of the skin at the tip of fingers or the thumb.</li>
            <li>We have tried everything under the sun &amp; the Nizoral is really the perfect cure.</li>
            <li>This product is extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>The scrubby brush for the scalp is really nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best anti-dandruff shampoo ever, I just love it, it works just as soon as you use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>So far this is the best dandruff shampoo that I used.</li>
            <li>Nizoral is by far the best shampoo we&#x27;ve found to take care of cradle cap on our kids</li>
            <li>I cannot assign a causal role to the product, but it has satisfied my expectation.</li>
            <li>After I bought this,though, I discovered the doctor would prescribe the stronger, prescription Nizoral for me--and with my insurance, the stronger stuff ends up much more affordable than the over the counter Nizoral here.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping, and arrived just as promised.</li>
            <li>I had given up on anything being able to treat it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it does stop dandruff and the falling of the hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works better than anything else at taming the flaky, irritated scalp.</li>
            <li>And there&#x27;s no terrible odor!  </li>
            <li>It works better than the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li>Well its working out good for me right now</li>
            <li>Then I jump in the shower, wet my hair and scrub (with the AWESOME brush)</li>
            <li>I searched &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; on a popular website (reddit), and saw this item mentioned a couple times, and one provided a link right to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would like a free brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the original treatment I now use the shampoo about once every 2 weeks to keep flake-</li>
            <li>It is very good using for dandruff, but my hair is not smooth.</li>
            <li>I realize that this isn&#x27;t full prescription strength.</li>
            <li>Best and only dandruff shampoo on the market, that actually works!  </li>
            <li>My 34 years old son says this is by far the best anti-dandruff shampoo he has used, and the only one that doesn&#x27;t give him dandruff.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the premium price.</li>
            <li>Worth every</li>
            <li>And the little palm-sized scrub brush that came free is also effective.</li>
            <li>am buying it again because a friend said that it can help with persistent facial redness too, since many people with cradle cap have persistent redness.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad that it is back</li>
            <li>It worked so well that I generally only have to use it once a week or so to maintain a healthy scalp.</li>
            <li>I had tried everything from the local pharmacies and supermarkets, and nothing ever worked and most gave me a stinging sensation in my eyes just from the fumes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so pleased with this product, I can only hope that whoever needs it finds this page and gives it a try.</li>
            <li>It does smell good and wasn&#x27;t harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li>Cleaned out the flakes and dandruff with the first application, quick acting and effective product, highly recommended for this personal problem.</li>
            <li>The little shampoo scrubby is nice.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me, not to say it wouldn&#x27;t work for others.</li>
            <li>Thanks to nizoral.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair very often at all.</li>
            <li>This is gentle *</li>
            <li>The product showed up when it was supposed to and was very competitively priced.  </li>
            <li>That is the real difference</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my 16 year old mixed race grand daughter.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of the other AD shampoos and none of them worked like this product.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the little scalp brush is great to loosen up any dry skin on the scalp!</li>
            <li>Not super sure of the benefits of the &#x27;brush&#x27; - maybe with longer hair</li>
            <li>or so there shouldn&#x27;t still be supply problems, thus high prices.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this set with the brush</li>
            <li>Not eating wheat really helped me clear this up</li>
            <li>I have been extremely satisfied with pretty much all my past purchases, but felt I really needed to take the time and write a review for this item to possibly help anybody else dealing with severe dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the same formula used in the prescription I used to get from my dermatologist just half the strength which makes it good for regular use.</li>
            <li>Although Nizoral is expensive, and can be purchased more cheaply elsewhere, I had no problems with delivery or service.</li>
            <li>It works far better than the everyday dandruff shampoos you can buy in a drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Only product out there that really delivers!</li>
            <li>Whats even better, I only use it like once or twice every other year</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even have to touch my hair, and I would have flakes on my shoulders and could see small flakes sitting on top of my hair in the mirrors.</li>
            <li>far as the transaction goes, no complaints.  </li>
            <li>Still not get a chance to use it completely</li>
            <li>I have been fighting large scales and dandruff/psoriasis for a long time.</li>
            <li>hair is soft, not dry.  </li>
            <li>The free scalp brush is a bit too hard</li>
            <li>Not only did the product clear up the scalp dandruff problem, it eliminated the inflammation/scaling problem on my face.</li>
            <li>only takes two washes to clear up dandruff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown up with an itchy, irritated, dry, and extremely flaky scalp since I was in elementary school.</li>
            <li>It is now at the end of my first day using it, and even now still wearing the black shirt, I can rub my head and have absolutely nothing falling down onto my shoulders.</li>
            <li>Apparently they are both caused by the same fungus.  </li>
            <li>I let it sit on my scalp while I brush my teeth first giving this a few minutes to sit there and do its thing.</li>
            <li>I do lather my whole head and let is set a little  time while in the shower</li>

            <li> I let it sit on my scalp while I brush my teeth first giving this a few minutes to sit there and do its thing.</li>
            <li> I do lather my whole head and let is set a little  time while in the shower</li>
            <li> If I ever ran my fingers through my hair, the white would just continually drop from my head, no matter how long I continued.</li>
            <li> I no longer have dandruff at all, except for the occasional dry weather flake or two).  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the only thing that cleared up the dandruff from itchy, flaky, dry skin around the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> I am now excited to have my haircut and inform my barber of this product, and no longer will have to awkwardly strike up a conversation about how dry my hair is as I&#x27;m sitting in the chair with us both noticing how the black smock is absolutely covered in white flakes.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and it made the rest of my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> That has never happened from any product I&#x27;ve ever used before for as long as I can</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t let it sit so long on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Other shampoos (especially prescription!) turned my hair into straw!  </li>
            <li> I color my hair every month and the permanent color dry my scalp.</li>
            <li> Her hair is black, long &amp; curly, &amp; she gets chunks of white stuff on her scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been buying various items off Amazon since 2008, and currently average an order every week.</li>
            <li> and if you struggle with dry scalp/ dandruff/itchy scalp, using this a couple time s a week will work!  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> After a few shampoos, it goes away and you only need to use this every once in awhile for maintenance.  </li>
            <li> Tried almost every other shampoo for flaking-</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first time I used it, but i was still skeptical.</li>
            <li> Within a month of use (along with my other products) I started to see results.</li>
            <li> All other shampoos worked for awhile, maybe a week, then stopped.  </li>
            <li> , none of them have the active ingredient that this one does.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is about the pricing.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t have it and just use soap, it does not control the other symptoms I suffer with!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know which of these products specifically or what combination is what&#x27;s helping me get my hair back, but I am not willing to risk cutting any one of them and losing all the progress made so far.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time on trying the other ones out there</li>
            <li> I had hopes that this would be the cure since it was previously prescription-only.</li>
            <li> After drying off and doing a rigorous hand-through-hair test, I wore a black shirt to see how it fared throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Some would work for a little bit, but then stop.</li>
            <li> and it helps to keep the itching and redness down!  </li>
            <li> leave it on for a few minutes*</li>
            <li> Its not a huge issue</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s like patchy, excessive dandruff).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a month now and my scalp no longer itches, I have very few flakes</li>
            <li> Comes with a very firm scrubbing brush for your scalp.</li>
            <li> , you know how hard it can be to get rid of.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry out your scalp like other dandruff shampoos, and the scent isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Nizoral seems to help reduce my scalp&#x27;s itchiness, at least for a while.</li>
            <li> slow shipping</li>
            <li> No more embarrassing flakes on my collar!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how bad and majorly embarrassing it was.  </li>
            <li> Others were harsh or left a terrible odor.  </li>
            <li> And some would make my issues worse.</li>
            <li> I had horrible dandruff since we were really young.  </li>
            <li> and thats all I need to keep the crazy fungus in check.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After one particularly bad bout six years ago, I resumed the search for a cure.  </li>
            <li> It does the trick and it doesnt smell bad.</li>
            <li> I had three dime/quarter size psoriasis spots that were annoying beyond belief.  </li>
            <li> I have always been embarrassed of it and have bought an insane number of products over the years to try and fix my scalp issues.</li>

            <li> I bought this product as the result of reading, in an Internet search, that it is effective in the treatment of wintertime splitting of the skin at the tip of fingers or the thumb. I have been applying it to a deep crack on my left thumb tip and has seemed to effect the repair of the lesion. I cannot assign a causal role to the product, but it has satisfied my expectation. (Good shampoo, too.)</li>
            <li> my husband suffered from dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It relieved my husband&#x27;s seborrheic dermatitis of scalp</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me, not to say it wouldn&#x27;t work for others.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has ever helped my dandruff.  Tried almost every other shampoo for flaking- this is the one for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying a lot of shampoos and this did it.&lt;br /&gt;Yay!</li>
            <li> Just like in the store but I do not have to go to the store!</li>
            <li> Will not need if you continue use, will make your hair fall out</li>
            <li> Great product works well for me.</li>
            <li> It did wonders to my dandruf. After 3 weeks of usage I saw a miraculous change. Dandruff was gone. Thanks to nizoral.</li>
            <li> Cleaned out the flakes and dandruff with the first application, quick acting and effective product, highly recommended for this personal problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s should be anti dandruff but not a 100%, about 75-80%. I would like a free brush.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway thank you.</li>
            <li> Nizoral seems to help reduce my scalp&#x27;s itchiness, at least for a while. After I bought this,though, I discovered the doctor would prescribe the stronger, prescription Nizoral for me--and with my insurance, the stronger stuff ends up much more affordable than the over the counter Nizoral here. Go figure.</li>
            <li> Well its working out good for me right now let see what happens in the next two weeks I just started using it</li>
            <li> I have been fighting large scales and dandruff/psoriasis for a long time. Some things work for a while and lose their effectiveness. I had hopes that this would be the cure since it was previously prescription-only. I realize that this isn&#x27;t full prescription strength. It did decrease the symptoms, but it wasn&#x27;t the cure I was hoping for. It does smell good and wasn&#x27;t harsh on my hair. Sigh....The search goes on.</li>
            <li> I have never found a product that worked on my scalp issues... I&#x27;ve grown up with an itchy, irritated, dry, and extremely flaky scalp since I was in elementary school. I have always been embarrassed of it and have bought an insane number of products over the years to try and fix my scalp issues. Some would work for a little bit, but then stop. Some would never work. And some would make my issues worse. I had almost given up when I found this product online and decided to give it a try. I noticed a difference after the first time I used it, but i was still skeptical. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a month now and my scalp no longer itches, I have very few flakes if any, and I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair very often at all. I&#x27;m so grateful for this amazing product and I will continue to purchase it. Plus, the little scalp brush is great to loosen up any dry skin on the scalp! Great product, fast shipping, and arrived just as promised.</li>
            <li> The ingredient in this shampoo is the only reason I use it! Not for my hair but under my over sized belly to help with the yeast problem I have and it helps to keep the itching and redness down!  When I don&#x27;t have it and just use soap, it does not control the other symptoms I suffer with! This shampoo was recommended  by a Pharmacist.</li>
            <li> Only product out there that really delivers! Arrived on schedule. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well; I used it for a couple weeks and all signs of flakes and itchiness were gone. I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry out your scalp like other dandruff shampoos, and the scent isn&#x27;t bad at all. Not super sure of the benefits of the &#x27;brush&#x27; - maybe with longer hair it helps get the shampoo to the scalp (???), but I didn&#x27;t need it. After the original treatment I now use the shampoo about once every 2 weeks to keep flake- and itch-free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff anymore after I use 2 times. It is very good using for dandruff, but my hair is not smooth. I don&#x27;t like my hair rush.</li>
            <li> My twin sister and I had horrible dandruff since we were really young.  My mom took us to the doctor and he called it &#x27;cradle cap.&#x27;  That&#x27;s how bad and majorly embarrassing it was.  I had given up on anything being able to treat it.  After one particularly bad bout six years ago, I resumed the search for a cure.  I found Nizoral and it changed my life.  I no longer have dandruff at all, except for the occasional dry weather flake or two).  I dont know how it cured my skin, but it did.  Whats even better, I only use it like once or twice every other year and thats all I need to keep the crazy fungus in check.&lt;br /&gt;I am buying it again because a friend said that it can help with persistent facial redness too, since many people with cradle cap have persistent redness.  Apparently they are both caused by the same fungus.  I will circle back and let ch&#x27;all know how it works on skin.</li>
            <li> My 34 years old son says this is by far the best anti-dandruff shampoo he has used, and the only one that doesn&#x27;t give him dandruff.</li>
            <li> Must buy for anyone who has dandruff problems</li>
            <li> I went through virtually every standard and prescription shampoo known to western man before I found this one.&lt;br /&gt;Put it on, lather it up, *leave it on for a few minutes* then rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the 2nd or 3rd use the itching and flaking was gone.&lt;br /&gt;Not &amp;#34;reduced&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is about the pricing. I heard rumors about factory issues, but after&lt;br /&gt;two years or so there shouldn&#x27;t still be supply problems, thus high prices.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 16 year old mixed race grand daughter. Her hair is black, long &amp; curly, &amp; she gets chunks of white stuff on her scalp. This is the ONLY thing that will get rid of it. We have tried everything under the sun &amp; the Nizoral is really the perfect cure.</li>
            <li> This is the only dandruff shampoo that works for me and actually stops the itching. It is the same formula used in the prescription I used to get from my dermatologist just half the strength which makes it good for regular use. I love this product! The free scalp brush is a bit too hard and I do not find it helpful.</li>
            <li> I used to use this stuff and they had stopped selling it for  a while and I am so glad that it is back it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This was an amazing discovery that solved a longstanding problem. I had suffered with dandruff and seborrheic dermititis for years. I purchased Nizoral after doing extensive research on anti-fungal shampoos. Not only did the product clear up the scalp dandruff problem, it eliminated the inflammation/scaling problem on my face. (I applied a smidgen of the shampoo directly to my facial skin and let sit for a couple of minutes.) Haven&#x27;t used hydrocortisone cream for weeks. Although Nizoral is expensive, and can be purchased more cheaply elsewhere, I had no problems with delivery or service. And the little palm-sized scrub brush that came free is also effective.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does stop dandruff and the falling of the hair. I can wash my hair every two weeks and not feel itchy or see the flakes.</li>
            <li> Great product that truly works. Big fan of Nizoral.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has changed my life!  I have tried many of the other AD shampoos and none of them worked like this product.  Others were harsh or left a terrible odor.  This is gentle *and* works!  No more embarrassing flakes on my collar!</li>
            <li> So far this is the best dandruff shampoo that I used.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Comes with a very firm scrubbing brush for your scalp.</li>
            <li> If you have thinning hair you need to try this.  Within a month of use (along with my other products) I started to see results. I highly recommend getting this set with the brush</li>
            <li> slow shipping but otherwise, good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! This shampoo works better than anything else at taming the flaky, irritated scalp. It does not smell gross and does not strip my hair color.  I don&#x27;t find that it overly dries my hair out either. I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the only thing that cleared up the dandruff from itchy, flaky, dry skin around the crown of my head. It worked so well that I generally only have to use it once a week or so to maintain a healthy scalp. I have long hair, and it made the rest of my hair shiny. And there&#x27;s no terrible odor!  Great product!!</li>
            <li> This product is extremely effective.  It is not recommended for daily use.  Do side affects or problems when used.</li>
            <li> Package came on time and the brush helped my scalp! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product. only takes two washes to clear up dandruff</li>
            <li> This is the best anti-dandruff shampoo ever, I just love it, it works just as soon as you use it for the first time. I color my hair every month and the permanent color dry my scalp.</li>
            <li> The key to any of these shampoos is the line up.  This works for a time and you have to change to another.  Just remember to keep it as part of your rotating shampoos.  The little shampoo scrubby is nice.</li>
            <li> Nizoral is by far the best shampoo we&#x27;ve found to take care of cradle cap on our kids (it&#x27;s like patchy, excessive dandruff).  After a few shampoos, it goes away and you only need to use this every once in awhile for maintenance.  The scrubby brush for the scalp is really nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the transaction goes, no complaints.  The product showed up when it was supposed to and was very competitively priced.  Based on my experience, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Still not get a chance to use it completely i will let  you know after 6 to 8 weeks for results</li>
            <li> Based on the recommendation of my dermatologist,.I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It works far better than the everyday dandruff shampoos you can buy in a drugstore.  It is well worth the premium price.</li>
            <li> I use this product not because of dandruff, but because I am trying to stop hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with Biotin pills, Revivogen shampoo and conditioner, Rogaine and Bosley hair gel, i have notice regrowth on my hairline and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know which of these products specifically or what combination is what&#x27;s helping me get my hair back, but I am not willing to risk cutting any one of them and losing all the progress made so far. Going on month 2 of this process and already seeing great results.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo besides Jason&#x27;s that gets rid of my scalp issues. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been buying various items off Amazon since 2008, and currently average an order every week. This is the first time I have ever written a review, this product is THAT impressive. I have been extremely satisfied with pretty much all my past purchases, but felt I really needed to take the time and write a review for this item to possibly help anybody else dealing with severe dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dandruff, you know how hard it can be to get rid of. I had tried everything from the local pharmacies and supermarkets, and nothing ever worked and most gave me a stinging sensation in my eyes just from the fumes. I searched &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; on a popular website (reddit), and saw this item mentioned a couple times, and one provided a link right to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it in two days, and used it before work the next morning. After drying off and doing a rigorous hand-through-hair test, I wore a black shirt to see how it fared throughout the day. I should mention I had SEVERE dandruff before using this product; all day, every day. I wouldn&#x27;t even have to touch my hair, and I would have flakes on my shoulders and could see small flakes sitting on top of my hair in the mirrors. If I ever ran my fingers through my hair, the white would just continually drop from my head, no matter how long I continued. It is now at the end of my first day using it, and even now still wearing the black shirt, I can rub my head and have absolutely nothing falling down onto my shoulders. That has never happened from any product I&#x27;ve ever used before for as long as I can remember!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with this product, I can only hope that whoever needs it finds this page and gives it a try. I am now excited to have my haircut and inform my barber of this product, and no longer will have to awkwardly strike up a conversation about how dry my hair is as I&#x27;m sitting in the chair with us both noticing how the black smock is absolutely covered in white flakes.</li>
            <li> It works better than the prescription stuff. I only need it occasionally during season change. It does the trick and it doesnt smell bad.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bazillion shampoos.  This is THE ONE that works. I had three dime/quarter size psoriasis spots that were annoying beyond belief.  I had steroid shots in my scalp.  They worked for awhile then stopped. All other shampoos worked for awhile, maybe a week, then stopped.  This one I have used over a year now and this is what works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution if you color your hair... it will lighten your hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save money and hair color:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I just dab some shampoo on the spots, use that AWESOME scrubby brush that comes with it and rub the shampoo in the spots. I let it sit on my scalp while I brush my teeth first giving this a few minutes to sit there and do its thing. Then I jump in the shower, wet my hair and scrub (with the AWESOME brush) I do lather my whole head and let is set a little  time while in the shower but I use to let the shampoo be the last thing I did so it sat longer.  Saving color, I don&#x27;t let it sit so long on my hair.  Its not a huge issue but it will lighten your hair over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft, not dry.  Other shampoos (especially prescription!) turned my hair into straw!  Not Nizoral.  Great stuff!!  Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  Scalp issues is an indication of something not in balance inside. Not eating wheat really helped me clear this up and...acupuncture. I swear by acupuncture!!!  It will fix a bunch of things at the same time.</li>
            <li> Im satified by this product</li>
            <li> Best and only dandruff shampoo on the market, that actually works!  Dont waste your time on trying the other ones out there, none of them have the active ingredient that this one does.  That is the real difference and if you struggle with dry scalp/ dandruff/itchy scalp, using this a couple time s a week will work!  Love it!  Bonus, SAFE FOR COLOR TREATED HAIR!</li>
            <li> This is the best anti-dandruff shampoo that you can buy without a prescription. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> My husband has ordered Nizoral on and off for years.  My family struggles with a sticky dandruff that is hereditary and this stuff is great to remove the obstacle and see our hair healthy and growing!</li>
            <li> great product. became a regular buyer on this</li>
