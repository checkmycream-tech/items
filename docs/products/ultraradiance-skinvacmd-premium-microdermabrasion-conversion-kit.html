            <li>was so happy with this that I bought 9 tip kit.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a win, win all around</li>

            <li>Great microdermabraision.</li>
            <li>I have it myself and it is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for on the go where ever you go.</li>
            <li>Suction wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>The suction is great</li>
            <li>The tips are great</li>
            <li>I love this machine!!</li>
            <li>After all that - I figured out how to use the system and LOVE it!!    </li>
            <li>There are You Tube videos you can watch that are very handy.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews and did a lot of research on the home microderms and after purchasing this one, I can say I made a GREAT choice!  </li>
            <li>Great product at a really good price.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with both their product and outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li>Who knows, I may even make my own!</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t seem like a good thing to do to my skin as I think the diamond tip should do the job it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li>Even though they have a fair share of good reviews, I decided I didn&#x27;t need the hassle.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and did a great job on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I actually ran across it by accident here and was really impressed by what I read about the product itself and the wonderful customer reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the adjustment of the suction on the tip (l wanted to close it more)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It came at a great price, It arrived quickly and was packaged very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this product!  </li>
            <li>YOU WONT REGRET IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>It is amazing to see and feel the result on the skin.</li>
            <li>It had amazing reviews</li>
            <li>Vacubrasion has AMAZING customer service so if you have any questions just go to their website and call or emailthem.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish i could have just bought the sinlge tip since I can&#x27;t use the rest of the kit.</li>
            <li>I never feel my skin this nice before.</li>
            <li>It works as good or better than any treatment I have had in a salon or spa.  </li>
            <li>but instruction would have been nice.    </li>
            <li>i can do my own microdermabrasion at home with SkinVac.</li>
            <li>product is a really good idea, they need to think it out a bit more.  </li>
            <li>am thrilled that I found this.  </li>
            <li>so I asked my best friend who is an aesthetician if this was a decent machine</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this, its so easy and does a great job....</li>
            <li>I am incredibly picky and I can say that it works and feels exactly like the treatments I&#x27;ve had done at the spa.  </li>
            <li>It is really easy to use and very effective at renewing your skin for a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>The instructions were very easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>This kit is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 6 weeks and love it!</li>
            <li>This SkinVac is by far the best  at-home microdermabrasion device out there.</li>
            <li>Does smooth your face if you get a good tip.</li>
            <li>but this will replace that as its gentler and more effective.</li>
            <li>Decided that the 2 more popular machines that have vacuum/suction seemed to be prone to problems.</li>
            <li>( I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but healthy looking skin is very important to me! :) ).</li>
            <li>Easy to just grab and go!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>:)  Seriously, great customer service, fast shipping, and an outstanding product!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an investment worth spending $70 for amazing looking skin!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and arrived nicely packaged</li>
            <li>So easy and effective.</li>
            <li>On a side, note, their customer service dept is  also fantastic!  </li>
            <li>i love this item.</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t changed the top.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so pleased.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one over others for many reasons.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can choose the suction you desire rather than a one suction setting.</li>
            <li>I have used other(several) devices before and they were okay.</li>
            <li>I love that there are no upkeep items to purchase and no maintenance except cleaning tips of course.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>Money, money and more money.</li>
            <li>My sun damaged skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>It cost me about $80 just once to do the microdermabrasion at the shop, and this  feels even better and save lots of money.</li>
            <li>.......:)</li>
            <li>so i can cover more ground.  </li>
            <li>dewy skin awaits, if you are on the fence and able to order-go for it.</li>
            <li>will post with more updates as we go.</li>
            <li>Love this contraption.</li>
            <li>Works with my Dyson just attach hose to top nozzle.</li>
            <li>I think I need a stronger wet/dry vac to get the most benefit out of using these though.</li>
            <li>and I would decide which was better.</li>
            <li>This Vacubrasion works 100% better.</li>
            <li>In the future I may purchase a 1.5 gallon shopvac to use just for this, but for now I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The results on my face were much better with this tip.</li>
            <li>I sent them some ideas like including an adaptor and providing more detail about its use in owner&#x27;s guide.  </li>
            <li>(make sure it is set on tools) and go about microderming you face.</li>
            <li>more thing</li>
            <li>My hands are looking better too.  </li>
            <li>(the D100 tip is perfect for this) to get a sense of how much is enough and notice how your skin responds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the case.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this product : )      </li>
            <li>I love on my lips.</li>
            <li>It did help lighten so sun spots on my arms, I am hoping with repeated treatment and better use of sunscreen I will see even better results.</li>
            <li>Also the kit comes with a brilliant adjustable suction attachment that allows you to regulate the pressure of the suction around the sensitive areas like under the eyes.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>it cost me more, I thought of returning it  </li>
            <li>though I will still go from time to time to pamper myself, this will allow me to get clearer, more radiant skin at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>They promptly sent a much longer hose that works great.  </li>
            <li>The customer service is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>product seems to have been designed when most people had canister vacs.  </li>
            <li>At a minimum add more length to the provided hose.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li>I think I exfoliate my skin better with a damp sponge topped with baking soda</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore it allows to the creams to penetrate much more.</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely fantastic product and I am thrilled that I bought it.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this product is actually better than anticipated.</li>
            <li>The conversion kit fits most vacuums or NB device.</li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to understand and the device is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is very easy to use, fit perfectly on my Hoover vacuum</li>
            <li>it is very powerful and you may give yourself a hickey!</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly onto my vacuum, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I had been willing to spend in the neighborhood of $150-$300 for a good quality, semi-professional, home diamond-tip microdermabrasion machine.</li>
            <li>These are really nice people, that are interested in improving the product and making sure their customers are satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The forever tip that comes with the universal adapter is very good starter as it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>First I was really impressed with the quality and dexterity of the professional grade microderm tips and handle.  </li>
            <li>i found that these would have been all i needed, even for forehead and nose was able to comfortably use them there and get all of the area.  </li>
            <li>and I just love how smooth my skin is after using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, glowing, clearer, and becoming younger-looking as a result of my weekly treatments.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest, originally I thought it was a joke, but it got such great reviews</li>
            <li>customer service was great at getting back to me via email with my questions and very encouraging and honest nice to find now a days.  </li>
            <li>I had read other reviews about their excellent customer service</li>
            <li>It was delivered very quickly as promised when my order was placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was so easy to assemble to my shopvac.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li>My kit came with two tips; one D200 and one D100,  The included instructions are easy to understand.  </li>
            <li>The tips are easy to attach to the metal wand and interchange in seconds.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for an at home micro-dermabrasion system, but balked at the cheap-looking all-in-one gadgets that looked like they would break easily.  </li>
            <li>I have to say this is just as strong as all the treatments I have recieved and paid $85 and up for.</li>
            <li>Using my own vacuum is much more effective and reliable than the manufacturer&#x27;s machine.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the suction of our high powered system might be too powerful for this device but with the provided attachment that comes with a hose of perfect length, I am able to adjust the air flow and get a wide range of appropriate and perfect suction for different areas of my face and decollate.</li>
            <li>The attachments fit and are easy to put on.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, easy to clean, and the hose allows you to make the suction as strong as you want it.</li>
            <li>I have an upright vac that I use with and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>First of all, I am a do-it-yourself person: hair, skin, nails, feet, etc (for which my husband is very grateful, LOL).  </li>
            <li>P,S,  I have a Dyson and the connectors work fine with it, in case you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to return, I&#x27;ll have to reorder.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for salon-level microdermabrasion at a super affordable price, you will NOT regret this purchase!</li>
            <li>The SkinVacMD is easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>As a Prime member, with Amazon&#x27;s excellent return policy, I didn&#x27;t have much to lose but an unexpected bonus was discovering that the folks at Vacubrasion are amazingly quick to respond to any requests for advice and information.</li>
            <li>I love how the diamond abrasive tips are reusable, so you never have to replace them and its super easy to clean with just alcohol wipes or even soap and water.</li>
            <li>This is the best little tool a women can get.</li>
            <li>Tips are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>after just one use my face looked and felt so smooth....</li>
            <li>it fit like a glove.  </li>
            <li>People saying that people are paid/given free products for their Amazon reviews.....</li>
            <li>I think it is important to watch some microdermbrasion videos</li>
            <li>&quot; videos available on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am using it with a Dyson vaccum cleaner and I can make the hose fit.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing value and it really cleans the skin surface.  </li>
            <li>and they included a free sample of an organic skin product.  </li>
            <li>It is much more convenient and economical than a visit to the spa or doctors&#x27; office.  </li>
            <li>free shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i feel my skin sooooo smooth.</li>
            <li>and I got a deal where a free body tip was included.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I received one professional microderm treatment on vacation at a spa for my acne scars and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>The small tip is excellent for getting into the curves of the nose and the fine skin around the mouth.</li>
            <li>but it saddens me because I loved it at first and thought I was really onto something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these new tips for a couple of weeks and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>i however was excited about the product so to add</li>
            <li>They are so friendly and helpful-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below is my original review of the product, which I gave 2 stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below is my original review:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also there are some excellent small vacs on Amazon in the $35 range.</li>
            <li>I bought a small shop vac for this use, the hose fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless I will continue to use it for the clean feel.</li>
            <li>thing that I discovered was that for my skin, instead of washing with a soap cleanser which strips the skin, if I use a creme cleanser such as Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Cleansing Milk, which nourishes the skin, my skin feels clean and more moist for the tip to more easily slide over without feeling quite so scratchy.</li>
            <li>I bought a PMD a while back, and I don&#x27;t really like it, so I am hoping this is more pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>I feel like it does a very good job removing dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>As with anything new, I experienced a bit of a learning curve in finessing the handling of the wand but now after having used it 3 times, I am feeling more confident about when to use less suction</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I read the reviews from others that already tried and loved the unit.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a full system.</li>
            <li>Love it, really works.</li>
            <li>THANKS SKINVAC for making such a great innovative and AFFORDABLE system that really works!</li>
            <li>I have been using this Kit for just a few weeks now and the results are incredible.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I use the kit with my Shark Lift Away, roughest texture tip and on full suction.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in years, much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be able to afford to do it as much as you like without going broke.</li>
            <li>For an overall self-administered micro-derm abrasion, it&#x27;s a good tool.</li>
            <li>I figured that maybe some exfoliated skin was catching in the tip, sort of clogging it and making it less effective.</li>
            <li>cleaner, softer, smoother skin.&lt;br /&gt;well made, packed well, arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Microdermabrasion followed by contractubex (scar treatment) has shown tremendous decrease in scar size in contrast to what plastic surgeons I saw have suggested.  </li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably softer, my pores are smaller, and as a result, I feel so much more confident.</li>
            <li>Customer service responded to my inquiry quickly.</li>
            <li>The case that my skinvac and tips came in were of high quality that anyone would be pleased to show to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They appear to be very interested in resolving customer concerns and approach it as a way to improve the product.  </li>
            <li>was very interested in trying out a home microdermasion machine.</li>
            <li>This is a brilliant product because it uses your home vac, in my case a small ShopVac, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about suction being an issue.  </li>
            <li>If the company sends me a strong tip I certainly would be happier.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great is that the suction can adjusted from be gentle to strong, depending on the fitting you use and with the option of different tips, there&#x27;s something for every skin type and different parts of the body.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this item if you enjoy getting microdermbrasion treatments but don&#x27;t enjoy the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable and perfect to do your own microdermabrasion treatments and get the professional results for such a low cost.  </li>
            <li>Second, I was a timid about doing microderm to myself but it was very easy and the kit is user friendly.  </li>
            <li>First, there was the price!  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if the suction was strong enough to help with clogged pores as that is much of my problem.  </li>
            <li>so the skin care products that we spend so much money on, can actually get deep into our skin and work..........an amazing product !!!</li>
            <li>Word to the wise, read it carefully.</li>
            <li>I notice it has more suction attached to the clear hose on the wand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product (SKinVacMD: Ultra Radiance ProDeluxe Microdermabrasion) was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that this will improve the look of the line between my eyebrows and the smile lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>First treatment, gentle, easy and hopeful.  </li>
            <li>It was very effective, but I was only in my early twenties, so had no concerns about aging skin.</li>
            <li>My main concern are fine lines, brown spots from sun damage and acne scars.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like being told that this will work great when I need a whole other system to attach it to.  </li>
            <li>However, thanks to the other women who gave this product great reviews, I felt obliged to pay it forward.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can attach to your own vacuum as many other products seems to lose suction after a while!  </li>
            <li>I just clean the tip with alcohol wipes and it&#x27;s ready for use.</li>
            <li>I have had treatments of every kind at the dermatologist from fillers to peels as well as minor cosmetic surgery.</li>
            <li>The inter-changeable tips are a nice weight and fit tightly on the wand.</li>
            <li>It smooths over your face easily and feels like a professional microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li>This is simple, low cost, and great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it actually works super well!!</li>
            <li>grain is very gentle.  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;The system is super easy to use and the diamond tips last virtually forever</li>
            <li>it would be nice if i could turn it all the way where it is closed.</li>
            <li>So much for inexpensive!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today</li>
            <li>so I wound up putting a piece of blue tape on it to seal more of the holes on it.</li>
            <li>I did notice a difference in my skin the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>More importantly it worked on my old scars that are left from an accident I had 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>and I just finished using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Watch the video on YouTube and follow directions exactly.</li>
            <li>My red acne scars are almost gone, didn&#x27;t have many.</li>
            <li>Surface wrinkles are diminishing, and treated skin looks better the next day.  </li>
            <li>First off, I will start by saying that I did weeks of COPIOUS research before settling on the SkinVac.</li>
            <li>I must have looked at every machine offered on eBay, Amazon and LCL Salon products but the reviews of the Vacubrasion system were so glowing that I decided to try the SkinVac first.</li>
            <li>though my scratches lasted for about a week, I am willing to give this contraption another try.</li>
            <li>The results are better than recent Microdermabrasions from a spa and dermatologist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>Have upgraded to 3 and may raise higher.  </li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read about the competeting products, I&#x27;d still go with this product first.  </li>
            <li>The wands will most standard tips so you could reuse tips that you have or buy others if you see them on sale.  </li>
            <li>I love that the tips are made to last</li>
            <li>My face feels very soft and clean after I use it.  </li>
            <li>It works great, takes up very little space and  attaches to my vacuume!</li>
            <li>The selling point for me was the fact that the Skinvac could connect with most vacuums (there is no way a vacuum would lose</li>
            <li>Additionally, you are going to need to do the procedure while trying to manage a vacuum hose; they aren&#x27;t the most flexible things.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the SkinVacMD for 3-4 weeks and highly recommend it as it is very user friendly.  </li>
            <li>I have had several professional microdermabrasion treatments and was experiencing some insecurity and anxiousness to try it on my own.</li>
            <li>I only did one forearm and asked three people to tell me which one felt smoother and all three were easily able to identify the arm that the microdermabrasion was done on, even though there was not any real visible difference.</li>
            <li>The materials are high quality, easy to use, and my skin is amazingly soft after using.  </li>
            <li>First it is super soft, which anyone who has had microderm knows that feeling.</li>
            <li>I could see immediate, positive results.</li>
            <li>The welts turned to scratches that burned much of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company about my scratches and they seemed interested in the problem and solving the problem.  </li>
            <li>First off I have to mention that my daughter is a master esthetician in a very prestigious skin spa.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad it fit my older model about 10 years old Dyson, so I didn&#x27;t have to spend extra on a vacuum</li>
            <li>My skin feels Super Soft after I&#x27;m finished using the SkinVacMD.  </li>
            <li>and I ordered the large tip for body and neck.</li>
            <li>Skinvac is easy to use at home with my existing vacuum.  </li>
            <li>As long as you have a vacuum that the attachment will fit to you can do your own microdermabrasion with professional results.</li>
            <li>I also use the fine tip for a final pass over the sun damage spots.</li>
            <li>i am like others who have posted am previous recipient of microdermabrasion with my fascialist on a regular basis and loved the results i received and now am so pleased that i can do this for my self at home for the same price of one treatment, accept now</li>
            <li>This is a nice little unit.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in microdermabrasion I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I dip the tips fastly in rubbing alcohol and let them dry in a very clean place and wipe the hoses</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>I can only use the tip that does not attach to the hose, because it wont fit any of my vacuums.</li>
            <li>The tip that doesn&#x27;t have holes has just a tad too much suction for me.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered the Skinvac, I really was not looking for it.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face and my whole body- even my feet.</li>
            <li>Also my skin is getting a very even tone.</li>
            <li>I used email and always got fast timely very helpful responses ,their email is sales@vacubrasion.com</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having facials every two months since 1989 because I really needed to.</li>
            <li>However, upon completion of my exfoliation session, I had welts over much of the area I had exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>I had seen a system on HSN for twice  as much</li>
            <li>Very deceptive.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole system</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for any woman (or man) who wants to look &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34;, and to anyone dealing with acne or recurrent pimples.  </li>
            <li>Decided to buy a wet/dry vac from Amazon very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>My daughter says my skin&#x27;s texture is smoother as well as much brighter.</li>
            <li>I can tell you, without hesitation, that this device is the real deal.</li>
            <li>if home micro really has an effect; time will tell.  </li>
            <li>I found this device on another website, came to Amazon and the reviews seemed promising.</li>
            <li>that need to be replaced very often.</li>
            <li>I recommand it absolutely.</li>
            <li>It feels absolutely fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Now, this product is available with a vacuum; you might want to consider that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li>It works exactly the same and even better i am saving thousands of dollars from going to get the same treatment at a specialist office.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a bit of mild adult acne, and my face has completely cleared since I started using the SkinVacMD system!</li>
            <li>PLUS, I have really dry lips, and after only one use around my lips, they are SOOOO much better!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the long term help with fine wrinkles since I just started with it</li>
            <li>SkinVac does the trick, it gently and effectively removes your dead / flaky skin cells, leaving a glowing newer and clear looking skin in just couple treatments.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old son touch it after first time I used.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not as if you&#x27;re getting the full brunt of the vacuum suction on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Third, the diamond tip is suppose to last forever,  saving me even more money.  </li>
            <li>My face is as smooth as if I just left a professional office.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product 100%.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>As for now, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the Microdermabrasion \\&quot;Forever\\</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Able to use with little effort.</li>
            <li>and you had to buy more little filters.  </li>
            <li>It also seems like the retin-A works a little better now too.  </li>
            <li>and I like the way it cleans up dry skin flakes and makes my face feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I&#x27;m happy with my decision in purchasing my skin vac md.</li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t the case on all parts of my face, but those that I&#x27;ve treated more heavily with the creams showed quite a bit of peeling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating a 4 because I think this is a good product based on the technology behind it and based on others experiences with it, however I ordered a premium conversion kit and seemed to have been sent a mini kit.</li>
            <li>I also notice that when using the diamond face tip I get more suction if I don&#x27;t use the clear hose/wand attachment and just use the black attachment the kit comes with where you screw the diamond tip into the end.</li>
            <li>but it is way too noisy for an instrument that is right next to your ear.</li>
            <li>My husband noticed my skin different right way.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily want to run out of the house right away)</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a pretty decent buy....</li>
            <li>It hooks right up to my vacuum.</li>
            <li>I plan on reordering this weekend and will update once I get the new shipment.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to microdermabrasion</li>
            <li>Then they sent me a new version of the product.</li>
            <li>and it just seemed like it was getting harder and harder to keep it nice.</li>
            <li>am in my early 50&#x27;s with quite a bit of sun damage so my main purpose for using microdermabrasion (along with Skinceutical &amp; Devita skin products and bi-annual, mid-level ReJuvePeel procedures) is to address and hopefully reverse the damage.</li>
            <li>After commenting about the short length of the hose to attach to an upright vacuum, the company contacted me directly and very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are very clear that use wash and put alcohol on your skin before you start.  </li>
            <li>The kit is in a very professional looking silver \\&quot;suitcase\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>As far as the deeper acne scars, since they are not super deep I think that I will get good results on the next months-I will keep you posted.</li>
            <li>I ended up pretty red one day.</li>
            <li>And the kit is complete!</li>
            <li>first the universal adapter does work with my dyson.  </li>
            <li>The result is better than any product I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I use retin-A pretty much daily</li>
            <li>There are two that look exactly the same in size</li>
            <li>To make it easier to use, I tie the vacuum hose to the top of the handle which means the only thing I&#x27;m left to maneuver is the hose of the microdermabrasion device.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and it only takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li>, I store everything in a clean place away from other stuff in my bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>When I first ordered this product it didn&#x27;t work with any of my vacuum cleaners</li>
            <li>I am always trying new skin care products and was looking at getting a professional microdermabrasion machine.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve paid less than one treatment, which is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I came across this item and was struck by the novel idea and the positive reviews that others had left.</li>
            <li>It does not hurt, just a slight pulling on the skin, and there was redness in areas that had been gone over more than once, but that was gone by the next day.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if its the vacuum I own or the actual demabrasion kit that doesn&#x27;t have such a powerful suction.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of not having to pay for the vacuum function, and more importantly not having to deal with potential break down issues in the future.  </li>
            <li>He said it is little freakier how my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>If your skin is a little older and thinner like mine, I definitely recommend an \\&quot;easy does it\\&quot; approach</li>
            <li>I was surprised, surprised, surprised.</li>
            <li>The directions aren&#x27;t clear so be prepared to look it up on website.</li>
            <li>All you do is screw the diamond tip into the wand, attach the wand to the clear hose, then attached the hose to your vacum tools attachment.</li>
            <li>My husband used a clear piece of plastic for a connector and</li>
            <li>I was going to order another PMD since the one I had lost suction completely.  </li>
            <li>It will not close completely</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>far as cleanup</li>
            <li>So I searched for a microdermabrasion machine that I could use at home, and had power close to that of the professional one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll need to return to the professional salon for microdermabrasion/facials anymore.</li>
            <li>and though I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles to speak of, I know that isn&#x27;t going to last forever.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft and</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and silky everywhere I used it.</li>
            <li>and I can move so fast that a facial is done in 10-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My unit came directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels as soft as it has when I&#x27;ve done it at the spa.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit awkward to use, considering you have to connect it to a vacuum, but it really works great.</li>
            <li>they not only sent a replacement right away, but they also threw in some extra goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very cumbersome to use with a floor canister that&#x27;s why I tried little shark first.</li>
            <li>The tips are high quality and the weight of wand is similar to those you&#x27;d find in a professional setting.</li>
            <li>In other words, I am not new to the world of beauty and as a woman in her early 40s, I am more than frequent customer at various &amp;#34;service providers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>mine is an older model DC07 yellow and gray.</li>
            <li>I mean no disrespect to the company, they have a great product, but I&#x27;m not sure I can afford to keep replacing tips as often as it looks like I will need to.</li>
            <li>Any who, one use under my belt, (not that i haven&#x27;t wanted to do more, but only had it a few days), will probably do my second treatment in a week tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>package arrived faster than expected and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>can even be a bit red (this is normal</li>
            <li>I am constantly chasing new beauty products, some work, some don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>You have everything you need to get started right away( 2 tips are included:1 for your face, 1 for your body, a wand, a vacuum hose and the universal cylindrical thing to hook up to your existing canister vacuum).  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to give it higher ratings.  </li>
            <li>They offered to send out new tips, including an additional finer tip, since my guess was that the scratches seemed to come from only a tiny section of the tip, not across the entire tip, which may have been due to an abrasive fine sticking up a little higher than the rest, i.e., a craggy rock with a point jutting upward.  </li>
            <li>I am really looking forward to seeing the long term effects of regular microdermabrasion that I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have the time or money for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ever since I started professional microdermabrasion, I never returned to doing regular facials.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had another attachment that I had from a shedaway pet brush that was a little bigger</li>
            <li>Second, there were no little filters to replace so that meant I&#x27;d be saving money.  </li>
            <li>Just $75 compared to what the other companies wanted certainly got my attention.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing that I love about the SkinVac is that it all fits in a small black pouch (which is provided) and fits neatly under my cabinet.</li>
            <li>The difference isn&#x27;t much but there is a slight difference.</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft afterwards, albeit a bit pink and the areas of sun damage</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a small vac with the right size hose to only use with this product.</li>
            <li>The wand is attached to a long clear white cord that has an attachment for your vacuum which allows you to vary the suction.  </li>
            <li>you get the basic component the microdermasion head that goes directly on the vacuum hose, keep in mind that you will be holding a 1+ inch hose in your hand while your trying to do a self microdermabrasion; that&#x27;s pretty thick.</li>
            <li>(suction got week very fast, returned it) in the past</li>
            <li>I was probably applied a little bit too much pressure because my cheeks are quite red, but that was user error.  </li>

            <li> They promptly responded which was a very pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Its power is great, it works perfectly, and has awesome results.</li>
            <li> It worked beautifully and I have been using it twice a week since then with wonderful results.  </li>
            <li> It is very good relation price/quality.</li>
            <li> so you can figure out your ideal strength.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure once they skin how radiant my skin looks after 1 use, they&#x27;ll be impressed so impressed that they&#x27;ll also become customers.</li>
            <li> Great value and very pleased!</li>
            <li> was so happy with this that I bought 9 tip kit.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a win, win all around</li>
            <li> I have received my skinvac and I am so happy that I placed this order.  </li>
            <li> When I opened it and saw the quality of this product, I was jumping for joy.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Happy with the some of the technology, not with the cost.  </li>
            <li> so it is a great investent for $70.00.</li>
            <li> Great microdermabraision.</li>
            <li> I have it myself and it is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for on the go where ever you go.</li>
            <li> Suction wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> The suction is great</li>
            <li> The tips are great</li>
            <li> I love this machine!!</li>
            <li> After all that - I figured out how to use the system and LOVE it!!    </li>
            <li> There are You Tube videos you can watch that are very handy.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and did a lot of research on the home microderms and after purchasing this one, I can say I made a GREAT choice!  </li>
            <li> Great product at a really good price.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with both their product and outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li> Who knows, I may even make my own!</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t seem like a good thing to do to my skin as I think the diamond tip should do the job it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> Even though they have a fair share of good reviews, I decided I didn&#x27;t need the hassle.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and did a great job on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually ran across it by accident here and was really impressed by what I read about the product itself and the wonderful customer reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the adjustment of the suction on the tip (l wanted to close it more)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> It came at a great price, It arrived quickly and was packaged very nicely.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this product!  </li>
            <li> YOU WONT REGRET IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> It is amazing to see and feel the result on the skin.</li>
            <li> It had amazing reviews</li>
            <li> Vacubrasion has AMAZING customer service so if you have any questions just go to their website and call or emailthem.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I kind of wish i could have just bought the sinlge tip since I can&#x27;t use the rest of the kit.</li>
            <li> I never feel my skin this nice before.</li>
            <li> It works as good or better than any treatment I have had in a salon or spa.  </li>
            <li> but instruction would have been nice.    </li>
            <li> i can do my own microdermabrasion at home with SkinVac.</li>
            <li> product is a really good idea, they need to think it out a bit more.  </li>
            <li> am thrilled that I found this.  </li>
            <li> so I asked my best friend who is an aesthetician if this was a decent machine</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this, its so easy and does a great job....</li>
            <li> I am incredibly picky and I can say that it works and feels exactly like the treatments I&#x27;ve had done at the spa.  </li>
            <li> It is really easy to use and very effective at renewing your skin for a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> The instructions were very easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> This kit is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 6 weeks and love it!</li>
            <li> This SkinVac is by far the best  at-home microdermabrasion device out there.</li>
            <li> Does smooth your face if you get a good tip.</li>
            <li> but this will replace that as its gentler and more effective.</li>
            <li> Decided that the 2 more popular machines that have vacuum/suction seemed to be prone to problems.</li>
            <li> ( I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but healthy looking skin is very important to me! :) ).</li>
            <li> Easy to just grab and go!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> :)  Seriously, great customer service, fast shipping, and an outstanding product!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an investment worth spending $70 for amazing looking skin!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and arrived nicely packaged</li>
            <li> So easy and effective.</li>
            <li> On a side, note, their customer service dept is  also fantastic!  </li>
            <li> i love this item.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t changed the top.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so pleased.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one over others for many reasons.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can choose the suction you desire rather than a one suction setting.</li>
            <li> I have used other(several) devices before and they were okay.</li>
            <li> I love that there are no upkeep items to purchase and no maintenance except cleaning tips of course.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Money, money and more money.</li>
            <li> My sun damaged skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> It cost me about $80 just once to do the microdermabrasion at the shop, and this  feels even better and save lots of money.</li>
            <li> .......:)</li>
            <li> so i can cover more ground.  </li>
            <li> dewy skin awaits, if you are on the fence and able to order-go for it.</li>
            <li> will post with more updates as we go.</li>
            <li> Love this contraption.</li>
            <li> Works with my Dyson just attach hose to top nozzle.</li>
            <li> I think I need a stronger wet/dry vac to get the most benefit out of using these though.</li>
            <li> and I would decide which was better.</li>
            <li> This Vacubrasion works 100% better.</li>
            <li> In the future I may purchase a 1.5 gallon shopvac to use just for this, but for now I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The results on my face were much better with this tip.</li>
            <li> I sent them some ideas like including an adaptor and providing more detail about its use in owner&#x27;s guide.  </li>
            <li> (make sure it is set on tools) and go about microderming you face.</li>
            <li> more thing</li>
            <li> My hands are looking better too.  </li>
            <li> (the D100 tip is perfect for this) to get a sense of how much is enough and notice how your skin responds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the case.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this product : )      </li>
            <li> I love on my lips.</li>
            <li> It did help lighten so sun spots on my arms, I am hoping with repeated treatment and better use of sunscreen I will see even better results.</li>
            <li> Also the kit comes with a brilliant adjustable suction attachment that allows you to regulate the pressure of the suction around the sensitive areas like under the eyes.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> it cost me more, I thought of returning it  </li>
            <li> though I will still go from time to time to pamper myself, this will allow me to get clearer, more radiant skin at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> They promptly sent a much longer hose that works great.  </li>
            <li> The customer service is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> product seems to have been designed when most people had canister vacs.  </li>
            <li> At a minimum add more length to the provided hose.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> I think I exfoliate my skin better with a damp sponge topped with baking soda</li>
            <li> and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore it allows to the creams to penetrate much more.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely fantastic product and I am thrilled that I bought it.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this product is actually better than anticipated.</li>
            <li> The conversion kit fits most vacuums or NB device.</li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to understand and the device is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> it is very easy to use, fit perfectly on my Hoover vacuum</li>
            <li> it is very powerful and you may give yourself a hickey!</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly onto my vacuum, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had been willing to spend in the neighborhood of $150-$300 for a good quality, semi-professional, home diamond-tip microdermabrasion machine.</li>
            <li> These are really nice people, that are interested in improving the product and making sure their customers are satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The forever tip that comes with the universal adapter is very good starter as it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> First I was really impressed with the quality and dexterity of the professional grade microderm tips and handle.  </li>
            <li> i found that these would have been all i needed, even for forehead and nose was able to comfortably use them there and get all of the area.  </li>
            <li> and I just love how smooth my skin is after using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, glowing, clearer, and becoming younger-looking as a result of my weekly treatments.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, originally I thought it was a joke, but it got such great reviews</li>
            <li> customer service was great at getting back to me via email with my questions and very encouraging and honest nice to find now a days.  </li>
            <li> I had read other reviews about their excellent customer service</li>
            <li> It was delivered very quickly as promised when my order was placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was so easy to assemble to my shopvac.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li> My kit came with two tips; one D200 and one D100,  The included instructions are easy to understand.  </li>
            <li> The tips are easy to attach to the metal wand and interchange in seconds.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for an at home micro-dermabrasion system, but balked at the cheap-looking all-in-one gadgets that looked like they would break easily.  </li>
            <li> I have to say this is just as strong as all the treatments I have recieved and paid $85 and up for.</li>
            <li> Using my own vacuum is much more effective and reliable than the manufacturer&#x27;s machine.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the suction of our high powered system might be too powerful for this device but with the provided attachment that comes with a hose of perfect length, I am able to adjust the air flow and get a wide range of appropriate and perfect suction for different areas of my face and decollate.</li>
            <li> The attachments fit and are easy to put on.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, easy to clean, and the hose allows you to make the suction as strong as you want it.</li>
            <li> I have an upright vac that I use with and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am a do-it-yourself person: hair, skin, nails, feet, etc (for which my husband is very grateful, LOL).  </li>
            <li> P,S,  I have a Dyson and the connectors work fine with it, in case you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
            <li> Luckily I was able to return, I&#x27;ll have to reorder.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for salon-level microdermabrasion at a super affordable price, you will NOT regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> The SkinVacMD is easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> As a Prime member, with Amazon&#x27;s excellent return policy, I didn&#x27;t have much to lose but an unexpected bonus was discovering that the folks at Vacubrasion are amazingly quick to respond to any requests for advice and information.</li>
            <li> I love how the diamond abrasive tips are reusable, so you never have to replace them and its super easy to clean with just alcohol wipes or even soap and water.</li>
            <li> This is the best little tool a women can get.</li>
            <li> Tips are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> after just one use my face looked and felt so smooth....</li>
            <li> it fit like a glove.  </li>
            <li> People saying that people are paid/given free products for their Amazon reviews.....</li>
            <li> I think it is important to watch some microdermbrasion videos</li>
            <li> &quot; videos available on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am using it with a Dyson vaccum cleaner and I can make the hose fit.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing value and it really cleans the skin surface.  </li>
            <li> and they included a free sample of an organic skin product.  </li>
            <li> It is much more convenient and economical than a visit to the spa or doctors&#x27; office.  </li>
            <li> free shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i feel my skin sooooo smooth.</li>
            <li> and I got a deal where a free body tip was included.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I received one professional microderm treatment on vacation at a spa for my acne scars and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> The small tip is excellent for getting into the curves of the nose and the fine skin around the mouth.</li>
            <li> but it saddens me because I loved it at first and thought I was really onto something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these new tips for a couple of weeks and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> i however was excited about the product so to add</li>
            <li> They are so friendly and helpful-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below is my original review of the product, which I gave 2 stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below is my original review:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also there are some excellent small vacs on Amazon in the $35 range.</li>
            <li> I bought a small shop vac for this use, the hose fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless I will continue to use it for the clean feel.</li>
            <li> thing that I discovered was that for my skin, instead of washing with a soap cleanser which strips the skin, if I use a creme cleanser such as Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Cleansing Milk, which nourishes the skin, my skin feels clean and more moist for the tip to more easily slide over without feeling quite so scratchy.</li>
            <li> I bought a PMD a while back, and I don&#x27;t really like it, so I am hoping this is more pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> I feel like it does a very good job removing dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> As with anything new, I experienced a bit of a learning curve in finessing the handling of the wand but now after having used it 3 times, I am feeling more confident about when to use less suction</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I read the reviews from others that already tried and loved the unit.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a full system.</li>
            <li> Love it, really works.</li>
            <li> THANKS SKINVAC for making such a great innovative and AFFORDABLE system that really works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Kit for just a few weeks now and the results are incredible.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I use the kit with my Shark Lift Away, roughest texture tip and on full suction.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in years, much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be able to afford to do it as much as you like without going broke.</li>
            <li> For an overall self-administered micro-derm abrasion, it&#x27;s a good tool.</li>
            <li> I figured that maybe some exfoliated skin was catching in the tip, sort of clogging it and making it less effective.</li>
            <li> cleaner, softer, smoother skin.&lt;br /&gt;well made, packed well, arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Microdermabrasion followed by contractubex (scar treatment) has shown tremendous decrease in scar size in contrast to what plastic surgeons I saw have suggested.  </li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably softer, my pores are smaller, and as a result, I feel so much more confident.</li>
            <li> Customer service responded to my inquiry quickly.</li>
            <li> The case that my skinvac and tips came in were of high quality that anyone would be pleased to show to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They appear to be very interested in resolving customer concerns and approach it as a way to improve the product.  </li>
            <li> was very interested in trying out a home microdermasion machine.</li>
            <li> This is a brilliant product because it uses your home vac, in my case a small ShopVac, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about suction being an issue.  </li>
            <li> If the company sends me a strong tip I certainly would be happier.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great is that the suction can adjusted from be gentle to strong, depending on the fitting you use and with the option of different tips, there&#x27;s something for every skin type and different parts of the body.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this item if you enjoy getting microdermbrasion treatments but don&#x27;t enjoy the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable and perfect to do your own microdermabrasion treatments and get the professional results for such a low cost.  </li>
            <li> Second, I was a timid about doing microderm to myself but it was very easy and the kit is user friendly.  </li>
            <li> First, there was the price!  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if the suction was strong enough to help with clogged pores as that is much of my problem.  </li>
            <li> so the skin care products that we spend so much money on, can actually get deep into our skin and work..........an amazing product !!!</li>
            <li> Word to the wise, read it carefully.</li>
            <li> I notice it has more suction attached to the clear hose on the wand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product (SKinVacMD: Ultra Radiance ProDeluxe Microdermabrasion) was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that this will improve the look of the line between my eyebrows and the smile lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> First treatment, gentle, easy and hopeful.  </li>
            <li> It was very effective, but I was only in my early twenties, so had no concerns about aging skin.</li>
            <li> My main concern are fine lines, brown spots from sun damage and acne scars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like being told that this will work great when I need a whole other system to attach it to.  </li>
            <li> However, thanks to the other women who gave this product great reviews, I felt obliged to pay it forward.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can attach to your own vacuum as many other products seems to lose suction after a while!  </li>
            <li> I just clean the tip with alcohol wipes and it&#x27;s ready for use.</li>
            <li> I have had treatments of every kind at the dermatologist from fillers to peels as well as minor cosmetic surgery.</li>
            <li> The inter-changeable tips are a nice weight and fit tightly on the wand.</li>
            <li> It smooths over your face easily and feels like a professional microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> This is simple, low cost, and great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it actually works super well!!</li>
            <li> grain is very gentle.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;The system is super easy to use and the diamond tips last virtually forever</li>
            <li> it would be nice if i could turn it all the way where it is closed.</li>
            <li> So much for inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today</li>
            <li> so I wound up putting a piece of blue tape on it to seal more of the holes on it.</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference in my skin the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> More importantly it worked on my old scars that are left from an accident I had 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> and I just finished using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Watch the video on YouTube and follow directions exactly.</li>
            <li> My red acne scars are almost gone, didn&#x27;t have many.</li>
            <li> Surface wrinkles are diminishing, and treated skin looks better the next day.  </li>
            <li> First off, I will start by saying that I did weeks of COPIOUS research before settling on the SkinVac.</li>
            <li> I must have looked at every machine offered on eBay, Amazon and LCL Salon products but the reviews of the Vacubrasion system were so glowing that I decided to try the SkinVac first.</li>
            <li> though my scratches lasted for about a week, I am willing to give this contraption another try.</li>
            <li> The results are better than recent Microdermabrasions from a spa and dermatologist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> Have upgraded to 3 and may raise higher.  </li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read about the competeting products, I&#x27;d still go with this product first.  </li>
            <li> The wands will most standard tips so you could reuse tips that you have or buy others if you see them on sale.  </li>
            <li> I love that the tips are made to last</li>
            <li> My face feels very soft and clean after I use it.  </li>
            <li> It works great, takes up very little space and  attaches to my vacuume!</li>
            <li> The selling point for me was the fact that the Skinvac could connect with most vacuums (there is no way a vacuum would lose</li>
            <li> Additionally, you are going to need to do the procedure while trying to manage a vacuum hose; they aren&#x27;t the most flexible things.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the SkinVacMD for 3-4 weeks and highly recommend it as it is very user friendly.  </li>
            <li> I have had several professional microdermabrasion treatments and was experiencing some insecurity and anxiousness to try it on my own.</li>
            <li> I only did one forearm and asked three people to tell me which one felt smoother and all three were easily able to identify the arm that the microdermabrasion was done on, even though there was not any real visible difference.</li>
            <li> The materials are high quality, easy to use, and my skin is amazingly soft after using.  </li>
            <li> First it is super soft, which anyone who has had microderm knows that feeling.</li>
            <li> I could see immediate, positive results.</li>
            <li> The welts turned to scratches that burned much of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company about my scratches and they seemed interested in the problem and solving the problem.  </li>
            <li> First off I have to mention that my daughter is a master esthetician in a very prestigious skin spa.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad it fit my older model about 10 years old Dyson, so I didn&#x27;t have to spend extra on a vacuum</li>
            <li> My skin feels Super Soft after I&#x27;m finished using the SkinVacMD.  </li>
            <li> and I ordered the large tip for body and neck.</li>
            <li> Skinvac is easy to use at home with my existing vacuum.  </li>
            <li> As long as you have a vacuum that the attachment will fit to you can do your own microdermabrasion with professional results.</li>
            <li> I also use the fine tip for a final pass over the sun damage spots.</li>
            <li> i am like others who have posted am previous recipient of microdermabrasion with my fascialist on a regular basis and loved the results i received and now am so pleased that i can do this for my self at home for the same price of one treatment, accept now</li>
            <li> This is a nice little unit.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in microdermabrasion I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I dip the tips fastly in rubbing alcohol and let them dry in a very clean place and wipe the hoses</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> I can only use the tip that does not attach to the hose, because it wont fit any of my vacuums.</li>
            <li> The tip that doesn&#x27;t have holes has just a tad too much suction for me.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered the Skinvac, I really was not looking for it.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face and my whole body- even my feet.</li>
            <li> Also my skin is getting a very even tone.</li>
            <li> I used email and always got fast timely very helpful responses ,their email is sales@vacubrasion.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having facials every two months since 1989 because I really needed to.</li>
            <li> However, upon completion of my exfoliation session, I had welts over much of the area I had exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> I had seen a system on HSN for twice  as much</li>
            <li> Very deceptive.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole system</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for any woman (or man) who wants to look &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34;, and to anyone dealing with acne or recurrent pimples.  </li>
            <li> Decided to buy a wet/dry vac from Amazon very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My daughter says my skin&#x27;s texture is smoother as well as much brighter.</li>
            <li> I can tell you, without hesitation, that this device is the real deal.</li>
            <li> if home micro really has an effect; time will tell.  </li>
            <li> I found this device on another website, came to Amazon and the reviews seemed promising.</li>
            <li> that need to be replaced very often.</li>
            <li> I recommand it absolutely.</li>
            <li> It feels absolutely fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Now, this product is available with a vacuum; you might want to consider that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> It works exactly the same and even better i am saving thousands of dollars from going to get the same treatment at a specialist office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a bit of mild adult acne, and my face has completely cleared since I started using the SkinVacMD system!</li>
            <li> PLUS, I have really dry lips, and after only one use around my lips, they are SOOOO much better!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the long term help with fine wrinkles since I just started with it</li>
            <li> SkinVac does the trick, it gently and effectively removes your dead / flaky skin cells, leaving a glowing newer and clear looking skin in just couple treatments.  </li>
            <li> My 9 year old son touch it after first time I used.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as if you&#x27;re getting the full brunt of the vacuum suction on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Third, the diamond tip is suppose to last forever,  saving me even more money.  </li>
            <li> My face is as smooth as if I just left a professional office.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product 100%.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> As for now, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend the Microdermabrasion \\&quot;Forever\\</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Able to use with little effort.</li>
            <li> and you had to buy more little filters.  </li>
            <li> It also seems like the retin-A works a little better now too.  </li>
            <li> and I like the way it cleans up dry skin flakes and makes my face feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m happy with my decision in purchasing my skin vac md.</li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t the case on all parts of my face, but those that I&#x27;ve treated more heavily with the creams showed quite a bit of peeling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating a 4 because I think this is a good product based on the technology behind it and based on others experiences with it, however I ordered a premium conversion kit and seemed to have been sent a mini kit.</li>
            <li> I also notice that when using the diamond face tip I get more suction if I don&#x27;t use the clear hose/wand attachment and just use the black attachment the kit comes with where you screw the diamond tip into the end.</li>
            <li> but it is way too noisy for an instrument that is right next to your ear.</li>
            <li> My husband noticed my skin different right way.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily want to run out of the house right away)</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a pretty decent buy....</li>
            <li> It hooks right up to my vacuum.</li>
            <li> I plan on reordering this weekend and will update once I get the new shipment.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to microdermabrasion</li>
            <li> Then they sent me a new version of the product.</li>
            <li> and it just seemed like it was getting harder and harder to keep it nice.</li>
            <li> am in my early 50&#x27;s with quite a bit of sun damage so my main purpose for using microdermabrasion (along with Skinceutical &amp; Devita skin products and bi-annual, mid-level ReJuvePeel procedures) is to address and hopefully reverse the damage.</li>
            <li> After commenting about the short length of the hose to attach to an upright vacuum, the company contacted me directly and very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are very clear that use wash and put alcohol on your skin before you start.  </li>
            <li> The kit is in a very professional looking silver \\&quot;suitcase\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> As far as the deeper acne scars, since they are not super deep I think that I will get good results on the next months-I will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I ended up pretty red one day.</li>
            <li> And the kit is complete!</li>
            <li> first the universal adapter does work with my dyson.  </li>
            <li> The result is better than any product I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I use retin-A pretty much daily</li>
            <li> There are two that look exactly the same in size</li>
            <li> To make it easier to use, I tie the vacuum hose to the top of the handle which means the only thing I&#x27;m left to maneuver is the hose of the microdermabrasion device.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and it only takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li> , I store everything in a clean place away from other stuff in my bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product it didn&#x27;t work with any of my vacuum cleaners</li>
            <li> I am always trying new skin care products and was looking at getting a professional microdermabrasion machine.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve paid less than one treatment, which is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I came across this item and was struck by the novel idea and the positive reviews that others had left.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt, just a slight pulling on the skin, and there was redness in areas that had been gone over more than once, but that was gone by the next day.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if its the vacuum I own or the actual demabrasion kit that doesn&#x27;t have such a powerful suction.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of not having to pay for the vacuum function, and more importantly not having to deal with potential break down issues in the future.  </li>
            <li> He said it is little freakier how my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> If your skin is a little older and thinner like mine, I definitely recommend an \\&quot;easy does it\\&quot; approach</li>
            <li> I was surprised, surprised, surprised.</li>
            <li> The directions aren&#x27;t clear so be prepared to look it up on website.</li>
            <li> All you do is screw the diamond tip into the wand, attach the wand to the clear hose, then attached the hose to your vacum tools attachment.</li>
            <li> My husband used a clear piece of plastic for a connector and</li>
            <li> I was going to order another PMD since the one I had lost suction completely.  </li>
            <li> It will not close completely</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> far as cleanup</li>
            <li> So I searched for a microdermabrasion machine that I could use at home, and had power close to that of the professional one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll need to return to the professional salon for microdermabrasion/facials anymore.</li>
            <li> and though I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles to speak of, I know that isn&#x27;t going to last forever.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft and</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and silky everywhere I used it.</li>
            <li> and I can move so fast that a facial is done in 10-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My unit came directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels as soft as it has when I&#x27;ve done it at the spa.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit awkward to use, considering you have to connect it to a vacuum, but it really works great.</li>
            <li> they not only sent a replacement right away, but they also threw in some extra goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very cumbersome to use with a floor canister that&#x27;s why I tried little shark first.</li>
            <li> The tips are high quality and the weight of wand is similar to those you&#x27;d find in a professional setting.</li>
            <li> In other words, I am not new to the world of beauty and as a woman in her early 40s, I am more than frequent customer at various &amp;#34;service providers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> mine is an older model DC07 yellow and gray.</li>
            <li> I mean no disrespect to the company, they have a great product, but I&#x27;m not sure I can afford to keep replacing tips as often as it looks like I will need to.</li>
            <li> Any who, one use under my belt, (not that i haven&#x27;t wanted to do more, but only had it a few days), will probably do my second treatment in a week tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> package arrived faster than expected and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> can even be a bit red (this is normal</li>
            <li> I am constantly chasing new beauty products, some work, some don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> You have everything you need to get started right away( 2 tips are included:1 for your face, 1 for your body, a wand, a vacuum hose and the universal cylindrical thing to hook up to your existing canister vacuum).  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to give it higher ratings.  </li>
            <li> They offered to send out new tips, including an additional finer tip, since my guess was that the scratches seemed to come from only a tiny section of the tip, not across the entire tip, which may have been due to an abrasive fine sticking up a little higher than the rest, i.e., a craggy rock with a point jutting upward.  </li>
            <li> I am really looking forward to seeing the long term effects of regular microdermabrasion that I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have the time or money for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ever since I started professional microdermabrasion, I never returned to doing regular facials.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had another attachment that I had from a shedaway pet brush that was a little bigger</li>
            <li> Second, there were no little filters to replace so that meant I&#x27;d be saving money.  </li>
            <li> Just $75 compared to what the other companies wanted certainly got my attention.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing that I love about the SkinVac is that it all fits in a small black pouch (which is provided) and fits neatly under my cabinet.</li>
            <li> The difference isn&#x27;t much but there is a slight difference.</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft afterwards, albeit a bit pink and the areas of sun damage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a small vac with the right size hose to only use with this product.</li>
            <li> The wand is attached to a long clear white cord that has an attachment for your vacuum which allows you to vary the suction.  </li>
            <li> you get the basic component the microdermasion head that goes directly on the vacuum hose, keep in mind that you will be holding a 1+ inch hose in your hand while your trying to do a self microdermabrasion; that&#x27;s pretty thick.</li>
            <li> (suction got week very fast, returned it) in the past</li>
            <li> I was probably applied a little bit too much pressure because my cheeks are quite red, but that was user error.  </li>
            <li> I feel the company could have simply engineered the product such as:  wand, 2 tips and vacuum adaptor that closes for optimal suction.  </li>
            <li> However, the product description isn&#x27;t specific enough about what size of vacuum hose it fits.  </li>
            <li> I use a regular vacuum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too short to avoid having to hold the vacuum hose too.</li>
            <li> Even if the pieces go together well, the provided hose is too short to just let a the vacuum hose hang there.  </li>
            <li> I have deep nose pores and have been using the strongest vacuum attachment.</li>
            <li> My vacuum hose is larger, but the adapter helps but won&#x27;t keep the device&#x27;s hose and vacuum connected without me holding it.  </li>
            <li> but one is for sensitive skin and the other for regular.  </li>
            <li> so i have to sit on floor with vacuum and mirror</li>
            <li> Eventually, I will invest in the vacuum for it.</li>
            <li> However, burned up my portable shark vacuum</li>
            <li> will fry my canister vacuum as well.</li>
            <li> so I can use my Dyson vacuum...</li>
            <li> You will need a vacuum with hand suction devise for it to work.</li>
            <li> I have a Shark vacuum, a Bissell and a shopvac.</li>
            <li> Then turn on your vacuum</li>
            <li> When attached to a vacuum, all of the associated dust disappears into the tubing.  </li>
            <li> Our vacuum unit itself has an air-flow adjustment</li>
            <li> I wish the videos and included charts showed HOW to attach the system to a home vacuum cleaner.  </li>
            <li> The on-line videos show a model using an UltraRadiance vacuum - not a \\&quot;house\\&quot; vacuum.  </li>
            <li> I have 3 vacuum cleaners - a Hoover - a Dirt Devil and a Eureka.  </li>
            <li> time I had my daughter use it on me, using my vacuum.</li>
            <li> No it didn&#x27;t, I thought  it has the vacuum machine already</li>
            <li> But, you&#x27;re using one hand to hold a vacuum hose that is cleaning throughout your house.  </li>
            <li> So, to do a procedure I need to hold the vacuum hose and try to manipulate the tip.</li>
            <li> I suggest that before ordering this product that you take your vacuum to the area where you would be doing the procedure, take the hose and bring close to your face and see what control you have and ability to perform the procedure as shown in the Youtube videos.  </li>
            <li> It can not break down, there are not ongoing costs for new parts.  </li>
            <li> Since it was significantly less expensive than the machines, I went ahead and took a chance, and I am really glad I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s improved my skin much but perhaps over time it will make a difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> have a \\&quot;whole house\\&quot; vacuum and was not sure how the SkinVac adaptor device was going to work with the long hose which plugs into the wall.</li>
            <li> but..........I am becoming disappointed that the \\&quot;forever\\&quot; diamond tips I have are wearing down so quickly.</li>
            <li> I can attach the separate little nozzle directly to my old shark mini vac, and i have to squeeze the vacuum hose into the attachment</li>
            <li> The tips are built to last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Do recommend doing test small patch on inner arm first and practice getting the rhythm down.</li>
            <li> After a few passes of the Diamond Tip, my skin felt amazingly soft and looked smoother.</li>
            <li> The unit I ordered has a flexible hose about 15 inches long.</li>
            <li> I chose this after a long research because the tips were forever and diamond, instead of aluminum oxide crystals etc.</li>
            <li> Follow directions and go slow and gently.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was sort of odd that this connects to an actual vacuum cleaner</li>
            <li> Now my face feels cleaner and softer than it has in a long time!</li>
            <li> In the long run think of all the money you&#x27;ll save by doing it yourself!</li>
            <li> do plan on using my skinvac for a very long time and will be telling everyone I know about it.  </li>
            <li> I hope that the tip will last long and work on dark spots, some indented acne and chickenpox scars.</li>
            <li> After only a few uses, I am already starting to see those wrinkles and my crows&#x27; feet go away!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a reason (other than the noise of the vacuum cleaner) to choose anything else over this.  </li>
            <li> was not good enough but still doesn&#x27;t feel like a professional micro, not even close but maybe in the long run who knows.</li>
            <li> Second my line are still there but less noticeable like my brown spots.</li>
            <li> Just hook this up to your regular canister vacuum,(I use a small wet/dry vacuum) and</li>
            <li> Reason why I did not give it a 5 star is cause I have to cover the holes on the black tube that connects to vacuum cause</li>
            <li> Also, if you don&#x27;t want to use the wand with the hose, you can use the black attachment in your kit and attach that to your  vacuum hose and screw your diamond tip into that.</li>
            <li> Finally, today I checked the tip and it looked dull, worn down with no little sparkly diamond flecks anymore.</li>
            <li> There is enough but not so much that it is uncomfortable or worrisome.  </li>
            <li> so I began pressing harder to see results.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> I would advise that you follow directions carefully, start with the gentlest suction and tip you can and take your time.</li>
            <li> I may take a picture to post some before and afters over the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was always concerned about the fact that weak suction was one of the main complaints people had.  </li>
            <li> The first time I must have  pressed too hard as it scratched and made my face red for several days and was afraid to use it again for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> The tip is not strong enough to make any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> At this time, I must give the product only 3 stars, but it has the serious potential to get 5 stars when the kinks are worked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after,  did not want to stop, but trying to follow directions-smooth, lil pink, but not much and slight fading of lines under my eyes, so looking forward to the progress there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was a possible mix-up.</li>
            <li> Also, it comes with 2 heads but not sure yet what the differences, you must buy additional diamonds for specific issues on the face.</li>
            <li> The other tip worked well.</li>
            <li> The included attachment works with the shopvac but not with the other two.</li>
            <li> There are no replacement filters or tips to buy as other microdermabrasion systems require and</li>
            <li> In the past, I regularly had micro-dermabrasion at the Dermatologist&#x27;s office to treat my acne.</li>
            <li> Reviews of other at home micro-dermabrasion machines that broke soon after their product guarantee expired, or needed replacement parts were a turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter</li>
            <li> The company is extremely helpful with guidance and as others have mentioned there are \\&quot;how to\\</li>
            <li> I have seen that link on other Amazon products, but can&#x27;t find one here.  </li>
            <li> I use RetinA and other alpha hydroxy products</li>
            <li> and it can leave me a little dry and flaky</li>
            <li> My theory is... a little here, a little there goes a long way!</li>
            <li> AND, my 14 year old son is getting some acne, and after using it only two times on him, we both see a DRAMATIC improvement!  </li>
            <li> I will have to break down and buy the vacuums the company sells for another $100.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dawn on me that the tips were wearing down so soon.</li>
            <li> I had two gift certificates that are down the drain.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use to as for the pressure to use but other than that, no problem.</li>
            <li> The machine and heads cost me less than one trip to the spa.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to get serious about their skin.....</li>
            <li> For less than cost of one treatment</li>
            <li> I recieved my vacubrasion two and half weeks ago</li>
            <li> and/or a less course tip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as harsh of my skin as I thought it might be.</li>
            <li> I had trouble using it with my Shark Rotator</li>
            <li> Now i ust do a few minutes at a time, aiming for a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I began to swipe the tips with an alcohol wipe to cleanse it from dead skin periodically as I continued on with the vac treatment.</li>
            <li> Used with the suction holes completely open to decrease broken capillaries.</li>
            <li> I bought a Nubrilliance on a trial 10 days ago and used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the vacubrasion for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> within a few hours, my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> So, I cotton-balled some green tea, witch hazel, and glycerin mixture over them to soothe and promote healing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally skeptical and do a lot of research before I make a purchase-especially for items that claim to provide professional results for for products used in the home.</li>
            <li> From the instruction sheet:  fits 1.25 inch round outlet.</li>
            <li> The hose must be round,  </li>
            <li> and I can use this just to suck out the dead skin</li>
            <li> I was missing a part in my kit, so I e-mailed them and</li>
            <li> And by quickly, I mean, after 2-3 usages I noticed that less benefits were being noticed after using the device.</li>
            <li> so it is useless (not enough suction).  </li>
            <li> you can purchase a small shop vac at home depot for 30 dollars that will work with it...</li>
            <li> it sucks the dead skins cells away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d start off slow.</li>
            <li> But that claim is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Put some serious effort into researching the reviews.</li>
            <li> and they still look dull and darker color, one got even oxidized and nothing like that shiny diamond in the pictures!</li>
            <li> Gosh, I hate to be the only one to have something negative to say</li>
            <li> The model  is in a terrible position so you can&#x27;t really see the technique.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend $200+ for something that was going to perform poorly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was afraid to open the box in fear of being disappointed.  </li>
            <li> So here is the steel wand that is useless.</li>
            <li> Results on face were comparable to what I would get from expensive salon treatment.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I still will never go to the spa for microderm again, there is no need</li>
            <li> But doing it in a salon is expensive.</li>
            <li> At no time, did I feel the company tried to tell me I was doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> You do need to support it or the weight will make doing the procedure really difficult; if not, unsafe...possibility of scratching the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid</li>
            <li> I was really afraid to order another PMD because the suction on the one I had went out within 2 months</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical and was expecting to hate this.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has bad acne and I am going to try on her after her skin recovering.</li>
            <li> and when I went over my forehead the amount of skin that peeled was shocking.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Have tried this about 5 times.  The first time I must have  pressed too hard as it scratched and made my face red for several days and was afraid to use it again for several weeks.  I now use it about once a week and I like the way it cleans up dry skin flakes and makes my face feel clean.  I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s improved my skin much but perhaps over time it will make a difference.  It would be nice if the suction was strong enough to help with clogged pores as that is much of my problem.  Nonetheless I will continue to use it for the clean feel.</li>
            <li> excellent in all ways. cleaner, softer, smoother skin.&lt;br /&gt;well made, packed well, arrived quickly&lt;br /&gt;would buy again&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy with this that I bought 9 tip kit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit awkward to use, considering you have to connect it to a vacuum, but it really works great. It&#x27;s not as harsh of my skin as I thought it might be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating a 4 because I think this is a good product based on the technology behind it and based on others experiences with it, however I ordered a premium conversion kit and seemed to have been sent a mini kit. My kit didn&#x27;t include the hose with adjustable nozzle, and metal wand. I&#x27;m not sure if it was a possible mix-up. Luckily I was able to return, I&#x27;ll have to reorder.  I plan on reordering this weekend and will update once I get the new shipment.  The piece I did receive looked to be of excellent quality with quality tips.  I bought a PMD a while back, and I don&#x27;t really like it, so I am hoping this is more pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and did a lot of research on the home microderms and after purchasing this one, I can say I made a GREAT choice!  The materials are high quality, easy to use, and my skin is amazingly soft after using.  I don&#x27;t know about the long term help with fine wrinkles since I just started with it but my skin has never been smoother.  I have been using twice a week and love the results!!!  On a side, note, their customer service dept is  also fantastic!  I had trouble using it with my Shark Rotator and they got me up and running in no time.  I love that you can attach to your own vacuum as many other products seems to lose suction after a while!  Great value and very pleased!</li>
            <li> I really like this.  I feel like it does a very good job removing dead skin cells.  My face feels very soft and clean after I use it.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to since I have never had microdermabrasion done before this. I can only use the tip that does not attach to the hose, because it wont fit any of my vacuums. I can attach the separate little nozzle directly to my old shark mini vac, and i have to squeeze the vacuum hose into the attachment but the hose is really short so i have to sit on floor with vacuum and mirror so I can do this. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s home made looking.The tip itself work well and you can apply pressure when applying on skin, which I am tempted to do often. I ended up pretty red one day. Now i ust do a few minutes at a time, aiming for a few times a week. It helps with acne, and I am working on a brown spot. I will update on relults of brown spot sometime in future. I do like that no tips or filters need replacing. I kind of wish i could have just bought the sinlge tip since I can&#x27;t use the rest of the kit.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and arrived nicely packaged but it is way too noisy for an instrument that is right next to your ear. Had to wear earplugs during use but gave up after two months of not seeing any results.</li>
            <li> i love this item. I bought it 6 months ago and I cannot complain. I still haven&#x27;t changed the top. I&#x27;m saving the rest for later. I use a regular vacuum. Eventually, I will invest in the vacuum for it. Reason why I did not give it a 5 star is cause I have to cover the holes on the black tube that connects to vacuum cause air comes out. it would be nice if i could turn it all the way where it is closed.</li>
            <li> However, burned up my portable shark vacuum and I&#x27;m afraid will fry my canister vacuum as well. It is very cumbersome to use with a floor canister that&#x27;s why I tried little shark first. I will have to break down and buy the vacuums the company sells for another $100. So much for inexpensive!</li>
            <li> If you could just get the head separately .. And just hook it up to your vacume .. You would save a lot.. This is just basically an overpriced vacume hose.</li>
            <li> Gosh, I hate to be the only one to have something negative to say but..........I am becoming disappointed that the \\&quot;forever\\&quot; diamond tips I have are wearing down so quickly. And by quickly, I mean, after 2-3 usages I noticed that less benefits were being noticed after using the device. It didn&#x27;t dawn on me that the tips were wearing down so soon. I figured that maybe some exfoliated skin was catching in the tip, sort of clogging it and making it less effective. I began to swipe the tips with an alcohol wipe to cleanse it from dead skin periodically as I continued on with the vac treatment. That didn&#x27;t seem to work so I began pressing harder to see results. That didn&#x27;t seem like a good thing to do to my skin as I think the diamond tip should do the job it&#x27;s designed to do. Finally, today I checked the tip and it looked dull, worn down with no little sparkly diamond flecks anymore. If I have to keep replacing tips that often, I can&#x27;t justify purchasing this item. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin and others won&#x27;t have this problem but it saddens me because I loved it at first and thought I was really onto something. I mean no disrespect to the company, they have a great product, but I&#x27;m not sure I can afford to keep replacing tips as often as it looks like I will need to.</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;All, this is a wonderful product! I used it for the first time today and I&#x27;m so pleased. I have oily, aging skin and it just seemed like it was getting harder and harder to keep it nice. Now my face feels cleaner and softer than it has in a long time! And the kit is complete! Nothing else to buy.</li>
            <li> Use caution though....it is very powerful and you may give yourself a hickey! It is adjustable so you can figure out your ideal strength. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I received this just two days ago, I have only used this once... I absolutely love this product! I have one question however.. Is there any way to buy replacable parts for this system and where can I purchase them?</li>
            <li> This machine is wonderful.  I purchased this one over others for many reasons.  First, there was the price!  Just $75 compared to what the other companies wanted certainly got my attention.  Second, there were no little filters to replace so that meant I&#x27;d be saving money.  Third, the diamond tip is suppose to last forever,  saving me even more money.  Lastly, I read the reviews from others that already tried and loved the unit.  It seemed like a win, win all around and it was!  The device fits on all three of my vacuums.  To make it easier to use, I tie the vacuum hose to the top of the handle which means the only thing I&#x27;m left to maneuver is the hose of the microdermabrasion device.  I&#x27;ve owned this for 4 months now and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  I use the tip that you can adjust.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with the adjustment of the suction on the tip (l wanted to close it more) so I wound up putting a piece of blue tape on it to seal more of the holes on it. It works perfectly for me.  I chose blue tape because it doesnt leave any sticky residue.  I peel back the tape when I get up around the eye area.  The tip that doesn&#x27;t have holes has just a tad too much suction for me.  My skin feels Super Soft after I&#x27;m finished using the SkinVacMD.  When I put my Eve Hansen&#x27;s Rosehip Oil on afterwards, my skin drinks it in!  Debi B.</li>
            <li> When I ordered the Skinvac, I really was not looking for it.  I was going to order another PMD since the one I had lost suction completely.  After stumbling upon the reviews about the Skinvac, I decided to give it a try.  I was really afraid to order another PMD because the suction on the one I had went out within 2 months but I could not find anything else.  The selling point for me was the fact that the Skinvac could connect with most vacuums (there is no way a vacuum would lose suction).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;forever\\&quot; tips was another seller.  Not having to purchase tips or filters was a deal breaker.  I have received my skinvac and I am so happy that I placed this order.  It was delivered very quickly as promised when my order was placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid to open the box in fear of being disappointed.  When I opened it and saw the quality of this product, I was jumping for joy.  The case that my skinvac and tips came in were of high quality that anyone would be pleased to show to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not wait to use it and this was the biggest treat.  It was so easy to assemble to my shopvac.  The instructions were very easy to follow.  I love the fact that you can choose the suction you desire rather than a one suction setting. It is very easy to use and did a great job on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do plan on using my skinvac for a very long time and will be telling everyone I know about it.  I did notice a difference in my skin the first time I used it.  I did not have to wait for weeks as I did with the PMD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said above, I was surprised, surprised, surprised.</li>
            <li> First I was really impressed with the quality and dexterity of the professional grade microderm tips and handle.  Second, I was a timid about doing microderm to myself but it was very easy and the kit is user friendly.  As long as you have a vacuum that the attachment will fit to you can do your own microdermabrasion with professional results. My face is as smooth as if I just left a professional office.  If you are interested in microdermabrasion I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used other(several) devices before and they were okay. This SkinVac is by far the best  at-home microdermabrasion device out there. I love that there are no upkeep items to purchase and no maintenance except cleaning tips of course. I am so glad I found this product. I actually ran across it by accident here and was really impressed by what I read about the product itself and the wonderful customer reviews. The instructions are easy to understand and the device is very easy to use. I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great. If you&#x27;re new to microdermabrasion I&#x27;d start off slow. However, if you are not a novice, I would go to the strongest suction adapter. I do this once every 6 months and my skin looks great. I tend to think that people over do stuff to their face. My theory is... a little here, a little there goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Happy with the some of the technology, not with the cost.  All I needed to order was the tip with the plastic adaptor.  The wand is attached to a long clear white cord that has an attachment for your vacuum which allows you to vary the suction.  It will not close completely so it is useless (not enough suction).  So here is the steel wand that is useless. The tip is not strong enough to make any difference in my skin.  I had two gift certificates that are down the drain.  I feel the company could have simply engineered the product such as:  wand, 2 tips and vacuum adaptor that closes for optimal suction.  If the company sends me a strong tip I certainly would be happier.  Whats up UltraRadiance?  Money, money and more money.</li>
            <li> It works great!I started with the #200 tip and graduated to the #100. It only takes a few minutes a couple of times a week. My sun damaged skin is looking better. Tips are easy to clean. I soak them in vinegar. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I used this two times. It is amazing to see and feel the result on the skin. My 9 year old son touch it after first time I used. He said it is little freakier how my skin smooth and soft. My husband noticed my skin different right way. I never feel my skin this nice before. It cost me about $80 just once to do the microdermabrasion at the shop, and this  feels even better and save lots of money. I also have somethings start grow on my skin and doctor didn&#x27;t even know what it is. After two times use this product it start fade way. My daughter has bad acne and I am going to try on her after her skin recovering. This is the product I thing every woman should own it!!!!</li>
            <li> The machine and heads cost me less than one trip to the spa. Fits on all my vacuums with ease. Able to use with little effort. I can see a big difference on all areas. I have used on not only my face ,neck, chest, but also on my hands and arms. Great product at a really good price.</li>
            <li> This device is a brilliant idea! It works great, takes up very little space and  attaches to my vacuume! I have to be honest, originally I thought it was a joke, but it got such great reviews I figured what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a try. . I&#x27;m so glad I did! The attachments fit and are easy to put on. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this, its so easy and does a great job....it has an attachment so I can use my Dyson vacuum...after just one use my face looked and felt so smooth....I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to get serious about their skin.....doing this really does get rid of the dead skin so the skin care products that we spend so much money on, can actually get deep into our skin and work..........an amazing product !!!.......:)</li>
            <li> hello fellow amazonians.  i am writing to review the products carried by vacubrasion.  first the universal adapter does work with my dyson.  it fit like a glove.  mine is an older model DC07 yellow and gray. The forever tip that comes with the universal adapter is very good starter as it&#x27;s grain is very gentle.  the two forever tips felt like the next level.  i found that these would have been all i needed, even for forehead and nose was able to comfortably use them there and get all of the area.  i however was excited about the product so to add i ordered the eye and nose tips to address them crows landing.  next plan to order the all over tip so i can cover more ground.  Any who, one use under my belt, (not that i haven&#x27;t wanted to do more, but only had it a few days), will probably do my second treatment in a week tomorrow.  First treatment, gentle, easy and hopeful.  after,  did not want to stop, but trying to follow directions-smooth, lil pink, but not much and slight fading of lines under my eyes, so looking forward to the progress there.  would highly recommend this product 100%. i am like others who have posted am previous recipient of microdermabrasion with my fascialist on a regular basis and loved the results i received and now am so pleased that i can do this for my self at home for the same price of one treatment, accept now i have a machine and get to keep it.  customer service was great at getting back to me via email with my questions and very encouraging and honest nice to find now a days.  dewy skin awaits, if you are on the fence and able to order-go for it. very happy i did. will post with more updates as we go. be well</li>
            <li> So easy and effective. Love this contraption. Works with my Dyson just attach hose to top nozzle.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a full system. Word to the wise, read it carefully. You will need a vacuum with hand suction devise for it to work. The directions aren&#x27;t clear so be prepared to look it up on website. Also, it comes with 2 heads but not sure yet what the differences, you must buy additional diamonds for specific issues on the face. Too soon to tell but so far not much difference. Skin peel was easier.</li>
            <li> Love it, really works. Using my own vacuum is much more effective and reliable than the manufacturer&#x27;s machine.</li>
            <li> 1 tip scratched my face. The other tip worked well. Used with the suction holes completely open to decrease broken capillaries. Does smooth your face if you get a good tip.</li>
            <li> Same review as the one for the Nose Diamond Tips. I like it so far. I think I need a stronger wet/dry vac to get the most benefit out of using these though.</li>
            <li> I love this machine!! People saying that people are paid/given free products for their Amazon reviews.....where&#x27;s mine?! Just kidding. But that claim is ridiculous. Anyway, I received one professional microderm treatment on vacation at a spa for my acne scars and LOVED it. I was searching online for local spas to follow up on my treatments and somehow came across this machine. It had amazing reviews so I asked my best friend who is an aesthetician if this was a decent machine and she said that YES, the diamond tips that come with it are what spas use!! I thought it was sort of odd that this connects to an actual vacuum cleaner but it actually works super well!! I&#x27;ve used it twice already and it&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, easy to clean, and the hose allows you to make the suction as strong as you want it. Will continue to use and CANNOT wait to see all my acne scars disappear!!!!! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This kit is very easy to use.  My skin glows after using it.  More importantly it worked on my old scars that are left from an accident I had 20 years ago. I have been using this only for one month. I have tried all kinds of creams, chemical peels or derma rollers all to no avail. Microdermabrasion followed by contractubex (scar treatment) has shown tremendous decrease in scar size in contrast to what plastic surgeons I saw have suggested.  I will keep using this, it has been the best investment along with contractubex on scar treatment and I believe it has already paid off.  I hope that the tip will last long and work on dark spots, some indented acne and chickenpox scars.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and I just finished using it for the first time. I am very pleased. I bought a Nubrilliance on a trial 10 days ago and used it a few times. I was looking to purchase replacement tips for it and I came across the Vacubrasion kit. I decided to order it and I would decide which was better. I am packing up the Nub. and sending it back tomorrow. This Vacubrasion works 100% better. I have a Shark vacuum, a Bissell and a shopvac. The included attachment works with the shopvac but not with the other two. Luckily I had another attachment that I had from a shedaway pet brush that was a little bigger and it all hooked together to go onto my Shark. In the future I may purchase a 1.5 gallon shopvac to use just for this, but for now I am very happy with my purchase. It came at a great price, It arrived quickly and was packaged very nicely.  The results on my face were much better with this tip. It smooths over your face easily and feels like a professional microdermabrasion. After some time I will come back to comment on future results. As for now, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product it didn&#x27;t work with any of my vacuum cleaners so I returned it to Amazon.  The company contacted me about my problem and asked for my suggestions on how to improve it.  I sent them some ideas like including an adaptor and providing more detail about its use in owner&#x27;s guide.  They promptly responded which was a very pleasant surprise.  Then they sent me a new version of the product. It worked beautifully and I have been using it twice a week since then with wonderful results.  I am very impressed with both their product and outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li> This microdermabrasion system is the Best you can buy out there.  It is really easy to use and very effective at renewing your skin for a more youthful appearance.  You have everything you need to get started right away( 2 tips are included:1 for your face, 1 for your body, a wand, a vacuum hose and the universal cylindrical thing to hook up to your existing canister vacuum).  Just hook this up to your regular canister vacuum,(I use a small wet/dry vacuum) and begin- it&#x27;s that easy. There are no replacement filters or tips to buy as other microdermabrasion systems require and no need for chemicals of any kind(that is a big plus for me).  Once you purchase this, you have no continious expense or upkeep. The tips are built to last for a very long time. That was just what I was looking for in a unit.  It&#x27;s very affordable and perfect to do your own microdermabrasion treatments and get the professional results for such a low cost.  I use it on my face and my whole body- even my feet. I love, love, love it! There customer service is Tops too! They are so friendly and helpful- even \\&quot;after\\&quot; you buy the products. THANKS SKINVAC for making such a great innovative and AFFORDABLE system that really works!</li>
            <li> For the price and ease of use, you can&#x27;t beat this product!  It works as good or better than any treatment I have had in a salon or spa.  You will see AND feel the difference as soon as you use it and the results the days following. In addition, I had a question about buying their &amp;#34;quiet vac,&amp;#34; sent them a message and was promptly answered with the information I had requested.  I had read other reviews about their excellent customer service but now I can say that is indeed a fact, jack!  :)  Seriously, great customer service, fast shipping, and an outstanding product!  If you are looking for salon-level microdermabrasion at a super affordable price, you will NOT regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Watch the video on YouTube and follow directions exactly. I was really skeptical and was expecting to hate this.  I have an upright vac that I use with and it works just fine. Do recommend doing test small patch on inner arm first and practice getting the rhythm down. Results on face were comparable to what I would get from expensive salon treatment.  For less than cost of one treatment and I can use repeatedly.  Follow directions and go slow and gently.  Acne is gone and the discoloration on my face are getting lighter.  Had purchased an at home  peel but this will replace that as its gentler and more effective.</li>
            <li> you can purchase a small shop vac at home depot for 30 dollars that will work with it...I get salon results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the vacubrasion for a few weeks now and I just love how smooth my skin is after using it. It&#x27;s very easy to use and it only takes a few minutes. The result is better than any product I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The best part is you don&#x27;t have to keep buying replacement parts.  It&#x27;s made to last a long time.  I just clean the tip with alcohol wipes and it&#x27;s ready for use.</li>
            <li> I recieved my vacubrasion two and half weeks ago and I love it! I have had microdermbrasion done on and off over the years at spas both medical and not. I have to say this is just as strong as all the treatments I have recieved and paid $85 and up for. My main concern are fine lines, brown spots from sun damage and acne scars. I have done 3 treatments since recieving it and have notice a differnce in my skin. First it is super soft, which anyone who has had microderm knows that feeling. Second my line are still there but less noticeable like my brown spots. My red acne scars are almost gone, didn&#x27;t have many. As far as the deeper acne scars, since they are not super deep I think that I will get good results on the next months-I will keep you posted. Also my skin is getting a very even tone. Needless to say I still will never go to the spa for microderm again, there is no need now.&lt;br /&gt;The system is super easy to use and the diamond tips last virtually forever so it is a great investent for $70.00. All you do is screw the diamond tip into the wand, attach the wand to the clear hose, then attached the hose to your vacum tools attachment. Then turn on your vacuum (make sure it is set on tools) and go about microderming you face. The suction is regulated through the attachments the kit comes with so don&#x27;t worry you won&#x27;t suck your face off! Also, if you don&#x27;t want to use the wand with the hose, you can use the black attachment in your kit and attach that to your  vacuum hose and screw your diamond tip into that.I think it is important to watch some microdermbrasion videos so you know the direction to go with the daimond tip on the face.I had bought Nubrillance (suction got week very fast, returned it) in the past and it had a book with these directions so that is how I know plus from getting treatements. You Tube is suppose to have videos which help as well. Vacubrasion has AMAZING customer service so if you have any questions just go to their website and call or emailthem. I used email and always got fast timely very helpful responses ,their email is sales@vacubrasion.com So if you have never done microderm on your skin then I recommend to send them an email and ask them the directions to go on the face.&lt;br /&gt;As far as cleanup I dip the tips fastly in rubbing alcohol and let them dry in a very clean place and wipe the hoses, I store everything in a clean place away from other stuff in my bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing I also notice that when using the diamond face tip I get more suction if I don&#x27;t use the clear hose/wand attachment and just use the black attachment the kit comes with where you screw the diamond tip into the end. The difference isn&#x27;t much but there is a slight difference. When using the body tip (ordered seperately, it is rounder and bigger) I notice it has more suction attached to the clear hose on the wand.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item if you enjoy getting microdermbrasion treatments but don&#x27;t enjoy the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0083K4WTE SkinVac MD by Vacubrasion Basic Home Microdermabrasion Kit (Patent Pending)]]</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the metal wand and the ease of use.  My kit came with two tips; one D200 and one D100,  The included instructions are easy to understand.  The tips are easy to attach to the metal wand and interchange in seconds.  When attached to a vacuum, all of the associated dust disappears into the tubing.  I could see immediate, positive results.</li>
            <li> The packaging An arrival exceeded my expectations but I&#x27;m not sure if its the vacuum I own or the actual demabrasion kit that doesn&#x27;t have such a powerful suction. Overall it&#x27;s a pretty decent buy....</li>
            <li> First of all, I am a do-it-yourself person: hair, skin, nails, feet, etc (for which my husband is very grateful, LOL).  I have been using the SkinVacMD for 3-4 weeks and highly recommend it as it is very user friendly.  I like that I can treat my skin at  home and that I am saving time and money doing it myself.  My skin is smoother, glowing, clearer, and becoming younger-looking as a result of my weekly treatments. Surface wrinkles are diminishing, and treated skin looks better the next day.  My hands are looking better too.  I also like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to buy replacement parts often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having facials every two months since 1989 because I really needed to. Ever since I started professional microdermabrasion, I never returned to doing regular facials. But doing it in a salon is expensive. So I searched for a microdermabrasion machine that I could use at home, and had power close to that of the professional one. This product (SKinVacMD: Ultra Radiance ProDeluxe Microdermabrasion) was worth every penny. Its power is great, it works perfectly, and has awesome results. I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll need to return to the professional salon for microdermabrasion/facials anymore. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> In the past, I regularly had micro-dermabrasion at the Dermatologist&#x27;s office to treat my acne. It was very effective, but I was only in my early twenties, so had no concerns about aging skin. The only downside to it was the cost and the inconvenience of having to go into the office to get it done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m 38 and though I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles to speak of, I know that isn&#x27;t going to last forever. I was looking for something I could do at home. Reviews of other at home micro-dermabrasion machines that broke soon after their product guarantee expired, or needed replacement parts were a turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter SkinVacMD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived faster than expected and exactly as pictured. Fits perfectly onto my vacuum, and is easy to use. After a few passes of the Diamond Tip, my skin felt amazingly soft and looked smoother. I can&#x27;t wait to see the cumulative effects! I plan on ordering the body tip ASAP.</li>
            <li> First off, I will start by saying that I did weeks of COPIOUS research before settling on the SkinVac. I had been willing to spend in the neighborhood of $150-$300 for a good quality, semi-professional, home diamond-tip microdermabrasion machine. I must have looked at every machine offered on eBay, Amazon and LCL Salon products but the reviews of the Vacubrasion system were so glowing that I decided to try the SkinVac first. As a Prime member, with Amazon&#x27;s excellent return policy, I didn&#x27;t have much to lose but an unexpected bonus was discovering that the folks at Vacubrasion are amazingly quick to respond to any requests for advice and information. I contacted them via email and received a response within an hour. I have had several professional microdermabrasion treatments and was experiencing some insecurity and anxiousness to try it on my own. The company is extremely helpful with guidance and as others have mentioned there are \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos available on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a \\&quot;whole house\\&quot; vacuum and was not sure how the SkinVac adaptor device was going to work with the long hose which plugs into the wall. I was concerned that the suction of our high powered system might be too powerful for this device but with the provided attachment that comes with a hose of perfect length, I am able to adjust the air flow and get a wide range of appropriate and perfect suction for different areas of my face and decollate. Our vacuum unit itself has an air-flow adjustment so I can further refine the suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 50&#x27;s with quite a bit of sun damage so my main purpose for using microdermabrasion (along with Skinceutical &amp; Devita skin products and bi-annual, mid-level ReJuvePeel procedures) is to address and hopefully reverse the damage. As with anything new, I experienced a bit of a learning curve in finessing the handling of the wand but now after having used it 3 times, I am feeling more confident about when to use less suction and/or a less course tip. If your skin is a little older and thinner like mine, I definitely recommend an \\&quot;easy does it\\&quot; approach (the D100 tip is perfect for this) to get a sense of how much is enough and notice how your skin responds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I discovered was that for my skin, instead of washing with a soap cleanser which strips the skin, if I use a creme cleanser such as Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Cleansing Milk, which nourishes the skin, my skin feels clean and more moist for the tip to more easily slide over without feeling quite so scratchy. My skin is very soft afterwards, albeit a bit pink and the areas of sun damage can even be a bit red (this is normal but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily want to run out of the house right away) so I moisturize well and within a few hours, my skin is glowing. I am really looking forward to seeing the long term effects of regular microdermabrasion that I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have the time or money for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I love about the SkinVac is that it all fits in a small black pouch (which is provided) and fits neatly under my cabinet. Easy to just grab and go! I also highly recommend the Microdermabrasion \\&quot;Forever\\&quot; Tips for Nose, Lips, and Under Eyes. The small tip is excellent for getting into the curves of the nose and the fine skin around the mouth. I also use the fine tip for a final pass over the sun damage spots. GREAT PURCHASE!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice little unit. Takes a little getting use to as for the pressure to use but other than that, no problem. In the long run think of all the money you&#x27;ll save by doing it yourself!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. I am using it with a Dyson vaccum cleaner and I can make the hose fit. My husband used a clear piece of plastic for a connector and it works!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it daily since it arrived in the mail and I ordered the large tip for body and neck. I am constantly chasing new beauty products, some work, some don&#x27;t but this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> At this time, I must give the product only 3 stars, but it has the serious potential to get 5 stars when the kinks are worked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I connected the hosed, wanded tip to my Hoover Bagless WindTunnel Canister Vac with 3 suction levels.  I opened the adjustable port on the tipped wand to maximum and set the suction control to low on my vac.  I began to let it flow across my skin, neither pulling or pushing.  As I worked over all the parts of my body that were reachable (I had the day off, give me a break), I saw the exfoliated skin accumulate in the vac&#x27;s dust catcher.  So, the product does what it is purported to do.  However, upon completion of my exfoliation session, I had welts over much of the area I had exfoliated.  So, I cotton-balled some green tea, witch hazel, and glycerin mixture over them to soothe and promote healing.  The welts turned to scratches that burned much of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company about my scratches and they seemed interested in the problem and solving the problem.  They offered to send out new tips, including an additional finer tip, since my guess was that the scratches seemed to come from only a tiny section of the tip, not across the entire tip, which may have been due to an abrasive fine sticking up a little higher than the rest, i.e., a craggy rock with a point jutting upward.  On May 2, 2013, she said that the tips were shipped out.  It is May 9, 2013 and the tips have not arrived yet, so I cannot attest to any improvements in the exfoliation results yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They asked me to take a picture with the wand attached to my vac and said there was a link under the product image for customers to add images.  I have seen that link on other Amazon products, but can&#x27;t find one here.  When I find it, the pic will be posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though my scratches lasted for about a week, I am willing to give this contraption another try. I will post with updated experience with products and company.</li>
            <li> UltraRadiance is a wonderful home Micro-Dermabrasion Kit.  The kit is in a very professional looking silver \\&quot;suitcase\\&quot;.  I absolutely love the case.    I wish the videos and included charts showed HOW to attach the system to a home vacuum cleaner.  I figured it out after awhile but instruction would have been nice.    The on-line videos show a model using an UltraRadiance vacuum - not a \\&quot;house\\&quot; vacuum.  The model  is in a terrible position so you can&#x27;t really see the technique.  He hair covers the area she&#x27;s \\&quot;vacuuming\\&quot;.  After all that - I figured out how to use the system and LOVE it!!    I have 3 vacuum cleaners - a Hoover - a Dirt Devil and a Eureka.  The system fits all of their hoses.    My face feels so soft and the blackheads that were on my nose are gone.    I had seen a system on HSN for twice  as much and you had to buy more little filters.  This system is all inclusive. The diamond heads will last forever.    This is an amazing value and it really cleans the skin surface.  It doesn&#x27;t just exfoliate - it sucks the dead skins cells away.I&#x27;m really pleased with this product : )      p.s. It&#x27;s MADE IN AMERICA !!!! and they included a free sample of an organic skin product.  I love on my lips.</li>
            <li> Great microdermabraision.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this product!  The results are better than recent Microdermabrasions from a spa and dermatologist&#x27;s office.  I purchased the conversions system and the lip plumper and eye diamond heads.  Just think, I get a microdermabrasion anytime I want for the same price as one microderm at a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> It is an incomplete package.  I don&#x27;t like being told that this will work great when I need a whole other system to attach it to.  Very deceptive.</li>
            <li> I am always trying new skin care products and was looking at getting a professional microdermabrasion machine. I came across this item and was struck by the novel idea and the positive reviews that others had left. Since it was significantly less expensive than the machines, I went ahead and took a chance, and I am really glad I did! it is very easy to use, fit perfectly on my Hoover vacuum and I went to town. It does not hurt, just a slight pulling on the skin, and there was redness in areas that had been gone over more than once, but that was gone by the next day. My skin felt soft and silky everywhere I used it. I only did one forearm and asked three people to tell me which one felt smoother and all three were easily able to identify the arm that the microdermabrasion was done on, even though there was not any real visible difference. It did help lighten so sun spots on my arms, I am hoping with repeated treatment and better use of sunscreen I will see even better results. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Kit for just a few weeks now and the results are incredible. i can do my own microdermabrasion at home with SkinVac. It works exactly the same and even better i am saving thousands of dollars from going to get the same treatment at a specialist office. it&#x27;s an investment worth spending $70 for amazing looking skin!( I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but healthy looking skin is very important to me! :) ). SkinVac does the trick, it gently and effectively removes your dead / flaky skin cells, leaving a glowing newer and clear looking skin in just couple treatments.  I love how the diamond abrasive tips are reusable, so you never have to replace them and its super easy to clean with just alcohol wipes or even soap and water. Also the kit comes with a brilliant adjustable suction attachment that allows you to regulate the pressure of the suction around the sensitive areas like under the eyes. You can also youtube Vaccubrasion for simple instructions on how to use skinVac.(i did). YOU WONT REGRET IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is the best little tool a women can get. I have it myself and it is great. I bought the whole system but when I go over to my family&#x27;s house I just take it with out my vac and I plug it into their vac. It&#x27;s great for on the go where ever you go. I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kit for about a month now and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I&#x27;ve always had a bit of mild adult acne, and my face has completely cleared since I started using the SkinVacMD system! And again, this is only a month in! My skin is noticeably softer, my pores are smaller, and as a result, I feel so much more confident. Thanks UltraRadiance, you&#x27;re the best!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I got it as a birthday gift from my husband after my friend recommended it to me.  I am 46 and starting to see some deep wrinkles between my eyebrows and on my neck that give away my age.  After only a few uses, I am already starting to see those wrinkles and my crows&#x27; feet go away!  AND, my 14 year old son is getting some acne, and after using it only two times on him, we both see a DRAMATIC improvement!  I would recommend this for any woman (or man) who wants to look &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34;, and to anyone dealing with acne or recurrent pimples.  PLUS, I have really dry lips, and after only one use around my lips, they are SOOOO much better!  I think I&#x27;ll try using it on my thumbs next to get rid of my splits!!  :)  P,S,  I have a Dyson and the connectors work fine with it, in case you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
            <li> First off I have to mention that my daughter is a master esthetician in a very prestigious skin spa. Discussed my purchase with her, mentioning all the rave reviews. With a what do I have to lose attitude.&lt;br /&gt;First time I had my daughter use it on me, using my vacuum. Suction wasn&#x27;t great. Decided to buy a wet/dry vac from Amazon very inexpensive. Definitely made a difference! It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long at all. There are tutorials on YouTube to explain it all. Needless to say, I&#x27;m happy with my decision in purchasing my skin vac md. My daughter says my skin&#x27;s texture is smoother as well as much brighter. Hands look smoother too! I&#x27;m going to start working on my stretchmarks. Will update soon.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product? 100% YES!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few months now and have noticed much smoother skin on my face and hands.  Skinvac is easy to use at home with my existing vacuum.  It is much more convenient and economical than a visit to the spa or doctors&#x27; office.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The SkinVacMD is wonderful.  I can get everywhere on my face neck and decollete.  The suction is great and I can move so fast that a facial is done in 10-15 minutes.  I use the kit with my Shark Lift Away, roughest texture tip and on full suction.  I use the device every three days and follow immediately with a skin peel.  I have used Nubrilliance and the suction would give out.  Then the cord would break.  I am quite happy with this solution!</li>
            <li> No it didn&#x27;t, I thought  it has the vacuum machine already so i have to order the machine which has the attachment  it cost me more, I thought of returning it  but oh well just don&#x27;t want to undergo the hassle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to leave gushy, rave reviews for purchases I make. I&#x27;m generally skeptical and do a lot of research before I make a purchase-especially for items that claim to provide professional results for for products used in the home. However, thanks to the other women who gave this product great reviews, I felt obliged to pay it forward.  I just got it the SkinVac yesterday and used then and again, earlier this morning. After 2 uses on my face and one on my arms- for my KP,I am so impressed. My skin feels and looks amazing. I only wish I remembered to take a before and after photo! I&#x27;ve spent a fortune getting professional facials (both microderm and others) and though I will still go from time to time to pamper myself, this will allow me to get clearer, more radiant skin at a fraction of the cost.  I have frequented some of the best spas in NYC, San Francisco,  Toronto, Paris. I have had treatments of every kind at the dermatologist from fillers to peels as well as minor cosmetic surgery. In other words, I am not new to the world of beauty and as a woman in her early 40s, I am more than frequent customer at various &amp;#34;service providers&amp;#34;. I can tell you, without hesitation, that this device is the real deal. The tips are high quality and the weight of wand is similar to those you&#x27;d find in a professional setting. What&#x27;s great is that the suction can adjusted from be gentle to strong, depending on the fitting you use and with the option of different tips, there&#x27;s something for every skin type and different parts of the body. I can&#x27;t wait to show my friends. I&#x27;m sure once they skin how radiant my skin looks after 1 use, they&#x27;ll be impressed so impressed that they&#x27;ll also become customers. I would advise that you follow directions carefully, start with the gentlest suction and tip you can and take your time. There are You Tube videos you can watch that are very handy. Who knows, I may even make my own! Perhaps we all should, and post photos of our skins progress!</li>
            <li> Updated March 10, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is my original review of the product, which I gave 2 stars. Have upgraded to 3 and may raise higher.  After commenting about the short length of the hose to attach to an upright vacuum, the company contacted me directly and very quickly.  They appear to be very interested in resolving customer concerns and approach it as a way to improve the product.  At no time, did I feel the company tried to tell me I was doing something wrong.  They promptly sent a much longer hose that works great.  They have followed up with emails, asking for input.  I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to give it higher ratings.  From what I&#x27;ve read about the competeting products, I&#x27;d still go with this product first.  It can not break down, there are not ongoing costs for new parts.  The customer service is outstanding.  I haven&#x27;t asked, nor do I want a refund.  My guess is, if I wanted to return it, the company would do  so without question.  These are really nice people, that are interested in improving the product and making sure their customers are satisfied.  For me, not providing a higher rating is I&#x27;m not sure if home micro really has an effect; time will tell.  If you want to give home micro a try; forget the hassles that are raised in the competing product reviews.  Just start with this product to give micro a test drive. This is simple, low cost, and great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is my original review:&lt;br /&gt;I was very interested in trying out a home microdermasion machine. Put some serious effort into researching the reviews. Decided that the 2 more popular machines that have vacuum/suction seemed to be prone to problems. Even though they have a fair share of good reviews, I decided I didn&#x27;t need the hassle.  I found this device on another website, came to Amazon and the reviews seemed promising. Decided to give it a try. My unit came directly from Amazon. Ordered it on a Saturday, it was delivered on the following Tuesday with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the low rating. There just isn&#x27;t enough info in product description on Amazon or the product website.  I liked the idea of not having to pay for the vacuum function, and more importantly not having to deal with potential break down issues in the future.  However, the product description isn&#x27;t specific enough about what size of vacuum hose it fits.  From the instruction sheet:  fits 1.25 inch round outlet. There is an adaptor that helps a bit. The hose must be round,  a Dyson will not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get the basic component the microdermasion head that goes directly on the vacuum hose, keep in mind that you will be holding a 1+ inch hose in your hand while your trying to do a self microdermabrasion; that&#x27;s pretty thick. Additionally, you are going to need to do the procedure while trying to manage a vacuum hose; they aren&#x27;t the most flexible things.  Then there&#x27;s the sanitary issue.  The instructions are very clear that use wash and put alcohol on your skin before you start.  But, you&#x27;re using one hand to hold a vacuum hose that is cleaning throughout your house.  I suggest you might want to consider this.  Now, this product is available with a vacuum; you might want to consider that. Also there are some excellent small vacs on Amazon in the $35 range. The unit I ordered has a flexible hose about 15 inches long. It&#x27;s too short to avoid having to hold the vacuum hose too. My vacuum hose is larger, but the adapter helps but won&#x27;t keep the device&#x27;s hose and vacuum connected without me holding it.  So, to do a procedure I need to hold the vacuum hose and try to manipulate the tip. Even if the pieces go together well, the provided hose is too short to just let a the vacuum hose hang there.  You do need to support it or the weight will make doing the procedure really difficult; if not, unsafe...possibility of scratching the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to have been designed when most people had canister vacs.  Any upright will probably have some issues. I suggest that before ordering this product that you take your vacuum to the area where you would be doing the procedure, take the hose and bring close to your face and see what control you have and ability to perform the procedure as shown in the Youtube videos.  Also, get a sense of how you feel about the sanitation issue of having the vac hose so close to you.  If you order the model with the extension hose, the vac hose will still be about 15 inches away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a really good idea, they need to think it out a bit more.  At a minimum add more length to the provided hose.  I haven&#x27;t returned the product yet. I&#x27;ve ordered a small vac with the right size hose to only use with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 6 weeks and love it! My skin looks and feels so much better. My acne scars are starting to disappear! It hooks right up to my vacuum. Totally recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I chose this after a long research because the tips were forever and diamond, instead of aluminum oxide crystals etc. that need to be replaced very often. I&#x27;m very glad it fit my older model about 10 years old Dyson, so I didn&#x27;t have to spend extra on a vacuum but after a couple of treatments, the tips don&#x27;t seam to be &#x27;forever&#x27;, maybe &#x27;a couple of times&#x27;! I put them in vinegar overnight and they still look dull and darker color, one got even oxidized and nothing like that shiny diamond in the pictures! Finer tip D-200 didn&#x27;t seem to exfoliate at all so I tried D-100 and then changed the suction to maximum cause adjustable was not good enough but still doesn&#x27;t feel like a professional micro, not even close but maybe in the long run who knows. I think I exfoliate my skin better with a damp sponge topped with baking soda and I can use this just to suck out the dead skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the SkinVacMD microdermabrasion kit for about 3 months now and I just love it.  I use retin-A pretty much daily and it can leave me a little dry and flaky, I use the microdermabrasion kit about once or twice a week and it takes care of all the scaliness.  It also seems like the retin-A works a little better now too.  My skin looks better than it has in years, much softer and smoother.  I was trying to go to the spa about once a month for microdermabrasion, but it was costing about $75.00 a session and wasn&#x27;t always in the budget.  Now, I can use this kit at home once or twice a week (it paid for itself after just one use) and the results are equal to the spa treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this company is just terrific to buy from.  I was missing a part in my kit, so I e-mailed them and they not only sent a replacement right away, but they also threw in some extra goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like getting microdermabrasion at a spa, take the plunge and get this kit for home use, it works just as well and you&#x27;ll be able to afford to do it as much as you like without going broke.</li>
            <li> I have just a word : excellent. I ve been using it during 3 weeks an i feel my skin sooooo smooth. It is very good relation price/quality. I recommand it absolutely. You will feel/see the difference as soon as you use it. Furthermore it allows to the creams to penetrate much more.</li>
            <li> Great product! I had been looking for an at home micro-dermabrasion system, but balked at the cheap-looking all-in-one gadgets that looked like they would break easily.  Also, I did not want to bother with continually replacing filters and tips.  The SkinVacMD is easy to use, easy to clean. The inter-changeable tips are a nice weight and fit tightly on the wand. I bought a small shop vac for this use, the hose fits perfectly. Customer service responded to my inquiry quickly. Genius!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely fantastic product and I am thrilled that I bought it.  I am a DIY person on just about everything and skincare is no exception.  I have been looking at microderm machines for over a year and I was always concerned about the fact that weak suction was one of the main complaints people had.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend $200+ for something that was going to perform poorly.  This is a brilliant product because it uses your home vac, in my case a small ShopVac, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about suction being an issue.  I hadn&#x27;t realized until I saw it that the attachments are vented so it&#x27;s not as if you&#x27;re getting the full brunt of the vacuum suction on your skin.  There is enough but not so much that it is uncomfortable or worrisome.  It feels absolutely fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips are reusable and the cord and attachments look like they&#x27;d last forever. The wands will most standard tips so you could reuse tips that you have or buy others if you see them on sale.  I love that the tips are made to last and that I&#x27;m not roped into buying refills of crystals, filters or pads.  The tips are great and I got a deal where a free body tip was included.  There are two that look exactly the same in size but one is for sensitive skin and the other for regular.  The information is listed on the side of each tip so you can tell which one you&#x27;re using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it today and I&#x27;ve already used it and my skin feels as soft as it has when I&#x27;ve done it at the spa.  I was probably applied a little bit too much pressure because my cheeks are quite red, but that was user error.  I use RetinA and other alpha hydroxy products and when I went over my forehead the amount of skin that peeled was shocking.  It was just waiting to slough off and the microderm treatment accelerated the process.  That wasn&#x27;t the case on all parts of my face, but those that I&#x27;ve treated more heavily with the creams showed quite a bit of peeling.  I am hoping that this will improve the look of the line between my eyebrows and the smile lines around my eyes.  I may take a picture to post some before and afters over the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled that I found this.  I can&#x27;t think of a reason (other than the noise of the vacuum cleaner) to choose anything else over this.  I am incredibly picky and I can say that it works and feels exactly like the treatments I&#x27;ve had done at the spa.  One use and I&#x27;ve paid less than one treatment, which is just fantastic.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> what the customer wanted</li>
            <li> The SkinVacMD seems to work well. However, I have not noticed any miraculous changes. I have deep nose pores and have been using the strongest vacuum attachment. It definitely helps, but the only way to evacuate these deeper pores is by having a facial and applying physical pressure. The quality of this product is actually better than anticipated. For an overall self-administered micro-derm abrasion, it&#x27;s a good tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these new tips for a couple of weeks and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. The conversion kit fits most vacuums or NB device. My skin feels wonderful!</li>
