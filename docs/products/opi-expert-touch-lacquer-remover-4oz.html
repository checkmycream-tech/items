            <li>The best remover I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This product works great to remove the OPI lacquer, but doesn&#x27;t have any direction on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Removes any kind of polish - boom!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s citrusy and quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>OPI polish removers are the best I have used,so easy to remove the polish</li>
            <li>Just as good as any store brand.  </li>
            <li>It works so quickly and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>If you have been using OPI nail polish, easily the best available, you have found out that it is truly a lacquer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing to me.</li>
            <li>This polish remover is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells about as nice as a polish remover can smell --</li>
            <li>I love OPI nail polish, they have beautiful colors and easy to use, but they just don&#x27;t hold up well.</li>
            <li>It says on the bottle that it&#x27;s suitable for soak-off gels too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell that this stuff works any better than what you get at the drugstore</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The scent is definitely better than store-bought ones, however, it still contains acetone, can&#x27;t be any better for your nails.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I even bought another one for my mom.  </li>
            <li>Okay as a gift size.</li>
            <li>But, I prefer the 16 oz size - much better price.</li>
            <li>and I have used many.</li>
            <li>OPI remover is much much better, easier and quicker to remove.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It removes cremes and foils quite easily.</li>
            <li>It goes very fast and even faster if you sit on your finger to warm up the lacquer and nails.</li>
            <li>The polish comes off very easily and it is gentle.</li>
            <li>Works strongly and quickly but with a pleasant smell, which typically isn&#x27;t the case with acetone-containing lacquer removers.</li>
            <li>It works on fairly fresh nail polish and knowing the chemical well (how do you do?)</li>
            <li>If you will buy it replace it to different more comfortable bottle</li>
            <li>The polish slides right off with no damage to the nail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be fine paying just as much for the tips as I pay for the pen, so it isn&#x27;t as much about price as it is about principle and outright wastefulness.</li>
            <li>A respectable nail polish blogger recommended OPI Expert Touch after I emailed and asked her how she manages to change polish colors four times in a row and not totally trash her nails.</li>
            <li>It can remove the nail polish perfectly and the smell is much better than the previously OPI green and red one.</li>
            <li>Normally, I have to put my remover-soaked cotton balls in the kitchen to keep the loo from smelling like acetone, but this powerful remover can be tossed in the restroom wastebasket with no worries about odor.</li>
            <li>Just bought the 16 oz since I really like it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper per ounce.</li>
            <li>Like night and day compared to the old stuff.</li>
            <li>it will takeoff old polish too.</li>
            <li>It came off quickly and my nails didn&#x27;t feel as dried out afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The relatively large bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Very pricey  for what is offered; not much product.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails or the skin around my nails.</li>
            <li> I would wet a cotton ball, stick it on my nail, and wait a minute or so while I surfed the internet.</li>
            <li> So far, the only things I&#x27;ve found to dislike about them is that they don&#x27;t sell their products in easier-to-reach-in-a-jiff places like all the drugstores and, worst of all, that their Correct and Cleanup Pen doesn&#x27;t have refill tips sold separately, so that once you&#x27;ve used up the two with which it comes, you have to buy a whole new pen instead of just refill tips.</li>
            <li> So maybe it&#x27;s nicer than other removers I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> I will never use any other remover.</li>
            <li> Becouse there is very wide hole</li>
            <li> But I noticed that after using it 5-6 times i spent almost half of bottle</li>
            <li> but like any other acetone based nail polish remover, it eventually thin and yellow your nails.</li>
            <li> prefer this over any nail polish remover on the market a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try the little bottle of OPI remover that came with a manicure set I had.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and I ended up having to peel the gel off my nails which made it ver thin and fragile.</li>
            <li> I had a manicure a few weeks ago that seriously took me half an hour to remove with my dollar store stuff.</li>
            <li> Then a few twists and my nail would be stripped!</li>
            <li> my manicurist does...........dab a small piece of cotton, place it on the nail and wrap the end of your finger with a small piece of aluminium foil.  </li>
            <li> Past nail polish remover ever...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to rub hard at all</li>
            <li> Not much OPI gets wrong.</li>
            <li> I got tired of fighting to get my polish off.  </li>
            <li> so its impossible to use it just a little bit its always a lot</li>
            <li> bottle to try it because it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> We like OPI nail polish remover because it does not have the awful added fragrance in other polish removers.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that this stuff works any better than what you get at the drugstore</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish, they have beautiful colors and easy to use, but they just don&#x27;t hold up well.</li>
            <li> A respectable nail polish blogger recommended OPI Expert Touch after I emailed and asked her how she manages to change polish colors four times in a row and not totally trash her nails. So I ordered some and it&#x27;s completely amazing. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails or the skin around my nails. It smells about as nice as a polish remover can smell -- it&#x27;s citrusy and quite pleasant. It removes cremes and foils quite easily. For stubborn glitters, I soak a cotton pad with Expert Touch and leave it on the nail for about ten minutes. The polish slides right off with no damage to the nail. It says on the bottle that it&#x27;s suitable for soak-off gels too. It&#x27;s just a perfect polish remover. I love this stuff. I bought the jumbo bottle. I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Works strongly and quickly but with a pleasant smell, which typically isn&#x27;t the case with acetone-containing lacquer removers. Normally, I have to put my remover-soaked cotton balls in the kitchen to keep the loo from smelling like acetone, but this powerful remover can be tossed in the restroom wastebasket with no worries about odor. Basically, it&#x27;s the quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from OPI. Not much OPI gets wrong. So far, the only things I&#x27;ve found to dislike about them is that they don&#x27;t sell their products in easier-to-reach-in-a-jiff places like all the drugstores and, worst of all, that their Correct and Cleanup Pen doesn&#x27;t have refill tips sold separately, so that once you&#x27;ve used up the two with which it comes, you have to buy a whole new pen instead of just refill tips. I&#x27;d be fine paying just as much for the tips as I pay for the pen, so it isn&#x27;t as much about price as it is about principle and outright wastefulness.</li>
            <li> It can remove the nail polish perfectly and the smell is much better than the previously OPI green and red one.</li>
            <li> Just as good as any store brand.  Very pricey  for what is offered; not much product.</li>
            <li> If you have been using OPI nail polish, easily the best available, you have found out that it is truly a lacquer. Regular nail polish remover won&#x27;t touch it! Despite that, this polish remover does not damage your skin or your nails, and one cotton ball soaked in it will remove nail polish from all ten fingers.</li>
            <li> but like any other acetone based nail polish remover, it eventually thin and yellow your nails. The scent is definitely better than store-bought ones, however, it still contains acetone, can&#x27;t be any better for your nails.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I even bought another one for my mom.  I got tired of fighting to get my polish off.  It came off quickly and my nails didn&#x27;t feel as dried out afterwards.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Okay as a gift size. But, I prefer the 16 oz size - much better price.</li>
            <li> OPI polish removers are the best I have used,so easy to remove the polish and you don&#x27;t need a lot .I prefer this over any nail polish remover on the market a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing to me. I&#x27;ve lived to the age of 42 without realizing that nail polish removers are NOT all created equally, but I have now learned! I had a manicure a few weeks ago that seriously took me half an hour to remove with my dollar store stuff. When I repainted I used a glitter polish, and I did not want to go through that again, so I thought I&#x27;d try the little bottle of OPI remover that came with a manicure set I had. It took off the glitter polish, just like that! I would wet a cotton ball, stick it on my nail, and wait a minute or so while I surfed the internet. Then a few twists and my nail would be stripped! Like night and day compared to the old stuff. I immediately went online and ordered this bottle, and next time I will be getting a bigger one. This is my remover now, there is no comparison!</li>
            <li> It works on fairly fresh nail polish and knowing the chemical well (how do you do?) it will takeoff old polish too. The relatively large bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best nail polish removers that I have used. The polish comes off very easily and it is gentle.</li>
            <li> So maybe it&#x27;s nicer than other removers I don&#x27;t know I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference But I noticed that after using it 5-6 times i spent almost half of bottle Why ? Becouse there is very wide hole so its impossible to use it just a little bit its always a lot goes out If you will buy it replace it to different more comfortable bottle</li>
            <li> This product works great to remove the OPI lacquer, but doesn&#x27;t have any direction on the bottle.  I did like my manicurist does...........dab a small piece of cotton, place it on the nail and wrap the end of your finger with a small piece of aluminium foil.  It goes very fast and even faster if you sit on your finger to warm up the lacquer and nails.</li>
            <li> Past nail polish remover ever...and I have used many.</li>
            <li> I had been using drug store brand nail polish removers before I found this product. OPI remover is much much better, easier and quicker to remove. You don&#x27;t need to rub hard at all it just do the work in 2 secs! Love it and I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This polish remover is amazing. It works so quickly and smells wonderful. I will never use any other remover.I am a fan for life!!!</li>
            <li> Finally, a nail polish remover that actually works like it&#x27;s supposed to.  It takes the nail polish off fast with very little effort. I bought the 4 oz. bottle to try it because it&#x27;s expensive.  It lasted me for about 1 year.  Just bought the 16 oz since I really like it and it&#x27;s much cheaper per ounce.</li>
            <li> The best remover I have ever used.  Takes the polish off with (almost) one swipe.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to remove gel manicure and it did not work. I followed the instructions and I ended up having to peel the gel off my nails which made it ver thin and fragile.</li>
            <li> This product is a must for removing Opi lacquer polish.</li>
            <li> Removes any kind of polish - boom!</li>
            <li> We like OPI nail polish remover because it does not have the awful added fragrance in other polish removers.</li>
