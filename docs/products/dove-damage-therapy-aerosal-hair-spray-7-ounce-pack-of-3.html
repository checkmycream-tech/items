            <li>I have used it for years and have really loved it.  </li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t they just leave a good thing alone?  </li>
            <li>Why must companies take an excellent product and change it so it no longer resembles the original?  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Looks like they might be getting rid of this flexible hold great hairspray with no lingering strong smell.</li>
            <li>liked the prompt delivery from Amazon and</li>
            <li>/&gt;This really is the best hairspray!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I could still find the good stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is the old formula and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray</li>
            <li>so glad my daughter found it on amazon</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray</li>
            <li>I like it because there is no fragrance like most hair sprays</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray and am bummed I can&#x27;t find it at the store anymore.</li>
            <li>I just love the hold--it&#x27;s not sticky at all, but it holds well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I could get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this product because I don&#x27;t get that crispy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>Great experience, the product is awesome, and it was packed very well and order arrived quickly, as expected.</li>
            <li>I have tried the new Dove, but this one works great.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who needs a light hold but still works.</li>
            <li>This hairspray goes on light, but has hold that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The light scent also fades quickly and isn&#x27;t noticeable, even by others, after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is a true flexable hold.</li>
            <li>Dove Damage Therapy Hair Spray, works great to hold the hair, but not make it feel sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li>have 6 cans of unused hairspray because I can&#x27;t find the right one to replace the Dove damage</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sensitive to scents and I don&#x27;t find this one to be strong at all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering how long even Amazon and its vendors will be able to get the original.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;new Dove Flexible Hold\\&quot; hairspray is in no way comparable to the original.</li>
            <li>While i am paying almost double per bottle here on Amazon, i would gladly pay it...</li>
            <li>so I was so glad to find it on Amazon and purchase several cans at a time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally like hair spray but this particular product is light, yet does the job.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave the hair hard like you have used &amp;#34;glue.&amp;#34;  Give the hair good body.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for damaged thin hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I will continue to order it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I think you need to bring down the shipping cost to sell even more of the product.</li>
            <li>I chose it because it is good and very hard to get anymore in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really worth wile to recommend it to others that have the same need.</li>
            <li>I finally found the right hairspray and now it&#x27;s no longer on the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray- holds my style without feeling stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>This is the dove flexible hold that I used before they \\&quot;new and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance with my hair</li>
            <li>sadly, something that works too good, gets out of stock because Dove HAS to put new and impoved on can, now the new replacement is sticky and smelly.</li>
            <li>i have tried from cheap to very expensive products on my gray fine hair, nothing works like the dove hair spray, not even ion hot rollers.</li>
            <li>hair looks natural and feels soft.  </li>
            <li>I want this formula back without having to pay a fortune for it to dealers who were smart enough to buy out the closeout sales.</li>
            <li>The new stuff makes my hair stiff, while the old stuff really is a flexible hold.</li>
            <li>For some odd reason, I cannot buy it locally any more; looked in Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and other places;</li>
            <li>At least, couldn&#x27;t they continue to produce the original version for customers who need it?  </li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and do not need a product that dries the hair out.</li>
            <li>I have really had trouble finding this old formula</li>

            <li> The new one is terrible, sticky and smells bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So needless to say, today I am buying a bunch here and stocking up!</li>
            <li> and I hate how crispy some hairsprays can make your hair.</li>
            <li> bad the price went up by $10!</li>
            <li> Too expensive!!!</li>
            <li> The replacement is terrible.</li>
            <li> Dove Strength and Shine Hairspray, Flexible Hold is awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Dove Damage Therapy Hair Spray, works great to hold the hair, but not make it feel sticky or stiff.  I have tried the new Dove, but this one works great.</li>
            <li> I love this product and was so sad when they discontinued it at the stores. While i am paying almost double per bottle here on Amazon, i would gladly pay it...it is weightless, smells great and doesn&#x27;t flake when you brush thought it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray I did buy it all the time at Wal-mart but they quit carrying it . so glad my daughter found it on amazon</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I finally found the right hairspray and now it&#x27;s no longer on the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;This hair spray didn&#x27;t \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; my hair as soon as I sprayed it on.&lt;br /&gt;I could actually style it a bit before it dryed.&lt;br /&gt;Every other can of hair spray I&#x27;ve bought since, I am so disappointed in.&lt;br /&gt;I have 6 cans of unused hairspray because I can&#x27;t find the right one to replace the Dove damage therapy.&lt;br /&gt;So needless to say, today I am buying a bunch here and stocking up!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and really like it.  My hair never feels \\&quot;sprayed\\&quot; but keeps its shape.  I only recently started ordering it through Amazon.  The last time I ordered the cans were poorly packaged and one of the cans had been bent and sprayed all over the box.</li>
            <li> This is this the \\&quot;good\\&quot; formula.  Dove changed the packaging and the formula of the flexible hold hairspray and it sucks! This is the good stuff!  Hopefully Amazon won&#x27;t run out any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad the price went up by $10! Also, I had one can that released all the pressure after I used it once.</li>
            <li> this hair spray works miracles with my hair. i have tried from cheap to very expensive products on my gray fine hair, nothing works like the dove hair spray, not even ion hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Looks like they might be getting rid of this flexible hold great hairspray with no lingering strong smell. They always stop putting out the best products!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for damaged thin hair. I recommend it to anyone who needs a light hold but still works.</li>
            <li> Too expensive!!! I think you need to bring down the shipping cost to sell even more of the product. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray I no longer can find it in the stores so I was so glad to find it on Amazon and purchase several cans at a time.  I hope you continue to carry this product.  I like it because there is no fragrance like most hair sprays and it is a true flexable hold.</li>
            <li> I chose it because it is good and very hard to get anymore in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the prompt delivery from Amazon and the price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really worth wile to recommend it to others that have the same need.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Why did DOVE take this off the market? The replacement is terrible. Dove Strength and Shine Hairspray, Flexible Hold is awful. I want this formula back without having to pay a fortune for it to dealers who were smart enough to buy out the closeout sales.</li>
            <li> Why must companies take an excellent product and change it so it no longer resembles the original?  At least, couldn&#x27;t they continue to produce the original version for customers who need it?  The \\&quot;new Dove Flexible Hold\\&quot; hairspray is in no way comparable to the original. I&#x27;m wondering how long even Amazon and its vendors will be able to get the original.  Thankfully, I am stocking up on it now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair spray for years and will not use anything else.  When I purchase it on line I order several at a time so I will never run out.  You are unable to find it in stores so when you see it on line stock up!  J.K. Glendora</li>
            <li> Have used this hair spray for many years and find the best.  It does not leave the hair hard like you have used &amp;#34;glue.&amp;#34;  Give the hair good body.  I live in a dry climate and do not need a product that dries the hair out.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray that I use. I&#x27;ve strayed and tried others, but always come back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, multi-texture, wavy hair that I flat iron almost every day. This hairspray goes on light, but has hold that lasts all day. When my hair was short and flippy it held without making it look crispy or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sensitive to scents and I don&#x27;t find this one to be strong at all, it&#x27;s one of the reasons I keep coming back to this product. The light scent also fades quickly and isn&#x27;t noticeable, even by others, after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is the best hairspray!</li>
            <li> Best hair spray I have ever used, at any price.  For some odd reason, I cannot buy it locally any more; looked in Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and other places; no luck.  So, I had to order on line.  Shipment was delivered in a timely manner.  Price is a little high, but, what choice do I have?  It is the only hair spray I&#x27;ve used that holds invisibly and disappears when I brush it of...I think it deserves five stars!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray and am bummed I can&#x27;t find it at the store anymore. I will continue to order it as long as it&#x27;s available. I have a feeling it&#x27;s on its way out though. I just love the hold--it&#x27;s not sticky at all, but it holds well.</li>
            <li> sadly, something that works too good, gets out of stock because Dove HAS to put new and impoved on can, now the new replacement is sticky and smelly.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray- holds my style without feeling stiff or sticky. I hate that it is not available in stores anymore, so I&#x27;m so happy to have found it here!!</li>
            <li> This is the old formula and it&#x27;s perfect. Why they stopped making it and felt they had to change it, is beyond comprehension. The new one is AWFUL!</li>
            <li> This spray is one of the best I have found.  It is flexible and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling sticky when brushed out. I have used it for years and have really loved it.  Now I see that Dove has remade the formula.  The new one is terrible, sticky and smells bad.  Why can&#x27;t they just leave a good thing alone?  I have really had trouble finding this old formula, Amazon was the best and fastest place I found.</li>
            <li> This is the dove flexible hold that I used before they \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; it, and I&#x27;m glad I could still find the good stuff.  The new stuff makes my hair stiff, while the old stuff really is a flexible hold.</li>
            <li> works as advertised.  does not leave hair hard and stiff.  hair looks natural and feels soft.  inexpensive too.  wonderful product for the price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally like hair spray but this particular product is light, yet does the job.  It is never sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair.  Have been unable to find it in the store and I&#x27;m glad I could get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance with my hair and I hate how crispy some hairsprays can make your hair. I love this product because I don&#x27;t get that crispy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> Great experience, the product is awesome, and it was packed very well and order arrived quickly, as expected. Will buy again!</li>
