            <li>This ranks up there with some of the best!</li>
            <li>quick Pull and NOTHING CAME OUT!!!!</li>
            <li>Says it works great.  </li>
            <li>I opened it a good quantity of eax was stuck on the lid which end up getting on my hands.</li>
            <li>Good thing it was on my palm</li>
            <li>Totally loved everything about this wax</li>
            <li>good for body waxing.</li>
            <li>Good wax.</li>
            <li>Its perfect, grabs on to the hair from the root and with one quick pull VOILA all goneeeeeee.....</li>
            <li>But once i got it in the warmer i really liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice to find organic wax</li>
            <li>This one is effective and like all wax--</li>
            <li>Good consistency, still not my favorite wax, but it is the best organic wax ive found so far.</li>
            <li>normally takes me 10 or so minutes to do, both armpits that is, took me 2 hours and 15 mins!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>its more of lotion than the kind of wax that I am use to.</li>
            <li>This is the best wax I have found so far</li>
            <li>Good stuff, works well and is a bit more comfortable than some of the honey based waxes.</li>
            <li>The smell is just fine, the texture is so creamy!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping that it will work better.</li>
            <li>and I said HEY WHY NOT, its Satin, its smooth and its organic!...</li>
            <li>and so i thought okay</li>
            <li>Fabulous, loving this wax.</li>
            <li>i havent been able to use this product</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>FYI Professionals make sure you consult and do your research as this product was discontinued in some beauty stores.</li>
            <li>I think I still can use this can of wax two more times.</li>
            <li>We absorb toxins through our skin and I feel it&#x27;s best to avoid, especially with heat applied products.  </li>
            <li>This may be the BEST wax available to the public.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The can says ideal for all kinds of hair think and coarse.</li>
            <li>well this should be fine...</li>
            <li>great wax, very low melt point, opalescent in color.</li>
            <li>Gluten free.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday with excellent results.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t know you had to buy another special product to get this product and residue off your skin when you are done.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much I ordered another one.  </li>
            <li>It spreads nice and thin and does a great job.</li>
            <li>So I was excited to use this item for the first time and moment</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if this is the reason of the hair not coming out so easily, or if this kind of wax is just not ideal, or maybe this kind of wax has a special type of instructions to use on underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic for face waxing, fast shipping</li>
            <li>NOT EVEN when you wax in the most sensitive of areas!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As a professional waxer, I have tried many waxes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind I will use, since it is organic</li>
            <li>Or, an epilator (hurts, but worth it and no chemicals or excess packaging).</li>
            <li>I tried with oil, water, lotion, wax strips, dry cloth, warm water damp cloth, ajax etc.</li>
            <li>I put some more wax on the same patch to try and remove it....and another pull and nothing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this wax</li>
            <li>it is wax, when you add heat it becomes hot wax.</li>
            <li>The wax was warm but not hot</li>
            <li>and I am very particular.</li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t make the mistake of having it get on anything, as its an absolute NIGHTMARE to get off.</li>
            <li>gentle an non-irritating.</li>
            <li>so have your wax stick ready.</li>
            <li>which is fine, we wait and wait to let the wax get dry</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash away like the honey waxes do, so make sure you put some towels down and keep a bottle of oil close at hand, as its the only thing that can clean this stuff up (I use normal massage oil0.</li>
            <li>yet i&#x27;m a little worried but mostly scared of the pain it arrived as said</li>
            <li>but i will say its a bit more messy</li>
            <li>but I tried it on my boyfriend&#x27;s back and it was pretty sticky</li>
            <li>and I think its a thousand times better than hard wax.</li>
            <li>I have been waxing myself from head to toe since I was 12 years old...</li>
            <li>My underarms are completely erythematous and</li>
            <li>Be prepared with an old towel underneath in case you spill.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a natural, organic hair remover I would recommend MOOM oil.</li>
            <li>thats more or less about 15 years experience now!!!</li>
            <li>First of all you need to be careful opening the can cause the wax gets stuck to the lid</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been the beauty industry over twenty five (25) years and recently decided to try this brand of wax for Brazilian, bikini waxing etc; I was very please with the product and will definitely reorder.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the most SCARY ITEM I&#x27;ve ever bought in my life. So I was excited to use this item for the first time and moment I opened it a good quantity of eax was stuck on the lid which end up getting on my hands. Now I tried for 2 HOURS to get rid of that wax. I tried with oil, water, lotion, wax strips, dry cloth, warm water damp cloth, ajax etc. I exactly dont know what helped getting rid of that DANGEROUS product off my hands but it took 2 hours, lots of pain n tears. Good thing it was on my palm so I could bear the struggle but if it was on my other part of body I would have end up bleeding. I AM RETURNING this product and warn not to use this product ever.</li>
            <li> Totally loved everything about this wax but i will say its a bit more messy then others I&#x27;ve used. I had to scrap the wax of the lid to even open it. But once i got it in the warmer i really liked it. It spreads nice and thin and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about who say this is a hard wax and that you don&#x27;t need strips. It is gooey and sticky even at room temp. I followed the directions using strips and it was a pain to work with, didn&#x27;t take off all my hair (or even half of it), and left a horrible mess that I mostly got rid of but now my skin it all red and bumpy. Misleading reviews, maybe the product changed?? Tried to take a pic, my arm looks worse in person.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for. Literally pulled off my skin and left the hair. I also didn&#x27;t know you had to buy another special product to get this product and residue off your skin when you are done.  I had wax stuck to me for days that I desperately tried to get off adding to my already irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, works well and is a bit more comfortable than some of the honey based waxes. However, don&#x27;t make the mistake of having it get on anything, as its an absolute NIGHTMARE to get off. It doesn&#x27;t wash away like the honey waxes do, so make sure you put some towels down and keep a bottle of oil close at hand, as its the only thing that can clean this stuff up (I use normal massage oil0.</li>
            <li> great wax, very low melt point, opalescent in color. fits in all warmers. gentle an non-irritating. good for body waxing.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax because is organic, I thought you don&#x27;t need to use muslin strips but I tried it on my boyfriend&#x27;s back and it was pretty sticky which is fine, we wait and wait to let the wax get dry and it never did :( so finally I had to put lots of azulene oil to take it off. Anyways I order some muslin strips and I&#x27;m hoping that it will work better.</li>
            <li> Good wax. Gluten free.</li>
            <li> OMG. I have been waxing myself from head to toe since I was 12 years old... thats more or less about 15 years experience now!!! I have always been a fan of GIGI all honey purpose wax! Its perfect, grabs on to the hair from the root and with one quick pull VOILA all goneeeeeee..... and after a while it DOESNT EVEN HURT!!!! NOT EVEN when you wax in the most sensitive of areas!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I wanted to try Satin smooth organic wax, merely bc of all the reviews and I said HEY WHY NOT, its Satin, its smooth and its organic!... I bought this plus an additional gigi JUST INCASE. I decided to try the satin organic wax. The smell is just fine, the texture is so creamy! its more of lotion than the kind of wax that I am use to. I put it into my warmer as I always do--- and let it heat up for the usual 45 mins. The wax was warm but not hot and so i thought okay well this should be fine... i tried on a small patch of my underarms... quick Pull and NOTHING CAME OUT!!!! and OMG OMG OMG OMG HOW DAMNNNNN PAINFUL! I put some more wax on the same patch to try and remove it....and another pull and nothing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I managed to try this about 5 or 6 times on the one patch before some was gone...I had to do this for my entire armpit... it was so painful that I can&#x27;t even describe it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What normally takes me 10 or so minutes to do, both armpits that is, took me 2 hours and 15 mins!!!!!!  NOT including the heating up time!!!! It was not until I decided to put on my cooling aloe vera gel for post waxes that the burning became unbearable. I was unable to sleep on my arms last night...and all clothing that touches my armpit hurt. I couldn&#x27;t even put on my backpack as the lightest touch of the strap was unbearable. My underarms are completely erythematous and swollen!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WISH I CAN RETURN THIS!!!! as IT IS 10 or so dollars for excruciating pain and time consumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can says ideal for all kinds of hair think and coarse. I have latin roots and therefore i have very thick thick thick black coarse hair..... i don&#x27;t know if this is the reason of the hair not coming out so easily, or if this kind of wax is just not ideal, or maybe this kind of wax has a special type of instructions to use on underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to now deal with the red painful pitts, and probably a dark scar afterwards!! DONT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> As a professional waxer, I have tried many waxes. This ranks up there with some of the best! It goes on smooth and thin. This may be the BEST wax available to the public.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, loving this wax. Would Definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i havent been able to use this product yet i&#x27;m a little worried but mostly scared of the pain it arrived as said but i havent used it for a month. please dont let the wax dry up</li>
            <li> In the description it said it was hard wax an turned out to be soft wax (which is really messy and I hate it) I considered returning it but I can use it on the legs and eyebrows</li>
            <li> Fantastic for face waxing, fast shipping I love this product. I use it everyday with excellent results. Nice to find organic wax</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been the beauty industry over twenty five (25) years and recently decided to try this brand of wax for Brazilian, bikini waxing etc; I was very please with the product and will definitely reorder. FYI Professionals make sure you consult and do your research as this product was discontinued in some beauty stores.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this wax and I think its a thousand times better than hard wax. Also I have very thick body hair except on my thighs and arms and this product really worked well. First of all you need to be careful opening the can cause the wax gets stuck to the lid so have your wax stick ready. I recommend using gloves unless you dont mind sticky hands. I think I still can use this can of wax two more times.</li>
            <li> it is wax, when you add heat it becomes hot wax.</li>
            <li> This wax was not how I expected. It&#x27;s Stayed liquidy on my skin and didn&#x27;t stick to the paper I have to peel it off so It just stuck to my skin an remained wet for a long time.</li>
            <li> Good consistency, still not my favorite wax, but it is the best organic wax ive found so far.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this. Says it works great.  It gets a little messy but you can clean it up with moist towel.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I ordered another one.  It&#x27;s the only kind I will use, since it is organic and I will not put anything on my skin that is not.  We absorb toxins through our skin and I feel it&#x27;s best to avoid, especially with heat applied products.  This one is effective and like all wax--no exception, it can get messy.  Be prepared with an old towel underneath in case you spill.  This is the best wax I have found so far and I am very particular.</li>
            <li> I would never purchase this again. The wax stinks- a very unnatural odor. It has a glossy, sparkly look which is peculiar. I didn&#x27;t even end up using it because the feel of it reeked chemicals. If you are looking for a natural, organic hair remover I would recommend MOOM oil. Or, an epilator (hurts, but worth it and no chemicals or excess packaging).</li>
