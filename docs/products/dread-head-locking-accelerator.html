    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>BUT it works best for my hair texture when I apply it after I shampoo my hair</li>
            <li>Amazing!!</li>
            <li>Worked great for my dreads</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this 2-3 times its great my hair locked within one month of using this spray</li>
            <li>good product for dreads</li>
            <li>Works great on my hair love it</li>
            <li>: The smell kind of makes your dreads smell like salt water and resin, and can be sticky after use.</li>
            <li>and all, I&#x27;m using this product until I can find a better product that gets the job</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>I liked the dollylocks a little better but this was good as well!</li>
            <li>The locking accelerator is an amazing products and works very well</li>
            <li>Quite satisfied because it really helps lock up dreadlocks and it helps the dreads form more quickly.</li>
            <li>Although I got an empty bottle, I know this product is great for locs</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the product and would purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li>Great product but the packaging sucks</li>
            <li>I started my husband dreads and he has very curly hair</li>
            <li>but he said it&#x27;s very itchy.</li>
            <li>this product has really speeded up the hairlocking process.</li>
            <li>This is neat because it cuts down on shipping cost (liquid weighs much more than the power) and prevents leaks in the shipping process.</li>
            <li>I can gladly say many positive things about this product with very limited negative things.</li>
            <li>: It accelerated the dreading process for my dreads (my hair is straight, thick hair) and did make my hair look better within the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>4months into my natural hair journey ( brotherlocks) and don&#x27;t have very course hair</li>
            <li>But get it though, it does help, just don&#x27;t be a fool and think it is instant; it may take 2 months off of a 6 month process, I think that&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have found that it preps my new hair for the re-twisting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going on month 3 of having new dreads,</li>
            <li>I purchased this for the first time last year, it comes in a power within the spray bottle that you mix water with.</li>
            <li>This product comes in Powder form that you must add water to, thats fine except that my bottle was slightly open and about half of the product spilled out into the package.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li>I live in the British Virgin Islands, and salt water does dry and tighten hair.</li>
            <li>However, be careful, because it is a simulation of natural salt water, and when they say don&#x27;t get it on the scalp.........believe them!</li>

            <li> typically use the accelerator after I wash my hair and before I tighten my new growth.</li>
            <li> my hair is only like two inches long i will be buying again</li>
            <li> After the product begins to dry, I maintain my dreads, and it makes the stray hairs lock into the dreads when I weave them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> it seems like it make his dreads soft instead of hard?</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight hair</li>
            <li> and it is still wet.</li>
            <li> Does not lock just gets your hair wet.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I will use it before I head out because the moisture helps my hair to lay down and the salts are tightening my hair</li>
            <li> I have exceptionally thick and curly hair and after doing a little bit of research, I found that a locking accelerator can help my hair to lock a little bit faster than I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also there aren&#x27;t any unnecessary residues, it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird smell or stickiness.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda hard not to get this stuff into your scalp.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get it on your scalp (which can be difficult) because it dries out the skin.</li>
            <li> maybe i used it wrong?</li>
            <li> It can also cause mad itching.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great on my hair love it</li>
            <li> I started my husband dreads and he has very curly hair so he needs something to keep his dread together. I purchased this product to help him and neither me or him saw a diffrence. i didn&#x27;t smell anything but he said it&#x27;s very itchy. it&#x27;s kinda hard not to get this stuff into your scalp. it seems like it make his dreads soft instead of hard? maybe i used it wrong? i will try again but i&#x27;m not planning on purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my dreads</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product and would purchase it again in the future. I have thin, straight hair but this product worked,</li>
            <li> 4months into my natural hair journey ( brotherlocks) and don&#x27;t have very course hair this product has really speeded up the hairlocking process.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said that they didn&#x27;t see a difference, but that is because they are expecting it to form locks instantly. It is not supposed to do that, the product is a simulation of what salt water does to locks, and that is to tighten them. I live in the British Virgin Islands, and salt water does dry and tighten hair. However, be careful, because it is a simulation of natural salt water, and when they say don&#x27;t get it on the scalp.........believe them! But get it though, it does help, just don&#x27;t be a fool and think it is instant; it may take 2 months off of a 6 month process, I think that&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this 2-3 times its great my hair locked within one month of using this spray I combined it with knotty boy hair pepper</li>
            <li> changed the texture after it died looks like dreads now... my hair is only like two inches long i will be buying again</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Works wonders! The locking accelerator is an amazing products and works very well I can gladly say many positive things about this product with very limited negative things. The only thing was the accelerator left salt on the tips of my dreadlocks but it just rubs off while you sleep but that&#x27;s not biggie! My dreads are locking and it only been 40 days!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the first time last year, it comes in a power within the spray bottle that you mix water with. This is neat because it cuts down on shipping cost (liquid weighs much more than the power) and prevents leaks in the shipping process. It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. If you&#x27;ve ever played string instruments, it smells a lot like bow resin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It accelerated the dreading process for my dreads (my hair is straight, thick hair) and did make my hair look better within the first couple of uses. After the product begins to dry, I maintain my dreads, and it makes the stray hairs lock into the dreads when I weave them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The smell kind of makes your dreads smell like salt water and resin, and can be sticky after use. Be careful not to get it on your scalp (which can be difficult) because it dries out the skin. It can also cause mad itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, I&#x27;m using this product until I can find a better product that gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jah-bless</li>
            <li> I have exceptionally thick and curly hair and after doing a little bit of research, I found that a locking accelerator can help my hair to lock a little bit faster than I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product out of curiosity and began to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I truly do. My hair is starting to feel drier and is starting to get the texture of my cousin&#x27;s hair (she has had locs for almost 17 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use the accelerator after I wash my hair and before I tighten my new growth. I have found that it preps my new hair for the re-twisting. Sometimes, I will use it before I head out because the moisture helps my hair to lay down and the salts are tightening my hair BUT it works best for my hair texture when I apply it after I shampoo my hair and it is still wet. It has worked for me and I do suggest it to others.</li>
            <li> Great product but the packaging sucks</li>
            <li> Although I got an empty bottle, I know this product is great for locs</li>
            <li> good product for dreads</li>
            <li> Bought this product before, bought it again to make my dreadlock extensions. Quite satisfied because it really helps lock up dreadlocks and it helps the dreads form more quickly. Also there aren&#x27;t any unnecessary residues, it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird smell or stickiness.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. I liked the dollylocks a little better but this was good as well!</li>
            <li> it seems to loosen up my dreads</li>
            <li> Does not lock just gets your hair wet. wil not buy again or tell anyone else to buy this product</li>
            <li> Works well, dreads locking up</li>
            <li> This product comes in Powder form that you must add water to, thats fine except that my bottle was slightly open and about half of the product spilled out into the package.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that i have seen no changes yet in my locs but time will tell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on month 3 of having new dreads, this product plus rolling them have totally helped my dreads form.</li>
