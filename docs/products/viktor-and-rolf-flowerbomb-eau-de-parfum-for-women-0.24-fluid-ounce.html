            <li>do I have to put twelve more words to finish this?</li>
            <li>Also, I prefer more of a sweeter fragrance, this seems to be more musk smelling.</li>

            <li>Try it you will love to smell sexy.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s lovely.</li>

            <li>The bottle is so cute</li>
            <li>I love this scent</li>
            <li>Flowerbomb is good quality and worth every penny or should I say dollar.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife she absolutely loves this scent!!!!</li>
            <li>cannot describe smells to save my life, but it is sweet, but not overpowering sweet, and its kind of a warm smell.</li>
            <li>I love it , light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>it was great but the bottle was too small LOL</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered this ahead of time to make sure I loved the smell before buying the big bottle!</li>
            <li>I loved it, many thanks for your fast shipping :-)</li>
            <li>but if I had read the fine print, I would have known what I was purchasing.</li>
            <li>looks like the free samples except in a fancy bottle.</li>
            <li>I know that patchouli can produce flowers, but it is primarily known as an herb rather than something &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and yet I found a way to enjoy this product at a affordable price.</li>
            <li>originally learned about Flowerbomb in one of those magazine samples.  </li>
            <li>It was the first one I&#x27;ve ever been tempted to buy and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Small, but great scent!</li>
            <li>Without a doubt it is a unique flora fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than the sample, light, flowerily, hint of spice and has a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li>From my limited experience with it, it seems to be great but ask me again in a month or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its great for gifts and the smell is a little sweet at first but once start to wear it, you&#x27;ll notice it has a nice smell through out the day.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite perfume of all time.</li>
            <li>However it does smell really good and last throurout the day.</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely sweet and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I really like this perfume - definately more of a winter scent</li>
            <li>This item is wonderful, the only downfall it&#x27;s just so tiny...</li>
            <li>sure you know that this  wonderful product is expensive</li>
            <li>I have been in love with the Viva la juicy for about a year now, and i was trying to look for something new.</li>
            <li>calm</li>
            <li>I enjoy it so much</li>
            <li>I wanted something very summery and light with flower scents.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I just bought this perfume 2 weeks ago and let me just say I&#x27;ve never been more excited to open something up before.</li>
            <li>$25 is pretty steep for the miniscule amount.</li>
            <li>Bring sexy back.</li>
            <li>This is my first time smelling the scent</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t buy any scents unless I smell it first.  </li>
            <li>However, I will be the first to say that I have found &amp;#34;MY SIGNATURE SCENT&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>This was the exact amount I needed.</li>
            <li>Sweet smell light wish it was a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>Which is probably a good thing, because there is a lot of waste with a spray and this way I dab and save.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever bought a .24 oz perfume before and it was bigger than this bottle, that means one of two things, or both: 1) the glass for the bottle was really thick, giving the illusion of more perfume, 2) they didn&#x27;t fill the bottle up to the top, also giving the illusion of more perfume if not paying attention to detail.</li>
            <li>This is a very small bottle,  but a great size for travel</li>
            <li>Finally a perfume that actually smells good on me.  </li>
            <li>But smells amazing, not fake or watered down.</li>
            <li>They scent is nice and smooth, very long lasting, vibrant yet</li>
            <li>Smells nice but the packaging looked a little suspicious.</li>
            <li>and I felt it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>Price is too much for the size of bottle.</li>
            <li>I can see the ruler showing the size, but it&#x27;s too much money for the size.</li>
            <li>But standing talking distance away, all they&#x27;re gonna get is patchouli unless they just have a very keen nose.</li>
            <li>so I never want to have too much of one.</li>
            <li>very disppointed.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a matter of personal preference but this perfume is too sweet for me.  </li>
            <li>Love this scent but this one is tiny, tiny for 25.00 and it does not stay on at all.</li>
            <li>I knew patchouli was a note in this perfume, but i had no idea that even though this is called Flowerbomb that patchouli would be the main thing you smell when putting it on.</li>
            <li>So i was looking for a new perfume one day and came across this again, and decided to go with the tiny bottle to try it out on my body first and see if i really like it.</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to try this fragrence for a long time and when I came across this item, I quickly purchased it.  </li>
            <li>and I typically go through scents pretty quickly</li>
            <li>This scent is new for me</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance because it has a distinctive flowery, powdery scent that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I read the ounces, sure, but when it arrived, I was really surprised that the bottle was sooo small.  </li>
            <li>Bottle just wasn&#x27;t large enough....</li>
            <li>I certainly need to brush up on my fluid ounces</li>
            <li>Love this perfume, bought the little bottle as a tester just wish the company I bought it from sold a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for women young and old</li>
            <li>last longer I use a unscented lotion that I pour the perfume into , and it lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>i was surprised to realize this says it parfum but does not stay.  </li>
            <li>i was surprised</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five is simply because this isn&#x27;t something i&#x27;ll wear a whole ton.</li>
            <li>Soft and LONGLASTING.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells so good, but is so expensive.</li>
            <li>its an ok fragrance but very, very small.</li>
            <li>I ordered the smallest one for my mom for Christmas (the bigger ones are expensive), but she really liked it!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely not going to be my new &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so I am not yet prepared with an answer in general.  </li>
            <li>I COULD BARELY GIVE IT AWAY</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t be so surprised next time!</li>
            <li>These little bottles fill my craving at a reasonable price.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Price is too much for the size of bottle.</li>
            <li> I can see the ruler showing the size, but it&#x27;s too much money for the size.</li>
            <li> But standing talking distance away, all they&#x27;re gonna get is patchouli unless they just have a very keen nose.</li>
            <li> so I never want to have too much of one.</li>
            <li> very disppointed.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a matter of personal preference but this perfume is too sweet for me.  </li>
            <li> Love this scent but this one is tiny, tiny for 25.00 and it does not stay on at all.</li>
            <li> I knew patchouli was a note in this perfume, but i had no idea that even though this is called Flowerbomb that patchouli would be the main thing you smell when putting it on.</li>
            <li> So i was looking for a new perfume one day and came across this again, and decided to go with the tiny bottle to try it out on my body first and see if i really like it.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this fragrence for a long time and when I came across this item, I quickly purchased it.  </li>
            <li> and I typically go through scents pretty quickly</li>
            <li> This scent is new for me</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance because it has a distinctive flowery, powdery scent that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I read the ounces, sure, but when it arrived, I was really surprised that the bottle was sooo small.  </li>
            <li> Bottle just wasn&#x27;t large enough....</li>
            <li> I certainly need to brush up on my fluid ounces</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, bought the little bottle as a tester just wish the company I bought it from sold a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for women young and old</li>
            <li> last longer I use a unscented lotion that I pour the perfume into , and it lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> i was surprised to realize this says it parfum but does not stay.  </li>
            <li> i was surprised</li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five is simply because this isn&#x27;t something i&#x27;ll wear a whole ton.</li>
            <li> Soft and LONGLASTING.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good, but is so expensive.</li>
            <li> its an ok fragrance but very, very small.</li>
            <li> I ordered the smallest one for my mom for Christmas (the bigger ones are expensive), but she really liked it!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely not going to be my new &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so I am not yet prepared with an answer in general.  </li>
            <li> I COULD BARELY GIVE IT AWAY</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be so surprised next time!</li>
            <li> These little bottles fill my craving at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The lack of sprayer on the .24 oz size makes it very difficult to apply effectively.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is verry tiny, but it will last a while because it only takes a few dabs for the entire day.</li>
            <li> The perfume stays on all day long and the smell is still there even after clothes are washed.</li>
            <li> but It&#x27;s definitely smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Only down side is, on me, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> i mean REALLY</li>
            <li> I have tried other colognes and always go back to Flowerbomb.  </li>
            <li> Just recieved my order...didn&#x27;t take very long at all...less than a week.</li>
            <li> that was a success, looks like ill be buying her a bigger bottle soon.</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller</li>
            <li> I am a perfume fanatic and have TONS of different scents but this is one that I will always come back to</li>
            <li> The bottle is tiny but a small amount of this fragrant nectar goes a long way.</li>
            <li> then i expected, but</li>
            <li> but expected based on the reviews...</li>
            <li> Not to heavy just enough without being overbaring.</li>
            <li> Seller delivered faster than expected.</li>
            <li> The size is admittedly small, but for me it&#x27;ll last a long time since I don&#x27;t wear fragrance every day, and I also wear other scents as well.</li>
            <li> the only thing i dislike is that the bottles are very small and if you try to get a bigger size the price goes up tp like 150 dollars!</li>
            <li> I can use it also for other perfumes when I travel.</li>
            <li> It is also not in fact a small spray bottle but actually opens to the perfume itself for you to apply as you will.</li>
            <li> I will other brands did little sample bottles like this.</li>
            <li> I give it a four out of five because it is packaged as shown and mine came with a batch code etched subtly into the actual glass, so</li>
            <li> you really do get just a small amount because it IS so expensive.</li>
            <li> With that said, for this size, a little pricey.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, a little pricey</li>
            <li> Size with this little guy was not an issue for me.</li>
            <li> Ive been trying on different smells that arent very common in my area.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money buying this it is beyond miniature size and by miniature</li>
            <li> This small one is a little too expensive compared to buying a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have this fragrance but the big bottle was to expensive</li>
            <li> Extremely small</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was that small</li>
            <li> I see why a regular size bottle of it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to overpowering and is delicate.</li>
            <li> Small!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small...</li>
            <li> br /&gt;smell is too weak</li>
            <li> Im disappointed and should get my money back. .</li>
            <li> The staying power of the scent is poor.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit disappointed</li>
            <li> its too small!!!</li>
            <li> weird</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know why people are afraid this is a knock off.</li>
            <li> I just wish that it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!  </li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed at the sample size.  </li>
            <li> , it is a rip off, don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> Small! What was I expecting? But smells amazing, not fake or watered down. I love it! I will consider buying the bigger one.  This small one is a little too expensive compared to buying a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> They scent is nice and smooth, very long lasting, vibrant yet calm I would recommend this for women young and old</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance because it has a distinctive flowery, powdery scent that is not overwhelming.  The size is admittedly small, but for me it&#x27;ll last a long time since I don&#x27;t wear fragrance every day, and I also wear other scents as well.</li>
            <li> Finally a perfume that actually smells good on me.  I love this scent.</li>

            <li> got for my girl, love it on her</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a knock-off. Doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing. It&#x27;s still pleasant and I like it, but it&#x27;s not Flowerbomb.</li>
            <li> I love love love Flowerbomb I just wish that it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!  This item is wonderful, the only downfall it&#x27;s just so tiny...you really do get just a small amount because it IS so expensive.</li>
            <li> Love Love LOVE this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money buying this it is beyond miniature size and by miniature i mean REALLY REALLY TINY.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff plan to buy more. Because it does not come with a body lotion to make the scent last longer I use a unscented lotion that I pour the perfume into , and it lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing! The perfume stays on all day long and the smell is still there even after clothes are washed.I like everything about it the only thing i dislike is that the bottles are very small and if you try to get a bigger size the price goes up tp like 150 dollars! I would recommend this product to about any person out their!</li>
            <li> With that said, for this size, a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Very good, i love it and i recomend it. great smell, if you are a romantic woman, you must try it</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, bought the little bottle as a tester just wish the company I bought it from sold a bigger bottle. It  was shipped out immediately. I will be buying the bigger bottle!!</li>
            <li> I just bought this perfume 2 weeks ago and let me just say I&#x27;ve never been more excited to open something up before. It is a little smaller then i expected, but its nice if your \\&quot;testing\\&quot; the perfume out. I enjoy it so much i bought a bigger one! Its great for gifts and the smell is a little sweet at first but once start to wear it, you&#x27;ll notice it has a nice smell through out the day. ENJOY!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good, but is so expensive. These little bottles fill my craving at a reasonable price. Actually, I just had to put some on before I could finish this review! The only issue I have is that the description says Eau de Parfum Spray, but there was no spray with my bottle. Which is probably a good thing, because there is a lot of waste with a spray and this way I dab and save.</li>
            <li> the smell probably lasts for 10 mins !!!&lt;br /&gt;smell is too weak&lt;br /&gt;the bottle is just way too tiny its a joke !</li>
            <li> originally learned about Flowerbomb in one of those magazine samples.  It was the first one I&#x27;ve ever been tempted to buy and I am glad I did.  It&#x27;s even better than the sample, light, flowerily, hint of spice and has a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell.  Delivery was fast.  Only down side is, on me, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> i was surprised to realize this says it parfum but does not stay.  for the price and size of bottle i was surprised</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! Get compliments every time I wear it!!&lt;br /&gt;Why do I have to put twelve more words to finish this?</li>
            <li> The lack of sprayer on the .24 oz size makes it very difficult to apply effectively.  I will probably purchase the rollerball next time.  Also- $25 is pretty steep for the miniscule amount.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but the packaging looked a little suspicious. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Small, but great scent!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought. However the price was great for me to sample.  Next time I psy mo closely to oz size</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing. My wife loves it, a little pricey but you won&#x27;t regreat the purchase.</li>
            <li> Bottle was actually way smaller than the image shows. Price is too much for the size of bottle.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was sensational. Without a doubt it is a unique flora fragrance. It was a delightful spray of that does not overwhelm your presence.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent! It&#x27;s a must have! I wish I could afford a big bottle. You know what they say about quality...</li>
            <li> its an ok fragrance but very, very small. The bottle is no taller than my thumb finger. Also, I prefer more of a sweeter fragrance, this seems to be more musk smelling.</li>
            <li> Good product.my wife likes it.but the bottle looks much bigger on the picture. but it is a tiny bottle. Deceiving picture.</li>
            <li> I ordered the smallest one for my mom for Christmas (the bigger ones are expensive), but she really liked it!</li>
            <li> Thought it was a much bigger bottle then what I got and paid for. I was a little bit disappointed</li>
            <li> The perfume smelled good.</li>
            <li> I can see the ruler showing the size, but it&#x27;s too much money for the size. I was looking for a stocking stuffer but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Perfume smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smell</li>
            <li> Love this scent but this one is tiny, tiny for 25.00 and it does not stay on at all. I wanted to have this fragrance but the big bottle was to expensive so I opted to get this one, it is a rip off, don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try Flowerbomb . I love it , light and refreshing. Bring sexy back. Try it you will love to smell sexy.</li>
            <li> its too small!!! looks like the free samples except in a fancy bottle.</li>
            <li> I just received the mini bottle! I absolutely LOVE it! This is my first time smelling the scent but it lives up to the hype! AMAZING!!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Extremely small and it appeared to have been opened</li>
            <li> The bottle is tiny but a small amount of this fragrant nectar goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This smells so good!  An associate of mine (a man) from Turkey told me about this scent.  He told me that he was dating a woman who used this scent and he told me that it made him &amp;#34;excited&amp;#34; each time he smelled it.  I did not believe him because I had not ever smelled it for myself and I don&#x27;t buy any scents unless I smell it first.  However, I will be the first to say that I have found &amp;#34;MY SIGNATURE SCENT&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> This scent is new for me so I am not yet prepared with an answer in general.  From my limited experience with it, it seems to be great but ask me again in a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I  recommend it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent, it makes me feel luxurious and beautiful and unique. It&#x27;s not to overpowering and is delicate. Only downside is the price. But it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, the bottle is so cute and practical.  I can use it also for other perfumes when I travel.</li>
            <li> Love this smell. So soft.</li>
            <li> Just recieved my order...didn&#x27;t take very long at all...less than a week. It&#x27;s very small...but expected based on the reviews...however it&#x27;s smells amazing!  I recieved compliments literally as soon as I put it on! Love it!</li>
            <li> Prefer spray so I can put on clothes and hair - too toxic for skin</li>
            <li> This perfume is so wonderful. The fragrance last all day. We&#x27;ll worth the money. A must have for me daily.</li>
            <li> This parfum is wonderful. It smells  light fresh and delicious. I get plenty of compliments on how wonderful it smells. Not to heavy just enough without being overbaring.</li>
            <li> Looking at all the reviews, I wonder how big people think .24 oz is? If you&#x27;ve ever bought a .24 oz perfume before and it was bigger than this bottle, that means one of two things, or both: 1) the glass for the bottle was really thick, giving the illusion of more perfume, 2) they didn&#x27;t fill the bottle up to the top, also giving the illusion of more perfume if not paying attention to detail. Size with this little guy was not an issue for me. The bottle is so cute I just wanna eat it, weird I know. Don&#x27;t worry, though, I won&#x27;t eat it. I give it a four out of five because it is packaged as shown and mine came with a batch code etched subtly into the actual glass, so i don&#x27;t know why people are afraid this is a knock off. The perfume is strong and lasts, which is a good quality. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five is simply because this isn&#x27;t something i&#x27;ll wear a whole ton. I knew patchouli was a note in this perfume, but i had no idea that even though this is called Flowerbomb that patchouli would be the main thing you smell when putting it on. I know that patchouli can produce flowers, but it is primarily known as an herb rather than something &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34;. If someone hugs you or something, they might smell the yummy floral undertone. But standing talking distance away, all they&#x27;re gonna get is patchouli unless they just have a very keen nose. so for personal preference reason, i gave it a 4 instead of 5. i do like the perfume, however. It is very nice and i like smelling it on myself. But it&#x27;s definitely not going to be my new &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this scent and I typically go through scents pretty quickly so I never want to have too much of one. This was the exact amount I needed. It was not the greatest of values but it served my needs. It is also not in fact a small spray bottle but actually opens to the perfume itself for you to apply as you will.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with the Viva la juicy for about a year now, and i was trying to look for something new. I came across this in macys and loved the smell months ago, and forgot about it. So i was looking for a new perfume one day and came across this again, and decided to go with the tiny bottle to try it out on my body first and see if i really like it. Turns out its on my top 3 favorite perfume list! will buy a bigger bottle when this runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot describe smells to save my life, but it is sweet, but not overpowering sweet, and its kind of a warm smell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was that small I thought it was bigger. Im disappointed and should get my money back. .</li>
            <li> I use this product before leaving the house and know I smell good which is the end stage before leaving the house like making sure my nails are done and makeup is complete.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you know that this  wonderful product is expensive and yet I found a way to enjoy this product at a affordable price. Flowerbomb is good quality and worth every penny or should I say dollar.</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed at the sample size.  It appeared to be a larger size online....very disppointed.&lt;br /&gt;With the purchase and shipping, I paid almost $8.00 for a sample given in departments stores.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent.  Soft and LONGLASTING.</li>
            <li> the wife loves it!!!!!  now sense that was a success, looks like ill be buying her a bigger bottle soon.</li>
            <li> Great scent for a great price arrive with great packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SURE PEOPLE WHO LIKE THIS WOULD FIND IT WONDERFUL...I COULD BARELY GIVE IT AWAY AS NO ONE LIKE HOW IT SMELLED ON THEM. GUESS I LEARNED A LESSON...NOT THE FAULT OF THE VENDOR, BUT MY OWN.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the scent. Seller delivered faster than expected.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite nice. The staying power of the scent is poor. Even on these trial sizes, it should represent the actual product.</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful and I get a lot of complements throughout the day. You don&#x27;t need to drench yourself in it for it to be noticeable. I see why a regular size bottle of it is so expensive. It smells absolutely sweet and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> LOOOVE this perfume, and this size is perfect for when I travel, or when I go out and need a touch up of the best scent in the world!</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne ever!!  I have tried other colognes and always go back to Flowerbomb.  Every time I wear Flowerbomb someone stops me and ask what cologne I am wearing.  I never get that with others.</li>
            <li> I know the oz&#x27;s are listed but It&#x27;s definitely smaller than expected. Either way it arrived unscathed and I love this scent!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember there being a ruler in the picture of the Flowerbomb I bought.  I read the ounces, sure, but when it arrived, I was really surprised that the bottle was sooo small.  I like how the picture of the item next to my review suddenly has a ruler in the picture.  I certainly need to brush up on my fluid ounces so I won&#x27;t be so surprised next time!</li>
            <li> Sweet smell light wish it was a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this fragrence for a long time and when I came across this item, I quickly purchased it.  I really like this perfume - definately more of a winter scent I think but still very nice.  I will other brands did little sample bottles like this.</li>
            <li> Ive been trying on different smells that arent very common in my area. I wanted something very summery and light with flower scents.</li>
            <li> This smells so dang good! It lasts forever too i can still smell it the next morning. The bottle is verry tiny, but it will last a while because it only takes a few dabs for the entire day.</li>
            <li> it was great but the bottle was too small LOL</li>
            <li> This is a very small bottle,  but a great size for travel or if you just want to try out the fragrance and make sure that you like it! I love it and have received lots of compliments when wearing it!</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered this ahead of time to make sure I loved the smell before buying the big bottle! It&#x27;s worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a matter of personal preference but this perfume is too sweet for me.  I&#x27;ll go back to my Chanel No, 5.</li>
            <li> I loved it, many thanks for your fast shipping :-)</li>
