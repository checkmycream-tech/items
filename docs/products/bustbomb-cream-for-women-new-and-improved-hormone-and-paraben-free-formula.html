            <li>This stuff is amazing, and I never say that about most purchases, nor do I have time to post.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days of day and night application</li>
            <li>Moreover, the cream is very smooth to apply...</li>

            <li>It is made from safe ingredients</li>
            <li>Will update review once I have had more experience with the product.</li>
            <li>I feel confident showing off my cleavage at this moment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward for more better results hopefully.</li>
            <li>was on time as well:)</li>
            <li>So it is safe for FDA approved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reordering and adding more for a friend.</li>
            <li>is more smoothe than before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Hope to see more growth I would recommend using the pill and the cream.</li>
            <li>I received this for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I tried to be more patient with the cream but saw no chance at all.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these already and will continue buy more.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve grown a FULL cup size and my breasts are more perky!</li>
            <li>With the use of Bustbomb cream, my girl&#x27;s breast is looking pretty good.</li>
            <li>Loved this product - fast shipping!</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m willing to keep using the cream because it feels good and may take a longer time to produce the desired results.</li>
            <li>Still excited about the hopeful outcome!</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this BustBomb Cream for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it to try.</li>
            <li>Was really hoping to have good results after reading these reviews</li>
            <li>Dr. John R. Lee has a good book about it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, don&#x27;t use too much of the cream or you could get unbalanced.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it is a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li>She definitely find it a great product and is really satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>And for even more powerful results, use it along with BustBomb&#x27;s herbal supplements-your bust will be glad you</li>
            <li>Cream was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I am about to think these things don&#x27;t really work, but maybe I&#x27;ll just look around if there is anything more effective.</li>
            <li>it gets absorbed very easily.</li>
            <li>After using the cream my breast did become more full and plump.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light aroma which is very soothing and refreshing.. 5 stars</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed a good bit so far using this cream and cannot be any more pleased with the effects!</li>
            <li>I was a huge skeptic.</li>
            <li>I was also happy with the pills from the same company.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m happy and have enough to fill the palm of my hands and out fill my 34B bras!!!</li>
            <li>Smell was light.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for sharing this product which helps women feel more sexier &amp;  more feminine.</li>
            <li>I really would not know what to do if I haven&#x27;t found it!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed a good bit so far using this cream and cannot be any more pleased with the effects.</li>
            <li>I felt it gave me significant results.</li>
            <li>so if you rub it on your hands first, your hands will absorb most of it.</li>
            <li>My newly developed, and developing acquisitions are entirely as a consequence of this excellent cream.</li>
            <li>The shipping was faster then expected witch was great.</li>
            <li>Cream is nice and soft and has no odor.  </li>
            <li>well that does not hold true for everyone.</li>
            <li>Also they work very well with the pills :)</li>
            <li>My breasts were tender and full feeling.</li>
            <li>My boobs are finally full.</li>
            <li>but I have alway had issues with my boobs using this cream I have noticed firmer breast and for me anything is better then what I have had to deal with my whole life.</li>
            <li>Good results for what it is, definitely recommend rrc</li>
            <li>have increased 1 full cup size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to undoubtedly reassure whoever isn&#x27;t pleased with their present breast situation, that if they get started making use of the this product, they will also be singing its praises.</li>
            <li>I will use this and more then likely order more.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs really quick</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you try this for enhancing your breasts :)</li>
            <li>For others who experienced the same thing as I did I would recommend using American E-Commerce Solutions BustBomb Pill because that worked more for me.</li>
            <li>I never found such kind of product which can full fill our dreams.</li>
            <li>I am running low and I plan to buy more soon!</li>
            <li>But, this brand really works!!</li>
            <li>This is a joke lol don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li>For the price it was definitely worth it</li>
            <li>however I began experiencing benefits within first full week of use.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if this cream would work, but it has now been nearly 3 weeks and my breasts are fuller and firmer.  </li>
            <li>however I began experiencing benefits within first full week of use.</li>
            <li>Also I experienced some nausea, i&#x27;m not sure whether it was the cream or something else</li>
            <li>I do like the texture of this cream as it&#x27;s nice and thick yet applies to the skin easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>Ladies, I bought this product because, I used to be a beautiful big girl, curves, big boobs and a fat booty; but after i lost soo much weight...</li>
            <li>It works very fast.</li>
            <li>so I am ready for the beach season!</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>really recommend this Cream to you, Ladies!</li>
            <li>I feel my boobs pretty growing &amp; not saggy.</li>
            <li>First time use skin felt smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li>be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve breastfed 4 babies and my boobs are pretty blah...</li>
            <li>This worked pretty well for me my breasts did grow and get firmer.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my wife after we had our first baby.</li>
            <li>It can raise your size so obviously that I am becoming worried about is there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update my review when I have a better picture of how it works long term.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually using it as a hormone balancer (if you have too much estrogen, using a progesterone cream can bring estrogen back into a good range).</li>
            <li>and my libido is back and in FULL force!</li>
            <li>Gets absorb quickly and leaves the skin polished and soft...</li>
            <li>Not ashamed to wear certain clothes.</li>
            <li>So, I will say you can put up a positive review because it really does work.</li>
            <li>I cant really tell a difference in myself.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really noticed any change.</li>
            <li>My tatas are much fuller when I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helpful</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I used as directed and did not have much improvement at the end.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and will continue to use it for that reason.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to get a boob job</li>
            <li>I was very worry of leaving  work</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;it really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks I found this</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>hahahahaha.....</li>
            <li>Really have not seen any difference in using this product</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and service.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thank you Bust Bomb for this cream, it has really helped me.</li>
            <li>I really wish I took a before picture to do a before and after thing.</li>
            <li>I really have not seen any results.</li>
            <li>In just a couple weeks of using the cream once a day and taking the capsules twice to three times a day they have plumped up considerably!!!</li>
            <li>My right breast is smaller than my right</li>
            <li>Within the first week I was feeling some breast soreness (like the feeling you get when your tits are growing as a teenager) and they were very sensitive.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks daily use breast measurements increased 1/2 inch and stretch marks under breasts significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>I have used many other brands, but does not work.</li>
            <li>I am excited about the results after the next few months :)</li>
            <li>what you&#x27;re getting is a natural product that not only works but is also comfortable.</li>
            <li>The cream makes the skin feel very soft and supple, but I did not see much enlargement effect.  </li>
            <li>I like this cream, highly recommended for those girls who need to feel firmer.</li>
            <li>It killed my self esteem, it even brought issues in the bedroom because I wasn&#x27;t confident enough to be fully naked with the man I love.</li>
            <li>After breast feeding I was completely flat on top and only had some boob</li>
            <li>Works really well for mature females.</li>
            <li>As far as the cream, there is so much information about the helpful qualities of progesterone.</li>
            <li>helped a bit but not sure how much thinking about getting more</li>
            <li>so if I had used it everyday it would have grown alot more.</li>
            <li>It makes my breasts look new and improved and I am ecstatic I didn&#x27;t have to go through with something like surgery just to get the look I want.</li>
            <li>The product description is  New Paraben-Free and Hormone-Free Formula.</li>
            <li>BustBomb Cream for Women - New and Improved...</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money, ladies!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time purchasing this product!</li>
            <li>and ive noticed a slight difference so far( had to do a double  take in mirror to make sure).</li>
            <li>and it is making it a lil bigger just a little bit though I will continue with the product I love</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 because it wasn&#x27;t so clear about how often do I use it.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift for a friend who really wanted it, and well... it is definitely working!</li>
            <li>She seems to really like it, so well that I am now about to buy a second tub.</li>
            <li>Its just a lotion that makes your skin soft .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell</li>
            <li>if Taken in Conjunction with BustBomb Natural Herbal Supplement for Women&lt;br /&gt;Proudly Made and Packaged in the USA in an FDA Registered and Inspected Facility</li>
            <li>/&gt;Deionized Water, Safflower Oil, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Witch Hazel Extract, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Polydimethylsiloxane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Stearic Acid, Wild Yam Extract, Milk Thistle Extract, Motherwort Extract, Fragrance, Progesterone, Sodium Hydroxide</li>

            <li>so far it seems to be working</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m just 22 years old...</li>
            <li>B Apply directly to the breasts and rub it with your finger tips.</li>
            <li>This product has increased my bust naturally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m top heavy enough.</li>
            <li>But once I actually found this product to stay helping me with gaining some back, hey it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>and the difference I feel is that my skin is super soft and there&#x27;s some less wrinkles.</li>
            <li>For other reasons unrelated to the cream, I temporarily stopped use and noticed my breast tissue reverted back to it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li>it does much, but I haven&#x27;t  used it that long</li>
            <li>Will definitely keep using and buying seeing that it does work slowly but for surely.</li>
            <li>I am completely against augmentation and could never imagine myself going through with surgery for such a thing</li>
            <li>its just regular old cream -,-&lt;br</li>
            <li>but now...my breasts are visibly larger, firmer and perky young.</li>
            <li>Its only been a week so far and nothing yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been making use of this, and various, supplements for some time now and am over and above surprised at the effects I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>but, my breasts have definitely gotten bigger and they&#x27;re soft.</li>
            <li>I got this for a particular person in my family who was curious (not</li>
            <li>I could not live my life with saggy old lady tits</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, don&#x27;t think there is any other product that does the same job as well as this.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing, and I never say that about most purchases, nor do I have time to post.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days of day and night application</li>
            <li> Moreover, the cream is very smooth to apply...</li>
            <li> Better results with this cream than the many others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this product because my confidence level has grown.</li>
            <li> If nothing more happens will stop using it.</li>
            <li> It is made from safe ingredients</li>
            <li> Will update review once I have had more experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I feel confident showing off my cleavage at this moment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward for more better results hopefully.</li>
            <li> was on time as well:)</li>
            <li> So it is safe for FDA approved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reordering and adding more for a friend.</li>
            <li> is more smoothe than before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Hope to see more growth I would recommend using the pill and the cream.</li>
            <li> I received this for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I tried to be more patient with the cream but saw no chance at all.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these already and will continue buy more.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve grown a FULL cup size and my breasts are more perky!</li>
            <li> With the use of Bustbomb cream, my girl&#x27;s breast is looking pretty good.</li>
            <li> Loved this product - fast shipping!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m willing to keep using the cream because it feels good and may take a longer time to produce the desired results.</li>
            <li> Still excited about the hopeful outcome!</li>
            <li> So when I was offered this BustBomb Cream for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it to try.</li>
            <li> Was really hoping to have good results after reading these reviews</li>
            <li> Dr. John R. Lee has a good book about it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, don&#x27;t use too much of the cream or you could get unbalanced.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it is a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> She definitely find it a great product and is really satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> And for even more powerful results, use it along with BustBomb&#x27;s herbal supplements-your bust will be glad you</li>
            <li> Cream was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I am about to think these things don&#x27;t really work, but maybe I&#x27;ll just look around if there is anything more effective.</li>
            <li> it gets absorbed very easily.</li>
            <li> After using the cream my breast did become more full and plump.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light aroma which is very soothing and refreshing.. 5 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed a good bit so far using this cream and cannot be any more pleased with the effects!</li>
            <li> I was a huge skeptic.</li>
            <li> I was also happy with the pills from the same company.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m happy and have enough to fill the palm of my hands and out fill my 34B bras!!!</li>
            <li> Smell was light.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for sharing this product which helps women feel more sexier &amp;  more feminine.</li>
            <li> I really would not know what to do if I haven&#x27;t found it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed a good bit so far using this cream and cannot be any more pleased with the effects.</li>
            <li> I felt it gave me significant results.</li>
            <li> so if you rub it on your hands first, your hands will absorb most of it.</li>
            <li> My newly developed, and developing acquisitions are entirely as a consequence of this excellent cream.</li>
            <li> The shipping was faster then expected witch was great.</li>
            <li> Cream is nice and soft and has no odor.  </li>
            <li> well that does not hold true for everyone.</li>
            <li> Also they work very well with the pills :)</li>
            <li> My breasts were tender and full feeling.</li>
            <li> My boobs are finally full.</li>
            <li> but I have alway had issues with my boobs using this cream I have noticed firmer breast and for me anything is better then what I have had to deal with my whole life.</li>
            <li> Good results for what it is, definitely recommend rrc</li>
            <li> have increased 1 full cup size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to undoubtedly reassure whoever isn&#x27;t pleased with their present breast situation, that if they get started making use of the this product, they will also be singing its praises.</li>
            <li> I will use this and more then likely order more.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs really quick</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you try this for enhancing your breasts :)</li>
            <li> For others who experienced the same thing as I did I would recommend using American E-Commerce Solutions BustBomb Pill because that worked more for me.</li>
            <li> I never found such kind of product which can full fill our dreams.</li>
            <li> I am running low and I plan to buy more soon!</li>
            <li> But, this brand really works!!</li>
            <li> This is a joke lol don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> For the price it was definitely worth it</li>
            <li> however I began experiencing benefits within first full week of use.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this cream would work, but it has now been nearly 3 weeks and my breasts are fuller and firmer.  </li>
            <li> however I began experiencing benefits within first full week of use.</li>
            <li> Also I experienced some nausea, i&#x27;m not sure whether it was the cream or something else</li>
            <li> I do like the texture of this cream as it&#x27;s nice and thick yet applies to the skin easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> Ladies, I bought this product because, I used to be a beautiful big girl, curves, big boobs and a fat booty; but after i lost soo much weight...</li>
            <li> It works very fast.</li>
            <li> so I am ready for the beach season!</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> really recommend this Cream to you, Ladies!</li>
            <li> I feel my boobs pretty growing &amp; not saggy.</li>
            <li> First time use skin felt smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li> be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve breastfed 4 babies and my boobs are pretty blah...</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well for me my breasts did grow and get firmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife after we had our first baby.</li>
            <li> It can raise your size so obviously that I am becoming worried about is there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my review when I have a better picture of how it works long term.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually using it as a hormone balancer (if you have too much estrogen, using a progesterone cream can bring estrogen back into a good range).</li>
            <li> and my libido is back and in FULL force!</li>
            <li> Gets absorb quickly and leaves the skin polished and soft...</li>
            <li> Not ashamed to wear certain clothes.</li>
            <li> So, I will say you can put up a positive review because it really does work.</li>
            <li> I cant really tell a difference in myself.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed any change.</li>
            <li> My tatas are much fuller when I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helpful</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I used as directed and did not have much improvement at the end.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and will continue to use it for that reason.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get a boob job</li>
            <li> I was very worry of leaving  work</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;it really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks I found this</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> hahahahaha.....</li>
            <li> Really have not seen any difference in using this product</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and service.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thank you Bust Bomb for this cream, it has really helped me.</li>
            <li> I really wish I took a before picture to do a before and after thing.</li>
            <li> I really have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> In just a couple weeks of using the cream once a day and taking the capsules twice to three times a day they have plumped up considerably!!!</li>
            <li> My right breast is smaller than my right</li>
            <li> Within the first week I was feeling some breast soreness (like the feeling you get when your tits are growing as a teenager) and they were very sensitive.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks daily use breast measurements increased 1/2 inch and stretch marks under breasts significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> I have used many other brands, but does not work.</li>
            <li> I am excited about the results after the next few months :)</li>
            <li> what you&#x27;re getting is a natural product that not only works but is also comfortable.</li>
            <li> The cream makes the skin feel very soft and supple, but I did not see much enlargement effect.  </li>
            <li> I like this cream, highly recommended for those girls who need to feel firmer.</li>
            <li> It killed my self esteem, it even brought issues in the bedroom because I wasn&#x27;t confident enough to be fully naked with the man I love.</li>
            <li> After breast feeding I was completely flat on top and only had some boob</li>
            <li> Works really well for mature females.</li>
            <li> As far as the cream, there is so much information about the helpful qualities of progesterone.</li>
            <li> helped a bit but not sure how much thinking about getting more</li>
            <li> so if I had used it everyday it would have grown alot more.</li>
            <li> It makes my breasts look new and improved and I am ecstatic I didn&#x27;t have to go through with something like surgery just to get the look I want.</li>
            <li> The product description is  New Paraben-Free and Hormone-Free Formula.</li>
            <li> BustBomb Cream for Women - New and Improved...</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money, ladies!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> and ive noticed a slight difference so far( had to do a double  take in mirror to make sure).</li>
            <li> and it is making it a lil bigger just a little bit though I will continue with the product I love</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because it wasn&#x27;t so clear about how often do I use it.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a friend who really wanted it, and well... it is definitely working!</li>
            <li> She seems to really like it, so well that I am now about to buy a second tub.</li>
            <li> Its just a lotion that makes your skin soft .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell</li>
            <li> if Taken in Conjunction with BustBomb Natural Herbal Supplement for Women&lt;br /&gt;Proudly Made and Packaged in the USA in an FDA Registered and Inspected Facility</li>

            <li> so far it seems to be working</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m just 22 years old...</li>
            <li> B Apply directly to the breasts and rub it with your finger tips.</li>
            <li> This product has increased my bust naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m top heavy enough.</li>
            <li> But once I actually found this product to stay helping me with gaining some back, hey it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> and the difference I feel is that my skin is super soft and there&#x27;s some less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> For other reasons unrelated to the cream, I temporarily stopped use and noticed my breast tissue reverted back to it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li> it does much, but I haven&#x27;t  used it that long</li>
            <li> Will definitely keep using and buying seeing that it does work slowly but for surely.</li>
            <li> I am completely against augmentation and could never imagine myself going through with surgery for such a thing</li>
            <li> its just regular old cream -,-&lt;br</li>
            <li> but now...my breasts are visibly larger, firmer and perky young.</li>
            <li> Its only been a week so far and nothing yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making use of this, and various, supplements for some time now and am over and above surprised at the effects I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> but, my breasts have definitely gotten bigger and they&#x27;re soft.</li>
            <li> I got this for a particular person in my family who was curious (not</li>
            <li> I could not live my life with saggy old lady tits</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, don&#x27;t think there is any other product that does the same job as well as this.</li>
            <li> After one month I saw results, not major like in cup size, but they were plumping up which is all I needed.</li>
            <li> After using this it definitely made my breasts feel young and firm again.</li>
            <li> The secret behind BustBomb&#x27;s success is no magic trick - it&#x27;s in the potent blend of herbs and other extracts, which include safflower oil, witch hazel extract, milk thistle, and wild yam extract.</li>
            <li> Bought for gf, so far it&#x27;s been a week and nothing happend yet besides a little pain according to her.</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and have always been small chested I am 5&#x27;1 and</li>
            <li> Although a side effect I&#x27;ve been noticing was being very angry and hungry more often.</li>
            <li> I live in Schertz, Tx and it is hard to find any breast enlargement items that work, but this one has worked and I can visibly see results.</li>
            <li> Not highly advised...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see a little results too soon to tell</li>
            <li> I thought this would be an easier way to get larger boobs than having to spend a large sum of money to get fake ones</li>
            <li> I used an entire tub of this cream in about a month, I think I could tell after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It obviously can&#x27;t do what it says its supposed to do, so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Only made my skin a little tighter other then that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> smalls so bad, only apply when I stay home and avoid seeing people, hope it has a better sent not sure it will work, but on the container, it says it can apply on breast and any part of the body.</li>
            <li> I have used the line (other products in this line) together, and the results have been noticeable.</li>
            <li> This product Doest NOT work, please don&#x27;t listen to those fake positive reviews&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies this cream is not worth the time and $- look elsewhere&lt;br /&gt;Natalie</li>
            <li> After having a child my breasts decreased to a size and shape I was less than happy with - which is devastating as a female!</li>
            <li> $100 down the drain.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s deff a slight difference.</li>
            <li> My breast feel softer and They feel slightly heavier.</li>
            <li> They feel slightly sore but it could also be from the breast massages</li>
            <li> I tried this and there is a slightly  development in me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product previously and found that by mixing one capsule of the BustBomb pills/capsule into the cream has helped my breast become perkier and a bit fuller where around the bust line I can see a change in plumpness</li>
            <li> Slight increase in bust size but nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> noticed a little fullness</li>
            <li> Used it for about 4 or 5 days with no results.. not even a little.</li>
            <li> I can tell a little bit of a difference I have not gone up in size</li>
            <li> From now on i still using and alot of improvement because this is the answer of my little bobie problem.</li>
            <li> But a little can help a lot.</li>
            <li> This was not a cheap product</li>
            <li> My wife has been having trouble in this sector so after looking at the reviews I decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li> Works nicely to firm things up.</li>
            <li> and I can feel my breast go firms go firm and shapey...</li>
            <li> Waste of money , I&#x27;m regreting now ..</li>
            <li> This cream helped my bust firm up and it helped me keep my breasts while the rest of me lost weight.</li>
            <li> i just started using a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it everyday and skipped a lot of times</li>
            <li> After a few days use I could already feel a difference in my breasts.</li>
            <li> any improve  waste of money and time</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend to anyone that is a little small around the breast area.</li>
            <li> am a mother of 4 and due to of course having kids, losing weight and getting sick over the years have had a turn on my body mainly my breasts which practically deflated from a 38B to a 34A which just caused me to get depressed and not wanting to show my disfigured breasts.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it does firm you breasts i guess :/&lt;br /&gt;but who cares?!</li>
            <li> I just recieved my package on the 24th of June, and I can say I&#x27;m seeing small results as of 2 days use.</li>
            <li> The application process alone is enough for 5 stars, the results are icing on the scoops (with is weird because I&#x27;ve never added icing to my ice cream).</li>
            <li> After using this product, my breasts are firm and looking-smart!</li>
            <li> It does seem to make my skin feel softer, but I&#x27;m just not really sure what the fuss is about just yet in terms of enhancement.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a weird smell, not bad, not good, just a weird smell, but it leaves no scent once you apply it.</li>
            <li> I have fuller breasts in a few weeks time!</li>
            <li> I have increased my boobs by two cup sizes, and its hard for a man to grow breasts.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t notice that it has been a cup, at least not yet</li>
            <li> And this requires to used in it is Advised to Use for at Least 3 Months in Order to Achieve Maximum Results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is Advised to Use for at Least 3 Months in Order to Achieve Maximum Results</li>
            <li> It has been slowly helping with my goal to increase my breast size</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous claims.  </li>
            <li> Incorporated 15 min breast massage a day and breasts that were saggy and sad are round, firmer and perky.</li>
            <li> Sorry my fellow small breasted friends, this products sucks.</li>
            <li> such a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Idk the science behind it at all, and I know every body differs, but this did work for me.</li>
            <li> It is really frustrating..</li>
            <li> ALL of these reviews are FAKE.</li>
            <li> Sadly, did not work for me at all.  </li>
            <li> , unfortunately I didnt see any noticable difference after 9 weeks.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d rather pay $60 then $5000 for fake boobs</li>
            <li> so I have to keep this like a useless ting.</li>
            <li> Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I will become an addict now /:</li>
            <li> Nothing to crazy</li>
            <li> She was unhappy with how her breasts looked and felt after months of breastfeeding.</li>
            <li> So fake!</li>
            <li> Reviews are fake!</li>
            <li> still not five star because of the bad sent</li>
            <li> The pills seemed to make me break out really bad.</li>
            <li> Could be a coincidence, because I&#x27;m still sorta having the issue, however, not as bad.</li>
            <li> Stupid to fall for it.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unhappy !!!</li>
            <li> Our formula is paraben-free, which means that you won&#x27;t be dealing with all the nasty side effects that result from these chemical preservatives.</li>
            <li> Worst cream</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have actually seen an increase in my breast size since using this cream. I didn&#x27;t suddenly become a DD but there has been growth. Also I notice that my stretch marks are fading where I use the cream.</li>
            <li> Better results with this cream than the many others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you this stuff works! After a couple weeks of use, I have achieved amazing firmness. There are no side effects and no skin irritation. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product because my confidence level has grown. Not ashamed to wear certain clothes.</li>
            <li> After having a child my breasts decreased to a size and shape I was less than happy with - which is devastating as a female! I am completely against augmentation and could never imagine myself going through with surgery for such a thing so I bought this alternative. It&#x27;s amazing!! It makes my breasts look new and improved and I am ecstatic I didn&#x27;t have to go through with something like surgery just to get the look I want. I will definitely recommend this to all my girl friends!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product. I have used the line (other products in this line) together, and the results have been noticeable. And it worked at an effective pace so I am ready for the beach season!</li>
            <li> I have used 3 jars of this product. noticed a little fullness but nothing to write home about. Will continure using it for about 3 months. If nothing more happens will stop using it.</li>
            <li> REVIEWING FOR MY WIFE.  I DONT HAVE BOOBS!!!!    Great cream. Works well.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a week and already see results.  Cream is nice and soft and has no odor.  I was also happy with the pills from the same company.  I think using both is the way to go</li>
            <li> ALL of these reviews are FAKE. &amp;#34;I bought this for my wife&amp;#34; &amp;#34;I bought this for my girlfriend&amp;#34;. So fake! Nothing will enhance your boobs except cosmetic surgery. Do not waste your money, ladies!</li>
            <li> It has been slowly helping with my goal to increase my breast size</li>
            <li> It works to some degree. I&#x27;m a D cup but with dense tissue. After using the cream my breast did become more full and plump. For other reasons unrelated to the cream, I temporarily stopped use and noticed my breast tissue reverted back to it&#x27;s original shape. So, in short if you want to keep this you have to keep buying the cream. I&#x27;ve read the reviews of some that claim it doesn&#x27;t work......well that does not hold true for everyone. It truly worked for me using only the cream. After one month I saw results, not major like in cup size, but they were plumping up which is all I needed. I don&#x27;t need no extra weight. I&#x27;m top heavy enough.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a friend who really wanted it, and well... it is definitely working! For the price it was definitely worth it and I would recommend to anyone that is a little small around the breast area.</li>
            <li> smalls so bad, only apply when I stay home and avoid seeing people, hope it has a better sent not sure it will work, but on the container, it says it can apply on breast and any part of the body. I will still use it, if it works, I will come back and give it four star- still not five star because of the bad sent</li>
            <li> Seems i have had no results from this product.  I am very disappointed. This was not a cheap product</li>
            <li> Used for 1.5 months now. No changes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, and I never say that about most purchases, nor do I have time to post.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days of day and night application I was up 1 size. Now 3 weeks later, 2 sized...plus they are tender so that sensitivity is an added plus. I was all lined up to have an augmentation done, I&#x27;m happily putting that off!</li>
            <li> My wife has been having trouble in this sector so after looking at the reviews I decided to buy this one. She seems to really like it, so well that I am now about to buy a second tub. It is made from safe ingredients so no chemicals and what you&#x27;re getting is a natural product that not only works but is also comfortable. I would highly recommend this product, don&#x27;t think there is any other product that does the same job as well as this.</li>
            <li> Works nicely to firm things up.</li>
            <li> Wow! I can&#x27;t believe it! This product really works! My friend bought it for a while ago and I&#x27;ve grown a FULL cup size and my breasts are more perky! I am running low and I plan to buy more soon! Also they work very well with the pills :)</li>
            <li> I cant really tell a difference in myself. I feels good and smells good that about it. I will continue to use in hopes that it will makes results happen.  * I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> good product. and after several weeks. i have started to notice some changes</li>
            <li> Excellent product, the results began to appear since the first weeks , i love it 3&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I could not believe.. but it actually works... I have been using it for only 15 days and I can feel my breast go firms go firm and shapey... Moreover, the cream is very smooth to apply... Gets absorb quickly and leaves the skin polished and soft... It has a nice light aroma which is very soothing and refreshing.. 5 stars</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed any change.</li>
            <li> This is a joke lol don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!! Ive used this over a month on my second month applying ritually and no increase what so ever. I believed the reviews and bought 3! Reviews are fake! Dont buy. Its just a lotion that makes your skin soft .</li>
            <li> I was a huge skeptic. I&#x27;ve had 3 kids and breast fed two of them, I know all too well the effects of that on the body. I bought this and the pills. The pills seemed to make me break out really bad. Could be a coincidence, because I&#x27;m still sorta having the issue, however, not as bad. I may try again later to see. I used an entire tub of this cream in about a month, I think I could tell after a few weeks. My breasts were tender and full feeling. I couldn&#x27;t believe it was the cream so I stopped using it after every shower, low and behold, my sagging boobies were begining to reappear. I ordered it just now for the second time. Idk the science behind it at all, and I know every body differs, but this did work for me. My tatas are much fuller when I use it. I&#x27;m afraid I will become an addict now /:</li>
            <li> Item arrived in time, packaged great. I have tried product for a couple of days now, haven&#x27;t seen or felt anything different. I like the texture of the product. Will update review once I have had more experience with the product.</li>
            <li> WOW!&lt;br /&gt;Its really Excellent Cream, working very good.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is a recovering anorexic and she has lost quite a lot of weight because of it. We have been using it for quite a while and we have been seeing some improvements with her breasts! This product works!!! I started the vitamins too.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this Cream to you, Ladies!</li>
            <li> My boobs are finally full. The cheapest way to go from a B-cup to C cup in 2 weeks! I could not afford plastic surgery. Thank heavens I tried this product!</li>
            <li> After using this it definitely made my breasts feel young and firm again. I really would not know what to do if I haven&#x27;t found it!!!</li>
            <li> With the use of Bustbomb cream, my girl&#x27;s breast is looking pretty good. I never found such kind of product which can full fill our dreams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s really helpful and I like the smell. It can raise your size so obviously that I am becoming worried about is there anything will do harm to my body? I like this product and hope all of the ingredients are harmless.</li>
            <li> This is my first jar the shipping was great and quick and the cream smells really great and feels really good on my skin I&#x27;m starting to see a little results too soon to tell will check back next month thanks</li>
            <li> Used it for about 4 or 5 days with no results.. not even a little. Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> It didnt work and there was no difference in my breast size and i used it for 3 months dont buy</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Tried the cream and pills for 2 months.</li>
            <li> Went through 2 jars of this cream for 3 months. I used as directed and did not have much improvement at the end. I am about to think these things don&#x27;t really work, but maybe I&#x27;ll just look around if there is anything more effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month that I&#x27;m using this amazing product. I feel confident showing off my cleavage at this moment. I feel my boobs pretty growing &amp; not saggy. I&#x27;m looking forward for more better results hopefully. Thanks for sharing this product which helps women feel more sexier &amp;  more feminine. Thumbs up!👍🏻</li>
            <li> I recommend females to try this i can vouch for my girlfriend she has tried this and i can see the improvements!!</li>
            <li> I paired this with the supplements. I&#x27;m trying lose weight without losing my hourglass figure. Anyone know if they have this for butts? Lol</li>
            <li> Waste of money , I&#x27;m regreting now .. Didn&#x27;t worked .. Unhappy !!!</li>
            <li> does not work at all! total hype!</li>
            <li> helped a bit but not sure how much thinking about getting more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making use of this, and various, supplements for some time now and am over and above surprised at the effects I&#x27;ve come across. I did not believe this supplement would work on me personally however I began experiencing benefits within first full week of use. I&#x27;ve developed a good bit so far using this cream and cannot be any more pleased with the effects! Each and every time I have had a concern relating to this product, I promptly received a reply from the staff members there. My newly developed, and developing acquisitions are entirely as a consequence of this excellent cream. I&#x27;m able to undoubtedly reassure whoever isn&#x27;t pleased with their present breast situation, that if they get started making use of the this product, they will also be singing its praises.</li>
            <li> My friend asked me to buy this product for her and I did. It works great and its really safe to use . Its just been 2 months since she used and it she already claims changing the size or her bra twice already. That is quite a lot of improvement in just a short time. She definitely find it a great product and is really satisfied with the results. If you want a product that delivers what it promises then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> It makes my breast feel so good.  I don&#x27;t know if they are larger but they feel larger.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work. I took it with the pills too. $100 down the drain.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous claims.  Stupid to fall for it.</li>
            <li> its just regular old cream -,-&lt;br /&gt;it did nothing but cause back ache from time to time&lt;br /&gt;it does firm you breasts i guess :/&lt;br /&gt;but who cares?! The product is a lie!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be an easier way to get larger boobs than having to spend a large sum of money to get fake ones so I bought this product. To be honest, I did not notice any changes in my breast size. I will say they seem firmer but no noticeable change. On the other hand, it is a great moisturizer! It is very hydrating and will continue to use it for that reason. In the end, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for larger breast but maybe for the hydration part. For others who experienced the same thing as I did I would recommend using American E-Commerce Solutions BustBomb Pill because that worked more for me. I received this product at a discount for a review.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my package on the 24th of June, and I can say I&#x27;m seeing small results as of 2 days use. It&#x27;s too early to tell but there&#x27;s deff a slight difference. My breast feel softer and They feel slightly heavier. They feel slightly sore but it could also be from the breast massages &amp; I also been taking pueraria mirifica. I have 2 kids and only breast fed my youngest child. After breast feeding I was completely flat on top and only had some boob but no cleavage :(&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will help me regain the loss after breast feeding.&lt;br /&gt;I will update once I finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was on time as well:)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get a boob job I was very worry of leaving  work so I tried to this product has a great smell but it also has a very good moisturizer to help the boobs lifted too I&#x27;m just try this product instead I&#x27;ll use it maybe two weeks now and it is making it a lil bigger just a little bit though I will continue with the product I love it must try.....I also take the pills.</li>
            <li> This cream helped my bust firm up and it helped me keep my breasts while the rest of me lost weight. Great Product. Used it in conjunction with the pills. I believe that helped as well.</li>
            <li> waiting for results...</li>
            <li> It is really frustrating..it ddnt work at all</li>
            <li> The application process alone is enough for 5 stars, the results are icing on the scoops (with is weird because I&#x27;ve never added icing to my ice cream).</li>
            <li> My wife used this with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E3DPOUQ. It worked great for her both products together provide excellent results.</li>
            <li> such a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I got this to try.I have been using this and the pills for about 2 weeks.  I can tell a little bit of a difference I have not gone up in size but they are getting firmer..  It says to use them for 3 months to see a big difference so I will keep on using. Very quick shipping and beautiful packaging.</li>
            <li> So I just got my jar of bust boom im excited to see how this goes!! hopefully it goes good ! wish me luck</li>
            <li> I got this for a particular person in my family who was curious (not me)...lol..and this is her honest opinion of the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;it really works. They say that it enhances you one cup size and i don&#x27;t notice that it has been a cup, at least not yet but, my breasts have definitely gotten bigger and they&#x27;re soft. So, I will say you can put up a positive review because it really does work. Also, I put what is left on my hands of the cream  on my deriere and that&#x27;s gotten plumper too&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is the family members unbiased opinion. They seem happy and thus, I&#x27;m happy to say this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Good product and it is works for me. I tried this and there is a slightly  development in me. The product description is  New Paraben-Free and Hormone-Free Formula. Why i like this product because it is Proudly Made and Packaged in the USA in an FDA Registered and Inspected Facility. So it is safe for FDA approved. And this requires to used in it is Advised to Use for at Least 3 Months in Order to Achieve Maximum Results. From now on i still using and alot of improvement because this is the answer of my little bobie problem.Thanks I found this and I will recommend this product. I got this in good price discount for product promotions in exchange of product reviews unbiased and honest .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> Loved this product - fast shipping! Highly recommend you try this for enhancing your breasts :)</li>
            <li> I live in Schertz, Tx and it is hard to find any breast enlargement items that work, but this one has worked and I can visibly see results. I have increased my boobs by two cup sizes, and its hard for a man to grow breasts.</li>
            <li> Only made my skin a little tighter other then that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Only make your breast softer.. Trust me! If you wanna buy something for enlargement, it may not be your choice.</li>
            <li> First time use skin felt smoother and firmer. After 3 weeks daily use breast measurements increased 1/2 inch and stretch marks under breasts significantly reduced. Incorporated 15 min breast massage a day and breasts that were saggy and sad are round, firmer and perky. I&#x27;m reordering and adding more for a friend. This product works!!! I started the vitamins too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product previously and found that by mixing one capsule of the BustBomb pills/capsule into the cream has helped my breast become perkier and a bit fuller where around the bust line I can see a change in plumpness and it&#x27;s texture is more smoothe than before.&lt;br /&gt;I am a mother of 4 and due to of course having kids, losing weight and getting sick over the years have had a turn on my body mainly my breasts which practically deflated from a 38B to a 34A which just caused me to get depressed and not wanting to show my disfigured breasts. But once I actually found this product to stay helping me with gaining some back, hey it&#x27;s worth it. Now I&#x27;m happy and have enough to fill the palm of my hands and out fill my 34B bras!!! Will definitely keep using and buying seeing that it does work slowly but for surely. Patience is a must and sticking to your regime is a must!!</li>
            <li> Sorry my fellow small breasted friends, this products sucks. It obviously can&#x27;t do what it says its supposed to do, so don&#x27;t waste your money. Makes a good gag gift though.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this cream would work, but it has now been nearly 3 weeks and my breasts are fuller and firmer.  I like this cream, highly recommended for those girls who need to feel firmer.</li>

            <li> Bought for gf, so far it&#x27;s been a week and nothing happend yet besides a little pain according to her. Still gonna finish the bottle though see if it works. Will update</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> i just started using a few days ago. it gets absorbed very easily. Helps keep the breast enlargement suction cups in place. Too soon to tell it it is going to help increase breast size.</li>
            <li> Love the product. I felt it gave me significant results. I used both the pills and the cream daily and felt a change. Breasts felt fuller and plumper after about 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Good results for what it is, definitely recommend rrc</li>
            <li> After using this product, my breasts are firm and looking-smart! yay!!</li>
            <li> Not visible results yet, thanks</li>
            <li> Sadly, did not work for me at all.  Used the entire jar.  Smell was light.  Cream was easy to apply.  Was really hoping to have good results after reading these reviews, unfortunately I didnt see any noticable difference after 9 weeks.  I am not so patient to continue using for 6 months to see if this will work for me.</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver...As I have matured everything was going south. But with this product everything is going north.</li>
            <li> This product Doest NOT work, please don&#x27;t listen to those fake positive reviews&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe Amazon allows this kind of thing</li>
            <li> Am using this with the capsules since I went through menopause over 10 years ago. Had lost about 20 lbs. and the girls were looking all floppy! In just a couple weeks of using the cream once a day and taking the capsules twice to three times a day they have plumped up considerably!!! So happy and my libido is back and in FULL force! hahahahaha.....I feel WONDERFUL!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week or so and I already see the difference. The shipping was faster then expected witch was great. Although a side effect I&#x27;ve been noticing was being very angry and hungry more often. Hope to see more growth I would recommend using the pill and the cream. They compliment eachother well and I&#x27;d rather pay $60 then $5000 for fake boobs</li>
            <li> The cream makes the skin feel very soft and supple, but I did not see much enlargement effect.  However, I&#x27;m willing to keep using the cream because it feels good and may take a longer time to produce the desired results.</li>
            <li> I have used many other brands, but does not work. But, this brand really works!! Works really well for mature females.</li>
            <li> so far it seems to be working I would recommend it at this point been using Bust Bomb for one month have increased 1 full cup size</li>
            <li> I received this for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. I do like the texture of this cream as it&#x27;s nice and thick yet applies to the skin easily and quickly. It does seem to make my skin feel softer, but I&#x27;m just not really sure what the fuss is about just yet in terms of enhancement. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, though, so I&#x27;ll update my review when I have a better picture of how it works long term.</li>
            <li> Really have not seen any difference in using this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve breastfed 4 babies and my boobs are pretty blah...they just hang there. So when I was offered this BustBomb Cream for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it to try. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week or so and the difference I feel is that my skin is super soft and there&#x27;s some less wrinkles. Nothing to crazy but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and enjoying the results.  Fast delivery and service.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Ladies, I bought this product because, I used to be a beautiful big girl, curves, big boobs and a fat booty; but after i lost soo much weight...and we&#x27;re talking about trimming from 87 kilos to 63 i not only lost my boobs, but they became soo saggy....like granny saggy! It killed my self esteem, it even brought issues in the bedroom because I wasn&#x27;t confident enough to be fully naked with the man I love. Next week will mark my month&#x27;s anniversary using this product and I can tell you that this works!!!! Within the first week I was feeling some breast soreness (like the feeling you get when your tits are growing as a teenager) and they were very sensitive. Also I experienced some nausea, i&#x27;m not sure whether it was the cream or something else but now...my breasts are visibly larger, firmer and perky young. Keep in mind i&#x27;m just 22 years old...I could not live my life with saggy old lady tits and i&#x27;m still in my youthful years. Thank you Bust Bomb for this cream, it has really helped me. I can recommend it to any one! Also, you can rub it on your butt *wink*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N:B Apply directly to the breasts and rub it with your finger tips. It absorbs really quick so if you rub it on your hands first, your hands will absorb most of it. Also, it has a weird smell, not bad, not good, just a weird smell, but it leaves no scent once you apply it. It&#x27;s been a month and i&#x27;ve used only 1/4 of the container. Love it! I really wish I took a before picture to do a before and after thing.</li>
            <li> It dose not work for me totally, even I can&#x27;t return it . so I have to keep this like a useless ting.</li>
            <li> I use it all but not see any change</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well for me my breasts did grow and get firmer. My right breast is smaller than my right so I couldn&#x27;t buy breast pills so I tried this. Keep in mind I didn&#x27;t use it everyday and skipped a lot of times so if I had used it everyday it would have grown alot more. It is help but not a miracle growth.</li>
            <li> Slight increase in bust size but nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. I used Mamorex before and my breast want to blow up.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time purchasing this product! I have been using it for about a month, and got no results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product! I have fuller breasts in a few weeks time!</li>
            <li> After a few days use I could already feel a difference in my breasts. Started to work even faster once I also took the supplement to go with it. No rashes or allergic reactions. I gave it a 4 because it wasn&#x27;t so clear about how often do I use it.</li>
            <li> I like this product the only thing I would say is they can improve on the smell but it&#x27;s ok I do think it firms up the skin and sagging area.</li>
            <li> Worst cream ever it&#x27;s been two weeks I don&#x27;t c any improve  waste of money and time</li>
            <li> Product arrived open, and leaking</li>
            <li> I am using it and i think it is working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the vitamin pill also. Like I say, I thought it was a joke so couldn&#x27;t resist looking into it. There are some really good ingredients in the pill. As far as the cream, there is so much information about the helpful qualities of progesterone. I&#x27;m actually using it as a hormone balancer (if you have too much estrogen, using a progesterone cream can bring estrogen back into a good range). Dr. John R. Lee has a good book about it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, don&#x27;t use too much of the cream or you could get unbalanced.But a little can help a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife after we had our first baby. She was unhappy with how her breasts looked and felt after months of breastfeeding. After using it a month she sees a lot of firmness returning and stretch marks disappearing. We are thrilled with the results and will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> This product has increased my bust naturally.It works very fast.</li>
            <li> I gave Bust Bomb cream &amp; pills a try. I stopped taking the pills after 2 months because they made me break out . I tried to be more patient with the cream but saw no chance at all. I took a before picture. I will try a different Bustcream with different ingredients .&lt;br /&gt;Ladies this cream is not worth the time and $- look elsewhere&lt;br /&gt;Natalie</li>
            <li> I really have not seen any results. Not highly advised...</li>
            <li> After one month daily use, my breast got firmer and breast size increased about 1/2 inch. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product worked for me.  I recently lost weight and my breast were sagging and had stretch marks.  After using this cream twice a day for a month,  my breast are noticeable plumper and firmer.  It also reduced my stretch marks.  I am excited about the results after the next few months :)</li>
            <li> Cream does not work. Don&#x27;t buy waste of money. Obviously these &amp;#34;positive&amp;#34; reviews are bs!</li>
            <li> So been using cream for a couple of wks and ive noticed a slight difference so far( had to do a double  take in mirror to make sure). Cant wait till I use all of it and see the end result.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think n it does much, but I haven&#x27;t  used it that long</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these already and will continue buy more.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything to my breasts after using for two months.</li>
            <li> Its only been a week so far and nothing yet but im still using it and hoping for the best! Still excited about the hopeful outcome!</li>
