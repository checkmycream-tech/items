            <li>Did I mention that I am 79 yrs young and my complexion is doing great!!!    </li>
            <li>for now my hydrating bobbi brown liquid foundation that I put on top of the MAC sculpt foundation , on my eye</li>
            <li>you will love it and notice results.</li>
            <li>It sits on top.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure if it works or not.</li>
            <li>I AM ENJOYING ALL OF WATTS&#x27; PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li>AND GET BETTER RESULTS.  </li>
            <li>I AM WELL PLEASED.</li>
            <li>Love the moisture content</li>
            <li>Thanks for your fine products and great prices.      </li>
            <li>The wrinkles and lines really smooth out and the moisture retention is so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost six months now, and I have come to the conclusion that it is reducing my fine lines slowly-but-surely, and preventing others from forming.  </li>
            <li>times i follow by a light moisturizer(dead sea, RIVIA products etc) or by argan or maracuja oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and people say my skin looks great, but I personally cannot tell the difference.</li>
            <li>IT IS SMOOTH TO APPLY,</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what the product will do with continouse use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apply it to your skin first, then massage in your favorite moisturizing cream/oil.</li>
            <li>I have used many things in the past for fine lines and wrinkles, this is the best product I have ever tried, it really works</li>
            <li>it gives me a clean feel, as it is not sticky</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26, fair skinned, with occasional hormonal acne and the beginnings of crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>Then I store the original bottle in the fridge to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>Ok revision, I love it so much, I am on my 2nd bottle and also ordered another for my sis...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, absorbs / dries fast without residue and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>I care so much about my skin&#x27;s hydration and glow and this really feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>high quality product which leaves great satisfaction in their use and price-wise is accessible to everyone reason that I recommend is widely purchased by anyone interested</li>
            <li>it deminished some of the fine lines on the forehead, laugh lines (did not do to much for lines around the lip area, but I am always careful around this area, and use a chapstick over it to be on the safe side, so it is a bit tricky to reach and penetrate the lip lines )</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>so I took some samples and started researching beauty products with a higher concentrate of HA in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more in the future</li>
            <li>One word of caution... don&#x27;t use too much !</li>
            <li>It helped tremendously to CLEARN UP ADULT ACNE.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I also started using it alone on my face after I wash - four large drops, every night and every morning.</li>
            <li>I use 3-4 drops in the AM with moisturizer and 1 drop pure on fingertip to dab around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I used this after I did a chemical peel, and it&#x27;s really soothing and hydrating.</li>
            <li>I use it with my moisturizer and my face and neck seem to really benefit from the added product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>it is very soothing after a peel&lt;br</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this and another brand of Hyaluronic Acid Solution for a couple of month and really can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I think really really helped by wrinkles/lines on my chest, even my daughter commented on it, as well as some lines on my neck) .&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>DOESN&#x27;T TAKE MUCH</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It really tightens the skin.</li>
            <li>I suspect it works better when combined with other products and will give it a try.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s working pretty well so far.</li>
            <li>After it was rubbed in my skin felt kind of tight, so I put my Cetaphil sensitive skin moisturizing lotion on top, worked like a charm, takes a while for the lotion to really \\&quot;sink in\\&quot;, feels a little sticky for a bit</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HINT: as recommended, when applying make sure your skins is still slightly damp, I spray some toner, rosewater etc.</li>
            <li>Within a week I had the first major breakout in over 10 years.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to pat dry the face first, but it&#x27;s better to let it air dry a bit and apply HA when the skin is still moist.</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product and my skin returned to normal.</li>
            <li>I would not be so pale:) and am just so used to wearing foundation, I would say these products improved my skin 90% from what it used to be.</li>
            <li>It seems to be helpful, but I am not convinced that it penetrates very far in to the layers of skin.</li>
            <li>A tiny tiny dab will do, and the dropper holds more than enough, no worries.</li>
            <li>The only downside was it took some time for my skin (sensitive, and combination in T-zone) to adjust to it - at first</li>
            <li>In the day I use it under my day moisturizer, and at night I use it under my night serum and night moisturizer when the heat is on full blast, or alone at other times.</li>
            <li>overall really recommend this product to clear up and improve your skin , wish I would have started this in my 30th !</li>
            <li>I had clear skin and wanted to try this product to use with my moisturizer .</li>
            <li>...even helps cuticles stay soft &amp; supple.  </li>
            <li>I got a facial and consultation at Dermalogica, where the facialist told me I had extremely dehydrated skin, which perplexed me because I&#x27;d recently started using a night serum and a heavy night moisturizer, on top of judlcious use of my day moisturizer (Cerave).</li>
            <li>I have not used other hyaluronic products, so I cannot compare, but Watts 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Solution is miraculous!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll update after a while and say whether this worked any major miracles for me.</li>
            <li>I have also read this can be used in combo with a derma-roller, but have only tried that once so far.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of the hyaluronic acid serum is like gel, like most other serums I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Everything I found was super $$$ ($100+ for a few ounces!)</li>
            <li>Other than that, it didn&#x27;t do much in the way of improving my skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li>I have naturally dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that when I apply it after the face is completely dry, the HA is not effective and will dry your skin even more.</li>

            <li> Oh, and I am not a competitor, I am a long time</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin, maybe one drop every other day will do !!!</li>
            <li> My dry areas have disappeared!  </li>
            <li> I used this product on my face twice a day for six months, to help moisturize, even skin tone and minimize (very faint) fine lines.</li>
            <li> So do not expect a miracle from this or any other</li>
            <li> For now, I sometimes use it as an \\&quot;in between\\&quot; product for when I run out of my other skincare options and need to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I still use it day and night along with other stuff.</li>
            <li> With the foundation you see some of the lines still coming through , but not the way they used to be, I need much less foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like product because it is not hreasy, but it is a little drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> Need to add  a little moisturizer.</li>
            <li> just a few drops.&lt;br</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Plain &amp; Swirl\\&quot; 1/3oz .33</li>
            <li> It was the middle of a brutal winter in NYC, and my skin started drying out to the point of flaking, even in the middle of the day when I&#x27;m usually at my oiliest.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any odd smell to the product, sorry I wasted my money.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.  I liked that I could get it in the 2oz. size and not over priced as some products of the same are.  I have been using this product and vitamin C for approx. a month have noticed my complexion is doing great.     I am now looking for Matrix 3000 with dmae in it. If you have it, please let me know!    Thanks for your fine products and great prices.      Did I mention that I am 79 yrs young and my complexion is doing great!!!    Connie</li>
            <li> I had clear skin and wanted to try this product to use with my moisturizer . Within a week I had the first major breakout in over 10 years. I stopped using this product and my skin returned to normal. I didn&#x27;t notice any odd smell to the product, sorry I wasted my money.  Oh, and I am not a competitor, I am a long time amazon customer and this review, like all my reviews, is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The 2oz bottle is larger than I had guesstimated, I got the dropper bottle. It arrived with a plastic seal around the nozzle with perforation marks (like an OTC medicine bottle seal). Very clean, not a scratch on the glass bottle, looks good. The consistency of the hyaluronic acid serum is like gel, like most other serums I have used in the past. A tiny tiny dab will do, and the dropper holds more than enough, no worries. I actually used the dropper to put it on my fingertip and then rubbed it on my face. After it was rubbed in my skin felt kind of tight, so I put my Cetaphil sensitive skin moisturizing lotion on top, worked like a charm, takes a while for the lotion to really \\&quot;sink in\\&quot;, feels a little sticky for a bit (I think that&#x27;s just my lotion). I used this after I did a chemical peel, and it&#x27;s really soothing and hydrating. I have naturally dry sensitive skin so I like that this serum is unscented, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch. I haven&#x27;t been using it very long so I&#x27;ll update after a while and say whether this worked any major miracles for me. Really I&#x27;m happy just with the way it moisturizes, for now. I&#x27;m 26, fair skinned, with occasional hormonal acne and the beginnings of crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Excellent product!!! After using for just 2 weeks (twise a day) my skin is soooo smooth and filled!!! Was delivered in time in a very safe package. Thank you, Amazon!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost six months now, and I have come to the conclusion that it is reducing my fine lines slowly-but-surely, and preventing others from forming.  My dry areas have disappeared!  I have also read this can be used in combo with a derma-roller, but have only tried that once so far.  I will update in time, but I do believe I can thank this product for my skin&#x27;s improvements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about hylauronic acid and decided to add it to beauty regimen. Watts comes through with very fair pricing and a product that seems to have really good effacacy. I use it with my moisturizer and my face and neck seem to really benefit from the added product. A winner that I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because:&lt;br /&gt;- it does not clog my pores&lt;br /&gt;- it works great for me when I apply it under moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;- it is very soothing after a peel&lt;br /&gt;- it gives me a clean feel, as it is not sticky&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again</li>
            <li> high quality product which leaves great satisfaction in their use and price-wise is accessible to everyone reason that I recommend is widely purchased by anyone interested</li>
            <li> I adore the texture, value and quality of this product.  I have tried others.  I care so much about my skin&#x27;s hydration and glow and this really feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> Like product because it is not hreasy, but it is a little drying to the skin. Need to add  a little moisturizer. Good booster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product with a derma roller and I think it&#x27;s working pretty well so far. No complaints.</li>
            <li> It was the middle of a brutal winter in NYC, and my skin started drying out to the point of flaking, even in the middle of the day when I&#x27;m usually at my oiliest. I got a facial and consultation at Dermalogica, where the facialist told me I had extremely dehydrated skin, which perplexed me because I&#x27;d recently started using a night serum and a heavy night moisturizer, on top of judlcious use of my day moisturizer (Cerave). All of it has hyaluronic acid (HA), but apparently not enough. The facialist pushed me to buy the Dermalogica skin booster, which has a lot of HA, but it was $$$ so I took some samples and started researching beauty products with a higher concentrate of HA in the ingredients. Everything I found was super $$$ ($100+ for a few ounces!), so I decided to get a bottle of this stuff alone and add it to my existing products. Getting the dropper bottle made it easier to control the amount. I also started using it alone on my face after I wash - four large drops, every night and every morning. The instructions say to pat dry the face first, but it&#x27;s better to let it air dry a bit and apply HA when the skin is still moist. I&#x27;ve noticed that when I apply it after the face is completely dry, the HA is not effective and will dry your skin even more. In the day I use it under my day moisturizer, and at night I use it under my night serum and night moisturizer when the heat is on full blast, or alone at other times. My face stays moisturized through the night and day when I do this, and I notice the bags under my eyes have lightened in color too. The only downside was it took some time for my skin (sensitive, and combination in T-zone) to adjust to it - at first I noticed my rosacea acting up and some bumps elsewhere, but after two weeks they went away.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be realy once you get wrinkles any products will only deminish them. So do not expect a miracle from this or any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this and another brand of Hyaluronic Acid Solution for a couple of month and really can see a difference in my skin. It helped tremendously to CLEARN UP ADULT ACNE.&lt;br /&gt;and it deminished some of the fine lines on the forehead, laugh lines (did not do to much for lines around the lip area, but I am always careful around this area, and use a chapstick over it to be on the safe side, so it is a bit tricky to reach and penetrate the lip lines ) I am excited to see what the product will do with continouse use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HINT: as recommended, when applying make sure your skins is still slightly damp, I spray some toner, rosewater etc. on my face, neck, and chest, I do this day and night. Then use the RIVIA firming serum(which I think really really helped by wrinkles/lines on my chest, even my daughter commented on it, as well as some lines on my neck) .&lt;br /&gt;At times i follow by a light moisturizer(dead sea, RIVIA products etc) or by argan or maracuja oil. just a few drops.&lt;br /&gt;If I would not be so pale:) and am just so used to wearing foundation, I would say these products improved my skin 90% from what it used to be. With the foundation you see some of the lines still coming through , but not the way they used to be, I need much less foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I overall really recommend this product to clear up and improve your skin , wish I would have started this in my 30th ! Still wish there is something to bring back some glow ! for now my hydrating bobbi brown liquid foundation that I put on top of the MAC sculpt foundation , on my eye, cheek area will have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck everyone, give it a TRY</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. Non greasy and excellent feel to you skin. great foundation for your make-up. Plus no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I use 3-4 drops in the AM with moisturizer and 1 drop pure on fingertip to dab around my eyes. I am good to go. The wrinkles do not seem to be so pronounced with the use of HA. I will definitely reorder once I run out! Ok revision, I love it so much, I am on my 2nd bottle and also ordered another for my sis...she loves it too!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face twice a day for six months, to help moisturize, even skin tone and minimize (very faint) fine lines. It&#x27;s easy to use, absorbs / dries fast without residue and moisturizes well. Other than that, it didn&#x27;t do much in the way of improving my skin tone and texture. I suspect it works better when combined with other products and will give it a try. For now, I sometimes use it as an \\&quot;in between\\&quot; product for when I run out of my other skincare options and need to repurchase. It&#x27;s a good temporary filler.</li>
            <li> Received this item on time and the price was good.  Very good value for this type of product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and people say my skin looks great, but I personally cannot tell the difference. I still use it day and night along with other stuff. Only four stars b/c I personally don&#x27;t see a change yet.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed a lot of improvement by it&#x27;s use. It seems to be helpful, but I am not convinced that it penetrates very far in to the layers of skin.</li>
            <li> Love it! Never knew anything about it until shopping at Amazon.  Women you will love it and notice results. Had no clue it would work so goid. Will be purchasing more in the future</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s supposed to help with wrinkles. It doesn&#x27;t soak into your skin, it runs off.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t mix well with moisturizers either. It sits on top.  I can&#x27;t say for sure if it works or not.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY, VERY GOOD!  IT IS SMOOTH TO APPLY, DOESN&#x27;T TAKE MUCH AND I HAVE ADDED SOME ARGAN OIL IN THE BOTTLE FOR JUST ONE STEP.  THIS WAS SUGGESTED BY A CUSTOMER&#x27;S REVIEW.  I AM ENJOYING ALL OF WATTS&#x27; PRODUCTS.  HINT:  ADD SOME OF THIS TO ANOTHER WATTS HA AND GET BETTER RESULTS.  THIS MIGHT NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE,  TRY IT!  I AM WELL PLEASED.</li>
            <li> I have not used other hyaluronic products, so I cannot compare, but Watts 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Solution is miraculous!  Holds the moisture in your skin amazingly well.  Great for your face, knees, elbows...even helps cuticles stay soft &amp; supple.  Apply it to your skin first, then massage in your favorite moisturizing cream/oil. I fill a roll-on perfume bottle (Amazon product below) with Watts and application is a snap; great nightly under the eyes.  Then I store the original bottle in the fridge to keep it fresh. Excellent product! Refillable perfume bottles referenced above are great:[[ASIN:B0053TDRQM 2 Roll-on Refillable Glass Perfume Bottle Purse or Travel Size. \\&quot;Plain &amp; Swirl\\&quot; 1/3oz .33 Fl. oz. 10ml.]]</li>
            <li> Love the moisture content</li>
            <li> I have used many things in the past for fine lines and wrinkles, this is the best product I have ever tried, it really works but you need to use it daily.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than Skinceuticals and does the trick.  Ive bought it for all of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is THE best hylaronic acid I&#x27;ve used. It really tightens the skin. No alcohol No paraben &#x3D; no irritation</li>
            <li> This really does amazing things to your face !!! The wrinkles and lines really smooth out and the moisture retention is so much better. However, I wonder what it&#x27;s made of ? I contacted the company and they never responded. It can be made of rooster comb or bacteria. I wonder which it is ? But regardless, it gives a great result ! One word of caution... don&#x27;t use too much ! I used 3-4 drops per day over 4 days and I started to get a rash. So if you have sensitive skin, maybe one drop every other day will do !!!</li>
