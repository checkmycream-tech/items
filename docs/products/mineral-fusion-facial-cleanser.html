    <ol>
            <li>she said she had gotten a lot of customer feedback on how well it worked, one of the best, but the store mgr had stopped...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great stuff with nothing that harms your skin!</li>
            <li>I swtiched to Andalou and that works wonderfully for me.</li>
            <li>i have to say this is some awesome stuff.</li>
            <li>The Skin Renewing Face Scrub and Toner both work incredibly well.</li>
            <li>Great texture, consistency, lathers well, no residue or harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>great stuff...totally organic</li>
            <li>It works great with the electric face scrubber.</li>
            <li>This and their lotion are both very nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>i asked the vitamin dept mgr why they&#x27;d stopped when the stuff was so good...</li>
            <li>So, time to find a good dermatologist to hopefully treat my now blotchy, spotty and peeling skin.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work so effectively.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderfully hydrating and cleansing lotion for &#x27;older&#x27; skin.  </li>
            <li>mild, foamy, and good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this brand of skincare.</li>
            <li>and it really makes your skin look great...</li>
            <li>i was amazed that i was able to find this, like just about everything, at amazon...</li>
            <li>My face is better for this product and so is the environment.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>Love this product line.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the best facial cleanser among I</li>
            <li>Instead of the wonderful herbal smell it used to have, it now smells like wet cardboard.  </li>
            <li>This feels really good on my skin, very moisturizing and leaves skin supple.</li>
            <li>but other than that it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Always gets my makeup off and face clean :)</li>
            <li>But it easily removes makeup, including mascara.</li>
            <li>Would be great as a cleanser on bare skin though, just for moisturization!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good cleanser for young, oily skin.</li>
            <li>my face felt clean, smooth and even refreshed.</li>
            <li>I was really excited.</li>
            <li>It gets the face clean without being abrasive and you feel like it&#x27;s clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and well balanced.  </li>
            <li>like it very much.</li>
            <li>Takes off the makeup and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have older, sensitive skin that still breaks out easily.  </li>
            <li>This does not agree with my skin, I ended up with very irritated skin and a bit of a rash.</li>
            <li>and I lost  much of the cleanser.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It really does seem to be concentrated, you only need to use a very small amount to get a good overall cleansing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so sad when a company changes formulas and the new stuff is not as good.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li>So now I know how I&#x27;ll look at 70 yrs old, or sooner</li>
            <li>It is also not as rich and tends to be a little drying to my skin.  </li>
            <li>at whole foods until the store i go to stopped stocking it even tho the other whole food did...</li>
            <li>At first I thought I had poison ivy, but there was no classic itch or redness.</li>
            <li>New formula is inferior to old (blue tube).</li>
            <li>This face wash is gentle on my dry &amp; sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the wash viscosity is pretty high, and I end up dispensing a little more than I need.</li>
            <li>It appears as a chemical burn much like I had when I received a too deep facial once at a spa.</li>
            <li>Please bring back the old formula!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my N. 1 facial cleanser so far</li>
            <li>Not a good thing since the cancer risk is fairly significant with nitrosamines.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> i have been trying to go all natural when it comes to facial products and what not, and i have tried Acure&#x27;s facial lotions and other toiletries</li>

            <li> the only down side about this, as one person has addressed, it can dry out your skin.</li>

            <li> Found little sample sizes in a hotel I stayed at.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find that in addition to the new packaging, there is a new formulation to this product.  </li>
            <li> one thing i hate about whole foods is that each store can carry or not carry stuff other stores do, so you never know if you can get what you want when you go in there...</li>
            <li> The dryness is so bad that the skin around my mouth has wrinkled up to the point that it pulls and hurts to open my mouth to eat.</li>
            <li> I hate to admit that, but there it is.  </li>
            <li> and it is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about my cleansers and usually end up spending $40+ on a single 8oz bottle so when a makeup artist and knowledgeable skin care pro told me I should try this I was really excited. Wish I would have got this sooner! Great texture, consistency, lathers well, no residue or harmful chemicals. Always gets my makeup off and face clean :)</li>
            <li> this item was a replacement in the Subscribe and save program. It is nothing like its predecessor. It has been a while since I received it, but just tried it and it is awful. I want to return it but the window is closed. Please, allow me to return this item.</li>
            <li> Will not use again. I have a sensitive sense of smell. This facial cleanser smells off. It gave me an instant migraine. I wanted to like it. I love this brand of skincare. But not this. The Skin Renewing Face Scrub and Toner both work incredibly well.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully hydrating and cleansing lotion for &#x27;older&#x27; skin.  I hate to admit that, but there it is.  In fact, I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer at night after using this product, only and eye cream, because it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin tight or dry.</li>
            <li> This face wash is gentle on my dry &amp; sensitive skin. I need to use a generous lotion afterwards as it does dry my skin out. But it easily removes makeup, including mascara. I actually use a body shop butter in my face to follow up. My only complaint is that the wash viscosity is pretty high, and I end up dispensing a little more than I need.</li>
            <li> great stuff...totally organic and it really makes your skin look great...moisturized and reduces wrinkles. couldn&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought at whole foods until the store i go to stopped stocking it even tho the other whole food did...i asked the vitamin dept mgr why they&#x27;d stopped when the stuff was so good...she said she had gotten a lot of customer feedback on how well it worked, one of the best, but the store mgr had stopped...one thing i hate about whole foods is that each store can carry or not carry stuff other stores do, so you never know if you can get what you want when you go in there...UNLIKE amazon! i was amazed that i was able to find this, like just about everything, at amazon...ordered multiple tubes. it&#x27;s great stuff with nothing that harms your skin!</li>
            <li> It gets the face clean without being abrasive and you feel like it&#x27;s clean.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this and the hydration facial cream that goes with it.</li>
            <li> Found little sample sizes in a hotel I stayed at. This and their lotion are both very nice on the skin. Takes off the makeup and leaves my skin soft and smooth. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This does not agree with my skin, I ended up with very irritated skin and a bit of a rash. I swtiched to Andalou and that works wonderfully for me. I gave the cleanser to a friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This feels really good on my skin, very moisturizing and leaves skin supple. Although this does not get all of the makeup off of my skin, i have to go back over it with a toner to fully remove it. Would be great as a cleanser on bare skin though, just for moisturization!</li>
            <li> This was thrown in a box with a book that I ordered. When I opened the box, the cap was off and the product had leaked all over the book. Beware of the packaging. It was a mess and I lost  much of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube. I will continue to use this brand. It works great with the electric face scrubber.</li>
            <li> My face is better for this product and so is the environment.</li>
            <li> Use this brand always. The creamier one for winter.</li>
            <li> i have to say this is some awesome stuff. i have been trying to go all natural when it comes to facial products and what not, and i have tried Acure&#x27;s facial lotions and other toiletries but i have to say this blows that out of the water. my face felt clean, smooth and even refreshed. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work so effectively. the only down side about this, as one person has addressed, it can dry out your skin. and even though i used it one time, it was enough to put a impression on me if you have seriously oily skin then this would definitely help to control that. I definitely would not suggest this, however, to anyone who has sensitive or dry skin on account it will severely dry out your skin. (mind you this is not even winter anymore but going into spring and that says a lot.) but other than that it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Shortly after using this &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; product, my forehead developed a rash of little bumps. Then the rash progressed to the sides of my face and all around my mouth and nose. At first I thought I had poison ivy, but there was no classic itch or redness. Over the last few days it progressed to a severely parched and now peeling dryness that is very red too. It appears as a chemical burn much like I had when I received a too deep facial once at a spa. The dryness is so bad that the skin around my mouth has wrinkled up to the point that it pulls and hurts to open my mouth to eat. So now I know how I&#x27;ll look at 70 yrs old, or sooner if I continued to use this product. I looked it up on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep site and the likely culprit ingredient &amp;#34;cocamidopropyl betaine&amp;#34; is known to cause these contact dermatitis etc reactions due to the nitrosamines it can be contaminated with in its manufacture. Not a good thing since the cancer risk is fairly significant with nitrosamines. So, time to find a good dermatologist to hopefully treat my now blotchy, spotty and peeling skin. Lovely.</li>
            <li> Love this product line.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find that in addition to the new packaging, there is a new formulation to this product.  Instead of the wonderful herbal smell it used to have, it now smells like wet cardboard.  Where is the clary sage that used to be in your products? It is also not as rich and tends to be a little drying to my skin.  Please bring back the old formula!</li>
            <li> I have used Mineral Fusion&#x27;s facial moisturizer for ages, and when my other cleanser ran out, I decided to try this cleanser.  I am so glad I did!  I love it.  I have older, sensitive skin that still breaks out easily.  This cleanser does not seem too drying or too moisturizing.  My face feels clean and well balanced.  It really does seem to be concentrated, you only need to use a very small amount to get a good overall cleansing.  The fragrance is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Just two drops of this cleanser removes every trace of makeup from your face. Yes, it works. However, it strips every drop of moisture from your skin. I can&#x27;t use it because it leaves my face dry. Not flaky dry, but aging dry, without suppleness. It&#x27;s a good cleanser for young, oily skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best facial cleanser among I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Very mild, foamy, and good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much.</li>
            <li> It cleans very deeply my skin, not agressive, I like the way it smells, it&#x27;s my N. 1 facial cleanser so far</li>
            <li> New formula is inferior to old (blue tube). It smells of chemicals and burns my skin.  I would not recommend.  It&#x27;s so sad when a company changes formulas and the new stuff is not as good.</li>
    </ol>
