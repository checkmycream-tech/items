            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great, controlled curls and a touchable feel that isn&#x27;t crunchy.</li>
            <li>I see now that Gigi Beauty (the seller I purchased from) no longer sellsthis product, and it is now being fulfilled by Amazon, who has great customer service.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love that it is organic.</li>

            <li>Always safe for color, foiled and keratin treated</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite style products.  </li>
            <li>My hair never looked better.</li>
            <li>I started using this product and my hair stays better looking, longer.  </li>
            <li>Love it, works better than anything I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love this product for curly hair</li>
            <li>Leaves my naturally curly hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>Curly hair must have and works best on wet hair.</li>
            <li>Sulfate free cleansing and aloe vera based for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product would reccommend it to others...</li>
            <li>Last year I switched to the Curly Girl Method and this is by far the best hair styling product I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>Apply desired amount to clean, damp hair to define curves and curls.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product for my VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and highly recommend it for curly hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very fine but naturally curly hair, and I think if my hair were thicker and more coarse, it would have worked better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely cost effective and worth a try!</li>
            <li>It just kind of weighed my hair down and got more wavy than curly.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, yet thicker in back and thinning on top.</li>
            <li>Love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I am in love with Loma shampoo and conditioner, so I decided to try the Curvy Creme, as I live in a very humid climate in the summer and choose to let my hair just go curly then.  </li>
            <li>smells great, but does not control frizz in thick curly hair</li>
            <li>Every bottle I have ever had of this has had the white cap break or malfunction, allowing the product to leak all over the counter top.</li>
            <li>Not only do I love LOMA Organics for my locks, but my husband prefers using it too.</li>
            <li>Its pretty sticky &amp; heavy good hold though</li>
            <li>Honestly, it was not worth it for me to return it if it meant trying to communicate with the seller and having to be without a staple hair product for over a week.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I would have used this as my styler before I switched to the CGM.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>She finds it leaves her hair very crunchy with stringy curls,</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like it very well.  </li>
            <li>If it ever is crunchy, I know it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve used too much.</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to style my hair and it enhances the little natural curl that I have so that I have been able to forego having another perm for several months now!</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s best to not apply while overly wet, because it&#x27;s difficult to tell if I&#x27;ve used too much product.</li>
            <li>They would only send me a replacement once they received their item back (they paid shipping) but didn&#x27;t provide a shipping label OR provide an accurate shipping address for me to send it back to.</li>
            <li>I have type 3B hair, which is curly and spirally, and this locks my curls into place but also allows them to be soft unlike gels were doing to my hair.</li>
            <li>When my 23 year old daughter tried mine, she had to have some.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally cury but always became shaggy looking after a day or two.  </li>
            <li>I can dry with a diffuser for soft curls, or let dry naturally for more defined, slightly crunchy curls (although a quick run-through with my fingers takes the crunch out once my hair is dry).</li>
            <li>I have loose curls and thick hair, and they curl up well on their own -</li>
            <li>I have such a hard time finding hair products that I&#x27;m not allergic to, so I was excited to find this soy- and gluten-free curvy creme.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Although I think this actual product is worth 5 stars, I&#x27;m deducting a star due to the poor design of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this product again, and plan to start trying their other products as well.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my Deva Curl hair specialist because it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol as one of its ingredients so won&#x27;t dry out my already dry hair.</li>
            <li> I mix it with the Loma Organics Fortifying Repairitive Tonic and apply to damp hair, then blow dry with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> that frizz when she tries to break the gel cast.</li>
            <li> I put it on while my hair is still wet</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this because she loves the other products in this line, and has curly hair.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my damp hair, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way to avoid crunchy hair!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I just have to be very careful with the amount or my hair looks and feels like a helmet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I LOVE the product but HATE the customer service.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair nor does it flake.</li>
            <li> but I like to have a creme that keeps the frizz down and tightens the curls.</li>
            <li> After I dampen my hair, I use a little every other day to refresh my curls.</li>
            <li> I usually have hair about half dry and rub well between palms before application.</li>
            <li> Apply small amount to dry hair for a separated or messy look....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the heavy weighed down feel.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to be a little heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I will never use this product again, and totally wasted my money on it.</li>
            <li> When I used this stuff, my hair was limp (barely any curls, worse than with no product), with awkward half-hearted waves, very sticky, and just looked really weird.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount (dime-sized?) and work it through the ends and all over.</li>
            <li> I told her I usually use some leave-in conditioner, argan oil and mousse.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair hard or sticky.</li>
            <li> This product gives me body and control but does not make my hair sticky or hard comb out.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly mediterranean hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single bad hair day since I started using this.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> When I contacted Gigi Beauty, the seller I purchased from, (through Amazon (for the worst leak in my experience), I was not pleased with their response.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Okay! not working for me as I would like... can use.</li>
            <li> I love this curly hair cream! Last year I switched to the Curly Girl Method and this is by far the best hair styling product I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s CG approved. I like it so much that I would have used this as my styler before I switched to the CGM. I have type 3B hair, which is curly and spirally, and this locks my curls into place but also allows them to be soft unlike gels were doing to my hair. No crunch!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single bad hair day since I started using this.  I only wish I could get it locally!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome for naturally curly hair! It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair nor does it flake. It is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my naturally curly hair feeling great. Not crunchy and not frizzy. Smells good too</li>
            <li> smells great, but does not control frizz in thick curly hair</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product for my VERY curly hair.

            <li> I have used many curl creams. I like this one best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the heavy weighed down feel. Product feels sticky. I will return to bumble and bumble product. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this product.  When my 23 year old daughter tried mine, she had to have some.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this because she loves the other products in this line, and has curly hair. She finds it leaves her hair very crunchy with stringy curls, that frizz when she tries to break the gel cast. She recommends the loma molding creme.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Loma shampoo and conditioner, so I decided to try the Curvy Creme, as I live in a very humid climate in the summer and choose to let my hair just go curly then.  This product seemed to be a little heavy for my hair.  I have very fine but naturally curly hair, and I think if my hair were thicker and more coarse, it would have worked better.  It just kind of weighed my hair down and got more wavy than curly.  Although I will say this, it did control the frizz.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t like it very well.  It didn&#x27;t define my curls.  My hair still frizzed.  Also, i thought it was a bit cruncy.  I love that it is organic.</li>

            <li> I have thick, curly mediterranean hair. In the past I&#x27;ve used all kinds of gels, mousse, cremes--none of which I cared much for. Not using a product was out of the question as my hair is way to frizzy on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Deva (curly hair) hairstylist recommended this product specifically for my hair. I told her I usually use some leave-in conditioner, argan oil and mousse. She said I would replace my mousse with this product, and to continue with the conditioner and oil. I put it on while my hair is still wet and it comes out perfect every time. It does not leave my hair hard or sticky. It&#x27;s lightweight, I don&#x27;t feel like I have product in my hair. I love this stuff and highly recommend it for curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says: Medium, flexible hold styler that activates curls and waves. For all hair types. Apply desired amount to clean, damp hair to define curves and curls. Apply small amount to dry hair for a separated or messy look.... Sulfate free cleansing and aloe vera based for over 20 years. Paraben and gluten free and never any animal testing! Always safe for color, foiled and keratin treated hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - -&lt;br /&gt;Although I think this actual product is worth 5 stars, I&#x27;m deducting a star due to the poor design of the packaging.

            <li> This product has a nice feel and scent. It does still leave your hair feeling somewhat crunchy.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes it so easy to style my hair and it enhances the little natural curl that I have so that I have been able to forego having another perm for several months now!</li>
            <li> Very nice product to define curls. I mix it with the Loma Organics Fortifying Repairitive Tonic and apply to damp hair, then blow dry with a diffuser. It helps keep my hair curly but controls the frizz.</li>

            <li> Curly hair must have and works best on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love LOMA Organics for my locks, but my husband prefers using it too. It defines his curls and tames the gray frizz. I find it&#x27;s best to not apply while overly wet, because it&#x27;s difficult to tell if I&#x27;ve used too much product. I usually have hair about half dry and rub well between palms before application. It helps to define curl at the ends and controls the fizz. My hair is fine, yet thicker in back and thinning on top. It&#x27;s definitely cost effective and worth a try! I&#x27;m ordering another tube.</li>
            <li> This product is the BEST for curly hair!  A little goes a long way!  I&#x27;ve used so many products for my curly hair, and this is the best one by far!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  This product gives me body and control but does not make my hair sticky or hard comb out.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Does not feel heavy on my hair and looks very natural. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite style products.  Great product--great price.  Great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick, curly hair. This defined her curls and controlled frizz. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> My hair never looked better. Style last for days. This is what my hair looks like in morning after I used the curvy Creme.  All I need to do Is just shaking of the head and out the door.</li>
            <li> Tried this product at my daughter&#x27;s house.  Keeps my hair from the frizzies!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally cury but always became shaggy looking after a day or two.  I started using this product and my hair stays better looking, longer.  Always have it at home and traveling.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not for me. I have loose curls and thick hair, and they curl up well on their own - but I like to have a creme that keeps the frizz down and tightens the curls. When I used this stuff, my hair was limp (barely any curls, worse than with no product), with awkward half-hearted waves, very sticky, and just looked really weird. I will never use this product again, and totally wasted my money on it. Maybe it will work for you, but it is not my bag.</li>
            <li> Love it, works better than anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> Its pretty sticky &amp; heavy good hold though</li>
            <li> Water soluble so it&#x27;s easy to use and it provides good curl. I just have to be very careful with the amount or my hair looks and feels like a helmet.</li>
            <li> Love this product for curly hair</li>
