            <li> and we just push down to dispense the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I also like the dispenser because I don&#x27;t end up with a half squeezed tube of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> No tubes to mess with .</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gotten hard to find.</li>
            <li> We used to buy these at BJ&#x27;s but it&#x27;s hard to find in stores now.</li>
            <li> It seems that everything I like is discontinued, but at least I have it now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Almost every other brand toothpaste gives me a weird, disgusting film in my mouth not long after brushing.  </li>

            <li> Very happy to find it not in any stores</li>
            <li> SUPERFAST shipping &amp; great deal!</li>
            <li> I purchased it about a month ago at Safeway. After 2 weeks I had super white teeth! I like it more than whitening strips and works 2 times better as well!!! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This works great!  My check-ups are easier by using this paste.</li>
            <li> The best tasting &amp; whitening toothpaste around and the neatest to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use it for years. It is superb!</li>
            <li> I love it and am ecstatic that I can still obtain it through Amazon!  It seems that everything I like is discontinued, but at least I have it now.  Amazon to the rescue again!!!</li>
            <li> Always use this product</li>
            <li> One of my favorite toothpastes.</li>
            <li> great product, price &amp; quick service.</li>
            <li> My go-to toothpaste for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost every other brand toothpaste gives me a weird, disgusting film in my mouth not long after brushing.  My dentist told me it was an allergic reaction to an ingredient and that I just needed to keep trying other brands until I find one that doesn&#x27;t cause the gummy film.  Mentadent, Tom&#x27;s of Maine and Arm and Hammer all have no side effect, but I get the cleanest feeling mouth that lasts the longest with Mentadent over the others.  It&#x27;s getting more difficult to find.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t disappear!!!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best toothpaste I have ever used. Hard to find in stores so it is great to find them on Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste. Great for everyone in the family.</li>
            <li> It is what I like on the edge of my sink which makes the tooth past very handy and a convenient.</li>
            <li> Ordered it several times. Always a good deal.</li>
            <li> I love this product have used it for a very long time, it combines toothpaste  &amp; peroxide together.</li>
            <li> We have used this toothpaste for years. It is so easy to use - no squished tube to deal with. It tastes good and does a great job on teeth too.</li>
            <li> received only 1 box out of a pack of 3 so returned it</li>
            <li> based on the price I assumed this was a misprint and was a pack of 2, but I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived and was 3 packs of 2. Great quality toothpaste for super cheap.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described, priced right and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> We really like this toothpaste and it&#x27;s gotten hard to find.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m concerned that they&#x27;re no longer making it which disturbs me because I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I was in my teens.  The combination of the baking soda and toothpaste ensures a very clean mouth and healthy gums.  I also like the dispenser because I don&#x27;t end up with a half squeezed tube of toothpaste.  The lids also stays on.  Will continue to use until I can no longer find.</li>
            <li> There is no other toothpaste I prefer.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Mentadent I don&#x27;t understand why it is no longer in the drugstores !</li>
            <li> Everything was great.</li>
            <li> Our grocery stores here in the Florida Keys have discontinued this product. We are delighted that we found on Amazon at a delightful price and pkg deal. This is an easy item to use for arthritic hands and for little kids too. No tubes to mess with . The reusable stand that refills fit into can also be decorated by using your imagination. Have fun brushing your pearly whites- who knew??</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste. We used to buy these at BJ&#x27;s but it&#x27;s hard to find in stores now. So glad Amazon still sells them. I&#x27;ve never had a toothpaste that makes my smile so bright.</li>
