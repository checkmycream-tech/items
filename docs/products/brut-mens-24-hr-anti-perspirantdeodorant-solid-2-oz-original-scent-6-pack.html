            <li>I bought this because it was a good price</li>
            <li>Most stores I have gone to do not carry this antiperspirant/deodorant.  </li>
            <li>This anti-perspirant is the all-time favorite of mine for my husband to wear.  </li>
            <li>This is simply the Best anti-perspirant i have ever used.</li>
            <li>Most anti perspirants just couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li>I used to love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Not being able to find it causes more sweat.</li>
            <li>Could not find my favorite brand of men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li>This quite simply is the best deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li>Love this item and it is one of our son&#x27;s favorites.</li>
            <li>so I am glad that I can stock up on Amazon.</li>
            <li>good product have used it for years fast delivery</li>
            <li>the light fragrance is also a plus.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>good, clean, masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Keeps under arms dry for hours a great product!</li>
            <li>I wanted original.  </li>
            <li>Once he tried it he decided that he liked it better, even though it is a solid and not a gel.</li>
            <li>It will be so much easier to buy a pack of these versus checking at the drug store for when they got more in.</li>
            <li>The actual pack of 6 is a really good buy, although be prepared that it somewhat melts in heat (i bought these during the summer</li>
            <li>strong name, strong heritage, confidence, long lasting effect, very good value for money</li>
            <li>This stuff is a white stick that smells like it would be more appropriate for a woman than a man.</li>
            <li>I am sure that it is just as good, but I wanted the green.</li>
            <li>keeps me nice and dry without any irratation.</li>
            <li>He says it does not ball up in the armpit hair, which is why he didn&#x27;t want to try it in the first place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this stuff since middle school, and, as it has disappeared from store after store, I&#x27;ve been sweating not being able to find it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It keeps me from sweating and being stinky haha.</li>
            <li>which I really like.</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant</li>
            <li>just like I do many other things.  </li>
            <li>This product is not Brut &amp;#34;original scent.&amp;#34; The original scent is represented by brut cologne, splash on, and regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>It said classic.</li>
            <li>This is my second order so my expectations are pretty much set in concrete.  </li>
            <li>Bought the wrong kind at first for my husband (antiperspirant and deodorant instead of just deodorant.)</li>
            <li>Now I know where to look for an old but well scented men&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li>If you find that you&#x27;re allergic to old spice as I am brut should work.</li>
            <li>I thought that I was getting the green original deodorant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, in general, but I cannot have my t-shirts ruined by purple stains in the armpits!</li>
            <li>arrived earlier than expected, and it&#x27;s the right stuff</li>
            <li>Like the smell of this on my husband, but apparently it contains a lot of oil</li>
            <li>not much to say really...</li>
            <li>Look all major outlets like Walmart, Target and various major drug outlets...</li>

            <li> I ordered a multi-pack because this is so hard to find in stores lately.</li>
            <li> Husband was disappointed he is looking for the solid green Brut.</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to wash off and it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a vicious cycle.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I buy this brand for my husband every time I get to one of the drug stores that carry it.  Most stores I have gone to do not carry this antiperspirant/deodorant.  I finally got the idea that I should buy these from Amazon just like I do many other things.  It will be so much easier to buy a pack of these versus checking at the drug store for when they got more in.</li>
            <li> Like the smell of this on my husband, but apparently it contains a lot of oil so the package arrived greasy.</li>
            <li> This anti-perspirant is the all-time favorite of mine for my husband to wear.  It works well, and I like the way it smells. I usually buy this online because it&#x27;s often hard to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> This is simply the Best anti-perspirant i have ever used. I work as a bag boy at a local gorcery store, so i&#x27;m always going in and out of the blazing Texas heat. Most anti perspirants just couldn&#x27;t handle it. This is the only one i&#x27;ve ever used that lasts my entire 5-7 shifts. keeps me nice and dry without any irratation. the light fragrance is also a plus. good, clean, masculine scent. I will never switch!</li>
            <li> not much to say really...what you see is what you get. strong name, strong heritage, confidence, long lasting effect, very good value for money</li>
            <li> Bought the wrong kind at first for my husband (antiperspirant and deodorant instead of just deodorant.) Actually, it may have bee on purpose...anywhoo. Once he tried it he decided that he liked it better, even though it is a solid and not a gel. He says it does not ball up in the armpit hair, which is why he didn&#x27;t want to try it in the first place. So, way to go Brut!</li>
            <li> good product have used it for years fast delivery</li>
            <li> This product is not Brut &amp;#34;original scent.&amp;#34; The original scent is represented by brut cologne, splash on, and regular deodorant. This stuff is a white stick that smells like it would be more appropriate for a woman than a man.</li>
            <li> I used to love this stuff. I ordered a multi-pack because this is so hard to find in stores lately. For some reason, my white t-shirts are now getting purple stains in the underarm areas. This never happened before. Checked with my wife, and the laundry detergent has not changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, in general, but I cannot have my t-shirts ruined by purple stains in the armpits! What&#x27;s up with that?</li>
            <li> Only 1 of the 6 were antiperspirant the other 5 were regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this stuff since middle school, and, as it has disappeared from store after store, I&#x27;ve been sweating not being able to find it. Not being able to find it causes more sweat. It&#x27;s a vicious cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was exactly as described. This is the combination antiperspirant AND deodorant. Product arrived in good shape. None were expired. I think the expiration dates were all in 2015 so plenty of time. In the end, the price was about the same as I paid in the store, but at least I don&#x27;t have to go search for it now.</li>
            <li> Could not find my favorite brand of men&#x27;s cologne any where.  Look all major outlets like Walmart, Target and various major drug outlets...nothing I could find about brand BRUT.  Looked in Amazon and found plenty and a very good price.  Now I know where to look for an old but well scented men&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was getting the green original deodorant. The white deodorant leaves marks on my dark clothing. It said classic. I wanted original.  I am sure that it is just as good, but I wanted the green.</li>
            <li> This is my second order so my expectations are pretty much set in concrete.  I really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> This quite simply is the best deodorant on the market. If you find that you&#x27;re allergic to old spice as I am brut should work.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only antiperspirant I&#x27;ve found that works for me. It keeps me from sweating and being stinky haha. The actual pack of 6 is a really good buy, although be prepared that it somewhat melts in heat (i bought these during the summer so I think the heat in the UPS truck got to it) and when I opend the box it was all greasy and nasty inside, but the deodorant was still good and usable. Will be getting this again.</li>
            <li> arrived earlier than expected, and it&#x27;s the right stuff</li>
            <li> Husband was disappointed he is looking for the solid green Brut. wish you would put details on inside coloring.</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to wash off and it irritated my skin. It barely has the typical Brut fragrance (old product?) which I really like.</li>
            <li> Just want I wanted, Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a good price and it&#x27;s listed as \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; and that is what I wanted. But sadly it is not a clear deodorant and the bar is white...and like with all white deodorants it leaves little white chunks in your armpit hair and that is one thing I was not wanting.</li>
            <li> Love this item and it is one of our son&#x27;s favorites. Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Keeps under arms dry for hours a great product!</li>
            <li> Everything came as promised.  I was a little worried about &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; during shipping, but that didn&#x27;t happen.  I really like this deodorant and it is hard to find in stores so I am glad that I can stock up on Amazon.</li>
