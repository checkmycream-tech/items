            <li>like the warm sensation after you apply the lotion to the orange scrub!</li>
            <li>when I am rinsing it off, my hand just kind of slides off of my face - there is no friction!</li>
            <li>, so worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>My skin is glowing and bright.</li>
            <li>Price is good.</li>
            <li>My skin feels sooooo good, and I may convince my husband to try it, too.</li>
            <li>It is so good I made my roommate try it</li>
            <li>Besides that, I have nothing but good results.</li>
            <li>This scrub in jar has the finest grain micro crystals in abundance, so it does a great job exfoliating effectively without scratching the skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as a peel though, just a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li>on which me me hope something good was happening.  </li>
            <li>This is as good as microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li>They both loved it.  </li>
            <li>So very glad I did.</li>
            <li>We are very satisfied with all the products from Philosophy.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>First use felt awesome but continued uses yielded no measurable results.</li>
            <li>they will love it too!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I splurged!  </li>
            <li>Grab one, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>I had to order more a.s.a.p.!</li>
            <li>But with that in mind, I love this peel!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there for acne, and have felt scammed more than once, but that&#x27;s not at all the feeling that this product gave me!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The results are amazing.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous and my skin looks great after using.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels amazing every time I use it, which is about once a week.</li>
            <li>And a nice glow to boot.</li>
            <li>Then when you add the activator, be prepared for it to foam and get warm</li>
            <li>I just wish it stayed warm.  </li>
            <li>Still, it does smell incredible - like fresh oranges.  </li>
            <li>You do feel a warm sensation</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something that is highly effective on exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and this one was the best most effective results!!!!</li>
            <li>THE ACTIVATOR FEELS WARM</li>
            <li>It seems to work well and exfoliates nicely while cleaning.</li>
            <li>my skin feels really nice.</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I found no benefit with it.</li>
            <li>It does feel a bit warm going</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>Use a warm washcloth and wipe away from your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Guys - try it yourself for a great clean face feeling.</li>
            <li>This product is probably the best I&#x27;ve used so far, with the exception of the purity face wash which is the absolute best thing on earth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 13 years old, and have heard all about how wonderful these philosophy products are.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best one I bought.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the Best peel I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great success in reduction of pore size and decrease in oil production on skin...</li>
            <li>and I love the warm foam produced by Step 2.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use it often but does exfoliate as good as can be and makes my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells good, exfoliates, and leaves my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>This brand is fantastic and I loved the results after just one use.  </li>
            <li>Mild pleasant scent adds to the \\&quot;Spa like facial\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and it is easy, quick and makes my skin feel and look great.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very smooth - hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels very smooth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything better than this.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin looked more evenly toned</li>
            <li>(I have light melasma) and felt nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li>my skin texture a lot more even.  </li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I swear my skin has NEVER looked better...</li>
            <li>but so do most peels, microderms, facials, and retinol products.</li>
            <li>I have gone through so many products and brands that promise immediate results.  </li>
            <li>Most things take time to work however from the moment I used this peel</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used a Vitamin C product before, try out something cheaper before buying this--just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>Love the micro granules-My face is always smoother.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m now in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the product and how it warms your skin as you use it.</li>
            <li>Makes my facial skin feel great!!  </li>
            <li>It was just ok....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so smooth and looks nice</li>
            <li>LOVE, this product.  </li>
            <li>I love, love this peel.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>This simple, at-home peel is wonderful to revitalize your skin.  </li>
            <li>Your skin looks healthy, shiny, radiant.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better than when I got facials every 2 months!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>After rubbing for about a minute I put the activating agent on top of it.</li>
            <li>I guess they are better at marketing than putting out a quality product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product hoping for a smoother, more radiant, even toned complexion.</li>
            <li>, either way didn&#x27;t like the price, but love the product.</li>
            <li>This product goes on my all time favorite list.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This product is more of a fancy scrub than it is a peel.</li>
            <li>I bought this in The Care Package set, and it is my favorite of all the products.</li>
            <li>Really love this peel.  </li>
            <li>I shipped it back and got a refund, so that was great!</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Murad, Pro-Active, Neutragena, and many many more.</li>
            <li>I love this peel.</li>
            <li>PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST MICRO PEELS OUT THERE; MY SKIN FELT LIKE AN INFANTS; MY ONLY OBJECTION IS THE PRICE, BUT</li>
            <li>love philosophy products</li>

            <li>I do not recommend many products but recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Even makeup seems to glide on better after using this.  </li>
            <li>And make sure you get it out from around your hairline as well.</li>
            <li>Saw this on a shopping channel and of course search Amazon for a better price and found it.  </li>

            <li>I had received a sample of this Vit C Peel with one of my orders and I really liked it, so I got the full kit.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and have tried a lot of products and this peel smells great and is not hard to use.  </li>
            <li>and what&#x27;s more fun is that people are commenting on how beautiful my skin looks - and when you&#x27;re 50 years old, that&#x27;s a really nice thing to hear.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought two more for my sister-in-law and mother-in-law.  </li>
            <li>This is a great peel if you need to do them frequently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very visible difference - and it lasts for a good couple of days.    </li>
            <li>It is so good and has been so much for my face.</li>
            <li>it is like you scrub years of damage and neglect right off your face!!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a TOTALLY different experience (in the GOOD way!)</li>
            <li>but my skin looked smoother, felt smoother and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is easy to use.</li>

            <li>My makeup goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is glowing and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It minimized my pores (to my surprise) and left my skin smooth and very even looking, like I was wearing the perfect shade of foundation.</li>
            <li>My face is glowing and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product when used twice a week keeps my skin feeling smooth.</li>

            <li>Ok so I have been struggling with pretty severe acne on my face for a while and my dermo has me using RetinA</li>
            <li>Many will help at first, but then end up breaking out from a sensitivity from something</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also feels incredibly clean.</li>
            <li>I needed something to clean out my face</li>
            <li>I no longer use tons of products...just a gentle cleanser, this peel twice a week, and a very light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good job at deep exfoiliation.</li>
            <li>Really gets your face smooth!</li>
            <li>Honestly after using the product until it was completely gone</li>
            <li>My wife loves this kit and I use to buy at the department store but the price was better on Amazon and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I love the microdelivery peel it makes my skin feel so soft after I use it and really exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li>, I am a loyal customer of this product by Philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The activating agent is uber mild.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it leaves the skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, although I tend to be very obsessive with the portioning.</li>
            <li>The product works good to get rid of dry skin and seems to promote cell turn over.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I chose this one, it really is easy and simple.</li>
            <li>after using this my face is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This combination makes my skin feel so smooth, and ready to absorb the serums and moisturizers I need to follow.</li>
            <li>ITS WORTH</li>
            <li>If I am spending that much on a product, I sure wish Philosophy would put the product in a MUCH nicer container.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty normal skin - so I thought, until I tried this and realized how much more nicer my skin could appear.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>THE CRYSTALS SMELL LIKE FRESH ORANGES.  </li>
            <li>I personally do not have that kind of money.</li>
            <li>Just nice to find it at a tiny discount.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>My 21 year old daughter&#x27;s skin has also looked better than ever since I began using it on her skin as well.</li>

            <li>my make up goes on soo much smoother after the treatment, my face feels clean and refreshed, it&#x27;s all a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a fantastic exfoliation for your face, much beyond your daily face wash.</li>
            <li>and it is super gentle.</li>
            <li>However, this one is so easy to use and makes your skin so soft and glow.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>If you do, rub gently the first time!</li>

            <li>This product is ok if you can&#x27;t get a facial somewhere in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;OLAY&#x27;S REGENERIST MICRODERMABRASION TREATMENT which is EXACTLY</li>
            <li>It feels as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>This peel is amazing and the only thing that keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li>Now I use Purity soap on my face daily, and this peel no less than once a month (and often more!)</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected, but the product is great.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for frequent use, easy to use and leaves skin baby smooth.</li>
            <li>My face is super baby soft...</li>
            <li>but super sensitive skin prevented that....till Philosophy.</li>
            <li>I also believe that the peel helps, to a certain degree, with evening skin tone.     </li>
            <li>Make certain to stay away from the eye area.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, this is amazing!  </li>
            <li>With smaller pores and fine lines were not visible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but my skin is very smooth and my pores do not look clogged...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I do think the price is a little prohibitive and have moved on to doing my own lactic acid peels at home.  </li>
            <li>It fades my scars faster, but it is something that is hard for me to gauge, I am the fairest of the fair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like all the products I have gotten from Philosophy, but this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but this product has really made a difference in my skin texture.</li>
            <li>note about cost: this product really stretches because you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>While I like the whole philosophy skin care line, this is the one product that absolutely blew me away.  </li>
            <li>Start gently</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get a feeling for how much you need to rub.  </li>
            <li>Neither one of us have been very regimented in taking care of our skin.  </li>
            <li>My pores have almost totally disappeared and my skin is smooth and creamy looking.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this peel!</li>
            <li>I get REAL microdermabrasions</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING FRESH, RENEWED AND SOFT.</li>
            <li>The peel is a two step process invovling a gentle scrub, and then application of a gel over the scrub.  </li>
            <li>but I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and consider it an absolute must.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it, as well as the fantastic Philosophy  \\&quot;Hope in a Jar\\&quot; cream I apply afterwards.</li>
            <li>You should just gently rub it over your skin.  </li>
            <li>Much softer and tighter.</li>
            <li>I then rinse my face and neck real well, pat</li>
            <li>this stuff made my skin clear up in like a week!!!</li>
            <li>I looked at the bottle more carefully and it was an older logo -</li>
            <li>My only issue is that originally the description stated 4oz , which was supposed to be for each bottle, but i received 2 bottles of 2oz each.  </li>
            <li>However I did see that the original bar code on the box had been covered with a sticker with a different bar code.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to keep your skin smooth and to treat yourself to a mini facial every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle to the skin and leaves it really, really soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is highly rated for a reason and a permanent staple in my cabinent (unfortunatly, I can&#x27;t say that for much).</li>
            <li>I have used it 4 times now with no bad side effects like some have mentioned with break outs and such.  </li>
            <li>I did not see miraculous results instantly like many others, but after the second application my skin became baby soft, after the third noticed fine lines and wrinkles are minimizing.</li>
            <li>After just one treatment of Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery Peel, our skin was left feeling soft and looking flawlessly smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin soft and smooth in a short mount of time and inexpensively.</li>
            <li>I was traveling for a couple of weeks and didn&#x27;t have the chance to use it and felt like I looked much older and just... not as healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(thank you to my Scottish grandmother), to the point that no one makes a shades of foundation that is a perfect match, so needless to say, my scars last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After just one treatment, the skin was left feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a boost for her complexion.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend on this using twice a week.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this peel for at-home use.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this peel/scrub for a once or twice a week exfoliation to help with anti-aging or clogged pores.</li>
            <li>Quick and gentle but left my skin really clear and almost pore-less (around my nose area).</li>
            <li>I am also sensitive in certain areas</li>
            <li>In addition, the last time I used it, I noticed a few days later that the skin on my hands felt great, and then I remembered that I had used the peel.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but leaves my face feeling refreshed and really clean.</li>
            <li>After the first time I used it, my face felt and looked exactly like it did after having the professional $75 salon facial</li>
            <li>However, if you have deep lines, scars, etc... on your face, this peel will not be strong enough for you.</li>
            <li>Anyway, right around the ten week mark i found out about this product.</li>
            <li>I have used other philosophy products and have generally been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Neither temporary or long term there was no benefit other than it smells nice.</li>
            <li>and it feels like new skin.  </li>
            <li>It really has helped clear up my complexion and give me a natural glow.</li>
            <li>Short backstory: I am in my late twenties with fair combination skin that has been damaged by acne and acne scarring.</li>
            <li>I usually use it right before I&#x27;m going somewhere special.  </li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It makes my skin which is normally patchy look completely even.</li>
            <li>same exact results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin was baby soft and had a glow to it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found thus far!</li>
            <li>Maybe this stuff is good enough to use in between office visits but it does not replace what the professionals do if you want to see serious changes.  </li>
            <li>it dry and then apply first the yellow gritty cream taking the tips of my fingers and lightly rubbing it on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of the Philosophy line - make up optional skin where less is more.  </li>
            <li>Using this peel has cleared my face of blackheads and clogged pores, and helped with fine lines and yet hasn&#x27;t dried my skin out or irritated it at all.  </li>
            <li>The clear liquid in bottle seems to run out before I finish the jar though.</li>
            <li>I wanted it to fade faster, so I stumbled across this one day, and everywhere I looked gave it fantastic reviews, so I took a deep breath and spent the money to get it.</li>
            <li>It really does leave my skin feeling soft and looking fresher (younger).</li>
            <li>Also, I wish the bottle of the step 2 was clear.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>And it is so gentle if you use it for only 2 minutes like the directions say.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This renews my skin and the renewal feeling and look last much longer than a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just curious if I&#x27;m old enough to use it, or if it will damage my skin because I&#x27;m younger than most people using this.</li>
            <li>this peel does not irritate my skin and leaves it so soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but the Philosophy counter people tried selling this product to me for YEARS despite my protests.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend likes how soft my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>if u have sensitive skin don&#x27;t even think about it</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin do not use any sort of micro abrasion.</li>
            <li>Soft-  </li>
            <li>It was so soft and plump,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38 years old.</li>
            <li>I am in my 30&#x27;s and have acne prone, oily and yet sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Now, maybe it was a combination of whatever products I used before, but because of my sensitive skin, I will not take any chances.</li>
            <li>I use it twice per week, because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have mature skin  </li>
            <li>Professional peel at home at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft for about 2 days.</li>
            <li>Anything that increases turnover rate of skin cells or gets rid of dead skin will most likely have a &amp;#34;breakout period&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>it was a special with a little apprehension and to my surprise</li>
            <li>Yes it exfoliates and leaves your skin silky soft, but no more then a cheap exfoliate from the store.  </li>
            <li>I saw where someone else had commented that you can get the same exact ingredients from the Olay Regenerist scrub, same scent and all....</li>
            <li>It last for quite a while which helps with the high price</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use 1-2 times a week as in the directions but has instant results!  </li>
            <li>i mean EXACTLY, did i say EXACTLY like the one you are wasting your money on.</li>
            <li>AND It made my skin SO much smoother which was also a plus for makeup application--it makes the makeup look way more natural without having any extra skin cells or weird spots.     </li>
            <li>I had been going to the doctor for a year and getting light chemical peels, but it was pretty expensive.</li>
            <li>I them apply the clear solution which activates the gritty cream.  </li>
            <li>Only because I have sensitive skin and, also, use a retinol gel.</li>
            <li>When I do, my skin looks completely refreshed, similar to when I get a professional facial at the spa.</li>
            <li>To early to review product itself, used only once without any problem though</li>
            <li>I leave it on 5 minutes - the longest time recommended and then, before I  rinse it off, I do one last quick scrub to loosen up any dead skin that the activator may have worked on.      </li>
            <li>It really exfoliated the skin in ways other peels have not.</li>
            <li>The good reviews for this product far outweighed the bad</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product-  using it makes my skin feel Seriously</li>
            <li>I do not have to spend money on expensive facials at the spa, it is like having my own mini facial at home.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth every single cent.</li>
            <li>It promises to get rid of dull skin and that is exactly what it does!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have used other Philosophy products, but this one made my skin break out.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure it really worked before I gave bad info.</li>

            <li> when I am rinsing it off, my hand just kind of slides off of my face - there is no friction!</li>
            <li> , so worth it!!!!</li>

            <li> Besides that, I have nothing but good results.</li>
            <li> This scrub in jar has the finest grain micro crystals in abundance, so it does a great job exfoliating effectively without scratching the skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as a peel though, just a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> on which me me hope something good was happening.  </li>
            <li> This is as good as microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li> They both loved it.  </li>
            <li> So very glad I did.</li>
            <li> We are very satisfied with all the products from Philosophy.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> First use felt awesome but continued uses yielded no measurable results.</li>
            <li> they will love it too!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I splurged!  </li>
            <li> Grab one, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> I had to order more a.s.a.p.!</li>
            <li> But with that in mind, I love this peel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there for acne, and have felt scammed more than once, but that&#x27;s not at all the feeling that this product gave me!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The results are amazing.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous and my skin looks great after using.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels amazing every time I use it, which is about once a week.</li>
            <li> And a nice glow to boot.</li>
            <li> Then when you add the activator, be prepared for it to foam and get warm</li>
            <li> I just wish it stayed warm.  </li>
            <li> Still, it does smell incredible - like fresh oranges.  </li>
            <li> You do feel a warm sensation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that is highly effective on exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and this one was the best most effective results!!!!</li>
            <li> THE ACTIVATOR FEELS WARM</li>
            <li> It seems to work well and exfoliates nicely while cleaning.</li>
            <li> my skin feels really nice.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I found no benefit with it.</li>
            <li> It does feel a bit warm going</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Use a warm washcloth and wipe away from your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Guys - try it yourself for a great clean face feeling.</li>
            <li> This product is probably the best I&#x27;ve used so far, with the exception of the purity face wash which is the absolute best thing on earth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 13 years old, and have heard all about how wonderful these philosophy products are.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best one I bought.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the Best peel I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great success in reduction of pore size and decrease in oil production on skin...</li>
            <li> and I love the warm foam produced by Step 2.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use it often but does exfoliate as good as can be and makes my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It smells good, exfoliates, and leaves my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> This brand is fantastic and I loved the results after just one use.  </li>
            <li> Mild pleasant scent adds to the \\&quot;Spa like facial\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and it is easy, quick and makes my skin feel and look great.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very smooth - hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything better than this.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My skin looked more evenly toned</li>
            <li> (I have light melasma) and felt nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li> my skin texture a lot more even.  </li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I swear my skin has NEVER looked better...</li>
            <li> but so do most peels, microderms, facials, and retinol products.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many products and brands that promise immediate results.  </li>
            <li> Most things take time to work however from the moment I used this peel</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a Vitamin C product before, try out something cheaper before buying this--just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> Love the micro granules-My face is always smoother.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the product and how it warms your skin as you use it.</li>
            <li> Makes my facial skin feel great!!  </li>
            <li> It was just ok....</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so smooth and looks nice</li>
            <li> LOVE, this product.  </li>
            <li> I love, love this peel.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> This simple, at-home peel is wonderful to revitalize your skin.  </li>
            <li> Your skin looks healthy, shiny, radiant.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks better than when I got facials every 2 months!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> After rubbing for about a minute I put the activating agent on top of it.</li>
            <li> I guess they are better at marketing than putting out a quality product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping for a smoother, more radiant, even toned complexion.</li>
            <li> , either way didn&#x27;t like the price, but love the product.</li>
            <li> This product goes on my all time favorite list.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is more of a fancy scrub than it is a peel.</li>
            <li> I bought this in The Care Package set, and it is my favorite of all the products.</li>
            <li> Really love this peel.  </li>
            <li> I shipped it back and got a refund, so that was great!</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Murad, Pro-Active, Neutragena, and many many more.</li>
            <li> I love this peel.</li>
            <li> PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST MICRO PEELS OUT THERE; MY SKIN FELT LIKE AN INFANTS; MY ONLY OBJECTION IS THE PRICE, BUT</li>
            <li> love philosophy products</li>
            <li> I decided to research a peel I could safely do at home, so I began looking through tons of product reviews.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend many products but recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> Even makeup seems to glide on better after using this.  </li>
            <li> And make sure you get it out from around your hairline as well.</li>
            <li> Saw this on a shopping channel and of course search Amazon for a better price and found it.  </li>
            <li> Look forward to using again, and hope for even more brightness, softness, and even skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love this product have used it for years.  </li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> The product smells great, a very natural orange that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of this Vit C Peel with one of my orders and I really liked it, so I got the full kit.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have tried a lot of products and this peel smells great and is not hard to use.  </li>
            <li> and what&#x27;s more fun is that people are commenting on how beautiful my skin looks - and when you&#x27;re 50 years old, that&#x27;s a really nice thing to hear.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought two more for my sister-in-law and mother-in-law.  </li>
            <li> This is a great peel if you need to do them frequently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very visible difference - and it lasts for a good couple of days.    </li>
            <li> It is so good and has been so much for my face.</li>
            <li> it is like you scrub years of damage and neglect right off your face!!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a TOTALLY different experience (in the GOOD way!)</li>
            <li> but my skin looked smoother, felt smoother and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works as described.</li>
            <li> easy to use</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean, polished, and healthy.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> This peel is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It minimized my pores (to my surprise) and left my skin smooth and very even looking, like I was wearing the perfect shade of foundation.</li>
            <li> My face is glowing and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product when used twice a week keeps my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been toying the idea of a chemical peel, but wasn&#x27;t really comfortable with that yet.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and it&#x27;s one of my favs.</li>
            <li> My skin feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt after I use this product.</li>
            <li> Always follow with a good moisturizer to keep your skin looking young.</li>
            <li> you get beautiful packaging along with the great (and expensive) product.</li>
            <li> This treatment is super easy to use and smells yummy.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have been struggling with pretty severe acne on my face for a while and my dermo has me using RetinA</li>
            <li> Many will help at first, but then end up breaking out from a sensitivity from something</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also feels incredibly clean.</li>
            <li> I needed something to clean out my face</li>
            <li> I no longer use tons of products...just a gentle cleanser, this peel twice a week, and a very light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good job at deep exfoiliation.</li>
            <li> Really gets your face smooth!</li>
            <li> Honestly after using the product until it was completely gone</li>
            <li> My wife loves this kit and I use to buy at the department store but the price was better on Amazon and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I love the microdelivery peel it makes my skin feel so soft after I use it and really exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li> , I am a loyal customer of this product by Philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The activating agent is uber mild.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it leaves the skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, although I tend to be very obsessive with the portioning.</li>
            <li> The product works good to get rid of dry skin and seems to promote cell turn over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I chose this one, it really is easy and simple.</li>
            <li> after using this my face is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This combination makes my skin feel so smooth, and ready to absorb the serums and moisturizers I need to follow.</li>
            <li> ITS WORTH</li>
            <li> If I am spending that much on a product, I sure wish Philosophy would put the product in a MUCH nicer container.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty normal skin - so I thought, until I tried this and realized how much more nicer my skin could appear.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> THE CRYSTALS SMELL LIKE FRESH ORANGES.  </li>
            <li> I personally do not have that kind of money.</li>
            <li> Just nice to find it at a tiny discount.</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My 21 year old daughter&#x27;s skin has also looked better than ever since I began using it on her skin as well.</li>
            <li> Great at home peel skin is baby soft the next day.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling very clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Skin is visibly smoother right after use.</li>
            <li> my make up goes on soo much smoother after the treatment, my face feels clean and refreshed, it&#x27;s all a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a fantastic exfoliation for your face, much beyond your daily face wash.</li>
            <li> and it is super gentle.</li>
            <li> However, this one is so easy to use and makes your skin so soft and glow.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> If you do, rub gently the first time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several peel products and this is the best one I&#x27;ve used, really makes skin soft and noticeably smooth, pores tight.  </li>
            <li> I love almost the entire line.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Philosophy products and finally decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> It got rid of all the extra skin cells that were just chillin&#x27; on my face and helped the medicine get in and do its magic.</li>
            <li> One of the first things  </li>
            <li> You want your skin to look clearer, radiant, more even toned instantly?  </li>
            <li> I saw results the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after reading stellar reviews on AmaZon and elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have now reached the age where my skin isn&#x27;t so smooth...</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin silky smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Okay so I suffer from severe acne, which has left my skin damaged from scars.</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed, I first used the peel and rubbed it all over my face.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling extremely smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> At the dermatologist office, your skin can get so hot you need a fan while they are working on you.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth and soft after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I have started to get compliments on my skin again because it really does glow!</li>
            <li> I saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li> Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery Peel (with vitamin c/peptide resurfacing crystals) had consistent rave reviews.</li>
            <li> This product is ok if you can&#x27;t get a facial somewhere in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;OLAY&#x27;S REGENERIST MICRODERMABRASION TREATMENT which is EXACTLY</li>
            <li> It feels as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> This peel is amazing and the only thing that keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li> Now I use Purity soap on my face daily, and this peel no less than once a month (and often more!)</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, but the product is great.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for frequent use, easy to use and leaves skin baby smooth.</li>
            <li> My face is super baby soft...</li>
            <li> but super sensitive skin prevented that....till Philosophy.</li>
            <li> I also believe that the peel helps, to a certain degree, with evening skin tone.     </li>
            <li> Make certain to stay away from the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this is amazing!  </li>
            <li> With smaller pores and fine lines were not visible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but my skin is very smooth and my pores do not look clogged...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I do think the price is a little prohibitive and have moved on to doing my own lactic acid peels at home.  </li>
            <li> It fades my scars faster, but it is something that is hard for me to gauge, I am the fairest of the fair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like all the products I have gotten from Philosophy, but this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but this product has really made a difference in my skin texture.</li>
            <li> note about cost: this product really stretches because you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> While I like the whole philosophy skin care line, this is the one product that absolutely blew me away.  </li>
            <li> Start gently</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get a feeling for how much you need to rub.  </li>
            <li> Neither one of us have been very regimented in taking care of our skin.  </li>
            <li> My pores have almost totally disappeared and my skin is smooth and creamy looking.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this peel!</li>
            <li> I get REAL microdermabrasions</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING FRESH, RENEWED AND SOFT.</li>
            <li> The peel is a two step process invovling a gentle scrub, and then application of a gel over the scrub.  </li>
            <li> but I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and consider it an absolute must.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it, as well as the fantastic Philosophy  \\&quot;Hope in a Jar\\&quot; cream I apply afterwards.</li>
            <li> You should just gently rub it over your skin.  </li>
            <li> Much softer and tighter.</li>
            <li> I then rinse my face and neck real well, pat</li>
            <li> this stuff made my skin clear up in like a week!!!</li>
            <li> I looked at the bottle more carefully and it was an older logo -</li>
            <li> My only issue is that originally the description stated 4oz , which was supposed to be for each bottle, but i received 2 bottles of 2oz each.  </li>
            <li> However I did see that the original bar code on the box had been covered with a sticker with a different bar code.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to keep your skin smooth and to treat yourself to a mini facial every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle to the skin and leaves it really, really soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is highly rated for a reason and a permanent staple in my cabinent (unfortunatly, I can&#x27;t say that for much).</li>
            <li> I have used it 4 times now with no bad side effects like some have mentioned with break outs and such.  </li>
            <li> I did not see miraculous results instantly like many others, but after the second application my skin became baby soft, after the third noticed fine lines and wrinkles are minimizing.</li>
            <li> After just one treatment of Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery Peel, our skin was left feeling soft and looking flawlessly smooth.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin soft and smooth in a short mount of time and inexpensively.</li>
            <li> I was traveling for a couple of weeks and didn&#x27;t have the chance to use it and felt like I looked much older and just... not as healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (thank you to my Scottish grandmother), to the point that no one makes a shades of foundation that is a perfect match, so needless to say, my scars last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After just one treatment, the skin was left feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a boost for her complexion.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend on this using twice a week.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this peel for at-home use.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this peel/scrub for a once or twice a week exfoliation to help with anti-aging or clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Quick and gentle but left my skin really clear and almost pore-less (around my nose area).</li>
            <li> I am also sensitive in certain areas</li>
            <li> In addition, the last time I used it, I noticed a few days later that the skin on my hands felt great, and then I remembered that I had used the peel.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but leaves my face feeling refreshed and really clean.</li>
            <li> After the first time I used it, my face felt and looked exactly like it did after having the professional $75 salon facial</li>
            <li> However, if you have deep lines, scars, etc... on your face, this peel will not be strong enough for you.</li>
            <li> Anyway, right around the ten week mark i found out about this product.</li>
            <li> I have used other philosophy products and have generally been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Neither temporary or long term there was no benefit other than it smells nice.</li>
            <li> and it feels like new skin.  </li>
            <li> It really has helped clear up my complexion and give me a natural glow.</li>
            <li> Short backstory: I am in my late twenties with fair combination skin that has been damaged by acne and acne scarring.</li>
            <li> I usually use it right before I&#x27;m going somewhere special.  </li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It makes my skin which is normally patchy look completely even.</li>
            <li> same exact results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was baby soft and had a glow to it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found thus far!</li>
            <li> Maybe this stuff is good enough to use in between office visits but it does not replace what the professionals do if you want to see serious changes.  </li>
            <li> it dry and then apply first the yellow gritty cream taking the tips of my fingers and lightly rubbing it on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Philosophy line - make up optional skin where less is more.  </li>
            <li> Using this peel has cleared my face of blackheads and clogged pores, and helped with fine lines and yet hasn&#x27;t dried my skin out or irritated it at all.  </li>
            <li> The clear liquid in bottle seems to run out before I finish the jar though.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to fade faster, so I stumbled across this one day, and everywhere I looked gave it fantastic reviews, so I took a deep breath and spent the money to get it.</li>
            <li> It really does leave my skin feeling soft and looking fresher (younger).</li>
            <li> Also, I wish the bottle of the step 2 was clear.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> And it is so gentle if you use it for only 2 minutes like the directions say.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This renews my skin and the renewal feeling and look last much longer than a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just curious if I&#x27;m old enough to use it, or if it will damage my skin because I&#x27;m younger than most people using this.</li>
            <li> this peel does not irritate my skin and leaves it so soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but the Philosophy counter people tried selling this product to me for YEARS despite my protests.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes how soft my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> if u have sensitive skin don&#x27;t even think about it</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin do not use any sort of micro abrasion.</li>
            <li> Soft-  </li>
            <li> It was so soft and plump,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 years old.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and have acne prone, oily and yet sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Now, maybe it was a combination of whatever products I used before, but because of my sensitive skin, I will not take any chances.</li>
            <li> I use it twice per week, because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have mature skin  </li>
            <li> Professional peel at home at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft for about 2 days.</li>
            <li> Anything that increases turnover rate of skin cells or gets rid of dead skin will most likely have a &amp;#34;breakout period&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> it was a special with a little apprehension and to my surprise</li>
            <li> Yes it exfoliates and leaves your skin silky soft, but no more then a cheap exfoliate from the store.  </li>
            <li> I saw where someone else had commented that you can get the same exact ingredients from the Olay Regenerist scrub, same scent and all....</li>
            <li> It last for quite a while which helps with the high price</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use 1-2 times a week as in the directions but has instant results!  </li>
            <li> i mean EXACTLY, did i say EXACTLY like the one you are wasting your money on.</li>
            <li> AND It made my skin SO much smoother which was also a plus for makeup application--it makes the makeup look way more natural without having any extra skin cells or weird spots.     </li>
            <li> I had been going to the doctor for a year and getting light chemical peels, but it was pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I them apply the clear solution which activates the gritty cream.  </li>
            <li> Only because I have sensitive skin and, also, use a retinol gel.</li>
            <li> When I do, my skin looks completely refreshed, similar to when I get a professional facial at the spa.</li>
            <li> To early to review product itself, used only once without any problem though</li>
            <li> I leave it on 5 minutes - the longest time recommended and then, before I  rinse it off, I do one last quick scrub to loosen up any dead skin that the activator may have worked on.      </li>
            <li> It really exfoliated the skin in ways other peels have not.</li>
            <li> The good reviews for this product far outweighed the bad</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product-  using it makes my skin feel Seriously</li>
            <li> I do not have to spend money on expensive facials at the spa, it is like having my own mini facial at home.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth every single cent.</li>
            <li> It promises to get rid of dull skin and that is exactly what it does!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have used other Philosophy products, but this one made my skin break out.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure it really worked before I gave bad info.</li>
            <li> The grains from the first step can be very harsh when trying to remove it.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen any major changes like i expected.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve gotten the same benefits for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> (retin-A makes me peel constantly, and instantly ages me 10 years because of dry peeling skin on my face)</li>
            <li> It really removes all your dead skin and makes your skin alot easier to apply make up on!</li>
            <li> Not sure of any longer term improvements it will make and not sure it&#x27;s better than any other facial scrub</li>
            <li> IT DOES LAST A LONG TIME AND DOES THE JOB;</li>
            <li> I choose to rub for a minute or less ...rinse off and VIOLA your face feels so soft</li>
            <li> If someone has sensitive skin it may be harsh for them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since used other products with Vitamin C and gotten the same result.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews on amazon and was excited to order this expensive product.</li>
            <li> or they make me oily or dry or whatever.</li>
            <li> it dry</li>
            <li> Strangely, my skin also looked slightly lighter (I&#x27;m moderately tan).</li>
            <li> I used to go to a salon to get a facial every two weeks and microdermabrasion once a month to help get rid of the scarring, but moved into a new place this past year and was not able to afford the extra expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not to mention the unbelievable soft feel.  </li>
            <li> I used this stuff one time and it&#x27;s half as red and all the dry scales are gone.</li>
            <li> I use it all they way down to my neck and upper chest.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly oily skin and hoped the product would aid with that, clearer complexion, smaller pores, anything, just an improvement.</li>
            <li> I left it on too long one time and it over dried my skin.</li>
            <li> My I don&#x27;t know if this is just super expensive</li>
            <li> I bought this item because the reviews were so good and am disappointed after using the product  continuously for a few months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product you will immediately notice how soft it makes your skin feel, and once you get it in your routine, you&#x27;ll notice that your face breaks out less and less!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little hard to impress by home peels because I get professional facials regularly.  </li>
            <li> when you put the peel (the stuff in the bottle) on top of the crystals you feel a little warmth nothing crazy....</li>
            <li> The Microdelivery Peel has instant results and I would recommend it to anyone who has had less than expected results with other products.  </li>
            <li> It takes just a few minutes every 3 to 4 weeks and helps to clear up blemishes, even out my T-zone, remove dead and peeling skin, and it leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I can use this at least three times a week.  </li>
            <li> This is one product that I have definitely spent my money on and that I truly believe in.</li>
            <li> NOt what i expected.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this product, but after using it I&#x27;m convinced my money was well spent.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like doing heavy peels with the change of seasons (usually a TCA peel) and I&#x27;ll use this one as needed in between - generally once a week or so</li>
            <li> I use the whole skin care line now and I would recommend this to all the 30 and 40 somethings out there that are tired of spending a fortune on products that promise and dont perform.</li>
            <li> So it is going to exfoliate, but if you already use clarisonic or something it&#x27;s not really needed.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful when you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> I them take a wash cloth on the rough side and rub all of the peel off.  </li>
            <li> And these sizes should last a long time - several months at the very least.     </li>
            <li> My skin did feel smoother and refreshed after use, but it&#x27;s evidently too harsh for my poor skin.</li>
            <li> I also think a little bit will go a long way</li>
            <li> This CAN however be purchased in the 4oz at other sites.</li>
            <li> I went on a face product binge and bought a bunch, including other peels.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a sample with some other products I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I then put on my hope in a jar and that dullness that I was experiencing due to aging has all but diminished...</li>
            <li> I use the clarasonic daily and along with this for past couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I would never buy this again due to the price alone.</li>
            <li> read other reviews that were expecting their faces to peel.</li>
            <li> I usually have some left over.  </li>
            <li> the crystals are a little rough...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and my ONLY complaint?</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
            <li> a total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> My worst nightmare is to run out of one before the other, which might be easy to do if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> If I concentrated I felt a slight warmth.</li>
            <li> it is HALF the price or less (24.99) for both the JAR OF ORANGE CRYSTALS (2.2 oz) and the BOTTLE OF ACTIVATING GEL (2 fl oz).&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed less acne since using the product.</li>
            <li> Tried it once with little results.</li>
            <li> It takes away all those little imperfections in the skin, leaving a glowing complexion.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, after a week in the desert, wearing heavy sunscreen which attracts dirt and grit, my face is really a mess.</li>
            <li> You can just get the [[ASIN:B000BYNEDA Ole Henriksen Three Little Wonders ($95 Value)]]set...</li>
            <li> a shopping network a little cheaper</li>
            <li> will say that the two steps can be a little cumbersome.</li>
            <li> a little so using this product helps to keep me from looking flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want the little crystals in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> My skin looked rough and dull.   </li>
            <li> PLUS it is helping get rid of/lighten those red spots acne leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I use a few times a week</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t recommend anyone else to waste their money on this.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about being messy or dripping-  </li>
            <li> Neither one has broken me out or caused any extra sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I used the olay line, it dried me out, made me peel and caused some sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> At least with some of my other products that I splurge on (Bobbi Brown, Chanel)</li>
            <li> It was impossible to do this, however, since I had no idea how much remained in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a combination exfoliating scrub and peel that takes off all the dull, dead skin that I didn&#x27;t even know I had.  </li>
            <li> I just know that in the past, I&#x27;d have clogged pores and they were visible to the eye.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use Philosophy</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to rub hard to achieve the desired effects, in fact you shouldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Not harsh or painful..</li>
            <li> I leave mine on for at least five minutes.</li>
            <li> hate to spend this much money on something, but I have to say</li>
            <li> Usually out of stock!</li>
            <li> And also the amount is so little, wayyyyy to expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star product, and I am a hard to please customer!</li>
            <li> I had flaky broken out skin for a month after using this nothing</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending hundreds of dollars at the dermatologist to try to repair the damage from my youth and to hold off aging.  </li>
            <li> So frustrating...</li>
            <li> It says to remove with a washcloth, but i found this very difficult and actually quite painful because of how tender my skin was after the peel.</li>
            <li> I found myself trying very hard not to run out of step 2 product before finishing the product from step 1, because then where would I be with a bunch of step 1 product without anything to activate it?!</li>
            <li> I have horrible oily skin and this did do the trick, however I have stopped using this and moved to using Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Irish Moor Mud masks.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had really bad skin damage: Almost immediately after I went off Retin A</li>
            <li> It was so bad it was into muscle and nerve.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and was thoroughly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This product was so horrible</li>
            <li> it was the worst thing I have ever tried!!!</li>
            <li> ALL of them have terrible side effects.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product is awesome !  Leaves your skin feeling very clean and soft.  My only issue is that originally the description stated 4oz , which was supposed to be for each bottle, but i received 2 bottles of 2oz each.  This CAN however be purchased in the 4oz at other sites.</li>
            <li> Had to talk myself into the product because of the price,but after reading all of the reviews decided to give it a try. I will not think twice about reordering it. I did not see miraculous results instantly like many others, but after the second application my skin became baby soft, after the third noticed fine lines and wrinkles are minimizing. Mild pleasant scent adds to the \\&quot;Spa like facial\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Best scrub I&#x27;ve ever tried! Been using it for about 7 years now. Don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything better than this. Leaves your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft. And a nice glow to boot. I use it about once a week to deeply cleanse my skin. It last for quite a while which helps with the high price</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Philosophy line - make up optional skin where less is more.  Basic skin care - it is that simple.  I love almost the entire line.  I use this treatment once a week and it is easy, quick and makes my skin feel and look great.  Awesome product.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like all the products I have gotten from Philosophy, but this is one of my favorites. Works great!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. My skin glows after using this. It&#x27;s also feels incredibly clean. Would highly recommend this.  Price is good.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Philosophy products and finally decided to try this product. Wow!!!! My skin feels sooooo good, and I may convince my husband to try it, too.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin which is normally patchy look completely even. It is so good I made my roommate try it and she immediately went and bought it afterwards.</li>
            <li> Good job at deep exfoiliation. I have had chemical peels. ThIs is not the same. But for what it dose it&#x27;s a great product! Worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Ok so I have been struggling with pretty severe acne on my face for a while and my dermo has me using RetinA and Aczone (a topical antibiotic). Both of which took about 10 weeks to see any sort of improvement-though I still had about 11 pimples on my face at any given time... Anyway, right around the ten week mark i found out about this product. I thought I&#x27;d try it-what could it hurt? OMGOSH this stuff made my skin clear up in like a week!!! And it is so gentle if you use it for only 2 minutes like the directions say. I use it every third or fourth night. It got rid of all the extra skin cells that were just chillin&#x27; on my face and helped the medicine get in and do its magic. Plus, it has all sorts of stuff in it to help &amp; prevent acne. Now I have literally 2 pimples on my face. PLUS it is helping get rid of/lighten those red spots acne leaves behind. AND It made my skin SO much smoother which was also a plus for makeup application--it makes the makeup look way more natural without having any extra skin cells or weird spots.     TRY IT ITS WORTH THE MONEY &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have used other Philosophy products, but this one made my skin break out. My skin did feel smoother and refreshed after use, but it&#x27;s evidently too harsh for my poor skin. That&#x27;s about all I have to say.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Results are immediate.</li>
            <li> Tried it once with little results. Tried it again the following week....same exact results.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was softer for about a day, that&#x27;s all...a total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Great peel! Quick and gentle but left my skin really clear and almost pore-less (around my nose area). My skin looked more evenly toned (I have light melasma) and felt nicely moisturized. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> (From the perspective of combination skin in its mid-twenties) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had really bad skin damage: Almost immediately after I went off Retin A, I went out in the tropical sun, and hiked and swam.  My skin looked rough and dull.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got the microdelivery vitamin c peel packets as part of the makeup optional kit.  I noticec a difference immediately.  My skin looked brighter, and smoother.  The peel did not get rid of blemishes, or red spots, or places of hyperpigmentation (I believe for those problems you need a skin lightener), but made my pores smaller and my skin texture a lot more even.  After the peel, I applied the when hope is not enough serum and help me.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this stuff. This peel is gentle yet effective. It really has helped clear up my complexion and give me a natural glow. I have always had very nice skin but this product has really made a difference in my skin texture. I no longer use tons of products...just a gentle cleanser, this peel twice a week, and a very light moisturizer. Also Amazon has the best price on autoship.....GREAT deal....</li>
            <li> Really good product!  After you use it the skin feels amazing and looks great!  Don&#x27;t forget to wear sunscreen after!</li>
            <li> Skeptical...but decided to give it a try. So very glad I did. Philosophy lived up to their claims. My complexion looks and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time in the dirt and in the sun and the wind, so my face takes a beating.  I already use several Philosophy products. I had received a sample of this Vit C Peel with one of my orders and I really liked it, so I got the full kit.  This product is terrific. It takes away all those little imperfections in the skin, leaving a glowing complexion.  Trust me, after a week in the desert, wearing heavy sunscreen which attracts dirt and grit, my face is really a mess. One of the first things  I do when I get home is to give myself a Philosophy Vit C Peel.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a boost for her complexion.  The results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I am a very big fan of exfoliating - it helps with cell turnover (dullness from aging AND breakout prevention).  I&#x27;ve used mechanical and chemical ones.  I like that this system gives me some of both.  I like to do this twice a week at night... and follow up with some Ole Henriksen Truth serum and night gel.  I swear my skin has NEVER looked better... NEVER.  For a day cream, I use the Ole Henriksen Truth serum and Sheer Transformation.  You can just get the [[ASIN:B000BYNEDA Ole Henriksen Three Little Wonders ($95 Value)]]set... match it with this Philosophy Microdelivery Peel kit and I promise you&#x27;ll be blown away!!</li>
            <li> Definitely saw and felt a difference in my skin after just one use.  Not sure of any longer term improvements it will make and not sure it&#x27;s better than any other facial scrub but my skin looked smoother, felt smoother and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Been using this for months. I wanted to make sure it really worked before I gave bad info. Yes it can make you breakout but so do most peels, microderms, facials, and retinol products. Anything that increases turnover rate of skin cells or gets rid of dead skin will most likely have a &amp;#34;breakout period&amp;#34; . Besides that, I have nothing but good results. I use this once a week or every two weeks. Only because I have sensitive skin and, also, use a retinol gel. I highly recommend this to keep your skin smooth and to treat yourself to a mini facial every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note about cost: this product really stretches because you use it sparingly. It lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I am a skin care junky.  I have gone through so many products and brands that promise immediate results.  Most things take time to work however from the moment I used this peel I saw immediate results.  You want your skin to look clearer, radiant, more even toned instantly?  Not to mention the unbelievable soft feel.  Then this is the product to use.    I am also sensitive in certain areas so I don&#x27;t use the peel in those areas like the folds of my nose.  However this has never made my skin irritaed or red.  I am very impressed by this product.  It promises to get rid of dull skin and that is exactly what it does!</li>
            <li> This is one product that I have definitely spent my money on and that I truly believe in. I too received a smaller sample version that, once it ran out, I had to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product once every couple of weeks. When I do, my skin looks completely refreshed, similar to when I get a professional facial at the spa. In fact, I felt a bigger difference using this product than I did after my last facial!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This renews my skin and the renewal feeling and look last much longer than a day. Another reviewer mentioned that you could use a facial scrub and get the same results, but I disagree. With a regular scrub, the result lasts only a day or so. With the peel, my skin looks great for days, even for a couple weeks. In addition, the last time I used it, I noticed a few days later that the skin on my hands felt great, and then I remembered that I had used the peel. So, no matter where on  your body you try it, you&#x27;ll see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s not that I look spectacularly different. I just know that in the past, I&#x27;d have clogged pores and they were visible to the eye. Now I use Purity soap on my face daily, and this peel no less than once a month (and often more!)...... and I get compliments on my skin often. I don&#x27;t have the BEST of complexions, but I get compliments! To me, that&#x27;s the best part. And I only started getting compliments on my skin when I started using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people tell me my skin glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to spend this much money on something, but I have to say, I am a loyal customer of this product by Philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and my ONLY complaint? If I am spending that much on a product, I sure wish Philosophy would put the product in a MUCH nicer container. The activator bottle is as homely looking as a bottle of glue! At least with some of my other products that I splurge on (Bobbi Brown, Chanel) you get beautiful packaging along with the great (and expensive) product.</li>
            <li> i like the way my skin feels after using it. My skin is glowing and bright. My makeup goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is amazing!  Totally worth the money.  I saw results the first time I used it.  My skin is glowing and smooth.  I had almost giving up on my face till I switched to Philosophy.  Now I am hooked!</li>
            <li> While I like the whole philosophy skin care line, this is the one product that absolutely blew me away.  It&#x27;s a combination exfoliating scrub and peel that takes off all the dull, dead skin that I didn&#x27;t even know I had.  But when I rinsed it off, the smoothness of my skin and the glow just amazed me.  It&#x27;s a very visible difference - and it lasts for a good couple of days.    When you use the exfoliating scrub, just don&#x27;t scrub too enthusiastically.  You&#x27;re supposed to rub it *around* not rub it *in.*  Start gently and you&#x27;ll get a feeling for how much you need to rub.  Then when you add the activator, be prepared for it to foam and get warm - I LOOOOVE that part!  I just wish it stayed warm.  I leave it on 5 minutes - the longest time recommended and then, before I  rinse it off, I do one last quick scrub to loosen up any dead skin that the activator may have worked on.      I do this peel every weekend and it&#x27;s something I look forward to - and what&#x27;s more fun is that people are commenting on how beautiful my skin looks - and when you&#x27;re 50 years old, that&#x27;s a really nice thing to hear.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment. I have oily, sallow skin with clogged pores on my nose. It did nothing for me but make me break out.  I&#x27;ve since used other products with Vitamin C and gotten the same result.  If you&#x27;ve never used a Vitamin C product before, try out something cheaper before buying this--just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> Excellent product does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading stellar reviews on AmaZon and elsewhere. First use felt awesome but continued uses yielded no measurable results. A drugstore exfoliant and a wash cloth achieve the same effect. Still, it does smell incredible - like fresh oranges.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> After reading several testomonials from Philosophy customers, I shelled out to purchase several products from their skin care line for both myself and my husband.  Neither one of us have been very regimented in taking care of our skin.  After just one treatment of Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery Peel, our skin was left feeling soft and looking flawlessly smooth.  It has motivated us to treat our faces daily with Philosophy products to maintain the rosy glow and can&#x27;t-keep-your-hands-off-it softness.  The Microdelivery Peel has instant results and I would recommend it to anyone who has had less than expected results with other products.  We are very satisfied with all the products from Philosophy.  This is one company whose name lives up to all the hype.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 13 years old, and have heard all about how wonderful these philosophy products are. I&#x27;m just curious if I&#x27;m old enough to use it, or if it will damage my skin because I&#x27;m younger than most people using this. I am already used to washing my face every morning and every night (and trust me, I haven&#x27;t forgotten to wash my face since february 19 2005.) Along with scrubing, steaming, and put a mask on once a week, I also get a facial once a month. Hope these products work for me, please reply soon!</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin and you are a newbie to peels...this would be the perfect peel for you.  I have extremely sensitive skin and have now reached the age where my skin isn&#x27;t so smooth...this peel does not irritate my skin and leaves it so soft.  Also...the smell is great!  However, if you have deep lines, scars, etc... on your face, this peel will not be strong enough for you.</li>
            <li> This treatment is super easy to use and smells yummy. I have used other philosophy products and have generally been pleased with the results. This product is probably the best I&#x27;ve used so far, with the exception of the purity face wash which is the absolute best thing on earth. My pores have almost totally disappeared and my skin is smooth and creamy looking. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!  My face is super baby soft...it is like you scrub years of damage and neglect right off your face!!  Not harsh or painful..you will be hooked and let your best friends try it...they will love it too!</li>
            <li> I went on a face product binge and bought a bunch, including other peels.  This is by far the best one I bought.  I am so glad I splurged!  I will be buying again as soon as I&#x27;m low.</li>
            <li> This is the best peel I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and it keeps my skin soft and smooth in a short mount of time and inexpensively.</li>
            <li> Love the micro granules-My face is always smoother.  Use 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s not worth it.  Yes it exfoliates and leaves your skin silky soft, but no more then a cheap exfoliate from the store.  And also the amount is so little, wayyyyy to expensive.</li>
            <li> This is by far the Best peel I have ever used!! My skin feels Amazing after I use it! I highly recommend this peel! It is definitely on my &#x27;Have to Have It&#x27; list!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it leaves the skin feeling clean and smooth. &lt;br /&gt;I like the warm sensation after you apply the lotion to the orange scrub! &lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this and was thoroughly disappointed.  It did not foam or turn white. I looked for an experation date, but found none.  However I did see that the original bar code on the box had been covered with a sticker with a different bar code.  I definitely will not buy from this Amazon provider again.  I went for the low price.  Should have realized there was a reason.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample with some other products I ordered.  It is amazing!  It is gentle enough to use 1-2 times a week as in the directions but has instant results!  My skin was baby soft and had a glow to it!  Even my husband noticed!  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use Philosophy but since I had gotten a sample of this I tried it and I&#x27;m now in love with this product. I have pretty normal skin - so I thought, until I tried this and realized how much more nicer my skin could appear. It minimized my pores (to my surprise) and left my skin smooth and very even looking, like I was wearing the perfect shade of foundation. Strangely, my skin also looked slightly lighter (I&#x27;m moderately tan). I love the texture of the product and how it warms your skin as you use it. This is the best \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; type skin care I&#x27;ve found thus far!</li>
            <li> NOt what i expected. I used it 2-3 times a week. You do feel a warm sensation but I haven&#x27;t seen any major changes like i expected. Will i buy again nahhh. I needed something to clean out my face but i guess my search will continue.</li>
            <li> I used this twice a week until it was gone and it made such a big difference in my skin - it looks years younger.  I was traveling for a couple of weeks and didn&#x27;t have the chance to use it and felt like I looked much older and just... not as healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I do think the price is a little prohibitive and have moved on to doing my own lactic acid peels at home.  So far, I&#x27;ve gotten the same benefits for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  I had my doubts about this product, but after using it I&#x27;m convinced my money was well spent. It&#x27;s very gentle to the skin and leaves it really, really soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but the Philosophy counter people tried selling this product to me for YEARS despite my protests. Finally, I bought it as part of a kit. Every time I use it I break out within 48 hours after! I get REAL microdermabrasions and it&#x27;s a TOTALLY different experience (in the GOOD way!)</li>
            <li> This combination makes my skin feel so smooth, and ready to absorb the serums and moisturizers I need to follow.</li>
            <li> Wife put this in my cart &#x3D; she is happy !</li>
            <li> Makes my facial skin feel great!!  My girlfriend likes how soft my skin feels.  Guys - try it yourself for a great clean face feeling.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on all skin types. I have horrible oily skin and this did do the trick, however I have stopped using this and moved to using Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Irish Moor Mud masks.</li>
            <li> This product was so horrible I&#x27;m telling u if u have sensitive skin don&#x27;t even think about it I had flaky broken out skin for a month after using this nothing helped to make it go away it was the worst thing I have ever tried!!! No no big no no</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that is highly effective on exfoliating. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and this one was the best most effective results!!!! highly recommend on this using twice a week. It really removes all your dead skin and makes your skin alot easier to apply make up on!</li>
            <li> Great product! I do not have sensitive skin though. If you do, rub gently the first time! Really gets your face smooth! Spendy, but a must have! Usually out of stock! Grab one, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> It was just ok.... I don&#x27;t think I am going to get this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent, saw results instantly...thumbs up....I use it once a week.  Stay away from sunlight for a day or two..try it</li>
            <li> A great at home peal. Gentle enough for frequent use, easy to use and leaves skin baby smooth. Love it.</li>
            <li> This will make your skin feel softer and look healthier in only one use! It&#x27;s awesome and I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Bought this from another website ...a shopping network a little cheaper it was a special with a little apprehension and to my surprise this system works wonderfully!!! Im always amazed at how my face feels after I use this ..which is once a week I might add..the crystals are a little rough... just adjust the pressure of your rubbing...when you put the peel (the stuff in the bottle) on top of the crystals you feel a little warmth nothing crazy.... you can leave it on for a couple of minutes or you can rub that in too... I choose to rub for a minute or less ...rinse off and VIOLA your face feels so soft so smooth and looks nice.. I then put on my hope in a jar and that dullness that I was experiencing due to aging has all but diminished...YAY Philosophy!!!</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a sample and I immediately got hooked!  I have never had a product give my face such a &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34;  I am 57 and have been taking care of my skin since I was 20.  I dont look my age, but I only wish I had discovered this product years ago. Hopefully those in their 30&#x27;s will read this and take heed.  I use 2x week and actually look forward to the night(s) I put this on.  LOVE, this product.  My face is glowing and smooth.  I will pay the price for this product, so worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> Product did not come in packaging  as described. Also  no instructions  we&#x27;re included  To early to review product itself, used only once without any problem though</li>
            <li> This scrub in jar has the finest grain micro crystals in abundance, so it does a great job exfoliating effectively without scratching the skin. The clear liquid in bottle seems to run out before I finish the jar though. Maybe I should plan ahead in portions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin is visibly smoother right after use.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, but the product is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great peel if you need to do them frequently. Personally, I like doing heavy peels with the change of seasons (usually a TCA peel) and I&#x27;ll use this one as needed in between - generally once a week or so</li>
            <li> This peel is the bomb!  It really exfoliated the skin in ways other peels have not.</li>
            <li> Wonderful mask! I&#x27;ve had great success in reduction of pore size and decrease in oil production on skin...I&#x27;ve been using this once a week, and have had great results!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Something had happened to my &amp;#34;step 1&amp;#34; and I was frantic. It just disappeared! A little pricey, but worth every single cent. I had to order more a.s.a.p.!</li>
            <li> This is a MUST have for your weekly cleansing. You will feel like the years of grime get scrubbed off and you are left with softer, tighter skin. I use it every 5-7 days faithfully and have now for 3 years.</li>
            <li> I love, love this peel. I am 26 and have suffered from acne prone skin since I was a teenager. I always have hyperpigmentation. I wanted it to fade faster, so I stumbled across this one day, and everywhere I looked gave it fantastic reviews, so I took a deep breath and spent the money to get it. And, my goodness, is it amazing! I use it 1 or 2 times a week. Not once has it made me breakout and it is super gentle. Every time I use it, I am still amazed at how my skin feels...when I am rinsing it off, my hand just kind of slides off of my face - there is no friction! It&#x27;s great. It fades my scars faster, but it is something that is hard for me to gauge, I am the fairest of the fair (thank you to my Scottish grandmother), to the point that no one makes a shades of foundation that is a perfect match, so needless to say, my scars last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin and face feel great after using this, it doesn&#x27;t cause flare-ups of acne, my make up goes on soo much smoother after the treatment, my face feels clean and refreshed, it&#x27;s all a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the two steps can be a little cumbersome. But it&#x27;s worth it. Oh! And I didn&#x27;t even mention the smell, the orange crystals smell like orange frosting to me - it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is highly rated for a reason and a permanent staple in my cabinent (unfortunatly, I can&#x27;t say that for much).</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  THE CRYSTALS SMELL LIKE FRESH ORANGES.  THE ACTIVATOR FEELS WARM ON MY SKIN AND THE PRODUCT LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING FRESH, RENEWED AND SOFT.</li>
            <li> This peel is amazing and the only thing that keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li> I like this product for periodic medium-deep cleaning. It seems to work well and exfoliates nicely while cleaning. I use a few times a week and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but leaves my face feeling refreshed and really clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very smooth - hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on amazon and was excited to order this expensive product. I don&#x27;t like it and I won&#x27;t recommend anyone else to waste their money on this.</li>
            <li> I have become a Philosophy fan after trying several of their products and have recently purchased about all of the skin care line! After using the product you can immediately see and feel the difference! I am totally hooked! My skin is the clearest it has ever been and people comment on how radiant my face looks! I use the whole skin care line now and I would recommend this to all the 30 and 40 somethings out there that are tired of spending a fortune on products that promise and dont perform. I just LOVE Philosophy!!!</li>
            <li> This simple, at-home peel is wonderful to revitalize your skin.  The peel is a two step process invovling a gentle scrub, and then application of a gel over the scrub.  After applying the scrub, then wait only 3 minutes, rinse, and voila! Your skin looks healthy, shiny, radiant.  I also believe that the peel helps, to a certain degree, with evening skin tone.     I use this peel once a week, although I believe it could be used twice a week. And these sizes should last a long time - several months at the very least.     I highly recommend this peel for at-home use.  Just remember, it won&#x27;t have the results that a cosmetic surgeon or dermatologist can provide with physician-grade treatments. But with that in mind, I love this peel!</li>
            <li> I use this on a regular basis. It makes a huge difference with my skin. I use this once a week and the rest of the week I use Philosophy Purity daily with my Clarisonic brush. .. great combination! My skin looks better than when I got facials every 2 months!&lt;br /&gt;You will notice a big improvment in your skin texture and a brightness &amp;glow in your complexion!</li>
            <li> So it is going to exfoliate, but if you already use clarisonic or something it&#x27;s not really needed.  If not then this is going to take away all those layers.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> I tried it!  I loved it!  I will be purchasing more.  Leaves my skin silky smooth and soft.  Smells great and I love the warm foam produced by Step 2.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is easy to use. I also like how my skin feels at the end of the process.</li>
            <li> Have only used a couple of times but I really like the product. I have oily skin and have tried a lot of products and this peel smells great and is not hard to use.  I use the clarasonic daily and along with this for past couple of weeks my skin feels really nice.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love it.  It is pricey but I don&#x27;t use it often but does exfoliate as good as can be and makes my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This product when used twice a week keeps my skin feeling smooth. Always follow with a good moisturizer to keep your skin looking young.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. It really does leave my skin feeling soft and looking fresher (younger). It is easy to use and works as described. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Okay so I suffer from severe acne, which has left my skin damaged from scars. Ive done countless hours of research about micro abrasion. (treatments can be from $200-500 per appointment) I personally do not have that kind of money. So when I found out about this product, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but my skin is very smooth and my pores do not look clogged... Which is unusual for me. I&#x27;ll continue to use it with the hopes of minimizing my scars.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin do not use any sort of micro abrasion. It can actually make your skin worse.&lt;br /&gt;So bang for your buck? So far:D</li>
            <li> I bought this item because the reviews were so good and am disappointed after using the product  continuously for a few months. The product smells great, a very natural orange that isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I used the product as directed, I first used the peel and rubbed it all over my face. It&#x27;s a grainy texture, which I assume is suppose to exfoliate, but did nothing for me. After rubbing for about a minute I put the activating agent on top of it. It turns the grainy orangey peel into a creamy lotion. The activating agent is uber mild. If I concentrated I felt a slight warmth. I started with leaving it on for only 15 minutes but I went longer (up to 45 minutes) after I noticed the lackluster results. I have slightly oily skin and hoped the product would aid with that, clearer complexion, smaller pores, anything, just an improvement. Honestly after using the product until it was completely gone I can honestly say I found no benefit with it. Neither temporary or long term there was no benefit other than it smells nice. I suggest if you want something that works trying something else. This is my second philosophy product and neither have worked. I guess they are better at marketing than putting out a quality product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping for a smoother, more radiant, even toned complexion. I have been toying the idea of a chemical peel, but wasn&#x27;t really comfortable with that yet. The Philosophy Microdelivery Peel is a GREAT exfoliator. It leaves my skin feeling extremely smooth and soft. I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as a peel though, just a good exfoliator. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending hundreds of dollars at the dermatologist to try to repair the damage from my youth and to hold off aging.  The good reviews for this product far outweighed the bad so I thought I would try it.  I have used it 4 times now with no bad side effects like some have mentioned with break outs and such.  It does feel a bit warm going on which me me hope something good was happening.  At the dermatologist office, your skin can get so hot you need a fan while they are working on you. With this product, you get no actual skin peeling afterwards as the stronger products do. Maybe this stuff is good enough to use in between office visits but it does not replace what the professionals do if you want to see serious changes.  I would never buy this again due to the price alone.</li>
            <li> This is as good as microdermabrasion.  I loved it so much I bought two more for my sister-in-law and mother-in-law.  They both loved it.  5 stars!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My I don&#x27;t know if this is just super expensive or I&#x27;m just broke, either way didn&#x27;t like the price, but love the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 5 years weekly on Sundays. It is so good and has been so much for my face. I do not have to spend money on expensive facials at the spa, it is like having my own mini facial at home.</li>
            <li> This product goes on my all time favorite list. It is a great value. It is like doing a micro derm at home. It is fabulous and my skin looks great after using. This is one of the best skin care products on the market!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product-  using it makes my skin feel Seriously Soft-  In the days after I use my Retin-A I can have some severe flaking, especially around my nose.  When I use this, it removes all that flaking and leaves me looking dewey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, I do it in the shower so I don&#x27;t have to worry about being messy or dripping-  I use it all they way down to my neck and upper chest.  I researched a variety of different products before deciding on this one- different Glycolic pads, peels, different masks, scrubs, etc.  I&#x27;m glad I chose this one, it really is easy and simple.</li>
            <li> Since using this product I have been getting an abnormal amount of compliments on my skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product you will immediately notice how soft it makes your skin feel, and once you get it in your routine, you&#x27;ll notice that your face breaks out less and less! I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there for acne, and have felt scammed more than once, but that&#x27;s not at all the feeling that this product gave me!  I have increased confidence now and I believe that I owe it all to Philosophy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and consider it an absolute must. It takes just a few minutes every 3 to 4 weeks and helps to clear up blemishes, even out my T-zone, remove dead and peeling skin, and it leaves my skin glowing. I recommend this to anybody. My only word of caution is to follow the directions closely. I left it on too long one time and it over dried my skin. When I follow the directions this isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several peel products and this is the best one I&#x27;ve used, really makes skin soft and noticeably smooth, pores tight.  If someone has sensitive skin it may be harsh for them.  I have oily skin.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is more of a fancy scrub than it is a peel. I have acne scars and this does nothing for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this in The Care Package set, and it is my favorite of all the products. My skin was changed in one use! It was so soft and plump, even my hands where I had applied the product felt the same way!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are, however, faults to this product. It says to remove with a washcloth, but i found this very difficult and actually quite painful because of how tender my skin was after the peel. The grains from the first step can be very harsh when trying to remove it. Also, I wish the bottle of the step 2 was clear. I found myself trying very hard not to run out of step 2 product before finishing the product from step 1, because then where would I be with a bunch of step 1 product without anything to activate it?! It was impossible to do this, however, since I had no idea how much remained in the bottle. Also, for some reason, when I applied the second product on it  never foamed up like they said it would.</li>
            <li> Really love this peel.  My skin felt smooth and soft after the first use.  I&#x27;m a little hard to impress by home peels because I get professional facials regularly.  However, this one is so easy to use and makes your skin so soft and glow.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I had a sample from Sephora, which is what caused me to want to purchase this on Amazon because it was cheaper.  However, I used it twice and it wasn&#x27;t foaming properly.  I looked at the bottle more carefully and it was an older logo - I shipped it back and got a refund, so that was great!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this kit and I use to buy at the department store but the price was better on Amazon and the shipping was fast. Philosophy products are amazing and we will definately be buying again when it runs out!</li>
            <li> Short backstory: I am in my late twenties with fair combination skin that has been damaged by acne and acne scarring. I used to go to a salon to get a facial every two weeks and microdermabrasion once a month to help get rid of the scarring, but moved into a new place this past year and was not able to afford the extra expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked for this peel for Christmas, hoping it would continue what the salon started, in helping me get rid of the scars and marks on my cheeks and chin. After the first time I used it, my face felt and looked exactly like it did after having the professional $75 salon facial and I was thrilled. I have started to get compliments on my skin again because it really does glow! I am so happy that I was given this and plan on buying it for myself once what I have runs out. It is the best at home peel I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I saw results after the first use. I&#x27;m 38 years old. My skin looks and feels very smooth. With smaller pores and fine lines were not visible.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years and I love it.  Nothing gets skin smoother than this microdelivery peel without burning or stinging.  Another one of the Philosophy products I cannot imagine being without.  Just nice to find it at a tiny discount.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend it. After just one treatment, the skin was left feeling soft and smooth. It has instant results. I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. It is the best Micro-peel I have ever used. YOU WILL SEE RESULTS ASAP. Well worth every penny[[ASIN:B00068CG3U Philosophy Microdelivery Dual-Phase Peel]]</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 plus years.  It&#x27;s the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever tried.  My girls like it also.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and have acne prone, oily and yet sensitive skin. I have tried everything under the sun to help, including pills and creams from the dermatologist. ALL of them have terrible side effects. (retin-A makes me peel constantly, and instantly ages me 10 years because of dry peeling skin on my face) I have tried Murad, Pro-Active, Neutragena, and many many more. Many will help at first, but then end up breaking out from a sensitivity from something or they make me oily or dry or whatever. So frustrating... especially because I want to focus on anti-aging as well an anti-acne...but super sensitive skin prevented that....till Philosophy. I started with their cleanser and a sample of the moisturizer...after a week I decided to buy the moisturizer...but still needed something for exfoliation. I love this peel. I also use the microdelivery face wash once a day. Neither one has broken me out or caused any extra sensitivity. Using this peel has cleared my face of blackheads and clogged pores, and helped with fine lines and yet hasn&#x27;t dried my skin out or irritated it at all.  I saw where someone else had commented that you can get the same exact ingredients from the Olay Regenerist scrub, same scent and all....I would agree to an extent...I used the olay line, it dried me out, made me peel and caused some sensitivity issues. Now, maybe it was a combination of whatever products I used before, but because of my sensitive skin, I will not take any chances. This works for me, has great results and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or clog my pores, so I am sold! I highly recommend this peel/scrub for a once or twice a week exfoliation to help with anti-aging or clogged pores.</li>
            <li> PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST MICRO PEELS OUT THERE; MY SKIN FELT LIKE AN INFANTS; MY ONLY OBJECTION IS THE PRICE, BUT IT DOES LAST A LONG TIME AND DOES THE JOB;</li>
            <li> love philosophy products</li>
            <li> I had been going to the doctor for a year and getting light chemical peels, but it was pretty expensive. I decided to research a peel I could safely do at home, so I began looking through tons of product reviews. Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery Peel (with vitamin c/peptide resurfacing crystals) had consistent rave reviews. I figured i could get multiple at home peels with it for the price of one in office peel. I LOVE IT! My skin looks and feels amazing every time I use it, which is about once a week. My 21 year old daughter&#x27;s skin has also looked better than ever since I began using it on her skin as well. This is a 5 star product, and I am a hard to please customer! LOL. I definitely recommend it, as well as the fantastic Philosophy  \\&quot;Hope in a Jar\\&quot; cream I apply afterwards.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and it&#x27;s one of my favs. It smells good, exfoliates, and leaves my skin smooth. I use a mandelic acid that makes my skin peel a little so using this product helps to keep me from looking flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews that were expecting their faces to peel. It&#x27;s more of a fantastic exfoliation for your face, much beyond your daily face wash. I use it twice per week, because I have sensitive skin and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have mature skin  and this product makes my skin look moist , my  pores look smaller, and  gives it a glow. I do not recommend many products but recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and always producing wonderful results. My skin feels clean and fresh! Did not cause any pain or discomfort. Easy to use, although I tend to be very obsessive with the portioning. My worst nightmare is to run out of one before the other, which might be easy to do if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so incredible!!!! I got bit by a spider on my chin in June of 2012 that is the size of 2 quarters that im still recovering from. It was so bad it was into muscle and nerve. I used this stuff one time and it&#x27;s half as red and all the dry scales are gone. My entire face feels like it was when I was 10 so buttery smoothe I can&#x27;t believe it. I will never be without my microdelivey peel ever again.</li>
            <li> My fav philosophy product ever! I&#x27;ve purchased this for myself and even of my mum. She loves it too! Leaves my skin clean, polished, and healthy.</li>
            <li> Professional peel at home at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel.  It&#x27;s feels like silk after I use it.  It also smells wonderful.  You don&#x27;t have to rub hard to achieve the desired effects, in fact you shouldn&#x27;t.  You should just gently rub it over your skin.  And although you will think that the bottle they give you to put on after the rub will not last, it will.  I usually have some left over.  After using it my skin just glows.  I usually use it right before I&#x27;m going somewhere special.  Even makeup seems to glide on better after using this.  Just be careful when you rinse it off.  Use a warm washcloth and wipe away from your eyes.  You don&#x27;t want the little crystals in your eyes.  They hurt.  And make sure you get it out from around your hairline as well.</li>
            <li> Saw this on a shopping channel and of course search Amazon for a better price and found it.  This brand is fantastic and I loved the results after just one use.  Look forward to using again, and hope for even more brightness, softness, and even skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love this product have used it for years.  I can see a difference in my skin after using it.  Much softer and tighter.</li>
            <li> it so very nice. after using this my face is very smooth and soft. doesn&#x27;t have any problem.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great at home peel skin is baby soft the next day.</li>
            <li> This product is ok if you can&#x27;t get a facial somewhere in a hurry.  It makes my skin feel soft for about 2 days.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be FOOLED by all the hype. if you are buying this product for the amount of money they want to poke you for, STOP!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;OLAY&#x27;S REGENERIST MICRODERMABRASION TREATMENT which is EXACTLY i mean EXACTLY, did i say EXACTLY like the one you are wasting your money on. it is HALF the price or less (24.99) for both the JAR OF ORANGE CRYSTALS (2.2 oz) and the BOTTLE OF ACTIVATING GEL (2 fl oz).&lt;br /&gt;buy it for yourself and COMPARE THE INGREDIENTS and plus it smells the same as philosophy&#x27;s there is NO DIFFERENCE IN PRODUCTS, just the PRICE.....edward donovan cruz</li>
            <li> I love the microdelivery peel it makes my skin feel so soft after I use it and really exfoliates nicely. I also think a little bit will go a long way and I also ordered the microdelivery peel pads to use between actual peels. The product works good to get rid of dry skin and seems to promote cell turn over. I&#x27;ve also noticed less acne since using the product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt after I use this product. Follow this up with some Estée Lauder time zone  and your skin will look great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for eight or so years now.  After cleaning my skin with Purity Made Simple, I rince my face, pat it dry and then apply first the yellow gritty cream taking the tips of my fingers and lightly rubbing it on my face and neck.  Make certain to stay away from the eye area.  I them apply the clear solution which activates the gritty cream.  I leave mine on for at least five minutes. I them take a wash cloth on the rough side and rub all of the peel off.  I then rinse my face and neck real well, pat it dry and it feels like new skin.  It feels as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I them apply my moisture cream.  I have sensitive skin, and I can use this at least three times a week.  I love it....would recommend it to everyone.  Linda A.</li>
