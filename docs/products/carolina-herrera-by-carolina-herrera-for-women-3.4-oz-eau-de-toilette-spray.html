            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Jasmine in it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great experience in every way.</li>
            <li>My favorite since it came out in 1990 or 91, stays on forever even through washes.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance as I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 16 years now.</li>
            <li>and she love the smell  and how it came packed.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite for 16 years now.</li>
            <li>My mom loves this fragrance and I am glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when UPS delivered my package today!</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li>I really love the way this smell s on my skin not too strong and does nt burn your nose like other</li>
            <li>When I first selected it, it said &amp;#34;Eau the Perfume&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I learned my lesson, I will be more thorough from in the future.</li>
            <li>mas no inverno gosto de perfume floral adocicado como o Hot Couture (givency).</li>
            <li>I have been using Carolina Herrera for several years and continue to be pleased with the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Very nice subtle scent of jasmine.</li>
            <li>Eau de toilette dissipates much faster; Eau de Parfum stays on your skin much longer.</li>
            <li>going through the return process, I contacted Amazon Chat, and the lady was very helpful -</li>
            <li>I have received more compliments from strangers, both men and women, than on any other fragrance.</li>
            <li>I was ordering so many things that I did not noticed that in the last page the title did not red &amp;#34;Eau the Perfume&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I make this a gift for my mom since this is the fragrance she use to wear, after a couple of months of daily use she is happy because the essence last all day, needs to apply smalls amount of the product so this bottle will last for her a long time.</li>
            <li>The delivery was delayed by the severe weather in early February (not Amazon&#x27;s fault) otherwise it would have bee a stress-free purchase.</li>
            <li>same as for gift #1; they were ordered together and really should count as one evaluation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not original, doesn&#x27;t smell and last like the original!</li>
            <li>I still occasionally try something new</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Product watered down. ..weak! Compared it dept. purchase, font and location of type in the same location as dept store product! I&#x27;ve used this product for 10+ yrs</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite scent. I love the scent of Jasmine in it. Every time I wear it I get compliments. It is my go-to scent all the time.</li>
            <li> Purchased this perfume as a gift for a family member. Product arrived quickly and as advertised. Price on Amazon could not be beat. Thanks for a great experience in every way.</li>
            <li> exelente vendedor lo recomiendo exelente producto muy puntual todo llego en buen estado segun lo acordado comprenle con confianza 100% recomendable</li>
            <li> The product title was deceiving.  When I first selected it, it said &amp;#34;Eau the Perfume&amp;#34; (which is the product I have bought from amazon in several occasions). I was ordering so many things that I did not noticed that in the last page the title did not red &amp;#34;Eau the Perfume&amp;#34;. (it did not specified anything). I received &amp;#34;Eau de Cologne&amp;#34;, which is a cheaper product. I learned my lesson, I will be more thorough from in the future.</li>
            <li> I prefer eau de parfum because is strong.&lt;br /&gt;The smell stay on the skin until the other day.&lt;br /&gt;In portuguese: eu prefiro eau de parfum porque gosto de perfumes marcantes e que permane√ßam na pele at&amp;eacute; o dia seguinte.Para mim &amp;eacute; um perfume ideal para se usar no verao, pois embora seja marcante e um pouco sensual, &amp;eacute; bem floral e tamb&amp;eacute;m serve para o dia e a noite. Tem pessoas que usam no inverno...mas no inverno gosto de perfume floral adocicado como o Hot Couture (givency).</li>
            <li> I have been using Carolina Herrera for several years and continue to be pleased with the fragrance.  I still occasionally try something new but I always return to Carolina Herrera.  I have received more compliments from strangers, both men and women, than on any other fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when UPS delivered my package today! I thought $47.14 was a great price for a CAROLINA HERRERA For Women By CAROLINA HERRERA Eau de Parfum Spray in 3.4 oz size, as posted in Amazon. I just opened the box and it is NOT Eau de PARFUM, but Eau de TOILETTE! Geesh! I was so disappointed!!! Eau de toilette dissipates much faster; Eau de Parfum stays on your skin much longer. Needless to say, I must return :(&lt;br /&gt;In going through the return process, I contacted Amazon Chat, and the lady was very helpful - for which I rate Amazon 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> My favorite since it came out in 1990 or 91, stays on forever even through washes.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance as I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 16 years now.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this smell s on my skin not too strong and does nt burn your nose like other perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I will order this again for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product as well , good price too.</li>
