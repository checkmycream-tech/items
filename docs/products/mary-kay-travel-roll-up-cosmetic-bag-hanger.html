            <li>They all also fit quite nicely!</li>
            <li>so it will do there, but I&#x27;d still would have liked to be able to hang it in my bedroom closet.  </li>
            <li>This is the largest hanging bag I could find with four clear compartments, a hanging hook, and that is still portable, so I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this case.</li>
            <li>Love the way it folds up into a cube and hangs from a door/hook/towel rack.</li>
            <li>There are better products out there.</li>
            <li>It is so handy to hang in hotel rooms, and folds to fit in a suitcase.  </li>
            <li>Thats how much I love it.</li>
            <li>Its sturdy and the colors are so cute together.</li>
            <li>This is the closest I&#x27;ve been able to come to the product that I had order on</li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law was very happy with this present.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I love that each bag is removable.</li>
            <li>the pouches are removable and I love the hanging part.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this bag.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love that the bags detach.</li>
            <li>I have had each bag hanging for more than a month stuffed to the gills, and then I rip off one bag every morning with that days essentials, and replace it when i get home.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this bag.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase for friends! :-)</li>
            <li>All fit nicely in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was better then ordering it through marykay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li>I was so very excited to receive this bag to take on my business trips.</li>
            <li>It came in great time and brand new shape :)</li>
            <li>I let my hubby use one zip pouch and was able to fit all my stuff in the rest of the pouches.</li>
            <li>I had all sorts of face and eye brushes and they were all able to fit.</li>
            <li>I still love it and do not regret purchasing it because it will be a great makeup organizer when I get back home.</li>
            <li>Easy to pack once you  take it apart reassemble when you arrive at your destination.</li>
            <li>so I purchased the item for easy traveling.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick as well.</li>
            <li>This is the classic Mary Kay roll up I have always loved.  </li>
            <li>it rolls up nice and also the hangar is pretty sturdily reinforced so I am not worried about it ripping.</li>
            <li>I have blown through a LOT of travel bags in my day and this one is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and to pack up and go.</li>
            <li>Well this one will fit all of your thongs and I organized mine into face eyes lips and brushes.</li>
            <li>It did fit quite a lot.</li>
            <li>great thing for those who travels a lot, not necessary to carry all the things though, which is also convenient</li>
            <li>I do feel like it is very versatile and can be used for many things, but I am hoping that someone improves on this concept and creates a more durable version of it.</li>
            <li>It is very nice, but much larger than I thought.</li>
            <li>While packing for my first trip and before I even put an item in the bag, the top zipper broke.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited when I received it, and I immediately placed all of my make up and toiletries into the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First pouch-All &#x27;eye&#x27; items.</li>
            <li>face wash, my full size Clinique moisture cream in the pump all in 2 pouches.</li>
            <li>Came in the mail super quick too</li>
            <li>again for the quick shipping too</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like it holds much, but it DOES hold FULL SIZED bottles of cosmetic items EASILY.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK - you can&#x27;t fit much in the plastic containers or you can&#x27;t really roll up the bag.  </li>
            <li>Also, super cute pink :)</li>
            <li>It is awesomely rare that you receive things just like they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit ALL of the items that I would potentially use for day or night make up.</li>
            <li>I had a weekend trip and stuffed it with EVERYTHING, and it still rolled right up and transported with ease.</li>
            <li>When I first got the bag it was very practical everything fit inside</li>
            <li>I liked the first bag so well, I immediately purchased a second one.  </li>
            <li>I put all of my everyday face products into travel friendly containers and I was able to fit them into here.</li>
            <li>It has a hanger to hang on the bathroom door unrolled for easy access to clear zippered pouches that will detach if you want to remove one separate from the others.</li>
            <li>space saver and works very well and is super compact</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Love that the individual cases inside come off with the velcro.  </li>
            <li>Just exactly as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>This bag is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t have to empty it after every use in order for me to have my products handy.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied!</li>
            <li>I had bought one of these over 10 years ago from a Mary Kay rep, and used it daily for cosmetic/face care needs plus more.  </li>
            <li>Now I am using this case mostly, but I still have three extra inside compartments with working zippers, so I store some items in those.  </li>
            <li>This is so much better than carrying a bunch of smaller bags.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as pretty as some (though it is attractive) with the solid black exterior, but some might say it makes it more professional looking and not so froo-froo with flowers and zebra prints.</li>
            <li>I loved it until I actually had to travel with to a wedding and left the bag in my car.</li>
            <li>though it was quite snug, the length was just enough to fit this palette right</li>
            <li>Very convinent organizing product for getting pretty</li>
            <li>Not only does it hold all of my items, but I can hang it in the bathroom by it&#x27;s hanger(Yes, it comes with a hanger to hang for easy access).</li>
            <li>It stays clean and is easy to wipe down.</li>
            <li>Also, I paid much a much lower price than what they charge on Mary Kay.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this bag as a gift because I like mine so much.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I have solo much makeup</li>
            <li>Really keeps things organized on the road.</li>
            <li>Then I am using the makeup pouch as my every day makeup bag, and keeping the others all ready to go.  </li>
            <li>this made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>Recommended to all ladies who love pink and traveling.</li>
            <li>It will fit your regular sized bottles(not</li>
            <li>I always have a bag packed and ready to go in case</li>
            <li>case I&#x27;m getting ready for my day shift while at the hospital.</li>
            <li>This helps me be organized and ready.</li>
            <li>It is all very well-made.</li>
            <li>Holds so much stuff.</li>
            <li>My Naked 1 palette also fit in there,</li>
            <li>It only holds its square shape if the make up pouches are completely filled with your contents.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much room but holds a lot of stuff.</li>
            <li>Really convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like how it rolls up into a portable square with a handle.  </li>
            <li>You wont regret it and its so cute with the pink inside!</li>
            <li>It was a good attempt at trying to organize different products, but the bag just doesn&#x27;t roll up properly with regular size items in the plastic containers.</li>
            <li>I will mainly be hanging it from a hook in my RV</li>
            <li>There was more than enough room for you needs the only thing I would say the heavier stuff you put in the pouches do start to get loosened from the Velcro</li>
            <li>I would definitely get some more and throw my scattered multiple make up bags away!!!</li>
            <li>The price was high...</li>
            <li>absolutely love how the little bags are removable.</li>
            <li>I Just Add a few more thing and roll it up and go.</li>
            <li>The pouches in length can fit a regular size shaving can and the width you can fit a short shaving can long ways.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to leave my travel items packed in the hanging bag between trips, add a few things, pack the bag in my suitcase, pull it out and hang it up for use at my destination.  </li>
            <li>I am still keeping my eyes open for a new way to travel with my make up and toiletries, but if you are looking for something that holds a lot of stuff and rolls up into a little square, then you just might fall in love with this bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 4 clear, removable bags and a hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The items are visible through the clear pouches.  </li>
            <li>I really like and and would give it five stars if the hook to hang it were bigger.  </li>
            <li>When doing my research, I came across this bag multiple times, and it looked quite promising</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not sure the velcro will hold up to being taken off and on many times.</li>
            <li>Overall each separate case does feel secure and snug, but I do feel like the black portion that holds these pouches together is quite flimsy.</li>
            <li>it made it much easier for me to have just one bag to put all the products I need when traveling for a short period of time where i don&#x27;t have to carry my entire make up set.</li>
            <li>Originally I ordered it to lug my toiletries back &amp; forth to the showers (I am currently deployed in Afghanistan), but the removable compartments are not large enough to store full-size toiletry items.</li>
            <li>How did I live without one of these for so long?</li>
            <li>That old case is still in fine shape, but one of the compartment zippers had broken.  </li>
            <li>face creams about 4 large Clinique jars and 3 small jars and my Lancôme normal size</li>
            <li>(and I mean a smidge) roomier (of course a few less cosmetics might be advised for me), it is convenient, easy to use, and has some unique features.</li>
            <li>It fits a TON of stuff, but I use it everyday and put ALL of my stuff in it (hangs on the back of my bathroom door), so a little bit of extra space would have been better for me, but this works.</li>
            <li>Unlike other roll up bags, this actually has lots of space and each zipper is big enough to put relatively large items such as foundation bottles.</li>

            <li> I was extremely excited when I received it, and I immediately placed all of my make up and toiletries into the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First pouch-All &#x27;eye&#x27; items.</li>
            <li> face wash, my full size Clinique moisture cream in the pump all in 2 pouches.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail super quick too</li>
            <li> again for the quick shipping too</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like it holds much, but it DOES hold FULL SIZED bottles of cosmetic items EASILY.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK - you can&#x27;t fit much in the plastic containers or you can&#x27;t really roll up the bag.  </li>
            <li> Also, super cute pink :)</li>
            <li> It is awesomely rare that you receive things just like they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I was able to fit ALL of the items that I would potentially use for day or night make up.</li>
            <li> I had a weekend trip and stuffed it with EVERYTHING, and it still rolled right up and transported with ease.</li>
            <li> When I first got the bag it was very practical everything fit inside</li>
            <li> I liked the first bag so well, I immediately purchased a second one.  </li>
            <li> I put all of my everyday face products into travel friendly containers and I was able to fit them into here.</li>
            <li> It has a hanger to hang on the bathroom door unrolled for easy access to clear zippered pouches that will detach if you want to remove one separate from the others.</li>
            <li> space saver and works very well and is super compact</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love that the individual cases inside come off with the velcro.  </li>
            <li> Just exactly as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> This bag is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t have to empty it after every use in order for me to have my products handy.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied!</li>
            <li> I had bought one of these over 10 years ago from a Mary Kay rep, and used it daily for cosmetic/face care needs plus more.  </li>
            <li> Now I am using this case mostly, but I still have three extra inside compartments with working zippers, so I store some items in those.  </li>
            <li> This is so much better than carrying a bunch of smaller bags.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as pretty as some (though it is attractive) with the solid black exterior, but some might say it makes it more professional looking and not so froo-froo with flowers and zebra prints.</li>
            <li> I loved it until I actually had to travel with to a wedding and left the bag in my car.</li>
            <li> though it was quite snug, the length was just enough to fit this palette right</li>
            <li> Very convinent organizing product for getting pretty</li>
            <li> Not only does it hold all of my items, but I can hang it in the bathroom by it&#x27;s hanger(Yes, it comes with a hanger to hang for easy access).</li>
            <li> It stays clean and is easy to wipe down.</li>
            <li> Also, I paid much a much lower price than what they charge on Mary Kay.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this bag as a gift because I like mine so much.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I have solo much makeup</li>
            <li> Really keeps things organized on the road.</li>
            <li> Then I am using the makeup pouch as my every day makeup bag, and keeping the others all ready to go.  </li>
            <li> this made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Recommended to all ladies who love pink and traveling.</li>
            <li> It will fit your regular sized bottles(not</li>
            <li> I always have a bag packed and ready to go in case</li>
            <li> case I&#x27;m getting ready for my day shift while at the hospital.</li>
            <li> This helps me be organized and ready.</li>
            <li> It is all very well-made.</li>
            <li> Holds so much stuff.</li>
            <li> My Naked 1 palette also fit in there,</li>
            <li> It only holds its square shape if the make up pouches are completely filled with your contents.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much room but holds a lot of stuff.</li>
            <li> Really convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like how it rolls up into a portable square with a handle.  </li>
            <li> You wont regret it and its so cute with the pink inside!</li>
            <li> It was a good attempt at trying to organize different products, but the bag just doesn&#x27;t roll up properly with regular size items in the plastic containers.</li>
            <li> I will mainly be hanging it from a hook in my RV</li>
            <li> There was more than enough room for you needs the only thing I would say the heavier stuff you put in the pouches do start to get loosened from the Velcro</li>
            <li> I would definitely get some more and throw my scattered multiple make up bags away!!!</li>
            <li> The price was high...</li>
            <li> absolutely love how the little bags are removable.</li>
            <li> I Just Add a few more thing and roll it up and go.</li>
            <li> The pouches in length can fit a regular size shaving can and the width you can fit a short shaving can long ways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to leave my travel items packed in the hanging bag between trips, add a few things, pack the bag in my suitcase, pull it out and hang it up for use at my destination.  </li>
            <li> I am still keeping my eyes open for a new way to travel with my make up and toiletries, but if you are looking for something that holds a lot of stuff and rolls up into a little square, then you just might fall in love with this bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 4 clear, removable bags and a hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The items are visible through the clear pouches.  </li>
            <li> I really like and and would give it five stars if the hook to hang it were bigger.  </li>
            <li> When doing my research, I came across this bag multiple times, and it looked quite promising</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not sure the velcro will hold up to being taken off and on many times.</li>
            <li> Overall each separate case does feel secure and snug, but I do feel like the black portion that holds these pouches together is quite flimsy.</li>
            <li> it made it much easier for me to have just one bag to put all the products I need when traveling for a short period of time where i don&#x27;t have to carry my entire make up set.</li>
            <li> Originally I ordered it to lug my toiletries back &amp; forth to the showers (I am currently deployed in Afghanistan), but the removable compartments are not large enough to store full-size toiletry items.</li>
            <li> How did I live without one of these for so long?</li>
            <li> That old case is still in fine shape, but one of the compartment zippers had broken.  </li>
            <li> face creams about 4 large Clinique jars and 3 small jars and my Lancôme normal size</li>
            <li> (and I mean a smidge) roomier (of course a few less cosmetics might be advised for me), it is convenient, easy to use, and has some unique features.</li>
            <li> It fits a TON of stuff, but I use it everyday and put ALL of my stuff in it (hangs on the back of my bathroom door), so a little bit of extra space would have been better for me, but this works.</li>
            <li> Unlike other roll up bags, this actually has lots of space and each zipper is big enough to put relatively large items such as foundation bottles.</li>
            <li> I would like the pockets just to be a LITTLE bigger, but other than that, I absolutely adore it!</li>
            <li> I have spent the night for a lot of short trips away from home since purchasing this last year.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to keep the stuff I use very often in just one place</li>
            <li> It takes me forever to pack all the incidentals when I travel long distance or just an over night trip.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very cheap and fake looking!</li>
            <li> The zippers on a few on the compartments were very hard to close but after rubbing a candle on the teeth part they are fine.</li>
            <li> It does not go over the bar in my closet like two other different brands of this type of thing that I have.  </li>
            <li> I only wish the company I ordered from would have packed it flat in a little larger mailing bag rather than fold it in half, bending/creasing it.  </li>
            <li> I can get all of my cosmetics in the case, but it will take me a little time to get used to it, as it is larger than I thought it would be,</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I wanted but was everything it was described as.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think Mary Kay sells the pink anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lots of other types of travel cases</li>
            <li> I put all my incidentals and toiletries in the sections as I&#x27;d need to use them 1 pouch for shower (shampoo/conditioner/face cleanser/razer), 1 pouch for makeup (and lash curler, tweezers, etc), 1 pouch for after shower: qtips, toothpaste/brush/etc), 1 pouch for other incidentals.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to others who are in need of something to organize their cosmetics and other small items.</li>
            <li> I was really expecting the bags on this to be small or awkward, and to not be able to truly hang stuffed with makeup, and I am so relieved to be proved wrong.</li>
            <li> Slightly overpriced, but the product delivers.  </li>
            <li> Rolls tight and is NOT BULKY.  </li>
            <li> and I find myself making small trips quite often and going home about every other weekend.</li>
            <li> If I fill all pockets and roll it up, it does not fit in my travel bag..</li>
            <li> &#x27;s a few years ago.</li>
            <li> (My everyday make up routine is not that extensive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not worth what Mary Kay is charging, at least I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> No more messy counters.</li>
            <li> My first one was stolen :(</li>
            <li> Though I did like this bag, I did not LOVE it like I thought I would.</li>
            <li> Also the zip on one of the pocket bags broke after one use, which means the quality is not good either.</li>
            <li> Hers lasted longer but one of the pouches is useless.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed!</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wanted a travel bag that had different pockets for the variety of makeup, cleansers and toiletries. This one did the job. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not sure the velcro will hold up to being taken off and on many times.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this case. Though I wish it was just a SMIDGE (and I mean a smidge) roomier (of course a few less cosmetics might be advised for me), it is convenient, easy to use, and has some unique features. Love the way it folds up into a cube and hangs from a door/hook/towel rack. It stays clean and is easy to wipe down. It&#x27;s not as pretty as some (though it is attractive) with the solid black exterior, but some might say it makes it more professional looking and not so froo-froo with flowers and zebra prints. I&#x27;d say - \\&quot;Go for it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it but plan on using on my honeymoon in October! I recently moved and used it to move my liquid items like shampoo and body wash in case it happened to leak.</li>
            <li> I wonder why this product got so good reviews. If I fill all pockets and roll it up, it does not fit in my travel bag..which is a hand-carry if you are traveling by plane. Also the zip on one of the pocket bags broke after one use, which means the quality is not good either. Definitely not recommended!</li>
            <li> Purchased for daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK - you can&#x27;t fit much in the plastic containers or you can&#x27;t really roll up the bag.  There are better products out there. It was a good attempt at trying to organize different products, but the bag just doesn&#x27;t roll up properly with regular size items in the plastic containers.</li>
            <li> This make-up kit bag is perfect for all my make-up!  It&#x27;s convenient, and portable.  I can take with me anywhere.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Has four removable pouches attached via Velcro so that if you don&#x27;t need all your products you don&#x27;t have to lug the entire case with you.</li>
            <li> I really like and and would give it five stars if the hook to hang it were bigger.  It does not go over the bar in my closet like two other different brands of this type of thing that I have.  I will mainly be hanging it from a hook in my RV so it will do there, but I&#x27;d still would have liked to be able to hang it in my bedroom closet.  Also, I paid much a much lower price than what they charge on Mary Kay.  It is not worth what Mary Kay is charging, at least I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bag as a gift because I like mine so much.  It is so handy to hang in hotel rooms, and folds to fit in a suitcase.  If room doesn&#x27;t allow, each pouch is removable to stuff in corners.  Also,you can remove just one pouch to use at the make-up area.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for Christmas.  When she saw it she almost cried.. She absolutely loves it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these.My first one was stolen :( so as soon as I found another on amazon I had to buy it.Thats how much I love it.Its sturdy and the colors are so cute together.</li>
            <li> This is the closest I&#x27;ve been able to come to the product that I had order on the As seen on TV product I wanted for my knitting and crocheting notions. This one is working well.</li>
            <li> I can organize everything into the different compartments and just hang it on the towel rack. When I need something, I just pull off the pouch that I need instead of having everything out. Also, super cute pink :)</li>
            <li> I liked the first bag so well, I immediately purchased a second one.  I only wish the company I ordered from would have packed it flat in a little larger mailing bag rather than fold it in half, bending/creasing it.  I&#x27;m still very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item!!! I will not travel without it. I keep my stuff in it and I keep it hanging on the back of my bathroom door. That Way When I Take A Trip I Just Add a few more thing and roll it up and go. This is simply amazingly convenient.</li>
            <li> My wife already had one that finally fell apart so this is a replacement. She likes it so I bought another one.</li>
            <li> I was so very excited to receive this bag to take on my business trips. While packing for my first trip and before I even put an item in the bag, the top zipper broke. My sister has one too, so I called her. She told me one of her zippers broke too. Hers lasted longer but one of the pouches is useless. It seems like it isn&#x27;t well made. I&#x27;m looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have spent the night for a lot of short trips away from home since purchasing this last year.  What a hassle-saving bag this is!!  I keep cosmetics and essentials in it hanging in the bathroom off my bedroom.  I keep my daily essentials in one bag, overnights and morning essentials in another. When I need to go, I just grab one or both off and go.  When I get home, I put them back on.  I have not had any problems with durability.</li>
            <li> I can get all of my cosmetics in the case, but it will take me a little time to get used to it, as it is larger than I thought it would be,</li>
            <li> I have blown through a LOT of travel bags in my day and this one is hands down the best. I had heard of it while I was in college, but I didn&#x27;t fully appreciate the ability to velcro sections of the bag on and off individually until I purchased the bag for myself. I won&#x27;t use a different bag every again; I gotta stay with mary kay!!</li>
            <li> I love how potable it makes your makeup!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like it holds much, but it DOES hold FULL SIZED bottles of cosmetic items EASILY.  It is a great compact case.  Rolls tight and is NOT BULKY.  I&#x27;ve had lots of other types of travel cases but this one is the BEST. Love that the individual cases inside come off with the velcro.  Will be ordering another just to store extra cosmetic items in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> When I first got the bag it was very practical everything fit inside and the separate pockets were removable. I loved it until I actually had to travel with to a wedding and left the bag in my car. The heat made my make up brushes smell like the plastic from the pouches and also my face smell like plastic, cleaning the brushes did not help. In the end I threw the bag and my brushes away.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law was very happy with this present. I knew she would because I&#x27;ve had one before and loved it. Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> great for travel and to organize those beauty products when on the go. I used it when I worked as a hotel clerk for the nightshift. It works! Easy to clean and to pack up and go.</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I wanted but was everything it was described as. I like having all the compartments for different items.</li>
            <li> Just exactly as I was hoping. Great way to keep my makeup organized. Got it for college and living in the dorms</li>
            <li> Very convinent organizing product for getting pretty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect! It fits all my make up wonderfully. So glad I decided to purchase it! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> For the price it is nice and does hold a good amount of stuff. The zippers on a few on the compartments were very hard to close but after rubbing a candle on the teeth part they are fine.</li>
            <li> I have solo much makeup and ive always loved rollups. But they never seem big enough. Well this one will fit all of your thongs and I organized mine into face eyes lips and brushes. You wont regret it and its so cute with the pink inside! I don&#x27;t think Mary Kay sells the pink anymore. Came in the mail super quick too</li>
            <li> Really nice bag , my daughter in college loves it</li>
            <li> It is awesomely rare that you receive things just like they are supposed to be. This product was just that</li>
            <li> Always wanted one, now I have it.  Really keeps things organized on the road.</li>
            <li> Not quality made.  Zippers in two of the compartments ran off the track almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It takes me forever to pack all the incidentals when I travel long distance or just an over night trip.  I&#x27;ve found after using this 3 times, it&#x27;s a great time saver.  I put all my incidentals and toiletries in the sections as I&#x27;d need to use them 1 pouch for shower (shampoo/conditioner/face cleanser/razer), 1 pouch for makeup (and lash curler, tweezers, etc), 1 pouch for after shower: qtips, toothpaste/brush/etc), 1 pouch for other incidentals.  Then I am using the makeup pouch as my every day makeup bag, and keeping the others all ready to go.  When I take off, I just velcro the makeup in and I AM ALL PACKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  LOVE IT!!!!!!  Appears well made and I expect it will last for several years if not 10.</li>
            <li> This bag is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It holds all of the essentials neatly. I love that each bag is removable.</li>
            <li> I just got back from a 6 day vacation and this bag worked well. I let my hubby use one zip pouch and was able to fit all my stuff in the rest of the pouches. The pouches in length can fit a regular size shaving can and the width you can fit a short shaving can long ways. You have plenty of room. I took with me. Several hair accessories hair ties, scrunchies, head bands, the shampoo, conditioner and leave in treatment using reusable bottles all in one pouch. Next pouch I had all my skin care, face creams about 4 large Clinique jars and 3 small jars and my Lancôme normal size face wash, my full size Clinique moisture cream in the pump all in 2 pouches. There was more than enough room for you needs the only thing I would say the heavier stuff you put in the pouches do start to get loosened from the Velcro the pouches are removable and I love the hanging part. No more messy counters.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bag. The fact that it has a hanger is even a plus so i don&#x27;t have to empty it after every use in order for me to have my products handy. for someone like me who has lots of make up and it&#x27;s hard to keep the stuff I use very often in just one place this is a MUST! it made it much easier for me to have just one bag to put all the products I need when traveling for a short period of time where i don&#x27;t have to carry my entire make up set. Unlike other roll up bags, this actually has lots of space and each zipper is big enough to put relatively large items such as foundation bottles. I would definitely get some more and throw my scattered multiple make up bags away!!! this made my life so much easier. I love it</li>
            <li> Slightly overpriced, but the product delivers.  You can hang it.  Roll it up and bag it up for travel.  Several separated compartments.  All in all, very trendy, girly and cute.  Recommended to all ladies who love pink and traveling.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my friend had one. I love that the bags detach. it rolls up nice and also the hangar is pretty sturdily reinforced so I am not worried about it ripping. It did take FOREVER to be even shipped.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, well-made travel bag that I cannot wait to use when I get home. Originally I ordered it to lug my toiletries back &amp; forth to the showers (I am currently deployed in Afghanistan), but the removable compartments are not large enough to store full-size toiletry items. I still love it and do not regret purchasing it because it will be a great makeup organizer when I get back home. It is sturdy &amp; well made. I would definitely recommend to others who are in need of something to organize their cosmetics and other small items. Love!</li>
            <li> I chose this purchase because I&#x27;ve wanted one for a while and this was a very good price. I was actually looking for a book and came across this product, and I bought. It is exactly what it I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li> I have one and my sister in law has one and we both love it!  So handy for traveling.</li>
            <li> Gave as a Christmas gift after a girls trip when a friend admired mine. I got mine as a gift when I admired someone else&#x27;s a few years ago. It holds all my bathroom needs and jewelry. It has a hanger to hang on the bathroom door unrolled for easy access to clear zippered pouches that will detach if you want to remove one separate from the others. It rolls up and fits perfectly in the corner of your suitcase. I don&#x27;t know how I ever did without it!</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied! When I received the bag....I was so disappointed! It was tiny! Come on! The price was high...and it was a Mary Kay product! So disappointed! I returned it.</li>
            <li> This is the classic Mary Kay roll up I have always loved.  It will fit your regular sized bottles(not the oversized ones).  I also have put brushes and combs in it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get what i was expecting!!&lt;br /&gt;I got totally different thing from what is shown in the picture..&lt;br /&gt;It is very cheap and fake looking!</li>
            <li> I had bought one of these over 10 years ago from a Mary Kay rep, and used it daily for cosmetic/face care needs plus more.  That old case is still in fine shape, but one of the compartment zippers had broken.  I was so happy to see these being offered I just had to have another one!  Now I am using this case mostly, but I still have three extra inside compartments with working zippers, so I store some items in those.  I always have a bag packed and ready to go in case I don&#x27;t get home on a night of being on call for the hospital, and have to work the next day.  I need to have everything with me just in case I&#x27;m getting ready for my day shift while at the hospital. This helps me be organized and ready. It has four roomy inside see-through compartments with zippers, and they all roll up and the outer part closes with Velcro.  It is all very well-made.</li>
            <li> I was really expecting the bags on this to be small or awkward, and to not be able to truly hang stuffed with makeup, and I am so relieved to be proved wrong. I have had each bag hanging for more than a month stuffed to the gills, and then I rip off one bag every morning with that days essentials, and replace it when i get home. The velcro keeps working and nothing has ever fallen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I had a weekend trip and stuffed it with EVERYTHING, and it still rolled right up and transported with ease. I am buying a second.</li>
            <li> I wanted to prepare for a weekend getaway at the beach and needed a travel bag to hold all of my items. I LOVE this bag. Not only does it hold all of my items, but I can hang it in the bathroom by it&#x27;s hanger(Yes, it comes with a hanger to hang for easy access). I plan to purchase for friends! :-)</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel. Easy to pack once you  take it apart reassemble when you arrive at your destination. I hange it in the restroom keeps everything there so I never forget anything when it&#x27;s time to leave,</li>
            <li> Great travel bag. Holds so much stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good travel make up bag because I am a college student and I find myself making small trips quite often and going home about every other weekend. When doing my research, I came across this bag multiple times, and it looked quite promising so I decided to make my purchase. I ordered my makeup case from eBay for about $17 including shipping, it is just a bit cheaper than it is here on Amazon. I was extremely excited when I received it, and I immediately placed all of my make up and toiletries into the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First pouch-All &#x27;eye&#x27; items. Eye shadows, eye liners, primer, mascara, etc. It did fit quite a lot. My Naked 1 palette also fit in there, though it was quite snug, the length was just enough to fit this palette right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second pouch- All &#x27;face&#x27; items. Foundation, BB cream, powders, blush, bronzer. They all also fit quite nicely! I was able to fit ALL of the items that I would potentially use for day or night make up. (My everyday make up routine is not that extensive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third pouch- All brushes. My MAC brushes fit perfectly. I had all sorts of face and eye brushes and they were all able to fit. The length was perfect for all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth pouch- Toiletries. I have acne prone skin so I do have an extensive skin care regimen. I put all of my everyday face products into travel friendly containers and I was able to fit them into here. Lotions, acne cream, face wash, make-up remover, etc. All fit nicely in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of this bag is pretty awesome. Four roomy separate make up pouches that can be attached to a larger roll with Velcro. Overall each separate case does feel secure and snug, but I do feel like the black portion that holds these pouches together is quite flimsy. It only holds its square shape if the make up pouches are completely filled with your contents. I do feel like it is very versatile and can be used for many things, but I am hoping that someone improves on this concept and creates a more durable version of it. Though I did like this bag, I did not LOVE it like I thought I would. I am still keeping my eyes open for a new way to travel with my make up and toiletries, but if you are looking for something that holds a lot of stuff and rolls up into a little square, then you just might fall in love with this bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a summary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Roomy&lt;br /&gt;Keeps you organized&lt;br /&gt;Rolls up&lt;br /&gt;Holds lots of stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Kind of flimsy&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hold shape well</li>
            <li> I really like this. It doesn&#x27;t take up much room but holds a lot of stuff. I would recommend. Sue</li>
            <li> Really convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 4 clear, removable bags and a hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for an international trip I had, planning to take one of the pouches through TSA security and it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a Mary Kay user, but this bag came in very handy for traveling. It held everything that I needed.</li>
            <li> I received this for Christmas. It is very nice, but much larger than I thought. If I want to take this on the plane with me it will take up a good amount of space. However, it is nice quality and I think I will get a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> space saver and works very well and is super compact and she loves it. :)&lt;br /&gt;thanks again for the quick shipping too</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay&#x27;s travel bags for years and have updated mine as Mary Kay updated them.  It&#x27;s so easy to leave my travel items packed in the hanging bag between trips, add a few things, pack the bag in my suitcase, pull it out and hang it up for use at my destination.  The items are visible through the clear pouches.  I was disturbed that I could not find them on the Mary Kay website, but Amazon came through.  This one was purchased as a gift and I had already promised it prior to having purchased it.  I was relieved to find it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was sooo fast.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love how the little bags are removable. I would like the pockets just to be a LITTLE bigger, but other than that, I absolutely adore it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this! The price was better then ordering it through marykay. It came in great time and brand new shape :)</li>
            <li> Awesome make-up bag or travel kit.  Every woman needs one or two of these!!!  Came promptly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going off to college and i&#x27;m not home a lot so I purchased the item for easy traveling. I absolutely love the product. The only issue is the size, I may end up buying another one. Delivery was very quick as well.</li>
            <li> How did I live without one of these for so long? This is so much better than carrying a bunch of smaller bags. and so practical that it just hangs on the towel rack at the hotel so you don&#x60;t cover the sink with your stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like how it rolls up into a portable square with a handle.  I wish it was about 2 inches longer and 2 inches wider.  It fits a TON of stuff, but I use it everyday and put ALL of my stuff in it (hangs on the back of my bathroom door), so a little bit of extra space would have been better for me, but this works. This is the largest hanging bag I could find with four clear compartments, a hanging hook, and that is still portable, so I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> great thing for those who travels a lot, not necessary to carry all the things though, which is also convenient</li>
