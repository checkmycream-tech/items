            <li>Great hydrator and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This YonKa Crème is very effective, esp.</li>
            <li>Yon Ka did the trick, it is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>and she wrote to check on how much I liked it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been blessed with good skin and people</li>
            <li>but I think the cream will be more effective with the Lotion YonKa.  </li>
            <li>BEST CREME, Love the smell and so good for very dry skin...</li>
            <li>the smell is kind of strong</li>
            <li>But these products took it to the next level, now my skin is perfect.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is fabulous!</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Products work wonderfully for me, in the winter especially.</li>
            <li>Their products of top quality.</li>
            <li>Love , Love it .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if your face needs a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is a light weight, nice smelling cream that absorbs nicely, which is useful for the application of applying either powder or cream foundation to skin.</li>
            <li>They work great on even the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I get dry skin in the winter and this stuff is wonderful for it!</li>
            <li>It has a sophisticated fragrance that is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The YonKa line is from Paris and the products are of exceptional quality, (all natural).  </li>
            <li>They are, by far, the best facial products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but it is not bad…sort of like a spa fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>It also smells so fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream many times in the past and always liked it, so I thought I&#x27;d try it again.</li>
            <li>The products have a light, natural scent, like fruit.</li>
            <li>First found this product in a shop on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, where I was vacationing.</li>
            <li>They recommend you use the Lotion YonKa first</li>
            <li>I have used many products over the years, but for the last 15+ years I have used Yonka exclusively.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend  it and the price is right.</li>
            <li>And the cleansing milk doesn&#x27;t strip away the healthy oils in your skin and dry it out, but still cleanses.</li>
            <li>Yonka&#x27;s products are so pure.  </li>
            <li>This product however really works on dehydration and makes skin look refreshed and super soft.</li>
            <li>The price was high, but I need hydration</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>On time and brand new.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and the start of laugh lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Possibly this one was old or they change their formula?</li>
            <li>Using the three steps combined cleared up both issues, evened my skin tone and left it soft and dewy.</li>
            <li>this is totally worth the money….you will notice a difference in your face within a few days of use.</li>

            <li> this is totally worth the money….you will notice a difference in your face within a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I was starting to get dry, flaky patches on several areas of my face, along with excess oil on my nose.</li>

            <li> for middle aged ladies like me with dehydrated skin.  </li>
            <li> Before using Yon-Ka 28, I had dry flaky skin around my cheeks and temples that no moisturizer seemed to resolve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products to try to save money, but nothing worked</li>
            <li> usually think I&#x27;m 10-15 years younger.</li>
            <li> If you want something lighter, try one of the other Yon-Ka creams.</li>
            <li> Its heavier going on but doesn&#x27;t weigh down my skin once it soaks in like some other products.</li>
            <li> As always with Yonka, you get a little aroma therapy along with your skin care.</li>
            <li> and it feels a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Yon-Ka moisturizer, toner, and milk for a few years now</li>
            <li> I should have purchased 2, not easy to find in stores</li>
            <li> however, this is one is a little ticker than before which makes it hard to apply to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I was in my late 30s when I started using these products.</li>
            <li> and I could replace the YonKa with what I&#x27;d spent on things that failed.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick, but is not pore clogging at all.  </li>
            <li> I suffer really badly from dry dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> and I did...much less expensive!</li>

            <li> I had used this cream before so I ordered it again, however, this is one is a little ticker than before which makes it hard to apply to my face and neck. Possibly this one was old or they change their formula?</li>
            <li> I use this with Yonka&#x27;s Lait Nettoyant and alcohol-free toner. They were recommended at a salon after a facial. I was starting to get dry, flaky patches on several areas of my face, along with excess oil on my nose. Using the three steps combined cleared up both issues, evened my skin tone and left it soft and dewy. I was in my late 30s when I started using these products. I&#x27;ve tried other products to try to save money, but nothing worked and I could replace the YonKa with what I&#x27;d spent on things that failed. It&#x27;s a miracle! The products have a light, natural scent, like fruit. I&#x27;ve been blessed with good skin and people usually think I&#x27;m 10-15 years younger. But these products took it to the next level, now my skin is perfect.</li>
            <li> BEST CREME, Love the smell and so good for very dry skin... very good quality. I should have purchased 2, not easy to find in stores</li>
            <li> Yonka how do you do it? This moisturizer is fabulous! Yonka&#x27;s products are so pure.  They work great on even the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Wanted something for my normal skin that has gotten a little dry during the winter.  The product does work in that it moisturizes.  However, I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell and it feels a little heavy.  Will keep looking.</li>
            <li> On time and brand new.</li>
            <li> I suffer really badly from dry dehydrated skin. A lot of products just don&#x27;t do what they say. This product however really works on dehydration and makes skin look refreshed and super soft. I&#x27;m converted to YonKa</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and the start of laugh lines around my eyes.  This product has made a noticeable difference in the texture and smoothness of my skin.  My face feels hydrated and youthful.  As always with Yonka, you get a little aroma therapy along with your skin care.</li>
            <li> this is totally worth the money….you will notice a difference in your face within a few days of use. the smell is kind of strong but it is not bad…sort of like a spa fresh clean smell. i love it. totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I get dry skin in the winter and this stuff is wonderful for it! Its heavier going on but doesn&#x27;t weigh down my skin once it soaks in like some other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream many times in the past and always liked it, so I thought I&#x27;d try it again. It is a light weight, nice smelling cream that absorbs nicely, which is useful for the application of applying either powder or cream foundation to skin.</li>
            <li> Yonka Creme 28 is excellant.  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream, I put it on at night and when I wake in the morning my face is still moisturized.  Would highly recommend  it and the price is right.</li>
            <li> First found this product in a shop on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, where I was vacationing. The price was high, but I need hydration&lt;br /&gt;especially around my nose and chin. Yon Ka did the trick, it is an amazing product! But after getting back home, went on line&lt;br /&gt;to Amazon to see if I could find it.......and I did...much less expensive! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great hydrator and moisturizer.  Can leave it on all night.  Not greasy.  I discovered it after getting a facial and it was applied at the end.  I went online to order it when I got home.</li>
            <li> This YonKa Crème is very effective, esp. for middle aged ladies like me with dehydrated skin.  The YonKa line is from Paris and the products are of exceptional quality, (all natural).  It goes on thick, but is not pore clogging at all.  I put it on a walk around the house till it soaks in. They recommend you use the Lotion YonKa first and I will get some of that soon.  But since I didn&#x27;t have any I used my moisturizing toner but I think the cream will be more effective with the Lotion YonKa.  This seller was prompt, delivered the product in a timely manner and she wrote to check on how much I liked it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Yon-Ka moisturizer, toner, and milk for a few years now and I love it. It has a sophisticated fragrance that is fresh and clean. Products work wonderfully for me, in the winter especially. Before using Yon-Ka 28, I had dry flaky skin around my cheeks and temples that no moisturizer seemed to resolve. It is heavier because it&#x27;s for dehydrated skin. And the cleansing milk doesn&#x27;t strip away the healthy oils in your skin and dry it out, but still cleanses. If you want something lighter, try one of the other Yon-Ka creams. Their products of top quality.</li>
            <li> Love , Love it . This is the only day cream I us . It also smells so fresh. Great price !</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I use it all the time and it works beautifully.  I highly recommend it if your face needs a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years, but for the last 15+ years I have used Yonka exclusively. They are, by far, the best facial products I have ever used. Your skin will thank you!</li>
