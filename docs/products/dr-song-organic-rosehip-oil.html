            <li>I have no idea if it&#x27;s any good directly on skin, but it gives nice moisturizing properties to soap.</li>

            <li>I am glad it is a big bottle because I am sure I will be using every drop of this great product.</li>

            <li>It absorbs very quickly, so it does Not leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I was worried it would have a strong smell, but once applied it has a bit of an earthy smell(which</li>
            <li>Dr. Song Rosehip Oil does not have a strong aroma, so you do not have to worry that you will be walking around smelling like a product.</li>
            <li>People use it to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>

            <li>got this for free for review purpose</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I was given this product free as part of a review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was sent this free to review</li>
            <li>The oil is so light, and absorbs into the skin immediately.</li>
            <li>, it is a good oil for a bunch of natural remedies.</li>
            <li>Like most oils there isn’t a very pleasant scent but that is expected, it’s strong and potent because it’s 100% natural oil</li>
            <li>but right now I love how my skin is feeling and</li>
            <li>It has the right color for rosehip oil as it should be more orange in color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using another brand of Rosehip Oil, but was more than happy to try the Rosehip Oil from Dr. Song, as I am familiar with other products from this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It’s a good product in general</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that reacts to many many things, so I gave rosehip oil a shot since it’s</li>
            <li>so I was really happy when I tried Dr. Song&#x27;s Rosehip Oil and found that it is a &#x27;dry&#x27; oil.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, Dr Song Medical products are made in the USA and is FDA compliant and a provider of professional products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive this for review, and I really have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>This had the most positive reviews that described the oil.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect, but it dissipates pretty quickly, so it isn&#x27;t a thing for me at all.</li>
            <li>It dispenses just the right amount of oil, and the oil spreads easily.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a very good size too, very big compared to Rosehip oil I have gotten from other companies, so it&#x27;s a much better value than most.</li>
            <li>Plus I love supporting products made in the USA, since that seems to be so rare theses days.</li>
            <li>This oil is supposed to be good for overall health, so this was a no</li>
            <li>I have noticed it makes my hair thicker and full of body.</li>
            <li>So stepping &amp;#34;out-of-the-box&amp;#34; took a bit of bravery on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Dr. Song Rosehip Oil for a couple of weeks - starting with just on my hands, I have come to the conclusion that perhaps this is a good type of product to use.</li>
            <li>I make every attempt to keep them healthy but sometimes it becomes a real pain.</li>
            <li>Rose hip oil is also frequently used to heal scarring and diminish photo-</li>

            <li>While it has a scent to it, it’s not a bad scent, and doesn’t overpower my perfume or change the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Like many oils, there are so many different uses for rosehip oil</li>
            <li>It seems like the older I get, the more I have to deal with the problem.</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent.</li>
            <li>quickly absorbs into the skin replenishing moisture and creates a protective barrier on the skin to help prevent</li>
            <li>It also absorbs into my skin quickly without leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a HUGE bottle, you get so much product for your money!</li>
            <li>I got to try this free for review purposes and its super high quality, even smells so fresh!</li>
            <li>It has helped reduce my fine lines and has really moisturized my skin.  </li>
            <li>Its amazing how simple inflammation can disrupt your focus!</li>
            <li>I tried it on my freshly shaved or legs.</li>
            <li>I put Dr. Song&#x27;s Rosehip Oil directly on the parts that felt swollen and inflamed and within fifteen minutes I felt a lot better.</li>
            <li>I just have to find the right use for me.</li>
            <li>Jury is still out right now.</li>
            <li>Meaning it absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and not slick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the oil cleanse method for the past year with great results.</li>
            <li>It’s not a miracle cure, but after twice-daily applications, my skin, in general, has a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used one other type of rosehip oil and let me tell you, this one has a better consistency and it smells good in comparison to the last brand I used.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention this includes a ton of amazing benefits to help with wrinkles, scars, stretch marks, rashes, burns, acne scars, dry skin, dermatitis, age spots, brittle nails, psoriasis, eczema, hyper-pigmentation, radiation, sun damage, dry/damaged hair and anti-inflammatory.</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is great for circulation of the skin (external use only).</li>
            <li>The oil is a dry oil and rubs in nicely-</li>
            <li>Leaves skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I think it feels great going on with a little chill - wakes me up!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different creams but nothing will beat this Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>You really can use it for just about everything!</li>
            <li>got a sample of this for review on my blog, and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but I stand by my reviews and do not recommend products that I do not personally use and love.</li>
            <li>pretty glass bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li>I expected rose hip oil to smell like…</li>
            <li>There are still so many different uses for Rosehip oil that I haven&#x27;t tried yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on some of my stretch marks and it seems to really be helping!</li>
            <li>In only two weeks there has been a slight change which was very surprising, this stuff has made me a believer</li>
            <li>My mom&#x27;s skin is looking a really healthy and smooth now that she uses it everyday</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin feeling super soft!  </li>
            <li>I have really been impressed so far and with the harsh winter months coming, I know that this will continue to be a daily staple in my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>- I find it keeps pure oils fresher longer -</li>
            <li>Dr Song sent me their 100% Pure USDA Certified Organic Virgin Rosehip Seed Oil to review for my blog</li>
            <li>being100% pure USDA certified organic)</li>
            <li>% Pure USDA Certified Organic Virgin Rosehip Seed Oil</li>
            <li>Plus, Dr. Song Rosehip Oil is 100% Pure Organic Virgin Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I recieved this product when I did, the weather changing has dried my skin out immensely.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it</li>
            <li>I use it on my face as well, but what I really like using it on are my nails &amp; cuticles.  </li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my skin looks and feels really hydrated and supple.  </li>
            <li>I stay away from the scalp area because it would make my hair very greasy looking.</li>
            <li>very soon</li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>Really helped my scars fade</li>
            <li>(it was a fresh scar that hadn&#x27;t started completely healing yet)</li>
            <li>after using the rosehip oil on it, it really seemed to aid in it&#x27;s minimizing the look of the scar.  </li>
            <li>It have work very well and it has a shelf life of 6 months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is so much you can do with it.</li>
            <li>But you really have to work your way into using it.</li>
            <li>No one wants to put it on their arms and legs and go sit on their furniture.</li>
            <li>No one wants to apply it to their feet and go walking around leaving footprints on their floors.</li>
            <li>Also, it is not so much like a lady&#x27;s product that men would be adverse to using.</li>
            <li>greasy if u dont use too much</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs into the skin very well, and does not leave any residue behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>It definitely has many natural givings.</li>
            <li>Small scars from over the years,&lt;br /&gt;UV light damage, and fine lines.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I need to use this product more and test the effectiveness for other uses.</li>
            <li>sure I will find other uses</li>
            <li>Rosehip Oil is extracted from rose bush seeds, and has high amounts of fatty acids, including linoleic, and linolenic.</li>
            <li>It has a very light slight odor, but I cannot even imagine explaining what it smells like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a whole list of ways Rosehip Oil can help and the Native American&#x27;s and Asian healers knew all about it, the history of the oil is quite interesting but I will let you google that for yourself if you are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The rosehip oil comes in this pretty blue 4 oz glass bottle with a big dropper for either applying to the skin or dropping it into lotions and creams giving you the ability to mix it easily.  </li>
            <li>My stash of essential natural oils has dramatically grown since I started a blog and the one oil that I have been lucky enough to test for free</li>
            <li>My main focus with Dr. Song Rosehip oil is my hands.</li>
            <li>It absorbs almost instantly and quickly.</li>
            <li>* Large 4 oz bottle – good value for the money as you only need a small drop at a time&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a co- worker tell me the other day that she liked my makeup that it looked different.</li>
            <li>I wake up and shower and shampoo my hair like normal.</li>
            <li>The oil works a moisturizer because it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth for long hours.</li>
            <li>Personally I used this as a night time routine when I was going to bed, that way in the morning I could shower and be fresh for the day.</li>
            <li>My face feels smoother, and the texture is more even now after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>It leaves no oily feel but left feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>I will be getting a new one when i use all of this one.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what this was, so I spent some time looking at different brands, and found Dr.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a natural moisturizer or a natural solution for lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I have used other products to try to help my hands and this is the first one that is really working for me.</li>
            <li>I have learned a lot recently about skincare and how certain products help us.  </li>
            <li>My neck and shoulders feel soft and totally moisturized for a whole day.</li>
            <li>some on the market are actually clear and therefore cannot be organic.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how it made my soles soft.</li>
            <li>all natural &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and doesn’t contain any chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking forward to using it in the winter as well when my hands really seem to need all the extra moisture they can get.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft every where I use this oil.</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil comes from rosehip fruit grown wildly in Chile.</li>
            <li>but the slight smell quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>It is extremely high in essential fatty acids along with being Rich in vitamins and antioxidants, especially Vitamin C, Vitamin A (retinol), and linoleic and linolenic acids—all superstars for skin and hair</li>
            <li>You can also use it for helps with dark skin spots, dry skin and even reduces fine lines</li>
            <li>use Dr. Song&#x27;s Rosehip Oil in a few ways, although it can be used in many other ways.</li>
            <li>* Left my skin soft in the areas I used it</li>
            <li>I was really surprised when I recently used rosehip oil and a scar I had on my face</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not 100% gone it definitely isn&#x27;t anywhere near as noticeable as I had feared it was going to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a second degree burn early this month</li>
            <li>When I received it I didn&#x27;t know much about the oil and not much instruction came with it.</li>
            <li>used this oil for the past few weeks and love it.</li>

            <li> I am glad it is a big bottle because I am sure I will be using every drop of this great product.</li>

            <li> It absorbs very quickly, so it does Not leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I was worried it would have a strong smell, but once applied it has a bit of an earthy smell(which</li>
            <li> Dr. Song Rosehip Oil does not have a strong aroma, so you do not have to worry that you will be walking around smelling like a product.</li>
            <li> People use it to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Songs product has been superior by far!</li>
            <li> It also helps smooth wrinkles and fine lines.</li>

            <li> got this for free for review purpose</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I was given this product free as part of a review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was sent this free to review</li>
            <li> The oil is so light, and absorbs into the skin immediately.</li>
            <li> , it is a good oil for a bunch of natural remedies.</li>
            <li> Like most oils there isn’t a very pleasant scent but that is expected, it’s strong and potent because it’s 100% natural oil</li>
            <li> but right now I love how my skin is feeling and</li>
            <li> It has the right color for rosehip oil as it should be more orange in color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using another brand of Rosehip Oil, but was more than happy to try the Rosehip Oil from Dr. Song, as I am familiar with other products from this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It’s a good product in general</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that reacts to many many things, so I gave rosehip oil a shot since it’s</li>
            <li> so I was really happy when I tried Dr. Song&#x27;s Rosehip Oil and found that it is a &#x27;dry&#x27; oil.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, Dr Song Medical products are made in the USA and is FDA compliant and a provider of professional products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive this for review, and I really have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> This had the most positive reviews that described the oil.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect, but it dissipates pretty quickly, so it isn&#x27;t a thing for me at all.</li>
            <li> It dispenses just the right amount of oil, and the oil spreads easily.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a very good size too, very big compared to Rosehip oil I have gotten from other companies, so it&#x27;s a much better value than most.</li>
            <li> Plus I love supporting products made in the USA, since that seems to be so rare theses days.</li>
            <li> This oil is supposed to be good for overall health, so this was a no</li>
            <li> I have noticed it makes my hair thicker and full of body.</li>
            <li> So stepping &amp;#34;out-of-the-box&amp;#34; took a bit of bravery on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Dr. Song Rosehip Oil for a couple of weeks - starting with just on my hands, I have come to the conclusion that perhaps this is a good type of product to use.</li>
            <li> I make every attempt to keep them healthy but sometimes it becomes a real pain.</li>
            <li> Rose hip oil is also frequently used to heal scarring and diminish photo-</li>

            <li> While it has a scent to it, it’s not a bad scent, and doesn’t overpower my perfume or change the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Like many oils, there are so many different uses for rosehip oil</li>
            <li> It seems like the older I get, the more I have to deal with the problem.</li>
            <li> It has a mild scent.</li>
            <li> quickly absorbs into the skin replenishing moisture and creates a protective barrier on the skin to help prevent</li>
            <li> It also absorbs into my skin quickly without leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a HUGE bottle, you get so much product for your money!</li>
            <li> I got to try this free for review purposes and its super high quality, even smells so fresh!</li>
            <li> It has helped reduce my fine lines and has really moisturized my skin.  </li>
            <li> Its amazing how simple inflammation can disrupt your focus!</li>
            <li> I tried it on my freshly shaved or legs.</li>
            <li> I put Dr. Song&#x27;s Rosehip Oil directly on the parts that felt swollen and inflamed and within fifteen minutes I felt a lot better.</li>
            <li> I just have to find the right use for me.</li>
            <li> Jury is still out right now.</li>
            <li> Meaning it absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and not slick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil cleanse method for the past year with great results.</li>
            <li> It’s not a miracle cure, but after twice-daily applications, my skin, in general, has a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used one other type of rosehip oil and let me tell you, this one has a better consistency and it smells good in comparison to the last brand I used.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention this includes a ton of amazing benefits to help with wrinkles, scars, stretch marks, rashes, burns, acne scars, dry skin, dermatitis, age spots, brittle nails, psoriasis, eczema, hyper-pigmentation, radiation, sun damage, dry/damaged hair and anti-inflammatory.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is great for circulation of the skin (external use only).</li>
            <li> The oil is a dry oil and rubs in nicely-</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I think it feels great going on with a little chill - wakes me up!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different creams but nothing will beat this Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> You really can use it for just about everything!</li>
            <li> got a sample of this for review on my blog, and I really like it!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but I stand by my reviews and do not recommend products that I do not personally use and love.</li>
            <li> pretty glass bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li> I expected rose hip oil to smell like…</li>
            <li> There are still so many different uses for Rosehip oil that I haven&#x27;t tried yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on some of my stretch marks and it seems to really be helping!</li>
            <li> In only two weeks there has been a slight change which was very surprising, this stuff has made me a believer</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s skin is looking a really healthy and smooth now that she uses it everyday</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin feeling super soft!  </li>
            <li> I have really been impressed so far and with the harsh winter months coming, I know that this will continue to be a daily staple in my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> - I find it keeps pure oils fresher longer -</li>
            <li> Dr Song sent me their 100% Pure USDA Certified Organic Virgin Rosehip Seed Oil to review for my blog</li>
            <li> being100% pure USDA certified organic)</li>
            <li> % Pure USDA Certified Organic Virgin Rosehip Seed Oil</li>
            <li> Plus, Dr. Song Rosehip Oil is 100% Pure Organic Virgin Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I recieved this product when I did, the weather changing has dried my skin out immensely.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it</li>
            <li> I use it on my face as well, but what I really like using it on are my nails &amp; cuticles.  </li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning my skin looks and feels really hydrated and supple.  </li>
            <li> I stay away from the scalp area because it would make my hair very greasy looking.</li>
            <li> very soon</li>
            <li> and it really helps.</li>
            <li> Really helped my scars fade</li>
            <li> (it was a fresh scar that hadn&#x27;t started completely healing yet)</li>
            <li> after using the rosehip oil on it, it really seemed to aid in it&#x27;s minimizing the look of the scar.  </li>
            <li> It have work very well and it has a shelf life of 6 months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is so much you can do with it.</li>
            <li> But you really have to work your way into using it.</li>
            <li> No one wants to put it on their arms and legs and go sit on their furniture.</li>
            <li> No one wants to apply it to their feet and go walking around leaving footprints on their floors.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not so much like a lady&#x27;s product that men would be adverse to using.</li>
            <li> greasy if u dont use too much</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs into the skin very well, and does not leave any residue behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> It definitely has many natural givings.</li>
            <li> Small scars from over the years,&lt;br /&gt;UV light damage, and fine lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, I need to use this product more and test the effectiveness for other uses.</li>
            <li> sure I will find other uses</li>
            <li> Rosehip Oil is extracted from rose bush seeds, and has high amounts of fatty acids, including linoleic, and linolenic.</li>
            <li> It has a very light slight odor, but I cannot even imagine explaining what it smells like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a whole list of ways Rosehip Oil can help and the Native American&#x27;s and Asian healers knew all about it, the history of the oil is quite interesting but I will let you google that for yourself if you are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The rosehip oil comes in this pretty blue 4 oz glass bottle with a big dropper for either applying to the skin or dropping it into lotions and creams giving you the ability to mix it easily.  </li>
            <li> My stash of essential natural oils has dramatically grown since I started a blog and the one oil that I have been lucky enough to test for free</li>
            <li> My main focus with Dr. Song Rosehip oil is my hands.</li>
            <li> It absorbs almost instantly and quickly.</li>
            <li> * Large 4 oz bottle – good value for the money as you only need a small drop at a time&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a co- worker tell me the other day that she liked my makeup that it looked different.</li>
            <li> I wake up and shower and shampoo my hair like normal.</li>
            <li> The oil works a moisturizer because it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth for long hours.</li>
            <li> Personally I used this as a night time routine when I was going to bed, that way in the morning I could shower and be fresh for the day.</li>
            <li> My face feels smoother, and the texture is more even now after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It leaves no oily feel but left feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> I will be getting a new one when i use all of this one.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what this was, so I spent some time looking at different brands, and found Dr.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a natural moisturizer or a natural solution for lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I have used other products to try to help my hands and this is the first one that is really working for me.</li>
            <li> I have learned a lot recently about skincare and how certain products help us.  </li>
            <li> My neck and shoulders feel soft and totally moisturized for a whole day.</li>
            <li> some on the market are actually clear and therefore cannot be organic.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how it made my soles soft.</li>
            <li> all natural &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and doesn’t contain any chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking forward to using it in the winter as well when my hands really seem to need all the extra moisture they can get.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft every where I use this oil.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil comes from rosehip fruit grown wildly in Chile.</li>
            <li> but the slight smell quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li> It is extremely high in essential fatty acids along with being Rich in vitamins and antioxidants, especially Vitamin C, Vitamin A (retinol), and linoleic and linolenic acids—all superstars for skin and hair</li>
            <li> You can also use it for helps with dark skin spots, dry skin and even reduces fine lines</li>
            <li> use Dr. Song&#x27;s Rosehip Oil in a few ways, although it can be used in many other ways.</li>
            <li> * Left my skin soft in the areas I used it</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when I recently used rosehip oil and a scar I had on my face</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not 100% gone it definitely isn&#x27;t anywhere near as noticeable as I had feared it was going to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a second degree burn early this month</li>
            <li> When I received it I didn&#x27;t know much about the oil and not much instruction came with it.</li>
            <li> used this oil for the past few weeks and love it.</li>
            <li> It does have a pretty strong smell but not as bad as  some.</li>
            <li> rate this product 9/10, and would definitely recommend this to anyone who has issues with dry skin, or wants something a little cheaper than the rest of the ‘scar creams’ on the market.</li>
            <li> have found that Rosehip oil makes my skin look healthier, more radiant, and less tired.</li>
            <li> My scar has lightened considerably, and my stretch marks have become slightly less ‘deep’-looking, and my skin is smoother.</li>

            <li> I like knowing that it is a single organic ingredient, and not a huge list of chemicals</li>
            <li> However, after reading what the Dr. Song brand purports the product to do, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try - primarily because my nails are brittle, splitty, and generally bad.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would reduce the unsightly dark lines.</li>
            <li> I would definitely encourage people to at least try the product.</li>
            <li> My dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Usually some times when I wash my face it sometimes feels dry but not when I use the rosehip oil</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with my hands due to arthritis.</li>
            <li> My typical testing time when trying these types of products is about two weeks just to see if there is any noticeable change.</li>
            <li> I use less in the morning on my face</li>
            <li> scent is a little odd-</li>
            <li> Even just this morning I woke up with terrible inflammation on my face, around my nose, my nose itself, just pretty much everywhere on the lower part of my face from allergies, which always flare up at this time of the year for me.</li>
            <li> I did find that the skin seems a little softer though.</li>
            <li> and I massage a little on each day</li>
            <li> just a little amount on your finger to rub in.</li>
            <li> then I do at night because it is a little oily.</li>
            <li> and a little goes</li>
            <li> Also it has helped a little with my son&#x27;s eczema, the spots aren&#x27;t gone, but they are improving.</li>
            <li> I have a few scars here</li>
            <li> I personally use it on my nails, which are brittle, thin, crack, have uneven surface, etc and so on.</li>
            <li> So, I did use it in my hair just a drop or two to tame frizz, style and manage any dryness.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my waist and it sometimes looks stringy and dull.</li>
            <li> Using the dropper provided, I found it hard to put just a drop on my finger without it getting on the counter as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is commonly used in skin care products.</li>
            <li> and I can imagine that in a few months we will be seeing dramatic results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It got to the point that I stopped wearing short sleeve shirts :-(  </li>
            <li> Also use it on my neck and shoulders which in return decreased the lines.</li>
            <li> My nails are terribly difficult to take care of, as well as my cuticles.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle, I spilled some because my hands hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> I hate having to stand around half-naked waiting for lotions or serums to dry!&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wanted to try this product because it was supposed to help with scars. Since I have plenty from my mastectomy and surgeries related to cancer I was hoping it would reduce the unsightly dark lines. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and haven’t seen a change in the color of the scars. I did find that the skin seems a little softer though. I think I may try it on other areas to test the effectiveness of this product for a different purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * Large 4 oz bottle – good value for the money as you only need a small drop at a time&lt;br /&gt;  * Left my skin soft in the areas I used it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * Didn’t seem to reduce the red marks from scars&lt;br /&gt;  * Scent is more “clinical” but dissipates soon after applying&lt;br /&gt;  * Using the dropper provided, I found it hard to put just a drop on my finger without it getting on the counter as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I need to use this product more and test the effectiveness for other uses. It’s a good product in general I just have to find the right use for me.</li>
            <li> Totally love this product. I use it on my feet and especially on the soles as they were very dry. I was surprised how it made my soles soft. I&#x27;ve tried many different creams but nothing will beat this Rosehip oil. Also use it on my neck and shoulders which in return decreased the lines. My neck and shoulders feel soft and totally moisturized for a whole day.</li>
            <li> Although Rosehip Oil is smelly, it works wonders for my skin and hair. As a review blogger, I had a chance to test this product. I added some to a bottle of my hair conditioner, and my hair is noticeably softer every time I use it. I also added some to a bottle of body wash. It changed the color of it, but the after effects are amazing! My skin has an extra layer of moisture because the oil is soaking in to wet skin.</li>
            <li> Felt good on my skin but I broke out after using it once.</li>
            <li> Love this Rosehip Oil. Lately my mother has been very self-conscious about her skin, and asked me to get her Rosehip Oil. I wasn&#x27;t sure what this was, so I spent some time looking at different brands, and found Dr.Song. This had the most positive reviews that described the oil. My mom&#x27;s skin is looking a really healthy and smooth now that she uses it everyday and it even made her happier about her skin. Works great and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that reacts to many many things, so I gave rosehip oil a shot since it’s all natural &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and doesn’t contain any chemicals. Let me say that my skin loves the oil and I haven’t had any reactions since using it.</li>
            <li> I use this Rosehip oil for my scars that I have I am a picker and I can&#x27;t help it I have a few scars here and there and I massage a little on each day and I&#x27;ve seen a difference since than as I continue to use each and every day you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it just a little amount on your finger to rub in.</li>
            <li> My stash of essential natural oils has dramatically grown since I started a blog and the one oil that I have been lucky enough to test for free was this rosehip oil.  Like many oils, there are so many different uses for rosehip oil and I specifically wanted to try this on my husbands scars from surgery that he had earlier in the year. I don’t always go by what the manufacturers of these products claim, I prefer to my own research instead and have read tons of great articles about this stuff. My typical testing time when trying these types of products is about two weeks just to see if there is any noticeable change. My husband has four scars all together so we decided to try it on the two smallest ones. He began applying it daily to the scars and the biggest change we have seen is a change in the color and pigmentation of them. In only two weeks there has been a slight change which was very surprising, this stuff has made me a believer and I can imagine that in a few months we will be seeing dramatic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosehip oil comes in this pretty blue 4 oz glass bottle with a big dropper for either applying to the skin or dropping it into lotions and creams giving you the ability to mix it easily.  I think I am going to attempt mixing it in with lotion and applying it that way from now on because i think that would make it  an easier and cleaner option. Like most oils there isn’t a very pleasant scent but that is expected, it’s strong and potent because it’s 100% natural oil</li>
            <li> I always worry that beauty products that are oils, or oil based, will leave my skin feeling greasy or clog my pores - so I was really happy when I tried Dr. Song&#x27;s Rosehip Oil and found that it is a &#x27;dry&#x27; oil.  Meaning it absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and not slick.  I love that it&#x27;s organic and made in the USA as well. I use it on my face as well, but what I really like using it on are my nails &amp; cuticles.  It&#x27;s especially nourishing after you&#x27;ve taken your nail polish off and skin &amp; nails are especially dry.  I&#x27;ll be looking forward to using it in the winter as well when my hands really seem to need all the extra moisture they can get.  I received a sample of this oil in order to review, but always post my honest opinion about a product. Oh - I also like to keep my bottle in the refrigerator - I find it keeps pure oils fresher longer - and I think it feels great going on with a little chill - wakes me up!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil cleanse method for the past year with great results. I just started recently combining this rosehip oil with a heavy castor oil to help balance it out and it gives it a nice &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> Dr Song sent me their 100% Pure USDA Certified Organic Virgin Rosehip Seed Oil to review for my blog and I love the results of it!  My favorite thing to do with Rosehip Oil is put it all over my body as soon as I get out of the shower.  When I wake up in the morning my skin looks and feels really hydrated and supple.  Plus, all my little nicks &amp; cuts that I get from daily life look healed and less noticeable.  You really can use it for just about everything!</li>
            <li> I applied Dr. Song Rosehip Oil to my scar left by surgery to remove skin cancer years ago.  While the scar is still visible, it has been fading over time, in part thanks to this wonderful elixir.  It also seems to help when I have flareups of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) by soothing and moisturizing the affected area.  If you suffer from DH, you know all too well how itchy it can be.  Rosehip oil really seems to alleviate some of that itch without making the rash worse.  I also use it as an overall moisturizer for my face, neck and hands.  And if like me you must avoid gluten, you&#x27;ll be glad to know this product is GLUTEN FREE!</li>
            <li> Jury is still out right now. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell at all</li>
            <li> My complexion is not very good, as I have your standard mature skin. Small scars from over the years,&lt;br /&gt;UV light damage, and fine lines. This oil is supposed to be good for overall health, so this was a no&lt;br /&gt;brainer for me since I have everything under the sun. Well my scars have lightened up, and skin has&lt;br /&gt;been recovering pretty well, so I am happy.</li>
            <li> I love Dr Song&#x27;s products so I&#x27;m thrilled to have this opportunity to share with you all &amp;#34;The Dr Song Rosehip Oil Review!&amp;#34; I tend to use my products greedily so the large size of this bottle is perfect for my every day use all over my body. Plus I love supporting products made in the USA, since that seems to be so rare theses days. Besides when using products that involve your body its nice knowing that the Dr Song Rosehip Oil is 100% pure and organic. Not to mention this includes a ton of amazing benefits to help with wrinkles, scars, stretch marks, rashes, burns, acne scars, dry skin, dermatitis, age spots, brittle nails, psoriasis, eczema, hyper-pigmentation, radiation, sun damage, dry/damaged hair and anti-inflammatory. Which helps me keep my skin moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> Great for my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this in my hair after I blow dry! My hair is so shiny. A little goes a long way. I apply it to the ends in my hair. I stay away from the scalp area because it would make my hair very greasy looking. I have done overnight treatments with it in my hair. I wake up and shower and shampoo my hair like normal. I have noticed it makes my hair thicker and full of body. I have hair down to my waist and it sometimes looks stringy and dull. Since I have been using this my hair looks amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped all other night creams and day creams and only have been using this. I have noticed some of my brown spots on my face seem lighter and my skin feels softer. I had a co- worker tell me the other day that she liked my makeup that it looked different. I did Nothing different that day... I just think my skin looks more refreshed since using this. I use less in the morning on my face then I do at night because it is a little oily. In the morning I apply it and wait about 20 min before applying my makeup and have no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that I bought 2 bottles when I ordered it because I love this stuff!! The smell is not all that great but it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I will find other uses but so far I&#x27;m happy with my results!!</li>
            <li> I am glad I got a chance to use the product I am so glad that the product has so many uses its good for your skin your hair, nails and and much more. I have only used it on my skin and I love how moisturizing it is I put it on after toners and serums and my skin is so moisturized and shiny all day. Usually some times when I wash my face it sometimes feels dry but not when I use the rosehip oil its feels so good. I look forward to using the product for my hair and other&lt;br /&gt;things very soon but right now I love how my skin is feeling and looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the for testing purposes/ for free in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I got to test it out a while back. Rosehip oil is great for circulation of the skin (external use only). I used it at night under my night cream. It helps stimulate collagen production which is a huge plus. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any significant differences, but it is a really good product and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil on my skin for around a week now, and I am very pleased by it! I have stretch marks on my stomach from when my daughter was born and recently they have started hurting.. when I got this in the mail to review, I thought it would be a great thing to try on the marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are already softer, lighter and they have stopped hurting! My skin is soft every where I use this oil. The oil is a dry oil and rubs in nicely- and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used some on a few mosquito bites and the itching stopped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a little odd- I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect, but it dissipates pretty quickly, so it isn&#x27;t a thing for me at all. I love the dropper top, it makes usage a lot easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample of this for review on my blog, and I really like it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> We were able to try out Dr. Song Rosehip Oil for free. My main focus with Dr. Song Rosehip oil is my hands. I have been having trouble with my hands due to arthritis. my hand swell up and hurt enough to bother me all day. I heard that rosehip oil would help relief the discomfort. I have been trying it for a week and it really helps. The arthritis makes my hands feel swollen and the rosehip oil relieves the swelling. I have used other products to try to help my hands and this is the first one that is really working for me. I will continue to use Dr. Song Rosehip oil when I have to deal with this problem I have with my hands. It seems like the older I get, the more I have to deal with the problem. When I opened the bottle, I spilled some because my hands hurt so bad. The color was maybe tan. When the rosehip oil touched my skin, I felt an immediate soothing affect. It has a very light slight odor, but I cannot even imagine explaining what it smells like. The most important thing to me is it makes my hands feel much better and also makes them feel softer. I am glad it is a big bottle because I am sure I will be using every drop of this great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I recieved this product when I did, the weather changing has dried my skin out immensely. I have solely been using this on my hands and arms. It does wonders for my dry elbows. I was worried it would have a strong smell, but once applied it has a bit of an earthy smell(which is expected with it being100% pure USDA certified organic) but the slight smell quickly dissipates. I have really been impressed so far and with the harsh winter months coming, I know that this will continue to be a daily staple in my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I got to try this free for review purposes and its super high quality, even smells so fresh! Really helped my scars fade</li>
            <li> I have learned a lot recently about skincare and how certain products help us.  I was really surprised when I recently used rosehip oil and a scar I had on my face (it was a fresh scar that hadn&#x27;t started completely healing yet) after using the rosehip oil on it, it really seemed to aid in it&#x27;s minimizing the look of the scar.  While it&#x27;s not 100% gone it definitely isn&#x27;t anywhere near as noticeable as I had feared it was going to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I don&#x27;t know that it will completely take your scars away, it really did help me to minimize at least one scar!  All that&#x27;s left is a little red spot...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please Note:  I received a review sample of this product.  However the opinions expressed here are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> I had a second degree burn early this month and I immediately grab my Dr. Song Rosehip Oil to dab and help with the healing. Rosehip Oil has become one of my favorite skin care items. I was very impressed with Dr. Song Rosehip Oil bottle size. The product is not greasy and has a light scent. When I received it I didn&#x27;t know much about the oil and not much instruction came with it. I search online and I am glad I remember you can use it on burns. It have work very well and it has a shelf life of 6 months. Also make sure you keep it in the refrigerator.    *Please note that I was sent this product complementary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> People have been using Rosehip oil for a long time back when other products, So i thought i would give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;There is so much you can do with it. I tried it on my freshly shaved or legs. It absorbs almost instantly and quickly. It leaves no oily feel but left feeling super soft. I LOVE it. You can also use it for helps with dark skin spots, dry skin and even reduces fine lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a HUGE bottle, you get so much product for your money! Im glad i got to try this out in exchange for my honest review. I will be getting a new one when i use all of this one.</li>
            <li> Great for use in handmade soaps. I have no idea if it&#x27;s any good directly on skin, but it gives nice moisturizing properties to soap. I was given this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I like to take long walks daily. At the beginning of summer -  this year - mosquitos were relentless and my arms ended up covered with bites - which even with being careful not to scratch - left me with a ton of small brown spots on both of my arms. It got to the point that I stopped wearing short sleeve shirts :-(  I thought with time and sun-screen the spots would go away - but they didn&#x27;t, so after reading a number of reviews,  I decided to order Dr. Song to help with the brown spots.  I have been using it, two times daily, for several weeks now and I am starting to see these stubborn brown spots fade and a few have actually disappeared!  I would recommend this product and the delivery was prompt.  I still use sun screen to protect the progress I have made - so if you use the product, as directed, you will hopefully be helped as I have been!</li>
            <li> The Dr. Song  Rosehip Oil is great!  I have used one other type of rosehip oil and let me tell you, this one has a better consistency and it smells good in comparison to the last brand I used.  It also doesn&#x27;t discolor your clothes.  The last product I used was a discoloring yellow.  Dr. Songs product has been superior by far!</li>
            <li> When I was given the opportunity to try out and review Dr. Song Rosehip Oil, I was dubious. However, after reading what the Dr. Song brand purports the product to do, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try - primarily because my nails are brittle, splitty, and generally bad. Also, as a lady-of-a-certain-age my skin needs help and I thought perhaps something along the line of this rosehip oil might be just the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never, never, never have I used an oil to care for my skin. Frankly, I don&#x27;t even like a lotion that leaves an &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feel to my skin or leaves &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; spots when I touch surfaces. So stepping &amp;#34;out-of-the-box&amp;#34; took a bit of bravery on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Dr. Song Rosehip Oil for a couple of weeks - starting with just on my hands, I have come to the conclusion that perhaps this is a good type of product to use. But you really have to work your way into using it. No one wants to put it on their arms and legs and go sit on their furniture. So you have to plan. No one wants to apply it to their feet and go walking around leaving footprints on their floors. So the key is planning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the rosehip oil on my arms, legs, and especially hands (those pesky nails, you know). After applying, you feel a bit oily, but it seems to dissipate nicely and fairly quickly. So I think the key is to apply it in the evening just prior to jumping in bed. Let it work overnight. I do believe I am seeing a difference in how my skin looks. So this is a product that I can recommend for folks to try. Also, it is not so much like a lady&#x27;s product that men would be adverse to using.</li>
            <li> this is a lot of oil for the price. It has the right color for rosehip oil as it should be more orange in color. some on the market are actually clear and therefore cannot be organic. a little of dr songs oil go a long way, ont leave u greasy if u dont use too much</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil comes from rosehip fruit grown wildly in Chile. It is extremely high in essential fatty acids along with being Rich in vitamins and antioxidants, especially Vitamin C, Vitamin A (retinol), and linoleic and linolenic acids—all superstars for skin and hair health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is beneficial for the following:  Wrinkles, scars, stretch marks, rashes, burns, acne scars, dry skin, dermatitis, age spots, brittle nails, psoriasis, eczema, hyper-pigmentation, radiation and sun damage, dry &amp; damaged hair, anti-inflammatory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this oil for the past few weeks and love it. It has a mild scent. It is moisturizing without being greasy. I used it with moisturizer for a more concentrated effect and alone itself. The oil absorbs into the skin very well, and does not leave any residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip can be used in multiple ways as I have mentioned above. So, I did use it in my hair just a drop or two to tame frizz, style and manage any dryness. It worked wonderfully. It gave my hair a nice shine and luster. Along with that if there was any split ends or dryness it took care of that as well. If you suffer from dandruff, use it on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes  I tend to get eczema, i have applied this to the areas that I did and it did help to moisturize and help with the itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Song’s Rosehip oil, is truly a great oil, given it’s benefits. I would definitely encourage people to at least try the product. It definitely has many natural givings. Best of all, Dr Song Medical products are made in the USA and is FDA compliant and a provider of professional products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Pure USDA Certified Organic Virgin Rosehip Seed Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please purchase this product here on Amazon. It truly is great buy. #drsong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for free for review purpose</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is wonderful. It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth! I was fortunate to receive this for review, and I really have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with Rosehip Oil! It is such a wonderful product for my skin, and even though I have combination skin, this oil doesn&#x27;t make my skin any oilier, in fact it absorbs into my skin perfectly, and leaves my skin feeling amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using another brand of Rosehip Oil, but was more than happy to try the Rosehip Oil from Dr. Song, as I am familiar with other products from this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oil comes in a 4 oz., blue glass bottle, with a dropper applicator. It dispenses just the right amount of oil, and the oil spreads easily. Rosehip Oil is extracted from rose bush seeds, and has high amounts of fatty acids, including linoleic, and linolenic. This oil has a nutty scent, which reminds me of hops, but the scent fads as the oil absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that Rosehip oil makes my skin look healthier, more radiant, and less tired. Plus, Dr. Song Rosehip Oil is 100% Pure Organic Virgin Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of forewarning, this is an oil, so there will be a period of about 10 minutes, where your skin will look shiny. However, as it absorbs into your skin, that look will dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given this product free as part of a review. All opinions are my own*</li>
            <li> I received one bottle of Dr. Song Rosehip Oil to review!  I can&#x27;t say it smells like roses, because it doesn&#x27;t.  It smells kind of like omega oils or Vitamin E.  It absorbs very quickly, so it does Not leave a greasy feeling.  It does leave your skin feeling super soft!  It has helped reduce my fine lines and has really moisturized my skin.  This is a great product and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is one of the best moisturizers for your skin, hair and nails.  It has an anti-aging benefit, due to the antioxidants and how it penetrates deep into the layers of skin.  People use it to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  It&#x27;s even used for acne and acne scars, due to the high levels of essential fatty acids.  Omega 3 and Omega 6 are important nutrients for healthy skin, it helps to repair the membranes.</li>
            <li> this product is a fantastic moisturizer!! it is also great for use on fine lines and wrinkles, with daily use you will see improvement in the lines and wrinkles. i would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a natural moisturizer or a natural solution for lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Dr. Song Rosehip Oil does not have a strong aroma, so you do not have to worry that you will be walking around smelling like a product. You can find information about Rosehip on WebMD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Dr. Song&#x27;s Rosehip Oil in a few ways, although it can be used in many other ways. I personally use it on my nails, which are brittle, thin, crack, have uneven surface, etc and so on. My nails are terribly difficult to take care of, as well as my cuticles. I make every attempt to keep them healthy but sometimes it becomes a real pain. Adding Dr. Song&#x27;s Rosehip Oil to my nails and cuticles has indeed strengthened them and has taken time off from constant care of them. I probably won&#x27;t ever have salon nails but they sure look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way I use Rosehip oil is for inflammation, especially during allergy season, or when my hands flare up from a combination of psoriatic arthritis, and typing a lot. Even just this morning I woke up with terrible inflammation on my face, around my nose, my nose itself, just pretty much everywhere on the lower part of my face from allergies, which always flare up at this time of the year for me. I put Dr. Song&#x27;s Rosehip Oil directly on the parts that felt swollen and inflamed and within fifteen minutes I felt a lot better. Its amazing how simple inflammation can disrupt your focus! I was not even able to focus on blogging before using Dr. Song&#x27;s so I decided I may as well show homage to the product by writing this review now, since this product is what helped me get that focus back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a whole list of ways Rosehip Oil can help and the Native American&#x27;s and Asian healers knew all about it, the history of the oil is quite interesting but I will let you google that for yourself if you are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this free to review but I stand by my reviews and do not recommend products that I do not personally use and love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a week now and I&#x27;m seeing some improvements. My dark spots.  are a bit lighter and my husband says, they are lighter. The oil works a moisturizer because it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth for long hours. The oil works to beat the signs of aging, sun spots, dry, rough, pigmentation, uneven skin tone and acne scars. It also helps smooth wrinkles and fine lines. If you have these problems, Dr. Song&#x27;s Rosehip Oil is a good product to try</li>
            <li> Dr. Song Rosehip Oil—Product Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently given some of Dr. Song’s Rosehip Oil to try! I love organic products, so I jumped at this opportunity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research on Rosehip Oil to learn about its benefits, and here’s what I found on the wiki page:&lt;br /&gt;It is commonly used in skin care products. It is commonly used for a variety of skin conditions, including dermatitis, acne and eczema, for mature and sun burnt skin as well as brittle nails and wrinkles. Rose hip oil is also frequently used to heal scarring and diminish photo-aging.[2]&lt;br /&gt;It quickly absorbs into the skin replenishing moisture and creates a protective barrier on the skin to help prevent dehydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I want to mention that this comes in a BIG 4. oz  pretty glass bottle with a dropper. It&#x27;s really nice! I expected rose hip oil to smell like…well, roses. But it doesn’t. While it has a scent to it, it’s not a bad scent, and doesn’t overpower my perfume or change the way it smells. It also absorbs into my skin quickly without leaving it greasy. I hate having to stand around half-naked waiting for lotions or serums to dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using this rose hip oil in two ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I’ve been adding it to my shea butter recipes to help lock moisture into the skin without any added greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I’ve been applying it to the stretch marks on my belly, and one of the scars on my hand. I’ve noticed a difference in the appearance of these marks/scars. My scar has lightened considerably, and my stretch marks have become slightly less ‘deep’-looking, and my skin is smoother. WIN! It’s not a miracle cure, but after twice-daily applications, my skin, in general, has a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product 9/10, and would definitely recommend this to anyone who has issues with dry skin, or wants something a little cheaper than the rest of the ‘scar creams’ on the market.</li>
            <li> Dr Song Organic Roseship Oil has many of uses. It does have a pretty strong smell but not as bad as  some. Personally I used this as a night time routine when I was going to bed, that way in the morning I could shower and be fresh for the day. I was applying this to acne marks and stretch marks. It was very easy to apply and not sticky or anything afterwards. This oil is a miracle worker and with time I know I will see even more results. If you read up about this oil you will see there are so many options and uses. I received this product in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> I mixed this with lotion and use it on my feet every night and it gets rid of scaly gross feet!</li>
            <li> I had received this Rosehip oil from Tomoson and Dr. Song for free in exchange for my honest review of the product. I have used this oil for 2 different things actually, for my face, and for my son&#x27;s eczema. In both cases it helped quite a bit. My face feels smoother, and the texture is more even now after using it for a few weeks. Also it has helped a little with my son&#x27;s eczema, the spots aren&#x27;t gone, but they are improving. For him I try to apply it to the areas twice a day, and for me, only after I wash my face. The bottle is a very good size too, very big compared to Rosehip oil I have gotten from other companies, so it&#x27;s a much better value than most. There are still so many different uses for Rosehip oil that I haven&#x27;t tried yet, it is a good oil for a bunch of natural remedies. Overall, I would recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great beauty oil. It feels great on the skin, absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy. Full review at http://beautybymitchypoo.com/2014/10/29/dr-song-rosehip-oil-review-3/</li>
            <li> The oil is so light, and absorbs into the skin immediately. Leaves skin very soft and smooth. Really like it. I&#x27;ve been using it on my body and eyes as well. I like knowing that it is a single organic ingredient, and not a huge list of chemicals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on some of my stretch marks and it seems to really be helping!</li>
