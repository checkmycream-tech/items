            <li> I use this product on myself, the dog and on my sheets and pillow cases.  It has a long lasting scent.  I hate that Victorias secret stop carrying this.  My small dog when I take him with me everyone says &amp;#34;Oh he smells so good&amp;#34; and they ask what I spray on him. :o)</li>
            <li> I loved this. Victoria&#x27;s secret discontinued this and I cant understand why... it smells like heaven. I thank this company for having the smarts to buy the last of discontinued quantities and sell them to gals like me that needed more and at a low cost.</li>
            <li> I use this airy fragrance every day!! I wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued. It is lasting and refreshing. They need to add this fragrance back!! LOOOOVVVVVEEEEE IIIIITTTTT!!!!</li>
            <li> The scent was very heavy &amp; over powering.  I have used other Mimosa colognes before and this was not at all what I expected.  I threw it out.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Smells like baby powder. It&#x27;s soft scent not over bearing just right. Nice and light, fresh, love love love!</li>
            <li> I actually ordered it for my sister it&#x27;s her favorite and the stores no longer carried it. So I did find research and found it here. She was very excited and so was I</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents! I wish they made is in a concentrated perfume. I keep a bottle in my purse so I can mist myself throughout the day. I prefer this over my expensive boutique fragrances! I&#x27;ll probably buy the body lotion soon so I can layer it nicely :D</li>
            <li> this reminds me my granpa, so i just have to say that it&#x27;s a beautiful fragrance. Thank you. . .</li>
            <li> I like this product.  it smells the most like Mimosa of all three colognes I tried, and, layered with the lotion, it seems to last pretty well.  I may try buying it at a store next time, even tho it will be more expensive.</li>
            <li> The perfect smell for any woman!</li>

            <li> My friend had bought this from Victoria Secret a while ago and she using it sparingly because it is no longer available.  One day I just happened to look on Amazon and I found it just in time for her Birthday.  She was SURPRISED and greatful.</li>
            <li> lucky me to be able to find my favorite splash spray for a reasonable price, I love Midnight Mirmosa, and found a good deal on a product not sold anymore....</li>

            <li> I actually found this perfume one time at a Victoria Secrets sale and I loved it,it has this light airy smell but it doesn&#x27;t fade like other mist tend to do. My mom is ecstatic with it too,she puts it on every day before she goes to work in the morning and when she comes home in the afternoon I have to ask if she sprayed it on again because like I said the scent really does stay.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product smells really good and not sure why VS stopped selling, recieved my order very quickly!</li>
