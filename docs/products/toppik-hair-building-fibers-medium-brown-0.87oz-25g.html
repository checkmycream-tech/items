            <li>Do your research, watch videos online, read the blogs; but nothing can prove how amazing Toppik is until you try it.</li>
            <li>Works great for a night at the bar or club where there is not to much light.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, I m glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li>It even helps kind of cover my gray hair at the roots.</li>
            <li>I can talk about the product and my own experience</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to apply with the spray attachment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best disguise I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>The best product for daily application on thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thinning on the top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not for someone with a lot of baldness, more for thinning hair and where you can see your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>; hope you&#x27;ll be as pleased as I am.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and have always been satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you leave it after applying it, it looks okay.</li>
            <li>I recommend putting some hair spray just so it can stick better.</li>
            <li>Love itüòç</li>
            <li>so I started looking for a better bargain and found it here.</li>
            <li>I have 2-3 spots on top of my head where the hair is thinning - and I don&#x27;t want to launch myself into getting hair plugs</li>
            <li>I ordered this and just love it.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I may bring it up if someone comments on one of my many hats I have to wear as sun protection.</li>
            <li>I love Toppik.</li>
            <li>and it was time consuming to cover the top of my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to work better and was easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I love Toppik and use it a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has it at such a great price!</li>
            <li>and I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Works like magic.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s literally magic how well this stuff covers up thinning spots.  </li>
            <li>The fibers are very light and will fly all over, so you need to hold the bottle near the area to be covered before shaking.  </li>
            <li>It certainly helps with the areas that need covering and it really works great!  </li>
            <li>I ordered the spray on top too, and maybe that is why it is so easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>I found the medium brown covers my scalp better than the light brown and blends better with my hair color and highlights.  </li>
            <li>It looks great and very natural.</li>
            <li>; A review for this kind of product can&#x27;t get much better than that, right?</li>
            <li>It provides very good coverage for moderately thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>ok not customer friendly product</li>
            <li>It washes out easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and stays put all day during work.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy and stays put until I wash it out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and helps cover up my embarrassing situation.</li>
            <li>As a woman, I have thinning hair at the top of my head which is more obvious when in sunlight or under bright lights.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe that I am sporting the mohawk I have always wanted, and it is ALL thanks to Toppik!</li>
            <li>so you  can see the back of your head is ideal, but while travelling i have used the front facing camera of my phone to help me make sure everything looks good on the back of my head.</li>
            <li>You might as well get a salt-shaker, fill it with finely ground garden dirt and shake it onto your hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>use this every day and it makes a huge difference, plus it bulks up the roots of your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes a huge diffference and I recommend it to anyone who has hair loss.</li>
            <li>this is such a great product...</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s a good product and one bottle lasts a long time because it&#x27;s a very fine powder</li>
            <li>sure to get the right color, too light</li>
            <li>It easily and quickly covers up thinning spots and doesn&#x27;t come off until I shampoo my hair.  </li>
            <li>Amazon also has a pump that screws onto the Toppik bottle and you can direct the powder better to the areas where you need it most.  </li>
            <li>Good coverup for specific areas lacking in fullness.  </li>
            <li>I started purchasing from Amazon and found the product more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was cheaper, but it certainly works for me!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone with thinning hair as a quick fix.</li>
            <li>This is one product that actually works BETTER than advertised!</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>i also brush it to  blend more naturally with the rest of my hair, (still wearing the towel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is superior to other brands.</li>
            <li>Perfectly satisfied with this product,  this product is just exactly what I needed to cover a natural part in my hair,</li>
            <li>This product only takes a little bit to shake on my head, and it disguises the thinning hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li>the large size), one at work and then the smallest container in my purse!</li>
            <li>My wife uses the product and likes very much.</li>
            <li>It actually works better on longer hair than shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do and doesn&#x27;t cake on your hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve checked it seven ways till sunday before leaving the house and it&#x27;s too obvious most of the time.</li>
            <li>I depend on Toppik daily to help me disguise the thinning on the top of my head and avoid embarassment.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t want to apply more than necessary.  </li>
            <li>It really does the job!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really stop!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Toppik!</li>
            <li>This is a product that I was sceptical about when I first heard it advertised.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t really need very much to do the job.</li>
            <li>Then not so much will come out and you will have better control and it will last much longer.</li>
            <li>, you tap it gently, moving it where you can see your scalp.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but it really does add thickness and volume.  </li>
            <li>very well.  </li>
            <li>It covers up the areas really well.  </li>
            <li>I really needed to do something.</li>
            <li>Thank God this product was introduced to me, it really has changed my life.</li>
            <li>It really covers all of those sparse spots.&lt;br /&gt;You can not beat the price.</li>
            <li>If you shake it near your front hairline, you may have to wipe a dusting off your forehead with a tissue, but it comes right off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s so much better than the other things that I tried.  </li>
            <li>Not too cool for a female.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty natural and stays in place all day.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t doubt that they will make more shades, but it looks like a black yamaka, not hair.</li>
            <li>I paid more for half this size at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>it really looks amazingly natural.</li>
            <li>My husband cannot live without it nowÔºÅ</li>
            <li>I Couldn&#x27;t live without it , my friend told me to try it</li>
            <li>And it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended Toppik highly and I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li>I started losing my hair at a very young age.</li>
            <li>/&gt;new life, back youth ;)</li>
            <li>Toppik really helps with filling in bare spots created by thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Buy a shade lighter than your natural color.</li>
            <li>Then if you attempt to use your fingers to blend it - a natural reaction to seeing what looks like coffee grains on your scalp - it just disappears completely.</li>
            <li>It makes the difference between looking nearly bald and having hair.  </li>
            <li>cuz u was upset that I&#x27;m losing hair at a young age and being a woman.</li>
            <li>It does the job and not messy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed a bald spot because of a DLE diagnosis (skin lupus) and this product completely covers it.</li>
            <li>Okay, here is what how you use this product: Do not peel off the sticky film under the lid, instead use a matte knife to cut out a triangle shaped piece, so that the film looks like a pizza with one big slice missing.</li>
            <li>I get almost more than twice the product for only a few $ more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I really liked how Toppik camouflages my thin spots.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it would be the right product if you actually have a big bald spot because it needs some hair to stick to in order for the hair to look fuller.  </li>
            <li>:  product be messy at first until you learn how to apply it, you need hairspray to lock in the product, if you have a spot that is totally bald, this may not work very well</li>
            <li>and it will look odd, but better too dark than light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, you generally need the Toppik hairspray in conjunction with this to meld the fibers to the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>You just need to be careful not to sprinkle too much at one time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and also adds a certain amount of color, which allows me to stretch out the time between those expensive salon coloring sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does take a little practice to get it dispersed just right.</li>
            <li>The only down side is the cost, but for me it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>In areas with significant thinning I have to be careful to not over-apply or it sticks to my scalp and looks odd.  </li>
            <li>have to admit, though, there are less expensive products that do just as good a job, if not better because they don&#x27;t have that slight greenish tint that I can see in a certain light, in the medium brown color that I use.</li>
            <li>Application is easy and the product does cover thin spots well.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d get as much coverage putting a little brown eyeshadow on your head.</li>
            <li>My fine, thin hair is growing slightly thinner as I grow older</li>
            <li>Been using it for 2 years and it makes a huge difference in the appearance of my thin hair.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has it at such a great price!</li>
            <li> and I love the product.  </li>
            <li> Works like magic.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally magic how well this stuff covers up thinning spots.  </li>
            <li> The fibers are very light and will fly all over, so you need to hold the bottle near the area to be covered before shaking.  </li>
            <li> It certainly helps with the areas that need covering and it really works great!  </li>
            <li> I ordered the spray on top too, and maybe that is why it is so easy to put on.  </li>
            <li> I found the medium brown covers my scalp better than the light brown and blends better with my hair color and highlights.  </li>
            <li> It looks great and very natural.</li>
            <li> ; A review for this kind of product can&#x27;t get much better than that, right?</li>
            <li> It provides very good coverage for moderately thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> ok not customer friendly product</li>
            <li> It washes out easily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and stays put all day during work.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy and stays put until I wash it out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and helps cover up my embarrassing situation.</li>
            <li> As a woman, I have thinning hair at the top of my head which is more obvious when in sunlight or under bright lights.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe that I am sporting the mohawk I have always wanted, and it is ALL thanks to Toppik!</li>
            <li> so you  can see the back of your head is ideal, but while travelling i have used the front facing camera of my phone to help me make sure everything looks good on the back of my head.</li>
            <li> You might as well get a salt-shaker, fill it with finely ground garden dirt and shake it onto your hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> use this every day and it makes a huge difference, plus it bulks up the roots of your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes a huge diffference and I recommend it to anyone who has hair loss.</li>
            <li> this is such a great product...</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s a good product and one bottle lasts a long time because it&#x27;s a very fine powder</li>
            <li> sure to get the right color, too light</li>
            <li> It easily and quickly covers up thinning spots and doesn&#x27;t come off until I shampoo my hair.  </li>
            <li> Amazon also has a pump that screws onto the Toppik bottle and you can direct the powder better to the areas where you need it most.  </li>
            <li> Good coverup for specific areas lacking in fullness.  </li>
            <li> I started purchasing from Amazon and found the product more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was cheaper, but it certainly works for me!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with thinning hair as a quick fix.</li>
            <li> This is one product that actually works BETTER than advertised!</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> i also brush it to  blend more naturally with the rest of my hair, (still wearing the towel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is superior to other brands.</li>
            <li> Perfectly satisfied with this product,  this product is just exactly what I needed to cover a natural part in my hair,</li>
            <li> This product only takes a little bit to shake on my head, and it disguises the thinning hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> the large size), one at work and then the smallest container in my purse!</li>
            <li> My wife uses the product and likes very much.</li>
            <li> It actually works better on longer hair than shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do and doesn&#x27;t cake on your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve checked it seven ways till sunday before leaving the house and it&#x27;s too obvious most of the time.</li>
            <li> I depend on Toppik daily to help me disguise the thinning on the top of my head and avoid embarassment.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t want to apply more than necessary.  </li>
            <li> It really does the job!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really stop!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Toppik!</li>
            <li> This is a product that I was sceptical about when I first heard it advertised.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t really need very much to do the job.</li>
            <li> Then not so much will come out and you will have better control and it will last much longer.</li>
            <li> , you tap it gently, moving it where you can see your scalp.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but it really does add thickness and volume.  </li>
            <li> very well.  </li>
            <li> It covers up the areas really well.  </li>
            <li> I really needed to do something.</li>
            <li> Thank God this product was introduced to me, it really has changed my life.</li>
            <li> It really covers all of those sparse spots.&lt;br /&gt;You can not beat the price.</li>
            <li> If you shake it near your front hairline, you may have to wipe a dusting off your forehead with a tissue, but it comes right off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s so much better than the other things that I tried.  </li>
            <li> Not too cool for a female.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty natural and stays in place all day.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t doubt that they will make more shades, but it looks like a black yamaka, not hair.</li>
            <li> I paid more for half this size at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> it really looks amazingly natural.</li>
            <li> My husband cannot live without it nowÔºÅ</li>
            <li> I Couldn&#x27;t live without it , my friend told me to try it</li>
            <li> And it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended Toppik highly and I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li> I started losing my hair at a very young age.</li>
            <li> /&gt;new life, back youth ;)</li>
            <li> Toppik really helps with filling in bare spots created by thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Buy a shade lighter than your natural color.</li>
            <li> Then if you attempt to use your fingers to blend it - a natural reaction to seeing what looks like coffee grains on your scalp - it just disappears completely.</li>
            <li> It makes the difference between looking nearly bald and having hair.  </li>
            <li> cuz u was upset that I&#x27;m losing hair at a young age and being a woman.</li>
            <li> It does the job and not messy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed a bald spot because of a DLE diagnosis (skin lupus) and this product completely covers it.</li>
            <li> Okay, here is what how you use this product: Do not peel off the sticky film under the lid, instead use a matte knife to cut out a triangle shaped piece, so that the film looks like a pizza with one big slice missing.</li>
            <li> I get almost more than twice the product for only a few $ more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I really liked how Toppik camouflages my thin spots.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it would be the right product if you actually have a big bald spot because it needs some hair to stick to in order for the hair to look fuller.  </li>
            <li> :  product be messy at first until you learn how to apply it, you need hairspray to lock in the product, if you have a spot that is totally bald, this may not work very well</li>
            <li> and it will look odd, but better too dark than light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, you generally need the Toppik hairspray in conjunction with this to meld the fibers to the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> You just need to be careful not to sprinkle too much at one time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and also adds a certain amount of color, which allows me to stretch out the time between those expensive salon coloring sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice to get it dispersed just right.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the cost, but for me it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> In areas with significant thinning I have to be careful to not over-apply or it sticks to my scalp and looks odd.  </li>
            <li> have to admit, though, there are less expensive products that do just as good a job, if not better because they don&#x27;t have that slight greenish tint that I can see in a certain light, in the medium brown color that I use.</li>
            <li> Application is easy and the product does cover thin spots well.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d get as much coverage putting a little brown eyeshadow on your head.</li>
            <li> My fine, thin hair is growing slightly thinner as I grow older</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 years and it makes a huge difference in the appearance of my thin hair.</li>
            <li> And, if I am going to cover the area near my forehead, I tilt my head back slightly so the fibers don&#x27;t end up on my forehead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should say the spot is not completely bald because Toppik needs some hair to stick to, but I must have enough there for it to work.</li>
            <li> can last a surprisingly long time.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and I use it daily.  </li>
            <li> Covers the thin spots and give you hair a full appearance.</li>
            <li> Messy and didn&#x27;t look very natural.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d love to recommend this to her, but that&#x27;s an awkward convo, no?</li>
            <li> As long as your expectations are in line</li>
            <li> bought it for my mom, who have been using toppik for long time now</li>
            <li> I use it after I wash and dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered medium brown, which was actually almost black.</li>
            <li> The only criticism is that it can be a little messy to apply, but with continued use, it becomes easier as you learn the dynamic of the product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thinning a bit and the part was getting too wide.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the aerosol spray because you had to be so careful not to get overspray on your clothes.  </li>
            <li> Got it sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Be careful to &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; into place</li>
            <li> This product really does cover thin spots in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Like hair coloring products, finding the right color can be difficult.</li>
            <li> wash my hair every other day, but I rinse it with water on the day I do not use shampoo, as Toppik can come off on your pillow.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a small price to pay, though, for a product that actually does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> I used two other products before trying Toppik Hair Building Fibers.</li>
            <li> He was trying other powders and couldn&#x27;t wear it to the gym or in the rain because of drips.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but never with the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> Now, whenever I&#x27;m shwingin&#x27; with the other swingers, they can&#x27;t tell my age from my weaponry.</li>
            <li> and it will do nothing, too dark</li>
            <li> If the color is too dark, you can see it.  </li>
            <li> Got product very quickly, but I ordered medium brown and received dark brown. :(</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; is not the operative word, BLACK is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> one drawback is that it tends to come off a bit on the pillowcases, so I&#x27;m doing laundry a little oftener.  </li>
            <li> I use a little hair spray to help hold it in place.  </li>
            <li> I used to have very thick hair and was so sad when my hair started to thin out on top.  </li>
            <li> it looks completely natural, and believe me i was totally skeptical before using it.</li>
            <li> few precautions...</li>
            <li> this stuff is MESSY.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think can be avoided, is the powder can make your hair look a little dull at the roots, but the alternative would be the appearance of  thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Toppik for the past couple of years, and it is a must-have product for me.  </li>
            <li> It looks fake close up but if finessed just so and used under proper lighting - it might not be detectable.</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> I have a spot that is thinning at the crown of my head and this works unbelievable at covering it up.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Joan Rivers product, but it was hard to apply, you had to use a brush.  </li>
            <li> bought the attachment which at least gives some level of control.</li>
            <li> have seen one negative review</li>
            <li> One negative</li>
            <li> The brush on powder does work for small areas, but my hair continued to thin</li>
            <li> The reviews that I read only had one bad review.</li>
            <li> I can simply say I am disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> You have to sprinkle and not touch - very hard to get right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so a few shakes of this and problem solved !!!</li>
            <li> sprinkle it on and covers all thin areas.....</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that has some thinning hair or a thin spot that they want to conceal.  </li>
            <li> My stylist told me about Toppik when she noticed how thin my hair was getting to be.</li>
            <li> It covers my scalp so my hair doesn&#x27;t look thin anymore.  </li>
            <li> My pubic area began to thin out and turn gray.</li>
            <li> you wind up with a dirty looking scalp and dull, dusty hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> All it does is coat your scalp with a nasty dark residue.</li>
            <li> (grrr.....!)  </li>
            <li> The Joan Rivers product was the worst.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is great for men and women that have thinning hair......sprinkle it on and covers all thin areas.....doesn&#x27;t come off until you wash your hair.....highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Toppik for the past couple of years, and it is a must-have product for me.  It easily and quickly covers up thinning spots and doesn&#x27;t come off until I shampoo my hair.  With Toppik, I can put off the inevitable (a wig, in all likelihood) for at least a few years more.  The only down side is the cost, but for me it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I buy this product on a regular basis!  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  It helps hide the thinning areas on the front and crown and has done wonders for my self confidence knowing people can&#x27;t see my scalp.</li>
            <li> The only con to this product is that for me, I have to have someone else apply it.  Otherwise, it works great at concealing balding spots or making the hair appear thicker.  It actually works better on longer hair than shorter hair.  Also, you generally need the Toppik hairspray in conjunction with this to meld the fibers to the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> Works great once you get the knack of using it.  Undetectable, a very good product.</li>
            <li> The best product for daily application on thinning hair.  It washes out easily.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely incredible! This is one product that actually works BETTER than advertised! Do your research, watch videos online, read the blogs; but nothing can prove how amazing Toppik is until you try it. I honestly can&#x27;t believe that I am sporting the mohawk I have always wanted, and it is ALL thanks to Toppik! Just try it! You will be amazed... and glad you did!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I m glad I discovered it. Toppik is doing a great job for me. My hair is thinning on the top. For now I can cover it up and not worry about having a shinney scalp.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!! It covers your scalp and seems to make your hair seem fuller. I no longer worry that people will see my balding head. It even helps kind of cover my gray hair at the roots. I really do love Toppik! It works great!</li>
            <li> I can simply say I am disappointed with this product. It falls through to your scalp, itches, and comes out under your finger nails when you scratch your head. I did not see where it attached to my hair, it just colored my scalp to match my hair.</li>
            <li> Okay, here is what how you use this product: Do not peel off the sticky film under the lid, instead use a matte knife to cut out a triangle shaped piece, so that the film looks like a pizza with one big slice missing. Then not so much will come out and you will have better control and it will last much longer. You do not shake it on to the roots of your hair where you can see the scalp, you tap it gently, moving it where you can see your scalp. If you shake it near your front hairline, you may have to wipe a dusting off your forehead with a tissue, but it comes right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day and it makes a huge difference, plus it bulks up the roots of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not for someone with a lot of baldness, more for thinning hair and where you can see your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to get the right color, too light and it will do nothing, too dark and it will look odd, but better too dark than light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair every other day, but I rinse it with water on the day I do not use shampoo, as Toppik can come off on your pillow.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do and doesn&#x27;t cake on your hair.  And it looks very natural. Buy a shade lighter than your natural color.</li>
            <li> It looks fake close up but if finessed just so and used under proper lighting - it might not be detectable. I think people who think it&#x27;s not visible have vision issues - I&#x27;ve checked it seven ways till sunday before leaving the house and it&#x27;s too obvious most of the time. Then if you attempt to use your fingers to blend it - a natural reaction to seeing what looks like coffee grains on your scalp - it just disappears completely. You have to sprinkle and not touch - very hard to get right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the attachment which at least gives some level of control. I would not buy this again. You&#x27;d get as much coverage putting a little brown eyeshadow on your head.</li>
            <li> scratch scalp if i leave it longer than 12 hours. but it does the job. hide spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It totally works and fills in the hair that I&#x27;ve lost.  It makes the difference between looking nearly bald and having hair.  I recommend this to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I use it every day &amp; find it to be a great product. I would recommend this product to all my friends in need of it.</li>
            <li> This product is superior to other brands. I have tried them all and for me this is the best. Been using it for 2 years and it makes a huge difference in the appearance of my thin hair.</li>
            <li> My fine, thin hair is growing slightly thinner as I grow older (grrr.....!)  A friend recommended Toppik highly and I was pleasantly surprised with the results.

That&#x27;s a small price to pay, though, for a product that actually does what it says it will do.  Do give it a try; hope you&#x27;ll be as pleased as I am.</li>
            <li> I depend on Toppik daily to help me disguise the thinning on the top of my head and avoid embarassment.  It provides very good coverage for moderately thinning hair.  In areas with significant thinning I have to be careful to not over-apply or it sticks to my scalp and looks odd.  As long as your expectations are in line and you don&#x27;t expect it to be a hair replacement you should be happy with this product.  It&#x27;s the best disguise I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; is not the operative word, BLACK is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t doubt that they will make more shades, but it looks like a black yamaka, not hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time - covers my &amp;#34;white shiny spots&amp;#34; very well.  It is easy to apply and stays put all day during work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and have always been satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Good coverup for specific areas lacking in fullness.  It covers up the areas really well.  It does take a little practice to get it dispersed just right.</li>
            <li> My husband cannot live without it nowÔºÅ He uses it every morning before he goes to work. Everyone is amazed by his hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since around 2002 and couldn&#x27;t go a day without it. It gives me a sense of confidence!</li>
            <li> This is the only product of this sort that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;If you try to blend it in it blotches.&lt;br /&gt;If you leave it after applying it, it looks okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 14 years. GREAT PRODUCT! I only found out recently that I can get it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> ok not customer friendly product</li>
            <li> I used to use another brand, but the next morning all my head started to scratch,&lt;br /&gt;but this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;new life, back youth ;)</li>
            <li> Pros:  masks thinning areas, color matches well, covers areas well&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  product be messy at first until you learn how to apply it, you need hairspray to lock in the product, if you have a spot that is totally bald, this may not work very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the applicator.</li>
            <li> Works great for a night at the bar or club where there is not to much light.I recommend putting some hair spray just so it can stick better.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, arrived on time and price was lower than others, per my research.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my mom, who have been using toppik for long time now and she says it is great.</li>
            <li> This is great! I Couldn&#x27;t live without it , my friend told me to try it cuz u was upset that I&#x27;m losing hair at a young age and being a woman. I use it after I wash and dry my hair. I keep it in my purse. Love itüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç</li>
            <li> Love!  this product.  Would recommend to everyone who has thinning hair.</li>
            <li> As we age our hair thins, this product is the best. Covers the thin spots and give you hair a full appearance. Would not be without.&lt;br /&gt;Just Love It !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfectly satisfied with this product,  this product is just exactly what I needed to cover a natural part in my hair,</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that has some thinning hair or a thin spot that they want to conceal.  It does the job and not messy at all.</li>
            <li> This product does help to conceal the white scalp that peeps through thinning hair.  I am hoping just a temporary thing.  I would recommend it for this purpose.....</li>
            <li> very good... excelent thank</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST secrets that I have.  My hair is thinning a bit and the part was getting too wide.  This did a great job of hiding the thinning!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My stylist told me about Toppik when she noticed how thin my hair was getting to be. She purchased the 0.36oz/10.3g for me from the local beauty supply. Even with her discount it was almost $25. But I really liked how Toppik camouflages my thin spots. Only a couple of people have noticed that there is something different with my hair. Only one person realized what the difference was, and only because she&#x27;d also used Toppik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toppik is now a must-have product for me so I started looking for a better bargain and found it here. I get almost more than twice the product for only a few $ more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend Toppik to anyone.</li>
            <li> If the color is too dark, you can see it.  Otherwise, it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Would be lost without it!</li>
            <li> I only buy this on Amazon. Great price!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for men and women who have thinning hair.  I use it because I have bald spots in my hair.  Not too cool for a female.</li>
            <li> The fibers work well and definitely give your hair a fuller appearance.  You just need to be careful not to sprinkle too much at one time.  It&#x27;s expensive so you don&#x27;t want to apply more than necessary.  The fibers are very light and will fly all over, so you need to hold the bottle near the area to be covered before shaking.  And, if I am going to cover the area near my forehead, I tilt my head back slightly so the fibers don&#x27;t end up on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, though, there are less expensive products that do just as good a job, if not better because they don&#x27;t have that slight greenish tint that I can see in a certain light, in the medium brown color that I use.</li>
            <li> Very Good quality and very good  product. Easy to use. Worth the money and yes Yes I&#x27;d definitly buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Toppik really helps with filling in bare spots created by thinning hair.  However, I can&#x27;t apply it evenly and it seems to cover my counter with the fibers.  I wish it were easier to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> Got product very quickly, but I ordered medium brown and received dark brown. :(</li>
            <li> So I have used this product for years and swear by it. I started losing my hair at a very young age. By the time I was in my 50&#x27;s I really needed to do something. Thank God this product was introduced to me, it really has changed my life. I can now get dressed and go out with confidence because all I need to is spray my hair with hair spray and then add this product to the spots that are balding. It makes a huge diffference and I recommend it to anyone who has hair loss. I  uaw it every day and no one knows I use anything!&lt;br /&gt;I have seen one negative review but I don&#x27;t think she was using it correctly, otherwise she would not have had those issues. Also you must use the color that&#x27;s closest to your hair color and you will have wonderful results!!</li>
            <li> You might as well get a salt-shaker, fill it with finely ground garden dirt and shake it onto your hair. All it does is coat your scalp with a nasty dark residue. I ordered medium brown, which was actually almost black. It does nothing to thicken your hair or even give the appearance of thicker hair. you wind up with a dirty looking scalp and dull, dusty hair. A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a life saver !!  I have 2-3 spots on top of my head where the hair is thinning - and I don&#x27;t want to launch myself into getting hair plugs so a few shakes of this and problem solved !!!</li>
            <li> Product does what is says it will do and covers sparse areas.  It looks pretty natural and stays in place all day.  The only criticism is that it can be a little messy to apply, but with continued use, it becomes easier as you learn the dynamic of the product.  I would recommend it to anyone with thinning hair as a quick fix.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and just love it.  It is easy and stays put until I wash it out.  I used to use Joan Rivers product, but it was hard to apply, you had to use a brush.  I ordered the spray on top too, and maybe that is why it is so easy to put on.  It covers my scalp so my hair doesn&#x27;t look thin anymore.  I used to have very thick hair and was so sad when my hair started to thin out on top.  This does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed a bald spot because of a DLE diagnosis (skin lupus) and this product completely covers it. I should say the spot is not completely bald because Toppik needs some hair to stick to, but I must have enough there for it to work. I have a friend with thinning hair all over her head and I&#x27;d love to recommend this to her, but that&#x27;s an awkward convo, no? Like \\&quot;Sweetie, would you like to try my acne cream?\\&quot; I may bring it up if someone comments on one of my many hats I have to wear as sun protection. I can talk about the product and my own experience and maybe she&#x27;ll ask about it. Good idea, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this is a great product that performs as promised.</li>
            <li> My wife uses the product and likes very much. Like hair coloring products, finding the right color can be difficult.</li>
            <li> I love Toppik. It looks great and very natural. It is also very easy to apply with the spray attachment.</li>
            <li> It really does the job! I am a woman with thinning hair.  I use the medium brown and it stays in until I shampoo my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off on my pillows and the .87 oz can last a surprisingly long time.  I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s so much better than the other things that I tried.  The Joan Rivers product was the worst.  It rubbed off on my pillows and the headrest in my car.</li>
            <li> I have fine thinning hair.  I used two other products before trying Toppik Hair Building Fibers. I used a color spray aerosol and a brush on powder.  I didn&#x27;t care for the aerosol spray because you had to be so careful not to get overspray on your clothes.  The brush on powder does work for small areas, but my hair continued to thin and it was time consuming to cover the top of my scalp.  This powder was suggested by a sales clerk at a beauty supply store.  It seemed to work better and was easier to use.  If I had a choice, I would like not to use any product, but I don&#x27;t want my scalp showing so I am very happy to have a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;  I started purchasing from Amazon and found the product more reasonably priced.  Amazon also has a pump that screws onto the Toppik bottle and you can direct the powder better to the areas where you need it most.  I use a little hair spray to help hold it in place.  I found the medium brown covers my scalp better than the light brown and blends better with my hair color and highlights.  I would be lost without this product.  One negative I don&#x27;t think can be avoided, is the powder can make your hair look a little dull at the roots, but the alternative would be the appearance of  thinning hair.  I order the refills and re-use my container.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who wanted to try it, but couldn&#x27;t find it in stock locally. He loves it! He was trying other powders and couldn&#x27;t wear it to the gym or in the rain because of drips. He says this cover so much better and no drips! To quote him &amp;#34;I feel like I have my hair back!&amp;#34; A review for this kind of product can&#x27;t get much better than that, right?</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me to try and now I sort of wish she hadn&#x27;t because now that I&#x27;ve started using it I can&#x27;t really stop!  I feel like if I stop using it people will start asking if I&#x27;ve suddenly lost a lot of hair!  Anyway, it&#x27;s a good product and one bottle lasts a long time because it&#x27;s a very fine powder and you don&#x27;t really need very much to do the job.</li>
            <li> Good product for thinning hair.  It disguises thinning by adding color to scalp.  You need to pick a color closes to your hair color.  The product adheres to your scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I love Toppik and use it a lot. It&#x27;s so easy to use and it&#x27;s great for thinning hair. It really covers all of those sparse spots.&lt;br /&gt;You can not beat the price. I paid more for half this size at a beauty supply store. I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has it at such a great price!</li>
            <li> Got it sooner than expected and I love the product.  What a difference when you use the product.  Makes your hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> Messy and didn&#x27;t look very natural. Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to apply it or maybe I don&#x27;t have enough hair to make it work.</li>
            <li> Great product for covering up thinning hair</li>
            <li> Application is easy and the product does cover thin spots well. It is a great confidence booster. Be careful to &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; into place or you will end up with it on your brush.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but never with the results I wanted. Toppik is the best. Just the results I wanted. Works like magic.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It certainly helps with the areas that need covering and it really works great!  Buy it!</li>
            <li> I love Toppik and am always happy with the results.  It lasts a long time and I use it daily.  I received it ahead of schedule and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> My pubic area began to thin out and turn gray. Body of a boy, junk of an octogenarian. No more. Now, whenever I&#x27;m shwingin&#x27; with the other swingers, they can&#x27;t tell my age from my weaponry. Thanks Toppik!</li>
            <li> This is really a great product as it fills in those areas where I&#x27;m losing hair...mainly on top of my head.  I share my &amp;#34;discovery&amp;#34; with anyone that I meet that has the same thinning that I have.  I keep one at home (the large size), one at work and then the smallest container in my purse! Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 4 years now.  I love it so much.  Easy to apply and helps cover up my embarrassing situation.</li>
            <li> I have a spot that is thinning at the crown of my head and this works unbelievable at covering it up.  It&#x27;s literally magic how well this stuff covers up thinning spots.  I don&#x27;t know if it would be the right product if you actually have a big bald spot because it needs some hair to stick to in order for the hair to look fuller.  Overall this product is a life saver/ confidence restorer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! Takes 2 seconds to apply.  This a must have for someone that has thinning hair, what a difference!</li>
            <li> This is a product that I was sceptical about when I first heard it advertised. The reviews that I read only had one bad review. I think that it works well for me.</li>
            <li> As a woman, I have thinning hair at the top of my head which is more obvious when in sunlight or under bright lights. This product only takes a little bit to shake on my head, and it disguises the thinning hair wonderfully. Wish it was cheaper, but it certainly works for me!!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This product really does cover thin spots in your hair.  It makes your existing look thicker.  I love it!  Try it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> this is such a great product... you have to have thinning hair, not be totally bald for this to work properly. it really looks amazingly natural. the first time you apply it, you stare at the mirror and say OMG!!!!! i look great!!! it looks completely natural, and believe me i was totally skeptical before using it. it stays in place even on windy and humid days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few precautions...this stuff is MESSY. i found the best way to apply it is to not wear a shirt and drape a towel over your shoulders as it get everywhere. i also brush it to  blend more naturally with the rest of my hair, (still wearing the towel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have two mirrors so you  can see the back of your head is ideal, but while travelling i have used the front facing camera of my phone to help me make sure everything looks good on the back of my head.</li>
