            <li>Very nice product.  </li>
            <li>very nice moisturizing gloves</li>
            <li>my granddaughter tried to escape with them -- I had to promise to get her her own pair.  </li>
            <li>She has already worn them and loves them; they keep her hands warm at night.</li>
            <li>I had a pair and loved it, so I got three more for myself and my daughters.  </li>
            <li>just keeps hands nice and warm.</li>
            <li>Liked the pair I got as a gift</li>
            <li>even my nails appear to be in better shape.  </li>
            <li>and I love them for the function</li>
            <li>I so much love these gloves.</li>
            <li>These gloves are So soft and fit amazing!!</li>
            <li>As far as customer service goes, I am completely happy with it.  </li>
            <li>They will send the products which were new sealed and good conditioned products.</li>
            <li>Extremely comfortable.  </li>
            <li>They loved how soft they were as well.  </li>
            <li>My wife has two pair and used with hand cream when sleeping, they keep her hands nice and soft.</li>
            <li>as a diabetic, I am very happy to have found something so helpful and relatively inexpensive and simple to use.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>ways they are very comfortable and eliminate the pain - - - with lotion or ointment applied before putting them on they leave you with softer and more comfortable hands by morning ......and a lot less pain.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I apply my own hand cream at bedtime and wear the gloves all night long.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that this is just a personal preference issue, and maybe some ladies like the &amp;#34;furry&amp;#34; feel, but for me they just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Someone with big hands would not be able to wear these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be contacting Amazon customer service and my CC company to make sure I either get a replacement pair or my money back.</li>
            <li>The gloves however-not so much.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really moisturize.</li>
            <li>These gloves are very luxurious and silky.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I suppose many, sleep with one hand or the other under the side of my face, sometimes over the pillow, but now it must be always UNDER the pillow to keep the shedding feeling.</li>
            <li>I am able to put my lotion and other cream on and it doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li>The gloves heal super dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li>it does not appear to have effected the gloves at all other than making them clean again.  </li>
            <li>these are wonderfully soft.  </li>
            <li>problems: first the elastic stretched out then holes formed in between the fingers</li>
            <li>1) I have worn these 3 nights so far and do not feel that my hands have improved at all.  </li>
            <li>my wife purchased these at whole foods and her latex allergy came roaring back.</li>
            <li>My wife said to use them as her two pair are over a year old and have never had a problem.</li>
            <li>As per our shipping department you received the product was directly came from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>looked kind of thin.</li>
            <li>The gloves are small and fit her tiny hands well.</li>
            <li>and my kids use them as well, I will be buying me another pair in the near future.</li>
            <li>I looked at other gloves to replace them, but decided to stay with the same brand due to its softness and fit.</li>
            <li>so well I was glad to purchase a pair for one of my friends who suffers from dry, chapped hands like me as they really work!</li>
            <li>Not very long lasting.</li>
            <li>although very soft, they make me sneeze and tickle my nose due to their &amp;#34;furry&amp;#34; texture.  </li>

            <li> these are wonderfully soft.  my granddaughter tried to escape with them -- I had to promise to get her her own pair.  I put heavy creamy lotion on and pull on these gloves for a while so it soaks in.  it works wonders, I would guess it doubles the effectiveness of the lotion.  I have washed them with a load of laundry.  it does not appear to have effected the gloves at all other than making them clean again.  even my nails appear to be in better shape.  as a diabetic, I am very happy to have found something so helpful and relatively inexpensive and simple to use.</li>
            <li> I ordered them to help soothe the eczema on my hands while I sleep. These gloves are So soft and fit amazing!! They work great I just received a pair and I love them for the function however the quality may not be 100%  the pair I received had some missed stitching which resulted in a Dime sized hole! I will probably order another pair and hope there is no holes or other flaws.</li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable.  I apply my own hand cream at bedtime and wear the gloves all night long.  Would recommend to anyone in need of this item.</li>
            <li> Work great.  Not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Winter time, cold weather  and doing dishes wreaks havoc with my hands.  They  chap, crack, get rough, and they ache all day long and wake me up during the night.  I decided to try these gloves....both without ointment/lotion applied first.....and with.&lt;br /&gt;Both ways they are very comfortable and eliminate the pain - - - with lotion or ointment applied before putting them on they leave you with softer and more comfortable hands by morning ......and a lot less pain.  Best of all, the ointment or lotion you use stays inside the glove....and does not get spread around the bed.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I could quit doing dishes......but that&#x27;s only a dream.  Wearing these at  night makes sense.</li>
            <li> I so much love these gloves. We all in the family use them. even my fidgety teenager likes them.&lt;br /&gt;a great product at a great price, with packaging and delivery just as good.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these product to anybody. Even if you think you do not need them.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy them, they are affordable, I use them as &amp;#34;preventive care&amp;#34; for my hands. and my kids use them as well, I will be buying me another pair in the near future.</li>
            <li> before they fell apart they were great. problems: first the elastic stretched out then holes formed in between the fingers</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Quality exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> They work great! Put on a heavy lotion then leave these gloves on overnight. The gloves heal super dry, cracked skin. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have had aloe gloves before, and they were great.  These did not help at all, and the threads started coming loose after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> As far as customer service goes, I am completely happy with it.  The gloves however-not so much. 1) I have worn these 3 nights so far and do not feel that my hands have improved at all.  I don&#x27;t feel, smell or see any aloe vera inside the glove 2) for wearing at night in bed while sleeping, I find the outer texture to be, although very soft, they make me sneeze and tickle my nose due to their &amp;#34;furry&amp;#34; texture.  Since I, and I suppose many, sleep with one hand or the other under the side of my face, sometimes over the pillow, but now it must be always UNDER the pillow to keep the shedding feeling. (again, I think it&#x27;s just a feeling and not that they actually do shed) that I get from the outside texture.  I am sure that this is just a personal preference issue, and maybe some ladies like the &amp;#34;furry&amp;#34; feel, but for me they just don&#x27;t work.  I will be giving them away.</li>
            <li> These gloves were purchased as a gift for my wife for Christmas. She has already worn them and loves them; they keep her hands warm at night. Not sure about the moisturizing effect, but they are definitely made from soft material. The gloves are small and fit her tiny hands well. Someone with big hands would not be able to wear these.</li>
            <li> very nice moisturizing gloves</li>
            <li> I ordered three pairs of these gloves.  I had a pair and loved it, so I got three more for myself and my daughters.  They loved how soft they were as well.  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> if you have a latex allergy - don&#x27;t get these. my wife purchased these at whole foods and her latex allergy came roaring back.</li>
            <li> I got these because my hands are very dry to the point they crack and bleed. My wife has two pair and used with hand cream when sleeping, they keep her hands nice and soft. I got the gloves and the material at the two of finger tips looked kind of thin. My wife said to use them as her two pair are over a year old and have never had a problem. So I put hand cream on then the gloves. When I woke up two of my fingers tips were sticking out of the gloves after wearing them only once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller and got this email when asking how to return the defective gloves:Thank you for contacting us. As per our shipping department you received the product was directly came from the manufacturer. They will send the products which were new sealed and good conditioned products. we will not accept the returns as used or opened products.&lt;br /&gt;We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this regards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be contacting Amazon customer service and my CC company to make sure I either get a replacement pair or my money back.</li>
            <li> These were really worthless.  Did not moisturize at all.  My hands were drier in the morning!!!  They also unraveled.  Very poor product.</li>
            <li> sheds... makes my nose itch. doesn&#x27;t really moisturize. just keeps hands nice and warm. prevents from drying up. doesn&#x27;t improve. you have to put hand cream to improve skin.</li>
            <li> Liked the pair I got as a gift so well I was glad to purchase a pair for one of my friends who suffers from dry, chapped hands like me as they really work!</li>
            <li> I have used these gloves before for the last couple of years and it was time to replace them since they were starting to fall apart. The gloves were falling apart just from using them about 6 months out of the year every night. I looked at other gloves to replace them, but decided to stay with the same brand due to its softness and fit. I am able to put my lotion and other cream on and it doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> These gloves are very luxurious and silky. They are perfect for wearing to sleep at night after putting on moisturizer. Highly recommend!</li>
