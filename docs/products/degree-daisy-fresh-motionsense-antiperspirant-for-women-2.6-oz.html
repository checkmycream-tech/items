            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved Degree...</li>
            <li>Smells great, goes on smooth, works strong!</li>
            <li>The deodorant goes on very easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any film on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using Dove gel deodorant and Dove Cucumber scent, but this is the best deodorant I have used so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light though.</li>
            <li>It does have a floral scent, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming, it is very light.</li>
            <li>Although this isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, I love Degree MotionSense.</li>
            <li>Great product,  woorks very well.</li>
            <li>My favorite brand antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SCENT</li>
            <li>Enjoyable scent.</li>
            <li>I tried this deodorant and not only did the smell, smell good to me, but it works!</li>
            <li>This scent isn&#x27;t as strong as another</li>
            <li>Works very well, the Daisy scent is nice and light.</li>
            <li>It keeps me smelling good all day since it&#x27;s only activated when moving.</li>
            <li>After using Dove for years when I became pregnant, the scent of Dove made my stomach hurl (and that&#x27;s putting it mildly).</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>It lasts long and smells good.</li>
            <li>Love this scent and cannot find it in stores where I live.</li>
            <li>It works, it cost is reasonable and it is shipped free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried (forgot which one), but it does smell fresh.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at all the 5 star ratings, unless another scent is better.  </li>
            <li>There is residue on skin and clothing if you&#x27;re not careful, and like many long-wear formulas, this doesn&#x27;t wash off with a quick rinse of soap and water.</li>
            <li>Smell is good, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as other deodorants I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered right away.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to over Dove.</li>
            <li>It came with the safety cap that comes with all new anti-perspirant but did not have the cap that you replace each day after use.</li>
            <li>It feels sticky, doesn&#x27;t seem to last long, and the scent is extremely strong.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product this entire hot, sticky summer with no odor or wetness.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any type of irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It does leave some white powdered residue on your armpits, but it is not noticeable unless you&#x27;re really close.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product especially if you are in such a sensitive situation like me!</li>
            <li>Much sooner than the expected delivery amazon gave me.</li>

            <li> Smells great. Great product</li>
            <li> Smells great, goes on smooth, works strong!</li>
            <li> Great scent for me. All I use.</li>
            <li> Not loving the scent.</li>
            <li> Although this isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, I love Degree MotionSense. It keeps me smelling good all day since it&#x27;s only activated when moving. This scent isn&#x27;t as strong as another I&#x27;ve tried (forgot which one), but it does smell fresh. It&#x27;s very light though. The deodorant goes on very easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any film on my skin. I haven&#x27;t noticed any stickiness either (as someone else stated). I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any type of irritation whatsoever. I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> Great product,  woorks very well. Worth the money. Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Keeps you dry. Smells great!</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It works, it cost is reasonable and it is shipped free.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dove gel deodorant and Dove Cucumber scent, but this is the best deodorant I have used so far. I tend to sweat a lot, and this antiperspirant does the trick. It smells good too. It does leave some white powdered residue on your armpits, but it is not noticeable unless you&#x27;re really close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big sweater at all and this deodorant couldn&#x27;t even keep up with the little bit that I do sweat</li>
            <li> I have purchased Degre before but this did not seem to be of the same quality. I can&#x27;t express what it is but it feels a bit gooey.</li>
            <li> Smell is good, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as other deodorants I have tried.  I&#x27;ll be switching back to Secret.</li>
            <li> Peach smells amazing! My favorite brand antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Definitely not life changing for me. Works very well, the Daisy scent is nice and light. This is my new go to over Dove.</li>
            <li> Works / protects well, I would definitely buy again. That said, none of these &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; products are ever invisible .. There is residue on skin and clothing if you&#x27;re not careful, and like many long-wear formulas, this doesn&#x27;t wash off with a quick rinse of soap and water. It&#x27;s best to loofah-soap this product off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular Degree before and liked it, but this was horrible.  It feels sticky, doesn&#x27;t seem to last long, and the scent is extremely strong.

            <li> Works well, but I did not get a cap. It came with the safety cap that comes with all new anti-perspirant but did not have the cap that you replace each day after use.</li>
            <li> Have used this product this entire hot, sticky summer with no odor or wetness. On days I don&#x27;t take a shower til late, it continues to work from the day before. Highly recommend.</li>

            <li> One of my favorites. It works well and smells great.</li>
            <li> Chose 5 stars since package arrived on time and no damage to package.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. LOVE THE SCENT</li>
            <li> Love this scent and cannot find it in stores where I live. Works great! Timely delivery too.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Quick delivery.  Enjoyable scent.</li>

            <li> Good deodorant, great smell, works well</li>
            <li> I have always loved Degree...best women&#x27;s deodorant out there :)</li>
