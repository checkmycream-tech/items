            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be receiving complements about it when I start wearing it.</li>
            <li>I tried many times to repair it and put it on</li>
            <li>This head band is ok.  </li>
            <li>it is not the best made, so you have to be really careful how you put it on.</li>
            <li>This arrived very quickly considering it came from China.  </li>
            <li>super cute looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute</li>
            <li>it worked great for my greek costume.</li>
            <li>Sure it was pretty.  </li>
            <li>I found the gold leaf ribbon works better and is a whole lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>The headband was worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I received it super fast!</li>
            <li>price was right its not flimsy stays on well and looks really pretty on.</li>
            <li>This thing fell apart the first day I got it ....</li>
            <li>really pretty, but you may need to tighten the claps.  </li>
            <li>feels good But to small.</li>
            <li>The leaf has a clasp that holds it very flimsily to the elastic.  </li>
            <li>It did break the first time I put it on, but it was easily fixed.</li>
            <li>wow I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast the package arrived!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty accent piece and it is big enough that it fit well without giving me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a little more goldy looking than i wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item, you won&#x27;t be able to use it any way.</li>
            <li>The good leaf part was heavy duty and not cheap looking at all.  </li>
            <li>can definitely see myself wearing this a lot on hot days that I feel like putting minimal effort into updo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>So no matter how gently you try to put this on a normal or even small size head, the links break between the leaves.  </li>

            <li> Once I secured with a little glue, I&#x27;ve had no problems...</li>
            <li> the band itself is very tight and the leaves dig into your head no matter what way you wear it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what size head it was made for though</li>
            <li> And hearing lately that anything from over seas has a lot of lead in it, It well not happen again.</li>

            <li> MY DAUGHTER DID NOT LIKE IT IT WAS TO TIGHT AN IT BROKE WHEN SHE WAS TRYING TO PUT IT ON</li>
            <li> I guess it is for kids !&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it it was so tight on my head.&lt;br /&gt;Second time it broke !&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could use it :(</li>
            <li> Looks good. feels good But to small. And hearing lately that anything from over seas has a lot of lead in it, It well not happen again.</li>
            <li> Its cute, it didnt brake. it worked great for my greek costume.</li>
            <li> super cute looks just like the picture. it is a little more goldy looking than i wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> This thing fell apart the first day I got it .... all that money i sent on the shipping .... it looks good for you to look at not use</li>
            <li> This is a very cute headband and it fits perfectly. But I thinks it&#x27;s designs for those with smaller heads because my head is a bit on the smaller side.</li>
            <li> The item shipped and was delivered within a matter of days. The headband was worth what I paid for it. It did break the first time I put it on, but it was easily fixed. The elastic part had just come undone from the metal holding it. I just slid it back in and closed the metal part tighter with some pliers. The leaves themselves seem to be put together well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely see myself wearing this a lot on hot days that I feel like putting minimal effort into updo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly considering it came from China.  It is lovely.  The person I sent it to gets lots of compliments on it.  She is very pleased.</li>
            <li> wow I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast the package arrived! I got it today and it was perfectly pack packaged. price was right its not flimsy stays on well and looks really pretty on. I plan on buying from this seller again .I give 5 stars!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received it super fast! And I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s super cute and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be receiving complements about it when I start wearing it. Can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> i jsut get  it and its too small :(  already spoiled:(( im dissapointed. i  realy dont think i ahve  big  head|!. iy isnt for nromal size head</li>
            <li> So no matter how gently you try to put this on a normal or even small size head, the links break between the leaves.  I tried many times to repair it and put it on but it would break somewhere else.  I found the gold leaf ribbon works better and is a whole lot cheaper.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item, you won&#x27;t be able to use it any way.</li>
            <li> This head band is ok.  The gold leaves look good however the band itself is very tight and the leaves dig into your head no matter what way you wear it.  I ended up giving it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Sure it was pretty.  The good leaf part was heavy duty and not cheap looking at all.  Not sure what size head it was made for though, I have a rather small head and it broke the first time I tried to put it on.  The leaf has a clasp that holds it very flimsily to the elastic.  Nice but considering I didn&#x27;t even wear it once before it broke I would not suggest this to anybody else.</li>
            <li> really pretty, but you may need to tighten the claps.  Once I secured with a little glue, I&#x27;ve had no problems...</li>
            <li> This is a pretty accent piece and it is big enough that it fit well without giving me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is not the best made, so you have to be really careful how you put it on.</li>
            <li> This item broke immediately and there&#x27;s no way to reattach the cord to the metal. The moment I stretched it in the slightest to put it on it broke.</li>
            <li> Broke while I tried it on!</li>
