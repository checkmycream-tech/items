            <li> My assigning 5 stars to this product reflects my own (and my daughter&#x27;s) satisfaction with it BUT the product has been discontinued by Neutrogena so that is moot! I was stockpiling as much as I could find after learning of Neutrogena&#x27;s drop of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Gonna be my daily shampoo just try it you&#x27;ll keep buying</li>

            <li> I have used this shampoo for many years, and will continue to do so.  Thank you for your efficient service.</li>
            <li> I have not found a better product...it leaves my hair feeling squeaky clean...not gummy like so many products do. If it&#x27;s true that the company has discontinued this...they are making a mistake...</li>
