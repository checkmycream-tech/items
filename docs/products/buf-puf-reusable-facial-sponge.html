            <li>a good skin care program should include a Buf-Puf...</li>
            <li>She seems to be very satisfied with it.</li>

            <li>I LOVE THESE SPONGES.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found these.</li>
            <li>so glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love them .....</li>
            <li>6 pk better price point.</li>
            <li>They are way better then the cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li>I was 60 in July and most people guess my age to be in my 40&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>I love this product, but you can&#x27;t buy it at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>When I discovered Amazon  I checked and sure enuf I could order from Amazon, go</li>
            <li>These are the very best for facial cleaning.</li>
            <li>Provides excellent lather with your favorite facial cleanser &amp; easily exfoliates your skin without damaging it.  </li>
            <li>They are worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I bought what I thought was the next best thing which were some cheap, knock-offs from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>I use them all over my body, but have one specially for my face, ears,and neck!</li>
            <li>These are perfect every time--I would recommend them to anyone who has dry skin, they work beautifully on my face especially!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so convenient and easy, I just use it at the end of my shower when my pores have all opened up.</li>
            <li>Use gently at night with a mild soap or cleanser  and then use a good moisturer.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>Buf-Pufs work and are far superior to the cheap knockoffs currently available in retail venues.  </li>
            <li>but it does smooth and brighten the skin if used correctly.</li>
            <li>We only have to replace them about once every 3 weeks and consider this a great deal for the level of cleanliness they promote.</li>
            <li>It used to be available in Target, then I had to get in online from Drugstore.com.  </li>
            <li>As a bonus, it helps keep it wrinkle free as well.</li>
            <li>My face tends to blush easily or turn red after a good scrubbing .  </li>
            <li>The first time you use it, you feel the difference more.</li>
            <li>It is great to exfoliate the dry skin from my face.  </li>
            <li>This is another product I&#x27;ve used for years to keep my face clean.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel clean and rid of all make-up</li>
            <li>I love the gentle buf puf and can&#x27;t find it in the stores around here.  </li>
            <li>Good prices on Amazon especially if you do the subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to find them at local stores recently, so I got them from Amazon--so convenient and a good price, too!</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin looking fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The pufs are great exfoliates/hygiene and last a month or more with daily use (shape flattens eventually)  </li>
            <li>I keep one in the shower and step out with smooth skin, ready for moisturizer and makeup.</li>
            <li>My skin is also glowing and always looks fresh.</li>
            <li>I ordered the gentle for myself and the original for my husband.  </li>
            <li>The texture is just right.</li>
            <li>For great skin look and I am 66 yrs old, exfoliate with the GENTLE facial sponge.</li>
            <li>Been using buf pufs since the early 80s &amp; can&#x27;t say enough good about them.  </li>
            <li>Honestly they&#x27;d be a good substitute for those expensive battery-powered face scrubbers you can buy now.</li>
            <li>Pkg, came very fast as with all &#x27;fulfilled by Amazon&#x27;  orders.</li>
            <li>I had been using the generic ones and these are so much better.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in my local stores for years!</li>
            <li>It has kept my skin looking young and smooth...</li>
            <li>I started using these years ago and was no longer able to find any in local retail stores.</li>
            <li>I love how it gently exfoliates my face without making me red.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty gentle on sensitive skin and are great for everyday.</li>
            <li>Just a little soap and  keeps your face clean and healthy, preventing breakouts.</li>
            <li>Skin feels great, but I have to remind myself, not to scrub my face too hard, even with these mild facial sponges.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>If you ever want to look at what those things really are (and what they can do)</li>
            <li>so keeping the facial skin free of oil and dirt must have some merit.</li>
            <li>I really like how the sponge makes my skin feel with the exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>but I found that I could really scrub and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>They really work.</li>
            <li>thanks to Buf-Puf.</li>
            <li>My skin is much fresher looking and clearer when I use these.</li>
            <li>I rub some of my White Dove bar soap on it, and lightly swirl it around my face.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Gentle sponge, and would recommend that to everyone.</li>
            <li>it really does the job of exfoliating your skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my face acne free, I am an adult that has had acne since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I sure wish I had known this as I would have bought the other one.  </li>
            <li>Just add your favorite cleanser and scrub away, nothing too harsh, no expensive creams.</li>
            <li>I was overly gentle at first since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>anyway, I remembered using Buf-Puf&#x27;s when I was in high school, so I found them on Amazon and ordered a gentle one to try.</li>
            <li>The gentle one is not hard on the skin.</li>
            <li>I suffer with eczema and these really help to keep my skin clear!</li>
            <li>This one is okay, just a little rougher on my face than I would like.</li>
            <li>Use them with a good sudsy soap or cleaner, and don&#x27;t press too hard, and they will keep your skin fresh looking without being too rough.</li>
            <li>I was able to give some to my children as they last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning this right this second!</li>
            <li>i have used this product for years &amp; couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>No need to buy one of those new electric ones.</li>
            <li>I replaced my sponge about every 3 months or so before it got flat and less effective.</li>
            <li>but you really have to be extra gentle and</li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>they will last so much longer!</li>
            <li>As I get somewhat older, I think my skin has become more delicate.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I found my next 2 years supply!</li>
            <li>I apply a squirt of my facial cleanser and gently massage my face, and then rinse-</li>
            <li>I used Buf-Pufs for years for a gentle daily exfoliation of my face, neck, and chest.  </li>
            <li>My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t order the Extra Gentle instead of the Gentle.</li>
            <li>even then it still feels you are not being gentle enough..</li>
            <li>I have used a Buf-Puf for nearly 50 years...</li>
            <li>I Love the way it deep cleans my face and clears away the dead cells.  </li>
            <li>After using the buff puff for about 4 months, I&#x27;m down to 1-2 zits a month, and they go away really quickly.</li>
            <li>Buf-Pufs last longer and stay fresh, as long as you rinse them well and shake them out after each use.</li>
            <li>Recommended highly for daily use.</li>
            <li>Simply rinse well and dry after each use to keep them fresh.  </li>
            <li>It is a gently exfoliator and works well on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very night, and I am gentle with the scrubbing as I am older and have delicate skin</li>
            <li>The puf also comes in extra gentle, but I prefer the gentle after trying the previously mentioned.</li>
            <li>I can use them every morning without issue, but generally end up using around 4 times per week.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Gentle enough for sensitive skin to use every day&lt;br /&gt;User</li>
            <li>I ordered extra soft hoping it&#x27;s soft enough.</li>
            <li>People who haven&#x27;t tried this might want to note that I&#x27;m in my mid 60s and can pass for a woman in her early 50s .........</li>
            <li>They were really too rough</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a way to exfoliate my face that doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin or flare up my allergies or medical issues due to certain ingredients.</li>
            <li>I then follow up with a quick wash with the facial cleanser again, just to get any dead skin swept</li>
            <li>They exfoliate extremely well but are gentle enough to not cause the skin to become damaged.  </li>
            <li>Buf-Puf are a bit hard to find but luckily we have Amazon.</li>

            <li> This one is okay, just a little rougher on my face than I would like.</li>
            <li> Use them with a good sudsy soap or cleaner, and don&#x27;t press too hard, and they will keep your skin fresh looking without being too rough.</li>
            <li> I was able to give some to my children as they last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning this right this second!</li>
            <li> i have used this product for years &amp; couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> No need to buy one of those new electric ones.</li>
            <li> I replaced my sponge about every 3 months or so before it got flat and less effective.</li>
            <li> but you really have to be extra gentle and</li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> they will last so much longer!</li>
            <li> As I get somewhat older, I think my skin has become more delicate.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I found my next 2 years supply!</li>
            <li> I apply a squirt of my facial cleanser and gently massage my face, and then rinse-</li>
            <li> I used Buf-Pufs for years for a gentle daily exfoliation of my face, neck, and chest.  </li>
            <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t order the Extra Gentle instead of the Gentle.</li>
            <li> even then it still feels you are not being gentle enough..</li>
            <li> I have used a Buf-Puf for nearly 50 years...</li>
            <li> I Love the way it deep cleans my face and clears away the dead cells.  </li>
            <li> After using the buff puff for about 4 months, I&#x27;m down to 1-2 zits a month, and they go away really quickly.</li>
            <li> Buf-Pufs last longer and stay fresh, as long as you rinse them well and shake them out after each use.</li>
            <li> Recommended highly for daily use.</li>
            <li> Simply rinse well and dry after each use to keep them fresh.  </li>
            <li> It is a gently exfoliator and works well on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very night, and I am gentle with the scrubbing as I am older and have delicate skin</li>
            <li> The puf also comes in extra gentle, but I prefer the gentle after trying the previously mentioned.</li>
            <li> I can use them every morning without issue, but generally end up using around 4 times per week.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Gentle enough for sensitive skin to use every day&lt;br /&gt;User</li>
            <li> I ordered extra soft hoping it&#x27;s soft enough.</li>
            <li> People who haven&#x27;t tried this might want to note that I&#x27;m in my mid 60s and can pass for a woman in her early 50s .........</li>
            <li> They were really too rough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a way to exfoliate my face that doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin or flare up my allergies or medical issues due to certain ingredients.</li>
            <li> I then follow up with a quick wash with the facial cleanser again, just to get any dead skin swept</li>
            <li> They exfoliate extremely well but are gentle enough to not cause the skin to become damaged.  </li>
            <li> Buf-Puf are a bit hard to find but luckily we have Amazon.</li>
            <li> But they started becoming difficult to find locally</li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is that even though this is the gentle one, its still a bit rough and I got a few tiny scratches on my face.</li>
            <li> Buf-Puf Gentle has a little scrubbing action which helps to remove dead skin and keep the skin glowing.</li>
            <li> In my early forties, I am starting to notice the typical signs of aging but continued to be plagued with clogged pores and blackheads on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> My bumps went down, my skin feels baby soft, and glowing.</li>
            <li> Since they were cheapest in a 6-pack, I probably now have enough for a very, long time.</li>
            <li> Stick with these, your usual bathing soap and a decent moisturizer after.  </li>
            <li> At first it felt really harsh, but I just applied little pressure and I got used to it.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering for acne for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Rinse it out well &amp; let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> Price online is also less than my local retailer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other people&#x27;s faces are made of, but this sponge feels rougher than my coarse wet stone (you know, the stone cooks sharpen their knives on)!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether these are not &amp;#34;genuine&amp;#34; buf-pufs or they just don&#x27;t make them like they used to, but these are not gentle.</li>
            <li> so not necessary and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and this did not irritate it like other sponges</li>
            <li> So instead of using this every night as recommended, I use it every other night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of rough, polyester fiber that is not suitable as a facial sponge, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands off and on, trying to save a little on the price, but the other brands are either too rough or they collapse after a few usings.</li>
            <li> The Gentles I used before are a little rough, and my skin is a little pinker after use than it used to be.</li>
            <li> And typically once they show up they stick around for a week or so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to &#x27;green&#x27; my skincare routine, and have been bothered by exfoliating agents that are often little plastic particles.</li>
            <li> If I lapse for a few days, I can always tell a difference.</li>
            <li> and I have been using Buf-Puf facial sponges for years but have been recently unable to find them in our small town.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li> (I use them once a day, not more.)</li>
            <li> Google &#x27;nurdles&#x27; which is seriously what they are called.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon should allow negative rating, and this one should receive a negative score!</li>
            <li> These are very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> or when it becomes too thin to use.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s labeled \\&quot;Gentle,\\&quot; seriously?!</li>
            <li> useless.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive beauty crap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades and have found it increasingly difficult to find in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> No need to purchase expensive highlighters or moisturizers with glow elements in them.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had been using the generic ones and these are so much better.  they exfoliate without scratching and are good for your skin.  I have very very sensitive skin and this did not irritate it like other sponges</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a way to exfoliate my face that doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin or flare up my allergies or medical issues due to certain ingredients. These gentle buf-pufs are perfect for the shower. I can use them every morning without issue, but generally end up using around 4 times per week. Price online is also less than my local retailer. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many, many years and my skin looks great. It is just the best exfoliator on the market. Use whatever cleanser you desire and the Buffpuff does the rest. I get many uses from one puff. Just simply THE BEST![[ASIN:B000NKHNI4 Buf-Puf Facial Sponge, Regular 1 ea]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Buf-Puf facial sponges for years!  They are high-quality and last over numerous uses.  Simply rinse well and dry after each use to keep them fresh.  I&#x27;ve tried store brand sponges to save money, but I always come back to the Buf! They are worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in my local stores for years! Thanks to Amazon, I found my next 2 years supply!</li>
            <li> My two daughters and I have been using Buf-Puf facial sponges for years but have been recently unable to find them in our small town. They exfoliate extremely well but are gentle enough to not cause the skin to become damaged.  All three of us use them every day.  So appreciate being able to find them online!</li>
            <li> Had been looking for Buf-Puf for years in drugstores and could not find it. But found it on Amazon! Who knew?</li>
            <li> Glad was able to find these on line, excellent product for facial exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle buf puf and can&#x27;t find it in the stores around here.  Not sure why they stopped carrying it.  When I asked they acted like it was off the market.  I was so glad to find it here.  It is great to exfoliate the dry skin from my face.  I only use it when needed but prefer it over any brand out there.</li>
            <li> too &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34;. didnt feel like it even exfoliated at all. ordered some reguaklr ones and of coirse they work great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I bought for my daughter, but this is what I used when I was a teenager. Just a little soap and  keeps your face clean and healthy, preventing breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my face daily for years.  It is a gently exfoliator and works well on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to &#x27;green&#x27; my skincare routine, and have been bothered by exfoliating agents that are often little plastic particles. If you ever want to look at what those things really are (and what they can do) Google &#x27;nurdles&#x27; which is seriously what they are called.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I remembered using Buf-Puf&#x27;s when I was in high school, so I found them on Amazon and ordered a gentle one to try. Its definitely an exfoliator, I almost went to the extra-gentle, but I just eased up on the pressure when using it and its been great. I apply a squirt of my facial cleanser and gently massage my face, and then rinse- I then follow up with a quick wash with the facial cleanser again, just to get any dead skin swept away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see a difference in my face after about three months of 3-4x/week use, fewer white bumps and blackheads and smooth-feeling skin. A Buf-Puf is a great way to exfoliate without chemicals.</li>
            <li> These are pretty gentle on sensitive skin and are great for everyday. Honestly they&#x27;d be a good substitute for those expensive battery-powered face scrubbers you can buy now. I like to throw one in my luggage when I travel instead of bringing the battery-powered brush thing I got as a gift. I replaced my sponge about every 3 months or so before it got flat and less effective.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering for acne for as long as I can remember. I finally went to a dermatologist who knew what he was doing; he recommended I purchase a buf-puf as well as betadine surgical scrub as part of my cleaning routine. Within a week I saw a difference in my skin. My bumps went down, my skin feels baby soft, and glowing. The only reason why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is that even though this is the gentle one, its still a bit rough and I got a few tiny scratches on my face. So instead of using this every night as recommended, I use it every other night.</li>
            <li> This is another product I&#x27;ve used for years to keep my face clean. I&#x27;m almost 70 and people say I look 20 years younger so keeping the facial skin free of oil and dirt must have some merit. Buf-Puf are a bit hard to find but luckily we have Amazon. Gave one to my granddaughter to help her avoid Acne and show her how to avoid oil and bacteria caused pimples. Buf-Puf Gentle has a little scrubbing action which helps to remove dead skin and keep the skin glowing. Recommended highly for daily use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean&lt;br /&gt;Gentle enough for sensitive skin to use every day&lt;br /&gt;User controls abrasiveness</li>
            <li> I am so glad to find these on Amazon!  I have looked for years, because they are simply not found locally.  I really like how the sponge makes my skin feel with the exfoliation.  I use them all over my body, but have one specially for my face, ears,and neck!</li>
            <li> Amazon should allow negative rating, and this one should receive a negative score! I bought this product because of the good reviews. They lied. I don&#x27;t know what other people&#x27;s faces are made of, but this sponge feels rougher than my coarse wet stone (you know, the stone cooks sharpen their knives on)! And it&#x27;s labeled \\&quot;Gentle,\\&quot; seriously?! I&#x27;m returning this right this second!</li>
            <li> I found a recommendation for Buf-Pufs while researching micro-dermabrasion. Someone had mentioned that Buf-Pufs were a possible alternative. In my early forties, I am starting to notice the typical signs of aging but continued to be plagued with clogged pores and blackheads on my nose and chin. I have tried all the topical products but they did not always agree with my skin and I never saw results. I had been using scrubs and micro-dermabrasion \\&quot;kits\\&quot; from various name brand companies. I decided to try this product and I immediately saw  and felt results. I seems so simple! Just add your favorite cleanser and scrub away, nothing too harsh, no expensive creams. I was overly gentle at first since I have sensitive skin but I found that I could really scrub and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I keep one in the shower and step out with smooth skin, ready for moisturizer and makeup. If I lapse for a few days, I can always tell a difference. Now, I don&#x27;t leave home without it. I can&#x27;t compare its effects to that of micro-dermabrasion but I do consider it my #1 most important beauty product!</li>
            <li> useless. I now use a korean italy towel and it actually cleans my face</li>
            <li> Perfect transaction - product was what they said, arrived when they said, for the price they said. Perfect!</li>
            <li> i have used this product for years &amp; couldn&#x27;t live without it. it makes my skin feel clean and rid of all make-up</li>
            <li> After I ordered this product I found out it comes in an even gentler version.  I sure wish I had known this as I would have bought the other one.  This one is okay, just a little rougher on my face than I would like.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE SPONGES. HAVE BEEN USING THEM FOR YEARS</li>
            <li> Been using these for over 20 years.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive beauty crap.  Stick with these, your usual bathing soap and a decent moisturizer after.  Your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered extra soft hoping it&#x27;s soft enough. But it&#x27;s not. It actually hurts when I used it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it agian</li>
            <li> I use Clinique face soap with my Buf-Puf every day.  I love how it gently exfoliates my face without making me red.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether these are not &amp;#34;genuine&amp;#34; buf-pufs or they just don&#x27;t make them like they used to, but these are not gentle. They are in fact so scratchy they are unusable.</li>
            <li> I Love the way it deep cleans my face and clears away the dead cells.  Great price-- wouldn&#x27;d do with out it.</li>
            <li> I have hyperkeratinization and these take care of it. It really helps to keep your dead skin from building up and clogging your pores. They really work.</li>
            <li> Pkg, came very fast as with all &#x27;fulfilled by Amazon&#x27;  orders. I am so glad I found these. Skin feels great, but I have to remind myself, not to scrub my face too hard, even with these mild facial sponges.Buf Puf so glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love them .....that is why I keep ordering them!  I also get them for friends in the UK who can&#x27;t get them there</li>
            <li> This sponge gave me a rash! It&#x27;s made of rough, polyester fiber that is not suitable as a facial sponge, in my opinion. OUCH! I&#x27;ll probably use it as a brillo pad for dishes.</li>
            <li> I used Buf-Pufs for years for a gentle daily exfoliation of my face, neck, and chest.  But they started becoming difficult to find locally so I had to stop using them.  Recently stumbled upon them here at Amazon, bought a pack of six, and am set for awhile. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades and have found it increasingly difficult to find in retail stores.  Buf-Pufs work and are far superior to the cheap knockoffs currently available in retail venues.  People who haven&#x27;t tried this might want to note that I&#x27;m in my mid 60s and can pass for a woman in her early 50s .........thanks to Buf-Puf.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Buf-Pufs for years, off and on. I hadn&#x27;t been able to find them at local stores recently, so I got them from Amazon--so convenient and a good price, too! There is nothing as good for exfoliating as a Buf-Puf. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t order the Extra Gentle instead of the Gentle. As I get somewhat older, I think my skin has become more delicate. The Gentles I used before are a little rough, and my skin is a little pinker after use than it used to be. (I use them once a day, not more.) I think if I&#x27;d gotten the Extra-Gentle they would be perfect. My skin is much fresher looking and clearer when I use these. I have tried other brands off and on, trying to save a little on the price, but the other brands are either too rough or they collapse after a few usings. Buf-Pufs last longer and stay fresh, as long as you rinse them well and shake them out after each use. Use them with a good sudsy soap or cleaner, and don&#x27;t press too hard, and they will keep your skin fresh looking without being too rough.</li>
            <li> I gave the product a 3 because even for sensitive skin it is still rough..It does a great job exfoliating but you really have to be extra gentle and even then it still feels you are not being gentle enough..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. Now the Walgreens/CVSs of the world make their own versions &amp; therefore no not stock the Buf Puf name brand which is the best! For great skin look and I am 66 yrs old, exfoliate with the GENTLE facial sponge. No need to buy one of those new electric ones. Use an exfoliating scrub with it. 6 pk better price point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Buf- Puf products for over 30 years and everyone thinks I am ten years younger than I am - and I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My face feels softer than before but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker like some reviews seem to gush. The first time you use it, you feel the difference more. Good prices on Amazon especially if you do the subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> These are very hard to find.  I was able to give some to my children as they last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product in a while and when I went to purchase it in the stores, I couldn&#x27;t find it.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  This works great in the winter with flakey skin.  Use gently at night with a mild soap or cleanser  and then use a good moisturer.  I don&#x27;t use it very night, and I am gentle with the scrubbing as I am older and have delicate skin but it does smooth and brighten the skin if used correctly.</li>
            <li> Great price and I received the product within days of order.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE BUFF PUFF!! I have suffered from the occasional pimple or zit (3-5 a month) for years and years. And typically once they show up they stick around for a week or so.  NOT with the buff puff!! After using the buff puff for about 4 months, I&#x27;m down to 1-2 zits a month, and they go away really quickly. My skin is also glowing and always looks fresh. No need to purchase expensive highlighters or moisturizers with glow elements in them. The buff puff will give you all that by using it just 3 times a week. It&#x27;s so convenient and easy, I just use it at the end of my shower when my pores have all opened up. I rub some of my White Dove bar soap on it, and lightly swirl it around my face. At first it felt really harsh, but I just applied little pressure and I got used to it. Now I&#x27;m addicted. Change the sponge every 3 months. I can&#x27;t believe women pay hundreds of dollars for various motorized Sonic brushes....so not necessary and a waste of money. I purchased the Gentle sponge, and would recommend that to everyone.</li>
            <li> My face tends to blush easily or turn red after a good scrubbing .  This buff let&#x27;s me use it in the a.m. without the redness I may get at night with the white buff puffs.</li>
            <li> These are perfect every time--I would recommend them to anyone who has dry skin, they work beautifully on my face especially!</li>
            <li> use them all the time and they are great.  They are way better then the cheaper ones.  they will last so much longer!</li>
            <li> These work great - used them for years and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> I bought these after they were recommended by our family&#x27;s dermatologist.  I only wish now that I had heard of them sooner!  They are extremely effective at thoroughly removing make-up, dirt, and even oil from our family&#x27;s skin.  We only have to replace them about once every 3 weeks and consider this a great deal for the level of cleanliness they promote.</li>
            <li> these are wonderful to use for washing my face.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years but am unable to find in many stores. I like buying on the internet.</li>
            <li> I have used Buf-Pufs since I was a teen... it really does the job of exfoliating your skin. I suffer with eczema and these really help to keep my skin clear! I wish I could find them locally though.</li>
            <li> Used these for YEARS! Wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without them!</li>
            <li> I have used a Buf-Puf for nearly 50 years...It has kept my skin looking young and smooth... Use it daily. I was 60 in July and most people guess my age to be in my 40&#x27;s... a good skin care program should include a Buf-Puf...</li>
            <li> Been using buf pufs since the early 80s &amp; can&#x27;t say enough good about them.  Provides excellent lather with your favorite facial cleanser &amp; easily exfoliates your skin without damaging it.  Rinse it out well &amp; let it air dry.  Replace once a month or when it becomes too thin to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to gently exfoliate the skin every day. Have used Buf-puf for decades; store brands just aren&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but you can&#x27;t buy it at Walmart.  I order it once a year and get a bunch.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 20 years.  It used to be available in Target, then I had to get in online from Drugstore.com.  When I discovered Amazon  I checked and sure enuf I could order from Amazon, go figure, it has everything you can think of! I ordered the gentle for myself and the original for my husband.  The puf also comes in extra gentle, but I prefer the gentle after trying the previously mentioned.The pufs are great exfoliates/hygiene and last a month or more with daily use (shape flattens eventually)  Great product!</li>
            <li> I started using these years ago and was no longer able to find any in local retail stores. I bought what I thought was the next best thing which were some cheap, knock-offs from Wal-Mart. They were really too rough but because I had nothing else, I used them. I finally thought to check Amazon and BINGO! Since they were cheapest in a 6-pack, I probably now have enough for a very, long time.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my face acne free, I am an adult that has had acne since my early 20&#x27;s. As a bonus, it helps keep it wrinkle free as well. The texture is just right.</li>
            <li> These were recommended to me by my sister as something she used years ago and it is something that my mom can use on her face.  She seems to be very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> These are the very best for facial cleaning. Keeps my skin looking fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I really like the product. I would recommend it to anyone. The buf puffs last quite a while. You should try them</li>
