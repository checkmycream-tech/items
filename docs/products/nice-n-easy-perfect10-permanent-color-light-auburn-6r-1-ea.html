    <ol>
            <li>I have been coloring my hair for years and this is the Best hair color ever!!!</li>
            <li>It came out absolutely perfect though.</li>
            <li>Best haircolor to use if you are coloring every 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Perfect 10 vs N+E</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>This is because, since Perfect 10 develops faster, it also expires faster.</li>
            <li>This is because, since Perfect 10 develops faster, it also expires faster.</li>
            <li>The great thing about this is I dont have to sit in a chair for 3-4 hours, pay 250 dollars for my haircolor, and get done with the color in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have tried L&#x27;Oreal, Feria with fairly good results but not as good as Perfect 10.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in my area stores, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>Light Auburn is the best ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a GORGEOUS, &amp;#34;grown-up &amp; sexy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Includes an awesome conditioner that will leave your hair shiny and smooth after coloring</li>
            <li>I like Perfect 10 much more than the Clairol Nice N&#x27;Easy I had been using.</li>
            <li>so I love that!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this shade!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this hair color!</li>
            <li>but i truly love the perfect 10 light auburn by nice n</li>
            <li>I just used perfect 10 for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Also,  it&#x27;s nice that it isn&#x27;t on your scalp for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Perfect 10 is only good for 25 minutes, which means it has to all be applied within 15 minutes or you won&#x27;t get</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it covers my gray/white hairs wonderfully and still looks natural.</li>
            <li>light auburn, the others bright orange.</li>
            <li>I have naturally mouse-brown hair, and this is just enough to make it very interesting and more toward auburn, with the best highlights I&#x27;ve ever had, and great shine!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a quick and easy product to use and the color is great.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the $200 bill when they are finished isn&#x27;t so grand.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shade of red from Perfect 10, but you probably need to have a lighter hair color to get the results you want.</li>
            <li>for my hair color when I need it most</li>
            <li>I have used many different hair dyes and Clairol Perfect 10 in 006r</li>
            <li>I use to be able to buy this in the store and when i could no longer find it</li>
            <li>The N+E product is a better color and a much better price</li>
            <li>The conditioner is PHENOMENAL, wish they sold it in bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure the room you are in has ventalation.  </li>
            <li>so i am very greatful to have found it at a great price.</li>
            <li>that the color was more &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;auburn&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love the 10 minute working time on this brand.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, easy and fast.  </li>
            <li>great color , easy to use and fast .</li>
            <li>Best to have two boxes on hand if your hair is really long</li>
            <li>I love this light autumn color.</li>
            <li>I have been using Perfect 10 for about a year, and I color my hair every 10-12 weeks (my natural color blends pretty well as it grows</li>
            <li>Perfect 10 is only good for 25 minutes, which means it has to all be applied within 15 minutes or you won&#x27;t get fully developed color.  </li>
            <li>I loved how fast this was</li>
            <li>But otherwise, it was easy just 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The red is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>but after I rinsed it out and applied the conditioner it smells fine.</li>
            <li>The color is bright and natural.</li>
            <li>Hope to keep using this color as it is available.</li>
            <li>(you know what I am talking about ladies).&lt;br /&gt;So, thanks Clairol for a great product and thanks Amazon for bringing it to my door.</li>
            <li>Apparently Perfect 10 uses a different process that is much kinder to your hair.</li>
            <li>I  found this product quick and easy to use</li>
            <li>Love this dye and haven&#x27;t been able to find it where I live.</li>
            <li>Whatever results show for light brown, it will be even more intense for you.</li>
            <li>(thin/flimsy plastic, one size fits all (too big)) aren&#x27;t as good as the ones you got before (thicker, the gloves fit</li>
            <li>I love Perfect 10 as a red head who&#x27;s hair was a vibrant copper up until my early thirties this has proven to be the easiest and closest color to my youthful shade.</li>
            <li>The good side about red fading is that you don&#x27;t have to panic!</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong</li>
            <li>The product works quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, easy.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different at home kits and they all seem to have a pension for turning my hair bright orange or yellow</li>
            <li>rarely took on the color I wanted.</li>
            <li>So far so good,  only time will tell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of regular Nice &#x27;n Easy and its only weakness</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair in such great condition that now I am going to let my hair grow long again, something I have not done since I started coloring years ago.</li>
            <li>After the first wash or two</li>
            <li>I still have to re-color every 3-4 weeks, but, Red is the most unstable of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasts about the same, 6 weeks, and I get more complements on this boxed color than the salon color.</li>
            <li>This is &amp;#34;MY&amp;#34; color, the one I use most often and always come back to - if they ever stop making it, I&#x27;m in a world of hurt.</li>
            <li>After rinsing if I see that the grey needs a bit more time, it&#x27;s no biggie to just color that portion for 5 more minutes since the mixed solution hasn&#x27;t been sitting around for 20 min.</li>
            <li>Your color will appear more and more copper-like as time goes by and it gets washed.&lt;br /&gt;*Complaints that the color was dramatically darker or brighter than expected --&amp;#62; When specified, most of the reviewers were some shade of blonde prior.</li>
            <li>However I feel like it fades pretty fast</li>
            <li>Not the vibrant color on the box; my brunette hair, stayed pretty brunette - despite leaving the treatment in for 20 mins</li>
            <li>and I particularly enjoy  the short waiting time (10-15 minutes) before the rinse-out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just wish there was a closer shade to my red than the ones available.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very silky and conditioned.</li>
            <li>so I can use it on my whole head each time.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Clairol and Amazon.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t really cover my silver strands.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much product as before.  </li>
            <li>The color sometimes fades, but I guess I can&#x27;t really complain because I would rather be able to color my hair again than be 22 years old with white hairs!!!    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to adjust the time you need to color your grey, etc.</li>
            <li>My natural hair color is a more of a reddish brown, but I thought since I had to color my hair anyway why not go a little more red?     </li>
            <li>sometimes can be difficult  to find my color at the local drugstores, especially when it is on sale, so I was thrilled to find it on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon at pretty much the same price and then the joy of the subscription service so that I do not have to wander the streets</li>
            <li>Down side is that the color doesn&#x27;t stay very bright, and you&#x27;ve got to dye about every 4 weeks if you don&#x27;t want to look dull.</li>
            <li>easy it gives me the true color i want and had been missing , all others left me feeling like i wasted my money but not any more since i can find it here .  </li>
            <li>I poured ONE of the bottles of activator into this new bottle.</li>
            <li>I poured ONE of the bottles of activator into this new bottle.</li>
            <li>&amp; I usually skip 2 days between washing &amp; use a color safe shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is totally natural Ginger!</li>
            <li>If you mix both bottles in the beginning, while you are applying the first one, time is ticking on the second one.</li>
            <li>First, I squirted both tubes of color creme into a sandwich-sized Ziploc, sealed, and mixed it up by working it with my hands.</li>
            <li>If you mix both bottles in the beginning, while you are applying the first one, time is ticking on the second one.</li>
            <li>This is true to color and actually does only take about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Easy application and the red doesn&#x27;t fade as much as other brands.</li>
            <li>And never use Vidal Sasoon if you want a natural shade of red!&lt;br /&gt;It is so simple to use and the comb applicator does a very even coloring job</li>
            <li>Great product, love the product, but the packaging was just terrible how they sent it and</li>
            <li>I have heard that the red dyes always fade fast so that might just be the way they all work.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and natural looking, too.  </li>
            <li>This color looked like my natural hair color except for the tint it has in it.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair used to be a darker auburn but darkened as it greyed.  </li>
            <li>; This is because you did not apply the color completely over all of your hair.</li>
            <li>; Again, this probably comes from reviewers with naturally lighter hair.</li>
            <li>fully developed color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are naturally blonde (even dark blonde), you need to keep in mind that most hair color swatches show results for BROWN hair.</li>
            <li>Now that I am older it seems to have lost some of its vibrant red color, plus I have white hair in the front.</li>
            <li>The red is very natural.</li>
            <li>This is the only color in a box that comes close to my natural color</li>
            <li>; Although you will see slightly different results with different brands (etc), red hair color is always fast to fade.</li>
            <li>Since my grey areas are very pourous, I can put the color on the rest of my hair for 10 min, but put it on the grey for just 5.</li>
            <li>I am a natural red head, but with age, as all you red heads out there now, it has lightened up alot.  </li>
            <li>I read a review on this product for a woman who had black hair, she should try the dark auburn color, not the light.</li>
            <li>I am so grateful that I can purchase this through Amazon as I live in a remote area.</li>
            <li>Once you wash it a couple times it will change to a less intense shade.&lt;br /&gt;*Complaints</li>
            <li>I have very dark brown/black hair and Perfect10 manages to lighten it to a shade very close to the one pictured on the box.  </li>

            <li> Down side is that the color doesn&#x27;t stay very bright, and you&#x27;ve got to dye about every 4 weeks if you don&#x27;t want to look dull.</li>
            <li> easy it gives me the true color i want and had been missing , all others left me feeling like i wasted my money but not any more since i can find it here .  </li>
            <li> I poured ONE of the bottles of activator into this new bottle.</li>
            <li> I poured ONE of the bottles of activator into this new bottle.</li>
            <li> &amp; I usually skip 2 days between washing &amp; use a color safe shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is totally natural Ginger!</li>
            <li> If you mix both bottles in the beginning, while you are applying the first one, time is ticking on the second one.</li>
            <li> First, I squirted both tubes of color creme into a sandwich-sized Ziploc, sealed, and mixed it up by working it with my hands.</li>
            <li> If you mix both bottles in the beginning, while you are applying the first one, time is ticking on the second one.</li>
            <li> This is true to color and actually does only take about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Easy application and the red doesn&#x27;t fade as much as other brands.</li>
            <li> And never use Vidal Sasoon if you want a natural shade of red!&lt;br /&gt;It is so simple to use and the comb applicator does a very even coloring job</li>
            <li> Great product, love the product, but the packaging was just terrible how they sent it and</li>
            <li> I have heard that the red dyes always fade fast so that might just be the way they all work.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and natural looking, too.  </li>
            <li> This color looked like my natural hair color except for the tint it has in it.  </li>
            <li> My natural hair used to be a darker auburn but darkened as it greyed.  </li>
            <li> ; This is because you did not apply the color completely over all of your hair.</li>
            <li> ; Again, this probably comes from reviewers with naturally lighter hair.</li>
            <li> fully developed color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are naturally blonde (even dark blonde), you need to keep in mind that most hair color swatches show results for BROWN hair.</li>
            <li> Now that I am older it seems to have lost some of its vibrant red color, plus I have white hair in the front.</li>
            <li> The red is very natural.</li>
            <li> This is the only color in a box that comes close to my natural color</li>
            <li> ; Although you will see slightly different results with different brands (etc), red hair color is always fast to fade.</li>
            <li> Since my grey areas are very pourous, I can put the color on the rest of my hair for 10 min, but put it on the grey for just 5.</li>
            <li> I am a natural red head, but with age, as all you red heads out there now, it has lightened up alot.  </li>
            <li> I read a review on this product for a woman who had black hair, she should try the dark auburn color, not the light.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful that I can purchase this through Amazon as I live in a remote area.</li>
            <li> Once you wash it a couple times it will change to a less intense shade.&lt;br /&gt;*Complaints</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown/black hair and Perfect10 manages to lighten it to a shade very close to the one pictured on the box.  </li>
            <li> is that it doesn&#x27;t completely cover grey roots for very long.</li>
            <li> If your hair is past shoulder length or thick definitely get two bottles to make sure you have enough.</li>
            <li> My natural color is a dark ashy blonde, my hair is medium thickness and long enough to hit mid-back.</li>
            <li> Then I cut a little bit off the corner of the Ziploc and, watching the side for change in ounces, put in enough of the color creme to equal 2.43 oz approximately (the size of one full tube).</li>

            <li> The directions say to leave it on 15 minutes for grey ~ and they also say that leaving it on longer (than 10 minutes) results in a darker product.</li>

            <li> I have long hair (a bit past the shoulders) and one box used to be enough to cover each strand.  </li>
            <li> Do you know of any color out there that does not give a pink tint?</li>
            <li> I think a lot of the people with the following complaints could have saved some trouble if they had access to some of the below information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The result was almost equal to N+E, except that my sun streaked blonde hair was an unrealistic ash blonde.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead or at least I was until the gray started creeping in! This is the only color in a box that comes close to my natural color so I love that! However I feel like it fades pretty fast &amp; I usually skip 2 days between washing &amp; use a color safe shampoo. I have heard that the red dyes always fade fast so that might just be the way they all work.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for years and this is the Best hair color ever!!! I get so many compliments on this shade!</li>
            <li> I love Perfect 10 as a red head who&#x27;s hair was a vibrant copper up until my early thirties this has proven to be the easiest and closest color to my youthful shade. I have tried L&#x27;Oreal, Feria with fairly good results but not as good as Perfect 10. And never use Vidal Sasoon if you want a natural shade of red!&lt;br /&gt;It is so simple to use and the comb applicator does a very even coloring job</li>
            <li> This is totally natural Ginger! Finally something I can use to cover my greys. I can go back to my natural red instead of the fake looking red i&#x27;ve been doing to get rid of greys!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different at home kits and they all seem to have a pension for turning my hair bright orange or yellow so I usually go to the salon but hate the 5 hours it seems to take. Plus, the $200 bill when they are finished isn&#x27;t so grand. I decided to give this a shot and I absolutely loved it. Including prep time and the 10 minute set time it only took about 15 minutes. The downside was I didn&#x27;t care for the applicator brush because it was hard to run through my hair which is very long (need two boxes) so I just used my hands to apply the hair color. I also used it for root touch-up and again with the lacking in being meticulous I used my hands and applied to my roots which I thought could cause a problem since I was getting a little beyond my roots. It came out absolutely perfect though. My only real complaint is the color washes out of the occasional gray hair after about a month. If your hair is past shoulder length or thick definitely get two bottles to make sure you have enough.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair color for over a year- and it covers my gray/white hairs wonderfully and still looks natural. My natural hair color is a more of a reddish brown, but I thought since I had to color my hair anyway why not go a little more red?     It&#x27;s fast, easy. The only complaint is that I sometimes have to color before my three weeks are up. The color sometimes fades, but I guess I can&#x27;t really complain because I would rather be able to color my hair again than be 22 years old with white hairs!!!    This is my favorite shade of red from Perfect 10, but you probably need to have a lighter hair color to get the results you want. I read a review on this product for a woman who had black hair, she should try the dark auburn color, not the light. It isn&#x27;t covering her grays because it is meant for people with lighter hair.</li>
            <li> This is true to color and actually does only take about 10 minutes. Down side is that the color doesn&#x27;t stay very bright, and you&#x27;ve got to dye about every 4 weeks if you don&#x27;t want to look dull.</li>
            <li> Best haircolor to use if you are coloring every 4-6 weeks.  It only takes 10 minutes and the coverage is terrific.  The red is beautiful.  I receive compliments on my hair on a regular basis. Easy application and the red doesn&#x27;t fade as much as other brands.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair color! It&#x27;s much less damaging/drying than other 20-min types. It&#x27;s easy to adjust the time you need to color your grey, etc. Since my grey areas are very pourous, I can put the color on the rest of my hair for 10 min, but put it on the grey for just 5. And I don&#x27;t end up with some areas light auburn, the others bright orange. After rinsing if I see that the grey needs a bit more time, it&#x27;s no biggie to just color that portion for 5 more minutes since the mixed solution hasn&#x27;t been sitting around for 20 min. I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in my area stores, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. Leaves my hair shiny and natural looking, too.  WooHoo!</li>
            <li> I  found this product quick and easy to use and I particularly enjoy  the short waiting time (10-15 minutes) before the rinse-out.&lt;br /&gt;I like the shade - others I have tried even though they looked the same on the box came out looking too intense.&lt;br /&gt;It also does not have a harsh chemical smell -- some have made my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;It sometimes can be difficult  to find my color at the local drugstores, especially when it is on sale, so I was thrilled to find it on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon at pretty much the same price and then the joy of the subscription service so that I do not have to wander the streets&lt;br /&gt;looking for my hair color when I need it most (you know what I am talking about ladies).&lt;br /&gt;So, thanks Clairol for a great product and thanks Amazon for bringing it to my door.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. I like the 10 minute vs. 25 minute leave on time. I just wish there was a closer shade to my red than the ones available.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in store anymore. Buy it in mass quantities. Great coverage, easy and fast.  No one believes it comes from a box!</li>
            <li> I have naturally red hair. Now that I am older it seems to have lost some of its vibrant red color, plus I have white hair in the front. I have used many different hair dyes and Clairol Perfect 10 in 006r Light Auburn is the best ever. The color is bright and natural. Once I have covered my roots and then run it through the rest of my hair I only have to leave it on for 10 minutes. It leaves my hair very silky and conditioned. I try to only use it every 4 weeks so I can use it on my whole head each time. It leaves my hair in such great condition that now I am going to let my hair grow long again, something I have not done since I started coloring years ago. Other hair colors that I used left my hair dry and brittle in comparison. I like Perfect 10 much more than the Clairol Nice N&#x27;Easy I had been using. Apparently Perfect 10 uses a different process that is much kinder to your hair. I am so grateful that I can purchase this through Amazon as I live in a remote area. Thanks to Clairol and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I loved how fast this was so I tried it twice. However, it didn&#x27;t really cover my silver strands. I have black hair with some scattered silver and it only slighlty darkened the silver hair. I was a little frustrated becuase it looks like I still need to color it.</li>
            <li> I use to be able to buy this in the store and when i could no longer find it i came here to amazon and they had it . I&#x27;ve tried other hair colors but i truly love the perfect 10 light auburn by nice n easy it gives me the true color i want and had been missing , all others left me feeling like i wasted my money but not any more since i can find it here .  great color , easy to use and fast .</li>
            <li> If you read the dramatic claims of this product, it&#x27;s seductive. I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of regular Nice &#x27;n Easy and its only weakness is that it doesn&#x27;t completely cover grey roots for very long. So I tried this ~ at twice the N+E price. Perfect 10 vs N+E: both mix about the same. The comb applicator attachment is worthless for retouching (and is not recommended for it in the directions, so I wondered why it even mattered). The product works quickly. The directions say to leave it on 15 minutes for grey ~ and they also say that leaving it on longer (than 10 minutes) results in a darker product. (I&#x27;m blonde). So I gave it 12 min. The result was almost equal to N+E, except that my sun streaked blonde hair was an unrealistic ash blonde. Hoping it fades soon. Can&#x27;t see a single bit of improvement over N+E except saving 15 minutes of time. The N+E product is a better color and a much better price (I can usually find it for $5 a box). This product is a little too hyped for nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;ME&amp;#34; and the color I&#x27;ve used for the past 2 years.  I order it here from Amazon because no stores in my area carry it anymore.  On me, it comes out a tad darker than it shows on the box, but that could be because I&#x27;ve been coloring for a lot of years.  After the first wash or two it&#x27;s perfect for me.  It&#x27;s a GORGEOUS, &amp;#34;grown-up &amp; sexy&amp;#34; red with lots of shine and layered depth, not at all garish (Raggedy-Ann) red or brassy.  I use a cheapie, nylon paint brush to brush color onto the hair surrounding my face, the roots in the crown area and carefully, with a Q-tip, on my eyebrows, first (where my grays like to start peeking out), leave on for 10 minutes, then empty the rest of the color throughout my hair and leave on for another 5 minutes, then rinse with cold water, condition, and rinse cold again. The conditioner is PHENOMENAL, wish they sold it in bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m carefull to wash my hair separately in the sink each time in COLD water as everyone recommends,  but I&#x27;m not sure it makes all that much of a difference.  I still have to re-color every 3-4 weeks, but, Red is the most unstable of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quick and easy product to use and the color is great.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> Not the vibrant color on the box; my brunette hair, stayed pretty brunette - despite leaving the treatment in for 20 mins</li>
            <li> I love this light autumn color. The great thing about this is I dont have to sit in a chair for 3-4 hours, pay 250 dollars for my haircolor, and get done with the color in 10 minutes. It lasts about the same, 6 weeks, and I get more complements on this boxed color than the salon color. Hope to keep using this color as it is available. The red is very natural.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave a line of demarcation when your hair grows back in like permanent hair color does.  Also,  it&#x27;s nice that it isn&#x27;t on your scalp for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> I did like this hair color, but my one complaint about it was, it has a pinkish tint to it.  I am a natural red head, but with age, as all you red heads out there now, it has lightened up alot.  I am 48, and have a lot of what I like to say blonde streaks.  This color looked like my natural hair color except for the tint it has in it.  I have washed it about 6 times in 5 days, hoping to lighten it a little.  It is getting there.  But otherwise, it was easy just 10 minutes.  It does smell a lot.  Make sure the room you are in has ventalation.  Question to other red heads out there that have lightened up.  Do you know of any color out there that does not give a pink tint?</li>
            <li> they dont sell this around here so i am very greatful to have found it at a great price. thanks</li>
            <li> This is &amp;#34;MY&amp;#34; color, the one I use most often and always come back to - if they ever stop making it, I&#x27;m in a world of hurt. I have naturally mouse-brown hair, and this is just enough to make it very interesting and more toward auburn, with the best highlights I&#x27;ve ever had, and great shine!</li>
            <li> 5 STARS SAYS IT ALL....I DO NOT HAVE ANY COMMENTS TO MAKE...HATE THE WAY YOU COERCE/HARASS/PROD YOUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE COMMENTS WHEN IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY.</li>
            <li> I just used perfect 10 for the first time.  It only took 10 minutes as stated.  It looks just like the front of the box.  My natural hair used to be a darker auburn but darkened as it greyed.  The smell is stronger than some but after I rinsed it out and applied the conditioner it smells fine. So far so good,  only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the product, but the packaging was just terrible how they sent it and each one of the four I ordered was squashed,  smashed and leaked. It was so sad to have to  contact them to say it was in bad shape. Love this dye and haven&#x27;t been able to find it where I live. So disappointed. ..</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair various hues of red (with DIY hair color) for 5+ years now. My natural color is a dark ashy blonde, my hair is medium thickness and long enough to hit mid-back. I have been using Perfect 10 for about a year, and I color my hair every 10-12 weeks (my natural color blends pretty well as it grows out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review in response to some negative reviews I&#x27;ve seen. I think a lot of the people with the following complaints could have saved some trouble if they had access to some of the below information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Complaints that the color didn&#x27;t coat all their hair, leaving it splotchy and two-tone --&amp;#62; This is because you did not apply the color completely over all of your hair. I always have a friend apply my color for me with the Root Applicator Tip, applying front to back, root to tip, into a sort of &amp;#34;pony tail&amp;#34;. I also use 2 boxes of color to cover all of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;*Complaints that the color faded or washed out --&amp;#62; Although you will see slightly different results with different brands (etc), red hair color is always fast to fade. This is not because the color is &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;poor quality&amp;#34; but because from a molecular level, red pigment is very very heavy and so it washes out faster than other pigments. Your color will appear more and more copper-like as time goes by and it gets washed.&lt;br /&gt;*Complaints that the color was dramatically darker or brighter than expected --&amp;#62; When specified, most of the reviewers were some shade of blonde prior. If you are naturally blonde (even dark blonde), you need to keep in mind that most hair color swatches show results for BROWN hair. Whatever results show for light brown, it will be even more intense for you. The good side about red fading is that you don&#x27;t have to panic! Once you wash it a couple times it will change to a less intense shade.&lt;br /&gt;*Complaints that the color was more &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;auburn&amp;#34; --&amp;#62; Again, this probably comes from reviewers with naturally lighter hair. And, again, the color is designed for brown hair. This was an issue I resolved by mixing the Dark Auburn with the Medium Brown.&lt;br /&gt;First, I squirted both tubes of color creme into a sandwich-sized Ziploc, sealed, and mixed it up by working it with my hands. I bought a small hair color applicator bottle from a beauty supply store (because it marks fluid ounces on the side). I poured ONE of the bottles of activator into this new bottle. Then I cut a little bit off the corner of the Ziploc and, watching the side for change in ounces, put in enough of the color creme to equal 2.43 oz approximately (the size of one full tube). I apply this bottle before mixing what is left in the other bottle. This is because, since Perfect 10 develops faster, it also expires faster. If you mix both bottles in the beginning, while you are applying the first one, time is ticking on the second one. Perfect 10 is only good for 25 minutes, which means it has to all be applied within 15 minutes or you won&#x27;t get fully developed color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps people with their at-home hair color experience!!urally lighter hair. And, again, the color is designed for brown hair. This was an issue I resolved by mixing the Dark Auburn with the Medium Brown.  First, I squirted both tubes of color creme into a sandwich-sized Ziploc, sealed, and mixed it up by working it with my hands. I bought a small hair color applicator bottle from a beauty supply store (because it marks fluid ounces on the side). I poured ONE of the bottles of activator into this new bottle. Then I cut a little bit off the corner of the Ziploc and, watching the side for change in ounces, put in enough of the color creme to equal 2.43 oz approximately (the size of one full tube). I apply this bottle before mixing what is left in the other bottle. This is because, since Perfect 10 develops faster, it also expires faster. If you mix both bottles in the beginning, while you are applying the first one, time is ticking on the second one. Perfect 10 is only good for 25 minutes, which means it has to all be applied within 15 minutes or you won&#x27;t get fully developed color.  I hope this helps people with their at-home hair color experience!!</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown/black hair and Perfect10 manages to lighten it to a shade very close to the one pictured on the box.  I have tried other box colors from various companies and my hair rarely took on the color I wanted. I&#x27;ve been using this brand/color for a few years now and have a few observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Will get you the color that&#x27;s on the box.  You might have to leave it on for longer than 10 minutes though if you have really dark hair&lt;br /&gt;- Includes an awesome conditioner that will leave your hair shiny and smooth after coloring&lt;br /&gt;- Less wasteful packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much product as before.  I have long hair (a bit past the shoulders) and one box used to be enough to cover each strand.  Best to have two boxes on hand if your hair is really long (mid-back and longer).&lt;br /&gt;- The gloves that come in the box now (thin/flimsy plastic, one size fits all (too big)) aren&#x27;t as good as the ones you got before (thicker, the gloves fit well).&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is pretty strong&lt;br /&gt;- Hair feels like straw after rinsing the dye from your hair.  However, the conditioner that is provided seems to remedy that (see above).</li>
            <li> I love the 10 minute working time on this brand. My short hair needs only one box and it works well for me.</li>
