    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best mirror.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a gorgeous item!</li>
            <li>Even with the shipping charges it proved to be a great deal, and it arrived in just a couple days after ordering.</li>
            <li>The person I bought it for, is truly happy.</li>
            <li>oh my! Lol</li>
            <li>I bought two mirrors for my nieces and they are great for them.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice mirror for doing your makeup.  </li>
            <li>The lighting is good and it works well for her.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it &amp; the light is plenty bright, and she can see everything she needs to.</li>
            <li>It provides really good light and the bulbs have a looooong life.  </li>
            <li>I love my mirror.</li>
            <li>so I make sure to turn it off and unplug after 15-20</li>
            <li>For the cost, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Now then have a nice mirror to get ready any time.</li>
            <li>and the light isn&#x27;t bright enough.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to fine a new one just like it.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it had two (2) magnifying strengths, but for myself I would prefer something a bit bigger in size.  </li>
            <li>Got  this as a gift for my wife -- we recently downsized into a &amp;#34;tiny home&amp;#34; type place, so it&#x27;s compact size is really nice..  </li>
            <li>The mirror is very small and doesn&#x27;t turn as smoothly as it should, although, it does have a good quality light and mirror</li>
            <li>It was my first time buying one</li>
            <li>My husband opened it up and put a stronger bulb in it, but it gets really hot</li>
            <li>Eventually, I found a tall basic ( no lighting)  mirror in the thrift store for $2 and am fine with that.</li>
            <li>so it could be very helpful to use.</li>
            <li>But my mother-in-law just absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Like the other reviews say, very very dim light and it heats up quickly</li>
            <li>Very true to outside color, only looking at 3x my pores</li>
            <li>This mirror was too short to be useful.</li>
            <li>this mirror does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - although it&#x27;s a little short (i put it on top of a book on my dresser to do my makeup).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to say too many negative things about either mirror; they just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because the light really is not effective and actually impedes your vision if that makes any sense.</li>

            <li> I had a Conair make up mirrow identicle to this one.  I was so glad to fine a new one just like it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this item in the department stores for the price I could purchase on Amazon.com and it was getting close to Christmas. Even with the shipping charges it proved to be a great deal, and it arrived in just a couple days after ordering. The person I bought it for, is truly happy.</li>
            <li> this mirror does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - although it&#x27;s a little short (i put it on top of a book on my dresser to do my makeup). but it&#x27;s cheaper at ulta! i picked it up for $19.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she loves it!! The lighting is good and it works well for her.</li>
            <li> The mirror is very small and doesn&#x27;t turn as smoothly as it should, although, it does have a good quality light and mirror so it could be very helpful to use.</li>
            <li> I love my mirror.Thank you.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A MIRROR. THE LIGHTS SEEM TO SERVE NO PURPOSE. THEY DO NOT ENHANCE THE VIEWING. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. DO NOT BUY, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A LIGHTED MIRROR THAT ACTUALLY DOES WHAT IT&#x27;S SUPPOSE TO DO.</li>
            <li> Very true to outside color, only looking at 3x my pores oh my! Lol</li>
            <li> For the cost, it&#x27;s fine. It was my first time buying one and I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s too small and the light isn&#x27;t bright enough. My husband opened it up and put a stronger bulb in it, but it gets really hot so I make sure to turn it off and unplug after 15-20 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will spend the extra money on a larger, brighter mirror so you can actually see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> If I had it to do again, I would pass on this purchase.  I stopped using it because the light really is not effective and actually impedes your vision if that makes any sense. I went back to my non lighted plain old mirror and am happier with that.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews say, very very dim light and it heats up quickly</li>
            <li> I thought it was bigger then it is :(</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift and seems to have hit the mark.  Works as advertised. No complaints from my daughter.</li>
            <li> Great price for a gorgeous item!</li>
            <li> This mirror was too short to be useful. Other than that, the lighting was not as advertised. I returned it for a three-sided lighted mirror and returned that too. The lighting was not good on either. I don&#x27;t want to say too many negative things about either mirror; they just didn&#x27;t work for me. Eventually, I found a tall basic ( no lighting)  mirror in the thrift store for $2 and am fine with that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law as a gift.  Her eyes aren&#x27;t what they use to be and she mentioned she wanted one after she saw mine.  I received mine as a gift, years ago.  I bought this one for her.  I liked the way it had two (2) magnifying strengths, but for myself I would prefer something a bit bigger in size.  But my mother-in-law just absolutely loves it.  She tells me that almost every time I see her.  She says, she doesn&#x27;t know what she would do without it.</li>
            <li> Got  this as a gift for my wife -- we recently downsized into a &amp;#34;tiny home&amp;#34; type place, so it&#x27;s compact size is really nice..  Wife loves it &amp; the light is plenty bright, and she can see everything she needs to.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mirror for doing your makeup.  It provides really good light and the bulbs have a looooong life.  The only negative is that the mirror is not very tiltable.  Not a lot of movement on the tilt.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars because i have broken 5 of these mirrors and still continue to purchase the exact same model.  It&#x27;s the best mirror.  Can see well and move it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I bought two mirrors for my nieces and they are great for them.  Now then have a nice mirror to get ready any time.</li>
