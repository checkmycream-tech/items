            <li>Received very quickly &amp; got a great deal from JeVan Collection!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, can&#x27;t shave with out it!</li>
            <li>Excellent Service very pleasead</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this item and would recommend to individuals with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Have been looking for this stuff for years to replace a bottle bought many, many moons ago.  </li>
            <li>Is it better than a Styptic pencil?</li>
            <li>But I do think this is better.</li>
            <li>That stops most bleeding.</li>
            <li>but she used this to be safe.</li>
            <li>I purchased Magic Touch to use trimming my dogs claws.</li>
            <li>Cut myself shaving on the day I received Magic Touch and stopped the bleeding immediately.</li>
            <li>was pleased to find it.</li>
            <li>(Infa-Lab also makes a powder styptic which I use more often).  </li>
            <li>Meh, it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>If it were more like a lite gel</li>
            <li>I would like it better.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Stings like a #$%&amp; for 1-2 seconds, then the sting goes away and you are not bleeding any more.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years after just giving it a try.  </li>
            <li>I am more than happy to have found a new source to obtain this product.  </li>
            <li>The blood-stopping ability of this product is far quicker and superior to the styptic pencils also.</li>
            <li>Really works !!!  </li>
            <li>Unlike a styptic pencil which (to me) burns like the devil, the sting is mild if any sting is felt at all.</li>
            <li>works quickly on cuts to stop bleeding</li>
            <li>After first use, this new formulation is not as effective.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would work on a real &amp;#34;gusher&amp;#34; but for small nicks and cuts from shaving, it works great!</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is great when getting small nicks, either from shaving, scraps, and punctures.</li>
            <li>and I found it is best used for areas that it would be difficult to apply powder and have the powder stay put</li>
            <li>I purchased my first bottle over fifteen years ago at a barber shop and still use it and like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is fast and it works!</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B007YV2YT8 LOT 3 KDS Lab Styptic Magic Touch Liquid 0.5 OZ Stop Minor Bleeding Blood Bleed]]</li>
            <li>Infa-Lab&#x27;s MAGIC TOUCH Liquid Styptic is FABULOUS for stopping small cuts, etc.</li>
            <li>It stops the bleeding but depending on the amount of bleeding it may take more than a single application.  </li>
            <li>I just toke up shaving with a barbers straight razor.</li>
            <li>I shave with a straight razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Stops bleeding fast.</li>
            <li>No white residue to clean of afterwards.</li>
            <li>Small cuts of any kind.</li>
            <li>One thing in particular, when you apply a dab of it on a razor cut it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue mark like when I used a Septic Pencil.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t set your expectations too high.</li>
            <li>I gave the product a few stars because it is easy to apply and stops bleeding fast, but then my bird licked her toe</li>
            <li>I do my own manicure and occasionally get a little close.  </li>
            <li>The main ingredient of an ammonium chloride urea (I believe, old bottle gone) is now ammonium chloride.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to a styptic pencil as long as this product is available.</li>
            <li>wow could not believe it</li>
            <li>This is the real McCoy, aluminum chloride that stops bleeding from nicks and cuts instantly without skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>They are making the old formula again, and it works.</li>
            <li>They use this at my nail shop to stop bleeding (I have sensitive cuticles) and it works, so I bought some for home.</li>
            <li>So far I prefer a styptic pen still.</li>
            <li>thought a few weeks ago, why not run a search on Amazon.com and see if it might be available.</li>
            <li>Wow, to my amazement I found it advertised.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves no mess like a styptic pencil would.</li>
            <li>You need to be real and remmember, this product is intended for nicks and minor cuts.  </li>
            <li>However, now I can simply place a drop of styptic on to my fingertip and apply directly onto the cut, which then immediately stops the bleeding.</li>
            <li>I only use Magic Touch to stop the occasional bleeding from the small puncture of a diabetic test lancet - not much of a challenge, but it does the job I ordered it for.</li>
            <li>Will use no other for minor shaving</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Have been looking for this stuff for years to replace a bottle bought many, many moons ago.  This is the real McCoy, aluminum chloride that stops bleeding from nicks and cuts instantly without skin irritation.  Beware of other formulations on the market that have gotten really negative reviews on both counts.  This is the one you want.</li>
            <li> Really works !!!  I just toke up shaving with a barbers straight razor. I get razor burn and lots of nicks. This stuff works great and I would buy it again. Is it better than a Styptic pencil? I think its close. But I do think this is better. The negative reviews I read were a little hard on the product. This is no mirical solution. Don&#x27;t set your expectations too high. it can stop my razor cuts easyly. I splash my face with ice cold water first. That stops most bleeding. Than any little bit of bleeding I apply about a drop and no more blood. Try and avoiud after shave with alchol. That will disolve the cloging and the cut will bleed worest. This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I hate the stypic pencils.  This stuff works great. A little dab on the nick and that&#x27;s it.  No white residue to clean of afterwards.</li>
            <li> I only use Magic Touch to stop the occasional bleeding from the small puncture of a diabetic test lancet - not much of a challenge, but it does the job I ordered it for.</li>

            <li> This is the best product to stop bleeding from shaving cuts! It&#x27;s the only thing I have found that works!</li>
            <li> Much better for stopping bleeding after shaving than traveling with a stupid pencil</li>
            <li> I purchased Magic Touch to use trimming my dogs claws. It works VERY poorly for that application, but maybe works better on humans.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, can&#x27;t shave with out it!</li>
            <li> Didn´t stop bleeding! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works.  I shave with a straight razor in the shower.  I often (beginner) nick myself.  An  application of this product stops the bleeding immediately.  I don&#x27;t know how it would work on a real &amp;#34;gusher&amp;#34; but for small nicks and cuts from shaving, it works great!</li>
            <li> Cut myself shaving on the day I received Magic Touch and stopped the bleeding immediately.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  They are making the old formula again, and it works.</li>
            <li> They use this at my nail shop to stop bleeding (I have sensitive cuticles) and it works, so I bought some for home. I use it on small scratches and stuff too!</li>
            <li> Works great for pet nail trimming.</li>
            <li> I like the liquid form of this styptic as it doesn&#x27;t leave white all over face such as the white pens do</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years... believe it is the best for razor nicks and cuts... stops bleeding immediately and leaves no residue when dry...</li>
            <li> Best styptic bar none. Shaving cuts. Small cuts of any kind. Stops bleeding fast. I keep a bottle at home, travel kit, and in my cars for those small emergencu needs. Great product. Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Dos not stop bleeding</li>
            <li> I had used this product previously and could not find it anywhere in stores so was pleased to find it. Unfortunately there was a product reformulation over the years (and it has been years) since my prior use. The main ingredient of an ammonium chloride urea (I believe, old bottle gone) is now ammonium chloride. After first use, this new formulation is not as effective. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Unlike a styptic pencil which (to me) burns like the devil, the sting is mild if any sting is felt at all. The blood-stopping ability of this product is far quicker and superior to the styptic pencils also. The product also contains an antibiotic which seems to be a sensible thing to add to a product that is intended to go onto a cut. I&#x27;ll never go back to a styptic pencil as long as this product is available.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised and I found it is best used for areas that it would be difficult to apply powder and have the powder stay put (Infa-Lab also makes a powder styptic which I use more often).  It stops the bleeding but depending on the amount of bleeding it may take more than a single application.  You need to be real and remmember, this product is intended for nicks and minor cuts.  I purchased my first bottle over fifteen years ago at a barber shop and still use it and like it.</li>
            <li> works quickly on cuts to stop bleeding</li>
            <li> I bought this for when I clip my bird&#x27;s claws. Big mistake. I gave the product a few stars because it is easy to apply and stops bleeding fast, but then my bird licked her toe and I thought she was going to be sick. I rinsed her feet, so no permanent harm, but will not use again for pet claws.</li>
            <li> Meh, it&#x27;s OK.  If it were more like a lite gel I would like it better.  As it is I have to use a lot to get it to work on my nicks.  So far I prefer a styptic pen still.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I do my own manicure and occasionally get a little close.  A little bit on a Q-tip stops the bleeding immediately, so you can continue with your manicure.  I have also used it on small nicks and it works well.</li>
            <li> Stings like a #$%&amp; for 1-2 seconds, then the sting goes away and you are not bleeding any more.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 20 years but since I live a long way from any Barber Shop Store I have been unable to obtain it.&lt;br /&gt;I thought a few weeks ago, why not run a search on Amazon.com and see if it might be available. Wow, to my amazement I found it advertised.  I ordered it Online and received it in a few days.  What a JOY!!!!!  This product always stops my razor cuts from bleeding almost instantly.  I am more than happy to have found a new source to obtain this product.  One thing in particular, when you apply a dab of it on a razor cut it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue mark like when I used a Septic Pencil.</li>
            <li> This product did not work well at all.  It took several applications and the bleeding did not stop.  I&#x27;ll go back to using a styptic pencil.  And please read the bottle before you put it in your medicine cabinet.  I had two other vendors send me liquid &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; instead of liquid styptic.  The bottles look identical.  [[ASIN:B007YV2YT8 LOT 3 KDS Lab Styptic Magic Touch Liquid 0.5 OZ Stop Minor Bleeding Blood Bleed]]</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so when ever I shave I have to worry about cutting razor bumps. Before I discovered liquid styptic I had to use paper towel to stop the bleeding. However, now I can simply place a drop of styptic on to my fingertip and apply directly onto the cut, which then immediately stops the bleeding. I am very impressed with this item and would recommend to individuals with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for years and it does the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> It is great when getting small nicks, either from shaving, scraps, and punctures. It stops the bleeding almost immediately.  It leaves no mess like a styptic pencil would.</li>
            <li> Excellent Service very pleasead</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years after just giving it a try.  Will use no other for minor shaving nicks.&lt;br /&gt;It is fast and it works!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Small nicks keep bleeding. Blood changes color but will not clod.</li>
            <li> Good stuff &amp; good service!!!!!</li>
