            <li> arrived quickly and looks okay, I just thought the pots were a little bigger</li>
            <li> so small great for prosthetic.</li>
            <li> Too thick and look shiny. And dont get one caught in your eye. The lashes are so thick that it feels like a pin fell in your eye, and yes its all over. Best to get water in your eye to get that thing out and prepare for pain.</li>
            <li> If you have the patience and take your time to put the lashes one by one it is the most natural option out there and you get to customize your look.</li>
            <li> When I first viewed the tiny jar, it looked like a giant hairball stuck inside. I&#x27;m not a professional at eyelash extensions but I do them for my friends and family and they love them. This time I bought enough of them for practice on myself. The quality is great and its worth your money. I have to go through a very long shipping process considering I live so far away from the U.S but everything was in perfect condition. Would buy these again. Def!</li>
            <li> Looks like pubes in a bag</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was old hair out of a comb......it looks like a hair ball at first glance ..lol upon inspection these are very tiny individual lashes. Nothing like what they sell at the beauty supply store with that hideous knot at the end. If you aren&#x27;t a professional ...don&#x27;t purchase</li>
            <li> These eyelashes look and feel fake. In addition, they are difficult to apply by myself. I threw the whole thing away in frustration. Two positives are the cheap price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Loved them just need the glue</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try them</li>
            <li> At first I thought this product was silk, like the title said it was. They forget to mention in the title that it is not silk at all. I should have read through the description, because when it arrived in the mail, I realized it was infact synthetic... It is stiff, hard lashes. This is totally my fault for not researching it  properly, however I think the description should be altered so it doesn&#x27;t mislead anyone anymore.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love these they look very natural but give my eyelashes that extra pop... it takes time and patience to aplly them but im a hairstylist im cool with taking my time</li>
            <li> Creepy lashes and cheap looking don&#x27;t put this on anyone!</li>
            <li> I have eyelash extensions and every once in a while when I can&#x27;t make it to the salon for a fill, I like to do a little touch-up myself. These are great loose lashes, but they are a little thin. Other than that, they work perfectly for me between appointments!</li>
            <li> Not what I thought I was buying,  Came in a tiny bag with thousands of compacted single lashes. This is only for professionals that do eyelashes, this is not to be done at home by yourself.</li>
            <li> Cheap thick lashes they are like plastic</li>
            <li> These are not silk lashes they are so thick.</li>
            <li> love these extensions, will order again for sure, high quality , shipped fast and safe. I look forward to doing business with them again.</li>
            <li> These are great lashes.  What I like the most about these is that they are so natural and light. I&#x27;ve purchased .20mm lashes before and they are too thick.  The thickness of these are perfect.</li>
            <li> They just make my eyes pop!Love these use them alllllll the time.</li>
