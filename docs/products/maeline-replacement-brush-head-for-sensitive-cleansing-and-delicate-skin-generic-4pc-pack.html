            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so far so great!  </li>
            <li>Good cheap option to replace your name brand bruses.</li>
            <li>These fit just fine and are great.  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews where people are complaining of a water spray while using</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased.</li>
            <li>At any rate, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>For a way better price</li>
            <li>MUCH MUCH better price than my clarisonic brushes.  </li>
            <li>I would return to buy more...</li>
            <li>Fit my clairsonic perfectly and the fibers of the brushes were soft.</li>
            <li>These are perfect, cheaper, generic alternatives to the original Clarisonic replacement brush heads!</li>
            <li>Fits great on my mia and by far a better price than clarisonic.</li>
            <li>It seems a bit softer than the Clarisonic heads, which is great for me because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>With the original brush head, there was one or two streams of very fine water spray, where this one has a TON.</li>
            <li>not as good as the real deal, but wifey says the work fine....</li>
            <li>Such a good value!</li>
            <li>Great little brushes for a good price.  </li>
            <li>many have mentioned, these are rougher than the original clarisonic heads.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft, great quality, and absolutely fit the Mia 2 with no problem whatsoever.</li>
            <li>When I need to stretch my budget this would be an easy compromise.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again, but it is a fine alternative to spending $25/head.</li>
            <li>They work just fine in my Clarisonic Mia 2.,  </li>
            <li>If you use it in the shower, it&#x27;s fine, but anywhere else is going to spray water all over.</li>
            <li>These brushes fit fine</li>
            <li>They fit my Mia just fine</li>
            <li>Works just like the Clarisonic but huge price difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>It glided in a smooth feel instead of feeling like the brush was scratching my face.</li>
            <li>and I genuinely cannot tell a difference between this brand and the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li>Of course my husband didn&#x27;t feel comfortable washing his face with that, so we threw it away and he tried another Maeline brush.</li>
            <li>And I was delighted to find it softer than the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; sensitive skin brushes.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t remember if this fine water spray happened with the original brush.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m super happy and will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
            <li>Work&#x27;s like the original</li>
            <li>Almost like the original.  </li>
            <li>Using these, I have noticed a significant improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>The original brush head didn&#x27;t have any of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>he original</li>
            <li>No difference from original brand ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a penny pincher, so when I found these I was so excited.</li>
            <li>My originals would get a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; after a while, and I felt like I was always having to clean them.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased!</li>
            <li>So, excellent for the price will not but another $25 brush head, so ridiculous, also I do not find an issue with water spray as opposed to the original</li>
            <li>Probably more so than many things I&#x27;ve bought through Amazon (that are generic).</li>
            <li>They fit - they work- and at $14/4, you&#x27;re really wasting money NOT trying them.</li>
            <li>I love how soft the heads are</li>
            <li>While these brushes look pretty much exactly like the Clarisonic brand brushes and fit onto my Clarisonic Pro correctly, I will not be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin, especially during the winter months and these sensitive brush heads are perfectly gentle on my skin while also perfect at removing makeup and nicely cleaning the skin!</li>
            <li>a and stayed using them right away,</li>
            <li>They work fine; the only problem I&#x27;m having is that there a a fine spray of water from the brushhead.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush head are not as soft as the original, so it&#x27;s more abrasive than I want a sensitive brush head to be.</li>
            <li>so they are a great, more expensive alternative.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are just as good as the ones that came with my Clarasonic Mia but cost half as much!  </li>
            <li>I used my Clarisonic for the first time, it was life changing.</li>
            <li>The brush feels stiffer and more dense than the Clarisinic ones so a lighter touch is necessary when using it.  </li>
            <li>Why pay more for the name brand when the generic work just as well!</li>
            <li>Clarisonic&#x27;s antimicrobial heads would last me 3 months almost top the dot.</li>
            <li>and I usually only use my Clarisonic every other day, however with these brush heads being so soft I have started using my Clarisonic every day, with awesome results.</li>
            <li>At way less than half of the cost of the name brand brush heads, these are perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I bought a Clarisonic Mia 2 about a year ago and it has been an amazing product, but the price for a single replacement brush head is $25 - definitely not the most economical solution to maintaining a solid skincare routine.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me, and I found it was fine using once daily</li>
            <li>The only thing I noticed was a fine water spray while using the new brush at first.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much better than expected.</li>
            <li>These are much nicer than the &amp;#34;other ones&amp;#34;  I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Just like the real thing although cheaper.</li>
            <li>First time using the brush it was pretty soft on my face.</li>
            <li>, I found this a little rougher than the Clarisonic version, but still, it&#x27;s so worth the price!!!  </li>
            <li>I originally had the Sensitive brush heads on my Clarisonic, but I was pleasantly surprised when I got these in the mail.</li>
            <li>Perhaps because I used to buy the original Clarisonic acne or the deep pore cleaner ones and maybe those heads just weren&#x27;t the choice for my skin.</li>
            <li>works like original only cheaper</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only buying original Clarisonic brush heads from now on.</li>
            <li>and I still feel my same clean as with my name brand ones.  </li>
            <li>I had success buying replacement brushes from a third party seller on Amazon - I&#x27;m still not sure if they were authentic or generic, but they seemed to work OK.</li>
            <li>and I must say it&#x27;s pretty soft.</li>
            <li>Not my first choice and would be cautious recommending to anyone who is used to Clarisonic&#x27;s sensitive heads.</li>
            <li>If you have to throw these out weekly and use a new one you&#x27;ll end up spending just as much money as you would on the Clarisonic brand brushes anyway.</li>
            <li>I got a bargain deal as others were offering less brushes for more money.  </li>
            <li>These generic brush heads look convincing enough.</li>
            <li>and I want to like them, but at some point I think it may be worth spending the extra money on the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolutely must by for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>These certainly look exactly the same as the brush that came with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Not as firm as the clarisonic, which I love.  </li>
            <li>I doubt they&#x27;ll hold up as long as the originals, but that&#x27;s ok because I want to replace them fairly regularly anyway.</li>
            <li>I know some reviewers stated that they had some splash back with this brush head, but I can&#x27;t speak to that as I use mine in the shower and rarely use it over the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>Even brand new</li>
            <li>These are VERY soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>Brushes meet same physical and quality criteria as original equipment at a lower price.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel exactly the same, but I think they&#x27;re softer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if your skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive as mine and you&#x27;re less picky about what you put on it, then this brush head it probably fine.</li>
            <li>They are gentle enough for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They also feel soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the Clarisonic brand sensitive brush heads</li>
            <li>Seems to work so far.</li>
            <li>This generic brush head is much rougher than band name version.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as the Clarisonic version</li>
            <li>It is for sensitive skin and feels like it.</li>
            <li>Bristles so far are holding up, but time will tell as it&#x27;s too soon.</li>
            <li>These are even softer than the Sensitive brush heads, so I would safely venture to say they would be comparable to the Delicate version of the Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the Clarisonic brand heads but not as expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not as good as the real brush heads, but it is fine.</li>
            <li>So, even though the authentic brushes are expensive, this reviewer has learned the lessen that sometimes you really do get what you way for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, for the price - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a little annoyance.  </li>
            <li>Aside from lacking the &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34; branding on the clear plastic cover, these brush heads look remarkably similar to the name brand product.</li>
            <li>These are a great, much less expensive relacement.</li>
            <li>First use, the black color is running - makes me wonder what it is leXving on my face ....</li>
            <li>I agree with the reviewer who says they are a tiny bit rougher than the name brand so order a level down, I ordered sensitive because of that review and they are just like the normal in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I found that paying a little extra for the name brand is worth it, they last, are softer, it ends up about the same.</li>
            <li>The delicate heads are supper soft and gentle on my face!</li>
            <li>First impression: It came in a plain white box, nothing fancy.</li>

            <li> While these brushes look pretty much exactly like the Clarisonic brand brushes and fit onto my Clarisonic Pro correctly, I will not be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin, especially during the winter months and these sensitive brush heads are perfectly gentle on my skin while also perfect at removing makeup and nicely cleaning the skin!</li>
            <li> a and stayed using them right away,</li>
            <li> They work fine; the only problem I&#x27;m having is that there a a fine spray of water from the brushhead.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush head are not as soft as the original, so it&#x27;s more abrasive than I want a sensitive brush head to be.</li>
            <li> so they are a great, more expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are just as good as the ones that came with my Clarasonic Mia but cost half as much!  </li>
            <li> I used my Clarisonic for the first time, it was life changing.</li>
            <li> The brush feels stiffer and more dense than the Clarisinic ones so a lighter touch is necessary when using it.  </li>
            <li> Why pay more for the name brand when the generic work just as well!</li>
            <li> Clarisonic&#x27;s antimicrobial heads would last me 3 months almost top the dot.</li>
            <li> and I usually only use my Clarisonic every other day, however with these brush heads being so soft I have started using my Clarisonic every day, with awesome results.</li>
            <li> At way less than half of the cost of the name brand brush heads, these are perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I bought a Clarisonic Mia 2 about a year ago and it has been an amazing product, but the price for a single replacement brush head is $25 - definitely not the most economical solution to maintaining a solid skincare routine.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me, and I found it was fine using once daily</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed was a fine water spray while using the new brush at first.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much better than expected.</li>
            <li> These are much nicer than the &amp;#34;other ones&amp;#34;  I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Just like the real thing although cheaper.</li>
            <li> First time using the brush it was pretty soft on my face.</li>
            <li> , I found this a little rougher than the Clarisonic version, but still, it&#x27;s so worth the price!!!  </li>
            <li> I originally had the Sensitive brush heads on my Clarisonic, but I was pleasantly surprised when I got these in the mail.</li>
            <li> Perhaps because I used to buy the original Clarisonic acne or the deep pore cleaner ones and maybe those heads just weren&#x27;t the choice for my skin.</li>
            <li> works like original only cheaper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only buying original Clarisonic brush heads from now on.</li>
            <li> and I still feel my same clean as with my name brand ones.  </li>
            <li> I had success buying replacement brushes from a third party seller on Amazon - I&#x27;m still not sure if they were authentic or generic, but they seemed to work OK.</li>
            <li> and I must say it&#x27;s pretty soft.</li>
            <li> Not my first choice and would be cautious recommending to anyone who is used to Clarisonic&#x27;s sensitive heads.</li>
            <li> If you have to throw these out weekly and use a new one you&#x27;ll end up spending just as much money as you would on the Clarisonic brand brushes anyway.</li>
            <li> I got a bargain deal as others were offering less brushes for more money.  </li>
            <li> These generic brush heads look convincing enough.</li>
            <li> and I want to like them, but at some point I think it may be worth spending the extra money on the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolutely must by for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> These certainly look exactly the same as the brush that came with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Not as firm as the clarisonic, which I love.  </li>
            <li> I doubt they&#x27;ll hold up as long as the originals, but that&#x27;s ok because I want to replace them fairly regularly anyway.</li>
            <li> I know some reviewers stated that they had some splash back with this brush head, but I can&#x27;t speak to that as I use mine in the shower and rarely use it over the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> Even brand new</li>
            <li> These are VERY soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> Brushes meet same physical and quality criteria as original equipment at a lower price.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel exactly the same, but I think they&#x27;re softer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if your skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive as mine and you&#x27;re less picky about what you put on it, then this brush head it probably fine.</li>
            <li> They are gentle enough for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> They also feel soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the Clarisonic brand sensitive brush heads</li>
            <li> Seems to work so far.</li>
            <li> This generic brush head is much rougher than band name version.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as the Clarisonic version</li>
            <li> It is for sensitive skin and feels like it.</li>
            <li> Bristles so far are holding up, but time will tell as it&#x27;s too soon.</li>
            <li> These are even softer than the Sensitive brush heads, so I would safely venture to say they would be comparable to the Delicate version of the Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Clarisonic brand heads but not as expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as good as the real brush heads, but it is fine.</li>
            <li> So, even though the authentic brushes are expensive, this reviewer has learned the lessen that sometimes you really do get what you way for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, for the price - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a little annoyance.  </li>
            <li> Aside from lacking the &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34; branding on the clear plastic cover, these brush heads look remarkably similar to the name brand product.</li>
            <li> These are a great, much less expensive relacement.</li>
            <li> First use, the black color is running - makes me wonder what it is leXving on my face ....</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer who says they are a tiny bit rougher than the name brand so order a level down, I ordered sensitive because of that review and they are just like the normal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I found that paying a little extra for the name brand is worth it, they last, are softer, it ends up about the same.</li>
            <li> The delicate heads are supper soft and gentle on my face!</li>
            <li> First impression: It came in a plain white box, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> That may sound dramatic, but my skin felt so soft and looked smoother after a single use.</li>
            <li> These generic brush heads are just not near the same quality as the name brand.  </li>
            <li> I do not know this product is true or false.</li>
            <li> I would get the sensitive heads from clarisonic, so there&#x27;s no way for me to go a step down.</li>
            <li> will see if they hold up as long.</li>
            <li> I did initially have slight difficulty getting in on, but it worked.</li>
            <li> I previously had generic ones for acne but they became too rough on my skin for the winter.</li>
            <li> And I bought a little different.</li>
            <li> I thought these brushes were rough and not at all close to the Clairsonic brushes, would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Even when washed and dried daily, the brush stunk and looked brown.</li>
            <li> After about a week this brush started to smell like a dirty, mildewy towel while my Clarisonic brand brush was still clean looking and did not have a smell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine many being disappointed.</li>
            <li> I read in other reviews the brush heads were too abrasive</li>
            <li> I bought them as stocking stuffers and the other people who received them just threw theirs away after a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li> Not worth returning.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that it&#x27;s likely anyone writing negative reviews about these brush heads has some stake in the Clarisonic company.</li>
            <li> After using these brushes, my skin feels rougher, less even, and I have small patches of dry skin around my mouth.</li>
            <li> Cost less</li>
            <li> Feels like little needles.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer these as they feel softer and less irritating on my skin.</li>
            <li> - inferior exfoliation, uneven skin texture and surface</li>
            <li> I was worried that they might not fit snugly into the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> Having used these replacement brushes for the past few days, I can say they feel and work nothing like the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> I purchased it thinking I was receiving the same quality just the generic version, and I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hard to match this deal.</li>
            <li> they also complained to the bristles coming out of the brush head which again I&#x27;ve no no problems with.  </li>
            <li> so I purchased the delicate brush heads.</li>
            <li> When I dry it, it also sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> They may be inexpensive, but they are not a good value.</li>
            <li> but quality was poor.</li>
            <li> Turn dirty green after about one month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Poor quality</li>
            <li> I like the normal Clarisonic brush heads and was very disappointed in these.  </li>
            <li> If I use them much past 6 weeks, I start getting painful break</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t affect the job that it does, but it&#x27;s a little annoying.  </li>
            <li> Of course, the replacement heads are expensive, and I was looking to save some money.</li>
            <li> It had enough bristles on the brush compare to the clarisonic acne brush which I hate and will never purchase again!</li>
            <li> Just like the brand name ones but so much less expensive!!!</li>
            <li> This Maeline brush also started to take on a brownish hue as if it was dirty or growing mold.</li>
            <li> They get the job done but they SMELL so bad!</li>
            <li> horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These heads fit my Clarisonic Mia 2 perfectly. Same quality brush as the one that came with it. Way cheaper than buying the name brand Clarisonic replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I do not know this product is true or false.And I bought a little different.</li>
            <li> As described work great</li>
            <li> I could not tell them from my clarisonic heads. will see if they hold up as long.</li>
            <li> These generic brush heads look convincing enough. Aside from lacking the &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34; branding on the clear plastic cover, these brush heads look remarkably similar to the name brand product. They also feel soft to the touch. Having used these replacement brushes for the past few days, I can say they feel and work nothing like the Clarisonic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used my Clarisonic for the first time, it was life changing. That may sound dramatic, but my skin felt so soft and looked smoother after a single use. Of course, the replacement heads are expensive, and I was looking to save some money. I had success buying replacement brushes from a third party seller on Amazon - I&#x27;m still not sure if they were authentic or generic, but they seemed to work OK. I purchased these Maeline Replacement Brushes based on the reviews and the price. They&#x27;re incredibly inexpensive. But, that&#x27;s about it. They may be inexpensive, but they are not a good value. After using these brushes, my skin feels rougher, less even, and I have small patches of dry skin around my mouth. These are obviously not the results I wanted. So, even though the authentic brushes are expensive, this reviewer has learned the lessen that sometimes you really do get what you way for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - no I do not recommend these products&lt;br /&gt;Results - inferior exfoliation, uneven skin texture and surface</li>
            <li> These brushes fit fine but quality was poor. Not worth returning.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these replacement brush heads!!  i will never ever again pay $25-$30 on a name brand name head.  I read many reviews where people are complaining of a water spray while using (I did not experience that) they also complained to the bristles coming out of the brush head which again I&#x27;ve no no problems with.  I love how soft the heads are and I still feel my same clean as with my name brand ones.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> It does what it needs to do for a fraction of the price. I will note that you do feel the difference in the quality of the bristles. I actually prefer these as they feel softer and less irritating on my skin. I&#x27;m very glad I found these!</li>
            <li> Works just like the Clarisonic but huge price difference. Glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s like the original</li>
            <li> not as good as the real deal, but wifey says the work fine....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the Clarisonic brand sensitive brush heads so they are a great, more expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> These are a great, much less expensive relacement.</li>
            <li> Seems to work so far.</li>
            <li> These generic brush heads are just not near the same quality as the name brand.  Even brand new the bristles are frayed. I will not cut corners again!</li>
            <li> These fit the Clarisonic just perfectly and are a great value. Glad I bought them!</li>
            <li> Ordered this item for second time. Brushes meet same physical and quality criteria as original equipment at a lower price. Will purchase again when required.</li>
            <li> Almost like the original.  Cost less</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much better than expected.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> I am convinced that it&#x27;s likely anyone writing negative reviews about these brush heads has some stake in the Clarisonic company. I was just happy these guys fit my Mia 2, but besides that...  They&#x27;re very effective. Using these, I have noticed a significant improvement in my skin. Perhaps because I used to buy the original Clarisonic acne or the deep pore cleaner ones and maybe those heads just weren&#x27;t the choice for my skin. At any rate, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. Probably more so than many things I&#x27;ve bought through Amazon (that are generic). It&#x27;s a fantastic deal. They fit - they work- and at $14/4, you&#x27;re really wasting money NOT trying them. Stick with the Clarisonic brush, but give these heads a try. I can&#x27;t imagine many being disappointed.</li>
            <li> hurts my face. Feels like little needles.</li>
            <li> I have the Clarisonic Pro and it fits just perfectly. It seems a bit softer than the Clarisonic heads, which is great for me because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> These are much nicer than the &amp;#34;other ones&amp;#34;  I ordered.  Will be ordering again in the future.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Work great!!!</li>
            <li> These work perfectly in my Mia 2 Clairsonic.  Excellent price for four.  Hard to match this deal.</li>
            <li> They fit my clarisonic perfect and works great.</li>
            <li> Yup!  Such a good value!</li>
            <li> Work great!  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> First impression: It came in a plain white box, nothing fancy. Took it out the box and felt the bristles on the brush and I must say it&#x27;s pretty soft. It had enough bristles on the brush compare to the clarisonic acne brush which I hate and will never purchase again! First time using the brush it was pretty soft on my face. It glided in a smooth feel instead of feeling like the brush was scratching my face. It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin and it&#x27;s a generic brand. For the price and quality, I get 4 brushes that will last me for a year for only $15! Overall I&#x27;m super happy and will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
            <li> This generic brush head is much rougher than band name version. I purchased it thinking I was receiving the same quality just the generic version, and I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my Mia &amp; works great! I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this brand &amp; the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as my clarisonic brush heads! For a way better price</li>
            <li> These look like Clarisonics brushes!  They fit my Mia just fine &amp; I am so pleased with their performance!  I will purchase these again and again!</li>
            <li> There great, they fit perfectly for a faction of the original Clarasonics price.</li>
            <li> Just like the real thing although cheaper. Great value.</li>
            <li> I thought these brushes were rough and not at all close to the Clairsonic brushes, would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my moms clarisonic and they work just as well as the name brand but for a much better price!</li>
            <li> These are perfect, cheaper, generic alternatives to the original Clarisonic replacement brush heads! I have sensitive dry skin, especially during the winter months and these sensitive brush heads are perfectly gentle on my skin while also perfect at removing makeup and nicely cleaning the skin! It&#x27;s an absolutely must by for sensitive skin! I previously had generic ones for acne but they became too rough on my skin for the winter. It&#x27;s recommended to change your brush head every 3 months so these will easily last you a year.</li>
            <li> They get the job done but they SMELL so bad! Would not reccomend</li>
            <li> so far so great!  MUCH MUCH better price than my clarisonic brushes.  These just arrived, only used them 1x.  Not as firm as the clarisonic, which I love.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> They work fine; the only problem I&#x27;m having is that there a a fine spray of water from the brushhead.  It doesn&#x27;t affect the job that it does, but it&#x27;s a little annoying.  However, for the price - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a little annoyance.  I will probably buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> The brush feels stiffer and more dense than the Clarisinic ones so a lighter touch is necessary when using it.  Takes some getting used to, but a great price!</li>
            <li> very good value and good product - choose a softer bristle than the name brand product</li>
            <li> Just like the brand name ones but so much less expensive!!!</li>
            <li> i was so happy to find these! these work just as well as the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; heads (which i have on my &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; unit) and for a fraction of the price. great find.</li>
            <li> These are excellent. Cannot tell the difference between these and the clarisonic heads. I got 4 for the price of 1. Defiantly will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am so please with these brushes. Wonderful and the price was terrific!</li>
            <li> Good cheap option to replace your name brand bruses. A lot softer then the one I had before but they are a good quality.</li>
            <li> these work great in my Clarsonic.</li>
            <li> Feels just like the Clarisonic brush... At a much better price!!!</li>
            <li> I did initially have slight difficulty getting in on, but it worked. And I was delighted to find it softer than the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; sensitive skin brushes. So far I am pleased! Received in a timely manner too.</li>
            <li> I got a bargain deal as others were offering less brushes for more money.  The brushes arrived in excellent condition and brushes as well.  I would return to buy more...</li>
            <li> I think they are perfect!!!! Work as good as the Clarisonic brand!</li>
            <li> works like original only cheaper</li>
            <li> Great Deal, Awesome Price, Works Excellent.  Not as soft as the Clarisonic version, I found this a little rougher than the Clarisonic version, but still, it&#x27;s so worth the price!!!  I&#x27;d recommend this without reserve.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as good as the real brush heads, but it is fine. It does spray a bit and the bristles come out sometimes. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again, but it is a fine alternative to spending $25/head.</li>
            <li> Great little brushes for a good price.  They work just fine in my Clarisonic Mia 2.,  Why pay more for the name brand when the generic work just as well!</li>
            <li> At way less than half of the cost of the name brand brush heads, these are perfect for me. They don&#x27;t feel exactly the same, but I think they&#x27;re softer. I doubt they&#x27;ll hold up as long as the originals, but that&#x27;s ok because I want to replace them fairly regularly anyway. My originals would get a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; after a while, and I felt like I was always having to clean them.</li>
            <li> I found that paying a little extra for the name brand is worth it, they last, are softer, it ends up about the same.</li>
            <li> horrible. they don&#x27;t even rotate. booooo.</li>
            <li> I bought a Clarisonic Mia 2 about a year ago and it has been an amazing product, but the price for a single replacement brush head is $25 - definitely not the most economical solution to maintaining a solid skincare routine. I originally had the Sensitive brush heads on my Clarisonic, but I was pleasantly surprised when I got these in the mail. These are even softer than the Sensitive brush heads, so I would safely venture to say they would be comparable to the Delicate version of the Clarisonic brush heads. I have combination skin and I usually only use my Clarisonic every other day, however with these brush heads being so soft I have started using my Clarisonic every day, with awesome results. They are extremely soft, great quality, and absolutely fit the Mia 2 with no problem whatsoever. They are not abrasive at all and I genuinely cannot tell a difference between this brand and the Clarisonic brand. I know some reviewers stated that they had some splash back with this brush head, but I can&#x27;t speak to that as I use mine in the shower and rarely use it over the bathroom sink. They are definitely worth the price and having four brush heads will last me at least four months. I will definitely be buying these again in the future.</li>
            <li> While these brushes look pretty much exactly like the Clarisonic brand brushes and fit onto my Clarisonic Pro correctly, I will not be purchasing them again. I started using a Clarisonic brand brush while my husband started using one of these Maeline brushes. After about a week this brush started to smell like a dirty, mildewy towel while my Clarisonic brand brush was still clean looking and did not have a smell. This Maeline brush also started to take on a brownish hue as if it was dirty or growing mold. Even when washed and dried daily, the brush stunk and looked brown. Of course my husband didn&#x27;t feel comfortable washing his face with that, so we threw it away and he tried another Maeline brush. Same problem with the second one!  If you have to throw these out weekly and use a new one you&#x27;ll end up spending just as much money as you would on the Clarisonic brand brushes anyway. I&#x27;ll stick with the name brand brushes and avoid wasting money on these again.</li>
            <li> Fits great on my mia and by far a better price than clarisonic. It is for sensitive skin and feels like it. Bristles so far are holding up, but time will tell as it&#x27;s too soon.</li>
            <li> Turn dirty green after about one month&#x27;s use. Poor quality</li>
            <li> These certainly look exactly the same as the brush that came with my Clarisonic. The only thing I noticed was a fine water spray while using the new brush at first. I couldn&#x27;t remember if this fine water spray happened with the original brush. If you use the Clarisonic in the shower, you would never notice.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Clarisonic brand heads but not as expensive. Been using for years the generic heads without issue.</li>
            <li> Works great, fit device perfectly, great price, and fast delivery! I read in other reviews the brush heads were too abrasive so I purchased the delicate brush heads. The delicate heads are supper soft and gentle on my face!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush head are not as soft as the original, so it&#x27;s more abrasive than I want a sensitive brush head to be. It feel like it&#x27;s just rubbing around on the surface of my skin instead of cleansing my pores like it&#x27;s meant to. With the original brush head, there was one or two streams of very fine water spray, where this one has a TON. If you use it in the shower, it&#x27;s fine, but anywhere else is going to spray water all over. When I dry it, it also sheds like crazy. The original brush head didn&#x27;t have any of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if your skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive as mine and you&#x27;re less picky about what you put on it, then this brush head it probably fine. It&#x27;s a great price for what you get, that&#x27;s for sure. I&#x27;m going to use up this four pack, but I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
            <li> These fit just fine and are great.  I was worried that they might not fit snugly into the Clarisonic but they do.  They are gentle enough for sensitive skin and I love the price!</li>
            <li> Softer brushes thant he original</li>
            <li> Fit my clairsonic perfectly and the fibers of the brushes were soft.</li>
            <li> No difference from original brand ... Except the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a penny pincher, so when I found these I was so excited. I got them in the mail, a and stayed using them right away, and I want to like them, but at some point I think it may be worth spending the extra money on the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many have mentioned, these are rougher than the original clarisonic heads. I would get the sensitive heads from clarisonic, so there&#x27;s no way for me to go a step down. This wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me, and I found it was fine using once daily (I could use the clarisonic heads twice daily, if needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback for me was the longevity. Clarisonic&#x27;s antimicrobial heads would last me 3 months almost top the dot. I received 4 heads in the Maeline package. If I use them much past 6 weeks, I start getting painful break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I repurchase? Maybe. When I need to stretch my budget this would be an easy compromise. Not my first choice and would be cautious recommending to anyone who is used to Clarisonic&#x27;s sensitive heads.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer who says they are a tiny bit rougher than the name brand so order a level down, I ordered sensitive because of that review and they are just like the normal in my opinion. So, excellent for the price will not but another $25 brush head, so ridiculous, also I do not find an issue with water spray as opposed to the original, I just tap the excess off before using. Super happy I have found an affordable alternative- loving my clairsonic again!!</li>
            <li> These are VERY soft bristles.  I like the normal Clarisonic brush heads and was very disappointed in these.  I bought them as stocking stuffers and the other people who received them just threw theirs away after a couple of uses.  I&#x27;m only buying original Clarisonic brush heads from now on.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are just as good as the ones that came with my Clarasonic Mia but cost half as much!  Buy them!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Wish I had stuck with brand. First use, the black color is running - makes me wonder what it is leXving on my face ....</li>
