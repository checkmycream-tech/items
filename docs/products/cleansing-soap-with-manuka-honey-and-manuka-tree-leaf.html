            <li> I like using this soap, but sometimes I still feel dry after. I&#x27;ve used it all over my body, but mostly I use it for my face. Sometimes I have to use more moisturizer than I would think after using this, but I don&#x27;t blame this soap for the issue since it&#x27;s winter. I like how it lathers, I like how it feels when I wash with it; but so far, it&#x27;s sort of like using Dove bar soap. I&#x27;d love to find a liquid manuka honey cleansing soap/body wash, but this will do until I find the right one for me. I purchased it to help soothe acne breakouts on my face, but I don&#x27;t notice anything different. I do like it, though.</li>
            <li> This soap does make my skin feel very soft and clean, however I can buy 6-8 bars of a nice regular soap at Walmart for the price of 1 of these bars.  I have NOT seen any improvement in my acne, so I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin super calm and mor moisturized after i apply it in the shower i like to use bath n body works after this is on my skin. i am trying to get rid of tinea versicolor psoriasis and some eczema spots</li>
            <li> This is a very nice soap. It lathers up great, but stays firm. I will order again when my budget allows.</li>
            <li> Just a regular soap. I do not understand what the hype is at all. Fast shipping and smell isn&#x27;t anything spectacular. I wrote a similiar comment and Amazon deleted it which is bizarre to me.</li>
            <li> This soap seems good for extra sensitive skin.  No feeling of a soap film on my skin after using.  And it is hardy enough to not disappear in a few days from water like some soaps do.  I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> A great honey soap that will soften and heal your skin. It is truly amazing, but pricy, so I was unable to continue using it.</li>

Now I have noticed the fine lines are less visible due to my skin being so moist. I am 49 years old and have struggled with adult acne for the past 29 years.

            <li> This soap is emollient, smells great and worth the price.  It is a smaller bar but I value the ingredients and am willing to pay for it.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin, especially if you have acne or other skin problems.  Only problem is the bars are small - would like larger bars.</li>
            <li> Waited awhile to write my review to make sure the soap works and so far, so good! I&#x27;m using it along with YS Bees Manuka Honey. **people please do your research on the real deal Manuka honey**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also wanted to say my soap isn&#x27;t messy at all. I read one review and it mentioned their soap was a complete mess once wet. If any soap sits in water, it becomes a mess and &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; but as long as u set this soap on a dry surface/soap dish after use, it will not get messy.

            <li> Nice clean smell. Love it, thanks!</li>
            <li> I have stopped using antything other than Manuka Honey products for my bath and body care.  Manuka Honey is one of the best natural products on the market today.  After bathing with the Cleansing Soap with Manuka Honey and Manuka Tree Leaf my skin feels not only cleansed but hydrated as well.  It lathers into a rich foamy cream which is luxuriant to the skin.  Afterwards I use with the Manuka Honey moisturing body butter and/or lotion which completes the my skin care routine.  I absolutely love these bath and beauty products.</li>
