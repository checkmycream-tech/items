            <li>The price is fair and the shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>It is the most wonderful blend of vanilla and slight cherry notes.</li>
            <li>Very nice soft vanilla with hint cherry.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this unique scent.</li>
            <li>When I sprayed the perfume it smelled strong of alcohol.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>If you love vanilla and enjoy a slight cherry sweet scent you will love love love this perfume!!</li>
            <li>The cherry vanilla is uplifting &amp; sweet, but not sickeningly so.  </li>
            <li>Waiting with anticipation when it will become available.</li>
            <li>Although it is worth the sellers asking price, i have never in my life paid more than $10 for this.</li>
            <li>Right on top of it</li>
            <li>and she absolutely adored getting it for Christmas!!!</li>
            <li>I love it too much!</li>
            <li>First purchased this at Wal-Mart for my daughter and fell in love with the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly not a bad thing when a guy thinks of you when you&#x27;re not around! ;)</li>
            <li>both my mom and i love this parfume, but have had a hard time finding it, so i bought her one also, and she is happy,</li>
            <li>It brings a smile to my face</li>
            <li>BUT FOUND SUCCESS ONLINE.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find the right scent.  </li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend if you like a sweet and lightly musky scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as rich-smelling, though, as I recall from 12+ years ago when I first wore it.</li>
            <li>Cherry Vanilla has been my favorite perfume for over 15 years and is my &amp;#34;signature scent.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve actually had guys tell me they knew I had been someplace because</li>
            <li>I get constant complements and my hubby barriers his face in my neck when I wear this. :)</li>
            <li>Such a refreshing &amp;#34;Summer&amp;#34; smell</li>
            <li>i spend $120 every other type of perfume so to have such an amazing scent for under $9 was flooring!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon prime.</li>
            <li>With hints of fresh creamy Vanilla and a slight note of sweet Cherry!</li>
            <li>It has a pretty cherry scent as is light, not heavy, and definitely not gaudy.  </li>
            <li>No woman that wants to smell fresh as the spring wind, would wear no other cologne than this choice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for casual, everyday use and even better for formal use!</li>
            <li>Sillage is low and longevity is moderate.&lt;br /&gt;Velvet vanilla cherry, not too sweet,</li>
            <li>I used to be able to get this locally, but now I can only get it online.  </li>
            <li>SHAME on them for jacking up the price so high.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite fragrance for a long time but my local retailers stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>Live in Alaska.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s time to find a new cologne</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s gonna be so surprised at Christmas!</li>
            <li>love this it is hard to find in the stores without paying high price gor 3 bottles for what one would ahve cost me</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nearly $60.</li>
            <li>If you like a natural vanilla scent, this is for you.</li>
            <li>Old and like there is a foul cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li>On mean occasion I have been stopped to ask what fragrance I am wearing so they could procures some for the Love ones.  </li>
            <li>I was in search of some new fragrances for the summer and came across this one during my search here on amazon, after seeing the low cost of the product I read the reviews and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>I ran out a few months ago and was very upset when I couldn&#x27;t find it at my normal store (Walmart),</li>

            <li> I ran out a few months ago and was very upset when I couldn&#x27;t find it at my normal store (Walmart),</li>
            <li> smelled a little old.</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been wearing other scents before ordering this from amazon, and while I like/love a lot of them, they don&#x27;t express me like</li>
            <li> Lasts a very very long time.</li>
            <li> Which sounds weird, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, though!  </li>
            <li> I have also been using this fragrance for 20 years, and like the other reviews, i always get compliments.</li>
            <li> BUTwe have ALWAYS paid less than $15.00 and it is now $47.63 per bottle...</li>
            <li> I wish it hade a little stronger fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I remember it being a little cheaper in stores though.</li>
            <li> SO HARD TO FIND</li>
            <li> It smelled so bad, like it was old.</li>
            <li> So disappointing that I cannot regularly find this in a store anymore.</li>
            <li> Cannot use the expensive perfumes due to allergies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find in my usual stores now.</li>
            <li> I used this perfume for years and recently, bought it from different stores and amazon because the smell was awful.</li>
            <li> I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean this perfume is being discontinued!</li>
            <li> So sad to see that its hard to find.</li>
            <li> Its actually subtle!</li>
            <li> People always think that it&#x27;s an expensive perfume</li>
            <li> Very sad I can no longer use this but have to use the body spray instead.</li>
            <li> Too bad it came dressed up as vericose vein lotion for halloween.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I got a bad one</li>
            <li> the smell was so bad.</li>
            <li> So incredibly frustrated that this is out of stock-everywhere.</li>
            <li> It too bad it is discontinued!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed to find that no stores sell this anymore.</li>
            <li> It has been terrible for two years.  </li>

            <li> I love this perfume so much. So sad to see that its hard to find. It is the most wonderful blend of vanilla and slight cherry notes. Lasts a very very long time. If you love vanilla and enjoy a slight cherry sweet scent you will love love love this perfume!! It has been a favorite of mine for years and i will buy it up untill the day i can&#x27;t find it anymore :)</li>
            <li> Great scent. This has been a favorite of my best friend for years and I was so happy to have found it here and she absolutely adored getting it for Christmas!!!</li>
            <li> I was in search of some new fragrances for the summer and came across this one during my search here on amazon, after seeing the low cost of the product I read the reviews and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I just received it in the mail today and I must say I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase...it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Love the product, but it is too expensive</li>
            <li> I love this cologne..My Twin and I have been exchanging it for Christmas/Birthdays. I get alot of complements when I wear it....BUTwe have ALWAYS paid less than $15.00 and it is now $47.63 per bottle...I guess it&#x27;s time to find a new cologne</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness. So incredibly frustrated that this is out of stock-everywhere. I absolutely love this unique scent. With hints of fresh creamy Vanilla and a slight note of sweet Cherry! This fragrance is so affordable, but smells different on every individual. I cannot count the times people have approached me with; &amp;#34;what on earth is that incredible scent you&#x27;re wearing?&amp;#34; Love it, and will be vigilant on checking back weekly, to see when Amazon will re-stock this delectable Perfume. Hurry, up Amazon! Summer is encroaching upon us, and this is my go to scent. Waiting with anticipation when it will become available.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!  SO HARD TO FIND BUT FOUND SUCCESS ONLINE.  ITEM WAS RECEIVED AS PROMISED. Wonderful transaction and I smell amazing!  Definitely would recommend if you like a sweet and lightly musky scent.</li>
            <li> awesome fragrance. I happened to comment on someones perfume and how lovely it was. she took it out of her purse and gave me the rest of her bottle to see if i liked it.. OOOOO.. i love it.. Iv been using for a week now and ive had people tell me how wonderful i smell already.. love it..</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! It&#x27;s great for casual, everyday use and even better for formal use! It&#x27;s such an elegant, delicious scent. I am very disappointed to find that no stores sell this anymore. I used to buy it at Walmart for $8.00 and here, online, it&#x27;s nearly $60. Looks like I&#x27;ll have to settle for the body spray.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this perfume, you can buy it at Wal-Mart for 8.00. I get soooooo many compliments on how great I smell when I wear it. It is ten time better than any expensive ones. This is all I use!</li>
            <li> Cherry Vanilla has been my scent for many years. Although I wasn&#x27;t thrilled to have to order it, I&#x27;m grateful it is still available</li>
            <li> Receive many compliments when I wear this cologne.  A variety of colognes are too strong for me and the cherry vanilla scent is perfect!</li>
            <li> This is the best Cologne ever! Been wearing it for 20 hrs n still love n worship it. And men everywhere always tell me how great I smell .</li>
            <li> Cherry, almond and vanilla. It&#x27;s not as rich-smelling, though, as I recall from 12+ years ago when I first wore it.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this perfume.  I&#x27;ve worn it for years and will continue to use it.  Best investment in perfume I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> Cherry Vanilla has been my favorite perfume for over 15 years and is my &amp;#34;signature scent.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve actually had guys tell me they knew I had been someplace because &amp;#34;my smell&amp;#34; (this perfume) was lingering in the air. It&#x27;s certainly not a bad thing when a guy thinks of you when you&#x27;re not around! ;)&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy the perfume at my local supercenter, but my local store doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore. I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean this perfume is being discontinued! I love it too much! I&#x27;ve actually been wearing other scents before ordering this from amazon, and while I like/love a lot of them, they don&#x27;t express me like this scent does. Which sounds weird, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it myself but it smells great on my wife,  If you like cherry and vanilla  then get some.</li>
            <li> My daughter has loved this fragrance for years. People always think that it&#x27;s an expensive perfume and she gets lots of compliments when she wears it. We can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so I was pleased to see that Amazon had it. She&#x27;s gonna be so surprised at Christmas!</li>
            <li> ive worn this forever. i spend $120 every other type of perfume so to have such an amazing scent for under $9 was flooring!</li>
            <li> Sillage is low and longevity is moderate.&lt;br /&gt;Velvet vanilla cherry, not too sweet, I get more vanilla than cherry in me.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it. It always was her favorite .but now I think it is becoming more popular. It is a fresh light scent great for teens</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for a long time but my local retailers stopped carrying it.  The price is fair and the shipping was fast.  If you like a natural vanilla scent, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for almost 20 years.  It has a pretty cherry scent as is light, not heavy, and definitely not gaudy.  A little goes a long way, though!  I used to be able to get this locally, but now I can only get it online.  I&#x27;m definitely going to have to stock up!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it lingers.  Delivered on time. I get constant complements and my hubby barriers his face in my neck when I wear this. :)</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find Cherry Vanilla . My local store stopped selling this item. I was worry that I could not find it. I been using this item for over 5 years. I always get great comments on what I am wearing. Thanks</li>
            <li> What more can I say...5 stars say it all!  I Love this Cherry Vanilla cologne spray.  My granddaughter loves it too and has asked me to spray her.  I recommend this cologne to everyone.</li>
            <li> The smell is as everybody describes, it smells like vanilla with some cherry notes, it&#x27;s a nice scent to wear for every day use.</li>
            <li> She smells great with this on.</li>
            <li> First purchased this at Wal-Mart for my daughter and fell in love with the smell of it. Have been purchasing it for myself since and now Wal-Mart stopped carrying it! Such a refreshing &amp;#34;Summer&amp;#34; smell</li>
            <li> I love this perfume , its all I wear . I get more compliments on it than any of really expensive ones. I am just wondering why walmart does not carry in stores any more?</li>
            <li> very happy with it. nothing smells any better on my wife. glad to find it . cant find it it the stores any more.</li>
            <li> I Oder 4  sherry vanilla Cologne spray and only got three Sherry Cologne spray.</li>
            <li> Cologne just as I remembered it.  Lasting too.  I spray it on in the morning and still smell it when I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> love this it is hard to find in the stores without paying high price gor 3 bottles for what one would ahve cost me</li>
            <li> it just didnt smell the same as i remembered. but it was still nice. both my mom and i love this parfume, but have had a hard time finding it, so i bought her one also, and she is happy, thats what counts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for close to 20 years and hare received more compliments than imaginable! I ran out a few months ago and was very upset when I couldn&#x27;t find it at my normal store (Walmart), thank goodness amazon had it In stock.... I bought 2!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice smell for the price.  Very nice soft vanilla with hint cherry.  Rec. In timely fashion.  Rob</li>
            <li> the cherry vanilla musk by cody has an awesome fragrance  this bottle didn&#x27;t say by cody, just cherry vanilla. there wasn&#x27;t any fragrance for 30.00 it is a rip off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for many years and I still get compliments on how good it smells . This is by far my favorite cologne ever !!!!</li>
            <li> The formula seems to have changed of that years ago. It still smells good. I would say it has more of a lit cigar smell to it with the cherry vanilla.</li>
            <li> My wife used to use this regularly, but the company must have changed the formula.  It has been terrible for two years.  No response from manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Have looked everywhere and finally found it through Amazon. Love it and the price was great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have also been using this fragrance for 20 years, and like the other reviews, i always get compliments. Although it is worth the sellers asking price, i have never in my life paid more than $10 for this. SHAME on them for jacking up the price so high. Walmarts site price is only $8.</li>
            <li> It is a gift, but I could not find it anywhere else.  I am glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> I wish it hade a little stronger fragrance.  It seems like the perfume that I brought at a local retailer had a stronger fragrance.</li>
            <li> No woman that wants to smell fresh as the spring wind, would wear no other cologne than this choice. Give it a try, you will not regret it....</li>
            <li> smelled a little old. But I still use it. Thank you and I would like to try vanilla musk next.</li>
            <li> This is what I always use and just love the smell. Cannot use the expensive perfumes due to allergies. This will be a re-purchase for me many times.</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for as long as I can remember. Always get compliments. My daughter actually wears it also. It&#x27;s very hard to find in my usual stores now. I was very pleased to find it on Amazon! I buy it in multiple.</li>
            <li> It was what I wanted as gift. It too bad it is discontinued!</li>
            <li> So glad my cherry vanilla perfume  came today.  Too bad it came dressed up as vericose vein lotion for halloween. Thanks amazon prime. Right on top of it</li>
            <li> Sister loved it, needed to buy more but price went way hi !</li>
            <li> When I sprayed the perfume it smelled strong of alcohol. It didn&#x27;t smell like the perfume that I used to buy at Walmart. I bought it here, because I figured it would smell just as nice as the perfume I bought at Walmart years ago. It smelled so bad, like it was old. I ended up buying the perfume off the company site for the cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Cherry Vanilla for years and years, buying it at a local store.  They have quit carrying it and so I was looking to replace it, but having no luck.  Couldn&#x27;t find the right scent.  I like this one because it reminds me of my granddad&#x27;s pipe from when I was a child.  When I checked it out on Amazon and it was there, I was thrilled.  My daughter also wears this cologne and is happy to know where we can get it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Sydney Couch</li>
            <li> Because I Like The Change Of Smell Of The parfume. How It Changes With Body. It Makes You Feel Wounderful.</li>
            <li> So disappointing that I cannot regularly find this in a store anymore. But glad that I found it here. Husband&#x27;s favorite smell, and I always get compliments when wearing it. Shipped quickly! I remember it being a little cheaper in stores though.</li>
            <li> My store stopped selling this item was ecstatic to find it on amazon only spray I use</li>
            <li> I have used Cherry Vanilla Cologne Spray for over 15 years or so.  On mean occasion I have been stopped to ask what fragrance I am wearing so they could procures some for the Love ones.  It reminds some of days gone bye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janice from Kansas</li>
            <li> I am in love with this perfume! When I use it all I need is a couple of spritses and that&#x27;s it! It&#x27;s not an overwhelming perfume. Its actually subtle!</li>
            <li> I used this perfume for years and recently, bought it from different stores and amazon because the smell was awful. I thought maybe I got a bad one but after purchasing on here and in different places...I think they changed the formula. What used to be a pleasant and vanilla scent that was light and everyone loved now smells like grandma&#x27;s stash from way back when. Old and like there is a foul cinnamon scent. Had to throw this one away bc the smell was so bad. Even contacted the company with no reply. Very sad I can no longer use this but have to use the body spray instead.</li>
