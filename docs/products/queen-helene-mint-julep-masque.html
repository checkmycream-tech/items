            <li>These are very affordable products that will do wonderful things for your skin.</li>
            <li>There is also a nice tingling sensation during use.</li>
            <li>Absolutely THE BEST masque out there.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, easy to use, and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This is the best face mask of them all by far</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels nice and refreshing yet not too minty.</li>
            <li>Its so easy to master as well!</li>
            <li>a great product delivering great results at a very low price...</li>
            <li>This mask along with a good diet and exercise routine keeps my skin looking clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a great item that does exactly what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, feels nice, and is fun to apply,</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I apply it every night; after washing it off in the morning, my face is more even and softer whilst pimples are smoothed out.</li>
            <li>will order some more</li>
            <li>Great for oily skin really reduces summer/oil break outs.</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>applying this, it does smell minty, which i love.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I love this mask.</li>
            <li>I love this mask.  </li>
            <li>It dries in about 10 minutes and in those 10 minutes magic happens.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, this is my favorite mask</li>
            <li>Works well and affordable :)</li>
            <li>and I have tried many many face masks.</li>
            <li>so make sure you have a moisturizer that will not clog pores (because that would be wasting your julep&#x27;s efforts)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li>As you take it off, the mask becomes silky smooth again, and your face is glowing!</li>
            <li>and I love that fact that I don&#x27;t feel the need to put foundation on before I leave the house</li>
            <li>My skin starts to try and produce more oil to counteract the drying effect of the mask, and that&#x27;s what may make you break out.</li>
            <li>but it just made my spots more irritated because now they were drier and flakier.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to tons of people and they all love it.  </li>
            <li>but I love mint.</li>
            <li>I really love how the mask works.</li>
            <li>Will buy again :)</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love Queen Helene.</li>
            <li>I use this one the most.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find this at Walgreens</li>
            <li>I use it weekly and the effects are mostly temporary.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it (and love Amazon&#x27;s S&amp;S option, saves lots of $)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this mask.  </li>
            <li>I had seen this product advertised by a doctor as safe to use during pregnancy when most acne products are a no</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>and we both love it.</li>
            <li>Love it, use it whenever I can :)</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>i need more words to send this, and i dont know why i want to write a review</li>
            <li>This is probably the best facial masque that I&#x27;ve ever used, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>it did feel nice and tingly though and is a fun thing to do with friends!</li>
            <li>any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The masque has a nice, tingly feeling when applied and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Works great to clear pores</li>
            <li>Great for my oily, sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is \\&quot;magic\\&quot;-i can&#x27;t say enough good about it!</li>
            <li>Overall very good for the cheap price.</li>
            <li>Using my fingers (not a fan brush), the mint mask like it&#x27;s sister mud mask was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I love using this about once a week to clean my pores and make them noticably tighter.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, covers well.</li>
            <li>This mask dries up pimples very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I realized the chemicals are a bit strong</li>
            <li>First it alarmed me but it feels good and cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s menthol effect is strong.</li>
            <li>However, I feel that this mask was more effective and much more noticeably clear pores.</li>
            <li>I have more natural mask that seem more effective.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it is easy to give your face a quick pick me up.  </li>
            <li>but now it’s fine.</li>
            <li>Your skin comes out feeling refreshed and rejuvenated and your pores are clean and look clean!</li>
            <li>I don’t notice a huge difference in my blackheads after using it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mask for about 2 weeks now and have not noticed any huge changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>great mask overall!</li>
            <li>We got a two pack this time, because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>Since it was cheap, I decided to keep it and try it.  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap that gets the job done</li>
            <li>While researching cleansing facial pores, I came across this inexpensive product with great reviews.</li>
            <li>rinse or wash it off and your skin feels smooth and not oily at all.</li>
            <li>It was also exceptionally smooth.</li>
            <li>Since that first time I have used it many many times, and now that I know what to expect with the &#x27;tingling&#x27; sensation, it is very enjoyable and refreshing especially in summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too drying, makes your skin feel super soft and smooth after use, and it has a pleasant mint scent.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy service. :)</li>
            <li>originally gave this product 4 stars, but I now give it five.</li>
            <li>This was the first mask that I tried and I love it.</li>
            <li>Using it once makes a SIGNIFICANT difference.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this at a store but they discontinued it,</li>
            <li>and when I get out my skin just feels refreshed, clean and glowing.</li>
            <li>Skin felt clean and replenished.</li>
            <li>Once I got over the initial shock and discomfort I realized that this mask is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I used to use this product years ago and came back to it looking for a good, cheap face mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many masks and this one seems to really make a difference on my cystic acne.</li>
            <li>When applying, the minty freshness has a cool, tingly feel on your skin.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m in a rush, I&#x27;ll use my hair dryer on the cool setting to speed the drying process.</li>
            <li>It smells ok but really works.</li>
            <li>It also goes fast so again, am glad it comes in a pack.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t mind the initial burning sensation from the mint, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Sure, pay alot for those tv products but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>My HG product, I love this item so much.</li>
            <li>It also has a very nice mint scent, which while prominent is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Despite the after smell I feel it&#x27;s well worth it for what I got in return: smooth, fresh, and clean skin.</li>
            <li>Apply hyaluronic acid gel (great moisturizer) (every other day at minimum).&lt;br /&gt;7.</li>
            <li>: Make sure to use a new face towel every 1-2 days to keep your face clean after washing.</li>
            <li>But otherwise, my face always feels fresh and clean from this product.</li>
            <li>Like before it goes away quickly but made me feel like there was a residue on my face.</li>
            <li>I still love this product and I&#x27;m so glad I went back.</li>
            <li>and it rinses away really quickly under the spray.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, is nice and cooling and my favorite mask out there right now.</li>
            <li>My face is really sensitive, dries out easily, but also breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>It smells good, fells amazing and it makes my pimples very tiny, my face is OBVIOUSLY more clear with my acne medicine but unless I want to have sunburns and red peeling</li>
            <li>The seller shipped quick, price was right.</li>
            <li>Everyone says this product is amazing, especially for acne</li>
            <li>Once of the few times researching during working hours turned out great</li>
            <li>Totally worth to try for the cost and feel the difference.</li>
            <li>So worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>That is not the case, and this mask proves it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price, it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When the warm sensation started, I knew my pores would feel the heat and open.</li>
            <li>It absorbed excess oil from my face, letting my face glow, instead of shine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Now i don&#x27;t even use either and think it was definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Minty fresh, dries in about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>you will look like Elphaba (Wicked) when you have it on, and your kids will laugh a lot.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and honestly cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>This great classic makes my skin tingle and the smell brings back great memories of years past!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all pregnant friends!</li>
            <li>Dries them right up.</li>
            <li>I use this mask every night on my chin, nostrils, and around my mouth (right up to my lips) because of hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li>and you can tell the difference right away.</li>
            <li>It smells great (to my surprise) and is so far the only thing that has helped to shrink the size of the large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>I love this mask; it makes your face so smooth after one use, it doesn&#x27;t make your face dry up or breakout, and you can&#x27;t beat the price ($8 for 2 large containers!)</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not sure if it helps with pores or blackheads like it says, but it feels great and can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>great product if used minimally and not everyday.</li>
            <li>Although my family medical history does not include acne, I experienced occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean and soft.</li>
            <li>; however, I ordered a set of two tubes and only one arrived in a HUGE box!  </li>
            <li>Apply an eye gel (better than cream), such as the Avalon lavender (daily).&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this and will be buying more ~</li>
            <li>For the first two weeks, I used this 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>It made my skin smooth, soft, tightened my pores, remove pimples, and its minty tingly sensation when you first apply it on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this same product for many decades</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and rinses clear.</li>
            <li>My all-time favorite facial mask.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first use, I noticed my skin feeling tighter and cleaned out.</li>
            <li>It also stings a bit when you first rub it on.  </li>
            <li>The reviews really sold me &amp; how harmless could a product under $10 be!?</li>
            <li>I did not give it a five because after almost a year of consistent use</li>
            <li>but fortunately I applied this masque and although the redness isn&#x27;t completely gone...</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love about the mask is the after-smell.  </li>
            <li>They were exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I thought my skin was burning, but this was just caused by the &#x27;mint&#x27; in the product.</li>
            <li>without doing the whole masque thing!</li>
            <li>I love this facial masque.</li>
            <li>When I start to get a pimple or blemish, i even dab a bit right on it and it seems to clear it up quickly...</li>
            <li>I have tried many facial masks over the years---some very pricey---and none have compared.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had moderate acne problems, especially after switching birth control pills and this was the first product (I had tried many) that prevents breakouts and keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>great product but not good smell.</li>
            <li>I recently heard that proper care of young skin is prep for great skin when you&#x27;re in your 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I feel that this product worked very well with me the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>I really like using a Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque in conjunction with the Queen Helene Miny Julep scrub for my face, I use the scrub first and once washed off</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used products that don&#x27;t burn and do just as good, if not better of a job - like Freeman&#x27;s Avocado and Oatmeal mask.  </li>
            <li>Areas that take longest to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; are your problem areas, do them a little more often!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you clean up well, I have been called out for green streaks across my face sometimes haha.</li>
            <li>I can certainly feel that my skin has tightened.</li>
            <li>I tried this a few months ago at a friend&#x27;s house, and since then it has been a love story!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t change the oil problem but it keeps your pores clean &amp; closed &amp; gives you a clean look.</li>
            <li>I have used many different face masks and this one is hands down my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It cleans up theface well and tightens pores while still being pretty simple to clean off.</li>
            <li>I wish this mask didn&#x27;t have so much coloring and fragrance - regardless it really helps my skin.</li>
            <li>so i put this on every night and it doesnt make me break out as much.</li>
            <li>It really tightens up your skin and makes you feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>Highly toxic, you don&#x27;t want to be letting parabens absorb in your face!</li>
            <li>Great product, but one is fairly hard with watery stuff and the other is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have heard of people leaving masks on overnight, but I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend that.</li>
            <li>and I really don’t get what the type is about.</li>
            <li>Overall, I enjoy the minty feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>It really cleans up my face</li>
            <li>this product didn&#x27;t do much for my acne.</li>
            <li>The masque tingles a lot, which I really like.</li>
            <li>After the mint scent is washed away, you can really smell the clay.  </li>
            <li>It might burn a bit sometimes, but it is efficient and clears the pores very well</li>
            <li>Absolutely loves</li>
            <li>It contains sulfur but really does not smell like sulfur (smells like mint).  </li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t want to use a white or light colored washcloth to remove.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.</li>
            <li>No, of course not, but it is clearer, more radiant and makes a marked difference in my overall appearance.</li>
            <li>The 2 pack is nice and will last you a very long time (still going strong, mine might last another 6 months</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth, soft and really clears up blackheads like no other.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying it to the needed areas 1 to 2 times daily simply because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a wet towel to wipe off your hands after you&#x27;re done applying it!</li>
            <li>I have small blackheads and within two days after applying and removing this masque for 15 minutes, most of the blackheads are gone!</li>
            <li>Make sure to lather it in to cover all pores and allow to dry completely before rinsing off.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and it does not make mine overly dry, but I can see how it would if your skin is more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I love this, because it really helps to reduce the black head.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels- painful at first but very refreshing afterwards.</li>
            <li>However, the mint scent of this particular mask is not over powering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will be one of my main masks that I rotate through in my beauty tool box.</li>
            <li>plus you get the enjoyment of having a vibrant mint-colored face for 10-15 minutes while you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li>I tend to have very large pores and while it didn&#x27;t &#x27;shrink&#x27; them as such, I did notice that my skin was much firmer and plumper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent hundreds over the years on products which would be fine if they worked</li>
            <li>It has an aftermath of a very minor sulfur smell after you wash it off which fades, but for me this is totally worth it because it works!  </li>
            <li>After using for 2 weeks at roughly 3 times a week, I still have blackheads, pores still look huge, and my acne remains untouched.</li>
            <li>my face is not one hat has many breakouts (just a few here and there) but</li>
            <li>My extremely dry skin is now soft and smooth and my complexion has improved.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face mask to help dry up problem areas like white heads and pimples.  </li>
            <li>My skin always feels so clean &amp; the pores really do shrink down.</li>
            <li>This is an old and classic product that still works.</li>
            <li>A staple for anyone that loves to dry out a zit quick and take care of their skin.</li>
            <li>and this works a whole lot better, on me at least.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The consistency was kind of strange when I squeezed it out, not like your typical face mask.</li>
            <li>But putting it on your face is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>yesterday I woke up with a small pimple on my forehead, like most people I was foolishly impulsed to try to pop it...</li>
            <li>My boyfriend actually made the comment that my face was still pretty broke out...</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t completely stop the acne, but it HELPS a ton!  </li>
            <li>An old stand-by that works!</li>
            <li>My first time I applied it right after taking a shower and it stung for a few moments</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling so smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>I had some large pores on my chest and tried everything to make them appear smaller and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I have almost totally clear</li>
            <li>I felt like nothing was working to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>It can literally clear up my face in a couple days if I use it both days.  </li>
            <li>Promptly 5 seconds later I feel an intense burning sensation that doesn&#x27;t stop until the mask dries.</li>
            <li>I do not consider myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Be aware that if you have scrubbed your face and/or have a minor cut applying this may sting.</li>
            <li>It worked wonders and completely cleared my skin.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think it&#x27;s very minty</li>
            <li>The big pores on the apples of my cheeks not so much, but there was still a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>If you use the masque on your entire face, your skin feels fresh and clean-looks younger.</li>
            <li>The last bottle I had was nice and thick and this bottle is a lot thinner</li>
            <li>but it does cool down your face and relaxes you.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use forever, if the price stays right here, will be a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li>This definitely reduces oiliness but doesn&#x27;t make your skin super dry or flaky.</li>
            <li>I also use it as a spot treatment when I sometimes get pimples in other places, but those are rare.</li>
            <li>Make sure none of the spots look \\&quot;wet (dark greensih color) before you wash it off (should be a light/pastel green)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And  it is large volumn, can hold for a long time.</li>
            <li>They do look a little bit light but that effect usually only lasts for a day and the next day my blackheads look exactly the same.</li>
            <li>It is a little messy getting it off (as they suggested, rub off with warm water and towel).</li>
            <li>I have recently started a new regimen for oily skin</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it helped dry my acne</li>
            <li>After the cheek touching incident, I put a thin layer of the mask just on the pimples and within a day or two, my skin was clear.  </li>
            <li>The mask isn’t super expensive so there’s no harm in having it around and using it every once in a while to clean your skin (superficially)</li>
            <li>Your pores will shrink and your face will be tightened, your skin feels really soft after washing it off and it does not dry you out.</li>
            <li>the only thing that makes it an okay product is that it is thick, so you need to work out the lumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes the skin very soft cleaning and tightening it at the same time....</li>
            <li>Once I took if off my skin did feel tight and clean, however this is not enough pros to outweigh the con of my face feeling like it is on fire.</li>
            <li>With that said, it does not actually burn or have any negative effects to my skin, and actually complements my current routine quite nicely.</li>
            <li>- you can see the oil surfacing in the clay as it dries, which offers instant gratification.</li>
            <li>I recently moved and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere near me</li>
            <li>after the third time using it, the blackheads were completely cleared.</li>
            <li>No way to feedback, apparently, except through this Review.  </li>
            <li>To begin using a mask at such an early age has had its benefits.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a green mask, so it&#x27;s fun to walk around the house with it on while it dries.  </li>
            <li>The mint scent was very mild compared to what I expected based on a few reviews.  </li>
            <li>Effective product; well-meaning supplier; sloppy quality control in fulfillment!</li>
            <li>but I don’t really think it does anything for my skin that any other clay mask wouldn’t do.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely looked worse before it got better.</li>
            <li>No matter what other masques I try, and some have been very pricey,  I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>I can barely keep my eyes open because of the sting on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price for the unbelievable quality of the product.</li>
            <li>I use this once a week all over my face and the first few times</li>
            <li>It works great at opening pores and tightening skin but for the first minute or so after showering and applying, it burns awful -</li>
            <li>I let it dry completely before washing off.</li>
            <li>I have the glam glow supermud clearing treatment which is $69 for a whole lot less</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work well for my friend (who has dry sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I used it frequently and my face was incredibly clear, never any black heads.</li>
            <li>Acne as a teen and now in my adult life I have combination skin (oily &amp; dry at the same time ugh!!).</li>

            <li> I apply it every night; after washing it off in the morning, my face is more even and softer whilst pimples are smoothed out.</li>
            <li> will order some more</li>
            <li> Great for oily skin really reduces summer/oil break outs.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> applying this, it does smell minty, which i love.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love this mask.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  </li>
            <li> It dries in about 10 minutes and in those 10 minutes magic happens.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, this is my favorite mask</li>
            <li> Works well and affordable :)</li>
            <li> and I have tried many many face masks.</li>
            <li> so make sure you have a moisturizer that will not clog pores (because that would be wasting your julep&#x27;s efforts)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li> As you take it off, the mask becomes silky smooth again, and your face is glowing!</li>
            <li> and I love that fact that I don&#x27;t feel the need to put foundation on before I leave the house</li>
            <li> My skin starts to try and produce more oil to counteract the drying effect of the mask, and that&#x27;s what may make you break out.</li>
            <li> but it just made my spots more irritated because now they were drier and flakier.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to tons of people and they all love it.  </li>
            <li> but I love mint.</li>
            <li> I really love how the mask works.</li>
            <li> Will buy again :)</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>

            <li> I use this one the most.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find this at Walgreens</li>
            <li> I use it weekly and the effects are mostly temporary.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it (and love Amazon&#x27;s S&amp;S option, saves lots of $)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this mask.  </li>
            <li> I had seen this product advertised by a doctor as safe to use during pregnancy when most acne products are a no</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> and we both love it.</li>
            <li> Love it, use it whenever I can :)</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> i need more words to send this, and i dont know why i want to write a review</li>
            <li> This is probably the best facial masque that I&#x27;ve ever used, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> it did feel nice and tingly though and is a fun thing to do with friends!</li>
            <li> any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The masque has a nice, tingly feeling when applied and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great to clear pores</li>
            <li> Great for my oily, sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is \\&quot;magic\\&quot;-i can&#x27;t say enough good about it!</li>
            <li> Overall very good for the cheap price.</li>
            <li> Using my fingers (not a fan brush), the mint mask like it&#x27;s sister mud mask was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love using this about once a week to clean my pores and make them noticably tighter.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, covers well.</li>
            <li> This mask dries up pimples very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I realized the chemicals are a bit strong</li>
            <li> First it alarmed me but it feels good and cool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s menthol effect is strong.</li>
            <li> However, I feel that this mask was more effective and much more noticeably clear pores.</li>
            <li> I have more natural mask that seem more effective.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is easy to give your face a quick pick me up.  </li>
            <li> but now it’s fine.</li>
            <li> Your skin comes out feeling refreshed and rejuvenated and your pores are clean and look clean!</li>
            <li> I don’t notice a huge difference in my blackheads after using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for about 2 weeks now and have not noticed any huge changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> great mask overall!</li>
            <li> We got a two pack this time, because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> Since it was cheap, I decided to keep it and try it.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap that gets the job done</li>
            <li> While researching cleansing facial pores, I came across this inexpensive product with great reviews.</li>
            <li> rinse or wash it off and your skin feels smooth and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> It was also exceptionally smooth.</li>
            <li> Since that first time I have used it many many times, and now that I know what to expect with the &#x27;tingling&#x27; sensation, it is very enjoyable and refreshing especially in summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too drying, makes your skin feel super soft and smooth after use, and it has a pleasant mint scent.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy service. :)</li>
            <li> originally gave this product 4 stars, but I now give it five.</li>
            <li> This was the first mask that I tried and I love it.</li>
            <li> Using it once makes a SIGNIFICANT difference.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this at a store but they discontinued it,</li>
            <li> and when I get out my skin just feels refreshed, clean and glowing.</li>
            <li> Skin felt clean and replenished.</li>
            <li> Once I got over the initial shock and discomfort I realized that this mask is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product years ago and came back to it looking for a good, cheap face mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many masks and this one seems to really make a difference on my cystic acne.</li>
            <li> When applying, the minty freshness has a cool, tingly feel on your skin.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m in a rush, I&#x27;ll use my hair dryer on the cool setting to speed the drying process.</li>
            <li> It smells ok but really works.</li>
            <li> It also goes fast so again, am glad it comes in a pack.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t mind the initial burning sensation from the mint, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Sure, pay alot for those tv products but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> My HG product, I love this item so much.</li>
            <li> It also has a very nice mint scent, which while prominent is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Despite the after smell I feel it&#x27;s well worth it for what I got in return: smooth, fresh, and clean skin.</li>
            <li> Apply hyaluronic acid gel (great moisturizer) (every other day at minimum).&lt;br /&gt;7.</li>
            <li> : Make sure to use a new face towel every 1-2 days to keep your face clean after washing.</li>
            <li> But otherwise, my face always feels fresh and clean from this product.</li>
            <li> Like before it goes away quickly but made me feel like there was a residue on my face.</li>
            <li> I still love this product and I&#x27;m so glad I went back.</li>
            <li> and it rinses away really quickly under the spray.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, is nice and cooling and my favorite mask out there right now.</li>
            <li> My face is really sensitive, dries out easily, but also breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> It smells good, fells amazing and it makes my pimples very tiny, my face is OBVIOUSLY more clear with my acne medicine but unless I want to have sunburns and red peeling</li>
            <li> The seller shipped quick, price was right.</li>
            <li> Everyone says this product is amazing, especially for acne</li>
            <li> Once of the few times researching during working hours turned out great</li>
            <li> Totally worth to try for the cost and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> So worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li> That is not the case, and this mask proves it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price, it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the warm sensation started, I knew my pores would feel the heat and open.</li>
            <li> It absorbed excess oil from my face, letting my face glow, instead of shine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Now i don&#x27;t even use either and think it was definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Minty fresh, dries in about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> you will look like Elphaba (Wicked) when you have it on, and your kids will laugh a lot.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and honestly cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> This great classic makes my skin tingle and the smell brings back great memories of years past!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all pregnant friends!</li>
            <li> Dries them right up.</li>
            <li> I use this mask every night on my chin, nostrils, and around my mouth (right up to my lips) because of hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li> and you can tell the difference right away.</li>
            <li> It smells great (to my surprise) and is so far the only thing that has helped to shrink the size of the large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> I love this mask; it makes your face so smooth after one use, it doesn&#x27;t make your face dry up or breakout, and you can&#x27;t beat the price ($8 for 2 large containers!)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if it helps with pores or blackheads like it says, but it feels great and can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> great product if used minimally and not everyday.</li>
            <li> Although my family medical history does not include acne, I experienced occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean and soft.</li>
            <li> ; however, I ordered a set of two tubes and only one arrived in a HUGE box!  </li>
            <li> Apply an eye gel (better than cream), such as the Avalon lavender (daily).&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this and will be buying more ~</li>
            <li> For the first two weeks, I used this 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> It made my skin smooth, soft, tightened my pores, remove pimples, and its minty tingly sensation when you first apply it on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this same product for many decades</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and rinses clear.</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite facial mask.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first use, I noticed my skin feeling tighter and cleaned out.</li>
            <li> It also stings a bit when you first rub it on.  </li>
            <li> The reviews really sold me &amp; how harmless could a product under $10 be!?</li>
            <li> I did not give it a five because after almost a year of consistent use</li>
            <li> but fortunately I applied this masque and although the redness isn&#x27;t completely gone...</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love about the mask is the after-smell.  </li>
            <li> They were exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I thought my skin was burning, but this was just caused by the &#x27;mint&#x27; in the product.</li>
            <li> without doing the whole masque thing!</li>
            <li> I love this facial masque.</li>
            <li> When I start to get a pimple or blemish, i even dab a bit right on it and it seems to clear it up quickly...</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial masks over the years---some very pricey---and none have compared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had moderate acne problems, especially after switching birth control pills and this was the first product (I had tried many) that prevents breakouts and keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> great product but not good smell.</li>
            <li> I recently heard that proper care of young skin is prep for great skin when you&#x27;re in your 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product worked very well with me the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> I really like using a Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque in conjunction with the Queen Helene Miny Julep scrub for my face, I use the scrub first and once washed off</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used products that don&#x27;t burn and do just as good, if not better of a job - like Freeman&#x27;s Avocado and Oatmeal mask.  </li>
            <li> Areas that take longest to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; are your problem areas, do them a little more often!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you clean up well, I have been called out for green streaks across my face sometimes haha.</li>
            <li> I can certainly feel that my skin has tightened.</li>
            <li> I tried this a few months ago at a friend&#x27;s house, and since then it has been a love story!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t change the oil problem but it keeps your pores clean &amp; closed &amp; gives you a clean look.</li>
            <li> I have used many different face masks and this one is hands down my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It cleans up theface well and tightens pores while still being pretty simple to clean off.</li>
            <li> I wish this mask didn&#x27;t have so much coloring and fragrance - regardless it really helps my skin.</li>
            <li> so i put this on every night and it doesnt make me break out as much.</li>
            <li> It really tightens up your skin and makes you feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Highly toxic, you don&#x27;t want to be letting parabens absorb in your face!</li>
            <li> Great product, but one is fairly hard with watery stuff and the other is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have heard of people leaving masks on overnight, but I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend that.</li>
            <li> and I really don’t get what the type is about.</li>
            <li> Overall, I enjoy the minty feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> It really cleans up my face</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t do much for my acne.</li>
            <li> The masque tingles a lot, which I really like.</li>
            <li> After the mint scent is washed away, you can really smell the clay.  </li>
            <li> It might burn a bit sometimes, but it is efficient and clears the pores very well</li>
            <li> Absolutely loves</li>
            <li> It contains sulfur but really does not smell like sulfur (smells like mint).  </li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t want to use a white or light colored washcloth to remove.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.</li>
            <li> No, of course not, but it is clearer, more radiant and makes a marked difference in my overall appearance.</li>
            <li> The 2 pack is nice and will last you a very long time (still going strong, mine might last another 6 months</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth, soft and really clears up blackheads like no other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it to the needed areas 1 to 2 times daily simply because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have a wet towel to wipe off your hands after you&#x27;re done applying it!</li>
            <li> I have small blackheads and within two days after applying and removing this masque for 15 minutes, most of the blackheads are gone!</li>
            <li> Make sure to lather it in to cover all pores and allow to dry completely before rinsing off.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and it does not make mine overly dry, but I can see how it would if your skin is more sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I love this, because it really helps to reduce the black head.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels- painful at first but very refreshing afterwards.</li>
            <li> However, the mint scent of this particular mask is not over powering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will be one of my main masks that I rotate through in my beauty tool box.</li>
            <li> plus you get the enjoyment of having a vibrant mint-colored face for 10-15 minutes while you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> I tend to have very large pores and while it didn&#x27;t &#x27;shrink&#x27; them as such, I did notice that my skin was much firmer and plumper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds over the years on products which would be fine if they worked</li>
            <li> It has an aftermath of a very minor sulfur smell after you wash it off which fades, but for me this is totally worth it because it works!  </li>
            <li> After using for 2 weeks at roughly 3 times a week, I still have blackheads, pores still look huge, and my acne remains untouched.</li>
            <li> my face is not one hat has many breakouts (just a few here and there) but</li>
            <li> My extremely dry skin is now soft and smooth and my complexion has improved.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face mask to help dry up problem areas like white heads and pimples.  </li>
            <li> My skin always feels so clean &amp; the pores really do shrink down.</li>
            <li> This is an old and classic product that still works.</li>
            <li> A staple for anyone that loves to dry out a zit quick and take care of their skin.</li>
            <li> and this works a whole lot better, on me at least.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The consistency was kind of strange when I squeezed it out, not like your typical face mask.</li>
            <li> But putting it on your face is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> yesterday I woke up with a small pimple on my forehead, like most people I was foolishly impulsed to try to pop it...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend actually made the comment that my face was still pretty broke out...</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t completely stop the acne, but it HELPS a ton!  </li>
            <li> An old stand-by that works!</li>
            <li> My first time I applied it right after taking a shower and it stung for a few moments</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling so smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> I had some large pores on my chest and tried everything to make them appear smaller and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I have almost totally clear</li>
            <li> I felt like nothing was working to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> It can literally clear up my face in a couple days if I use it both days.  </li>
            <li> Promptly 5 seconds later I feel an intense burning sensation that doesn&#x27;t stop until the mask dries.</li>
            <li> I do not consider myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Be aware that if you have scrubbed your face and/or have a minor cut applying this may sting.</li>
            <li> It worked wonders and completely cleared my skin.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it&#x27;s very minty</li>
            <li> The big pores on the apples of my cheeks not so much, but there was still a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> If you use the masque on your entire face, your skin feels fresh and clean-looks younger.</li>
            <li> The last bottle I had was nice and thick and this bottle is a lot thinner</li>
            <li> but it does cool down your face and relaxes you.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use forever, if the price stays right here, will be a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> This definitely reduces oiliness but doesn&#x27;t make your skin super dry or flaky.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a spot treatment when I sometimes get pimples in other places, but those are rare.</li>
            <li> Make sure none of the spots look \\&quot;wet (dark greensih color) before you wash it off (should be a light/pastel green)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And  it is large volumn, can hold for a long time.</li>
            <li> They do look a little bit light but that effect usually only lasts for a day and the next day my blackheads look exactly the same.</li>
            <li> It is a little messy getting it off (as they suggested, rub off with warm water and towel).</li>
            <li> I have recently started a new regimen for oily skin</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say it helped dry my acne</li>
            <li> After the cheek touching incident, I put a thin layer of the mask just on the pimples and within a day or two, my skin was clear.  </li>
            <li> The mask isn’t super expensive so there’s no harm in having it around and using it every once in a while to clean your skin (superficially)</li>
            <li> Your pores will shrink and your face will be tightened, your skin feels really soft after washing it off and it does not dry you out.</li>
            <li> the only thing that makes it an okay product is that it is thick, so you need to work out the lumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes the skin very soft cleaning and tightening it at the same time....</li>
            <li> Once I took if off my skin did feel tight and clean, however this is not enough pros to outweigh the con of my face feeling like it is on fire.</li>
            <li> With that said, it does not actually burn or have any negative effects to my skin, and actually complements my current routine quite nicely.</li>
            <li> - you can see the oil surfacing in the clay as it dries, which offers instant gratification.</li>
            <li> I recently moved and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere near me</li>
            <li> after the third time using it, the blackheads were completely cleared.</li>
            <li> No way to feedback, apparently, except through this Review.  </li>
            <li> To begin using a mask at such an early age has had its benefits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a green mask, so it&#x27;s fun to walk around the house with it on while it dries.  </li>
            <li> The mint scent was very mild compared to what I expected based on a few reviews.  </li>
            <li> Effective product; well-meaning supplier; sloppy quality control in fulfillment!</li>
            <li> but I don’t really think it does anything for my skin that any other clay mask wouldn’t do.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely looked worse before it got better.</li>
            <li> No matter what other masques I try, and some have been very pricey,  I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I can barely keep my eyes open because of the sting on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price for the unbelievable quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week all over my face and the first few times</li>
            <li> It works great at opening pores and tightening skin but for the first minute or so after showering and applying, it burns awful -</li>
            <li> I let it dry completely before washing off.</li>
            <li> I have the glam glow supermud clearing treatment which is $69 for a whole lot less</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for my friend (who has dry sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I used it frequently and my face was incredibly clear, never any black heads.</li>
            <li> Acne as a teen and now in my adult life I have combination skin (oily &amp; dry at the same time ugh!!).</li>
            <li> I first wash my face with a scrub, dry my face and apply a moderately thick layer of the mask, and wait about 20 minutes for it to dry completely and let it go to work.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and cool when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> Apply a mask, such as the mint or mud mask (about 1-2 times a week), then dry face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin always feels soft and tight after I use it and</li>
            <li> I know it would not have stuck around so darn long.</li>
            <li> will revisit if it shows any long term benefits, but will contunue to use for the feeling alone.</li>
            <li> This product coupled with benzoyl peroxide completely cleared up my acne in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a small bottle of this mask from Sally&#x27;s when I was in high school going through the typical teenage acne phase.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so messy to put on, but hey, a little mess is worth it.</li>
            <li> Cleanse using an exfoliating wash and Clarisonic brush, then dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll note that it helps me if I put some sort of moisturizer on afterwards, because using the mask by itself can make my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Just dab a bit on the blemish, let it dry and your blemish IMMEDIATELY starts to disappear.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding it at the local stores and pharmacy&#x27;s and finally found at Walmart and Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I normally try to use one at least 2-3x per week.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there is a product on the market which can shrink them completely, but this one is not going to.</li>
            <li> Only down side is that you need to work to get it all off.  </li>
            <li> I cant use it and this mask makes my pimples tiny little whiteheads which I dont mind (as long as my cystic acne is gone)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The pores look smaller and less clogged.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s hot outside or cold, the pores in my face seem to stay open and clogged.</li>
            <li> I feel like it also help clear up my acne when I use it consistently (At least once a day).</li>
            <li> I have a clear complexion and this actually makes it worse...</li>
            <li> Since I rotate through, the 2 tubes should last me a few months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to the &amp;#34;Mayan Healing Clay&amp;#34; that&#x27;s all the rage these days but not as harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my skin for multiple reasons, but this product is a miracle!</li>
            <li> By the way, the green mask will dry and change to a different shade of green, plus it will be dry to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> still break out when my hormones are all out of balance, but using this helps tame the breakout until the hormones are back in balance.</li>
            <li> Other than that I have no problems with</li>
            <li> I will be a lifelong buyer of this product!</li>
            <li> I use it every other day after showering and leave it on for thirty minutes or so, followed by cleansing with albolene.</li>
            <li> so i used it every other day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any messier than other masks.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and any other area where I get pimples.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have acne problems but in the last 6 months I have started to have them and this product is getting rid of them!</li>
            <li> Apply Vitamic C serum, such as that by Avalon (at least 1 time per week).&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> I tried it was borderline uncomfortable how much it tingled</li>
            <li> It seems like they watered it down or something.</li>
            <li> We sit down once a week with our funky masks on together.</li>
            <li> Love this mask for helping to heal and clear the awful pregnancy acne that is such a frustrating part of the pregnancy journey.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: unfortunately it dries up (i.e. color got darker and more difficult to get it out of the tube) after 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> However, I did notice there was a slight &#x27;after smell&#x27; that you get after application (reason for 4 stars).</li>
            <li> I also didn’t notice less oil formation in my t-zone after using this.</li>
            <li> This mask is a hidden gem.  </li>
            <li> I would leave it on for half hour while I watch a TV show and when you wash it off it cleans all the dirt in your pores.</li>
            <li> I do, however, get significantly less pimples.</li>
            <li> I now have significantly less blackheads on my cheeks...</li>
            <li> smear it on your face, let it dry-feels tight.</li>
            <li> The skin does feel a bit tight afterwards but a little moisturizer fixes that.</li>
            <li> Apply a (papaya) enzyme mask using a fan brush (at least twice a week), then dry face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a little drying</li>
            <li> and I can see little dots where my blackheads or pimples are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick consistency and when your done applying simply wash off your fingers.</li>
            <li> works extremely well!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really heavy and thick, not much movement to it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind leaving it on my face for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The mask needs to get into the pore in order to attach and pull out the dried oils and dirt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does come out a bit messy sometimes.</li>
            <li> Your skin will get smoother, and softer with a few applications.</li>
            <li> The green part of the mask also calms redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the mask every night for a few days, and by the end of it, my skin was clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, my face seems to break out a few days after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use this everyday to see what happens.  </li>
            <li> Every since I started using it every night a few days before my period, I no longer get hormonal pimples.  </li>
            <li> people commented that it&#x27;s messy -</li>
            <li> but it  went away as the mask dried.  </li>
            <li> The scrub is a gentile exfoliator that removes all of your dead skin.</li>
            <li> Too messy for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a green clay</li>
            <li> And anything with unnatural coloring and fragrance is not good at all for delicate facial skin.</li>
            <li> As it sits, it caused very slight burning, not one that caused me worry, just one that made you know it was working.</li>
            <li> This crap does absolutely nothing but dry my face out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for years, and was not able to locate for a few months until now.</li>
            <li> If your skin is raw from winter/exfoliation, this may hurt a bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this in the store and unfortunately they only carry the small 2oz tubes.</li>
            <li> When it comes to pimples I think it helps a bit, not sure, because I have acne products I already use for that type of thing.</li>
            <li> The drying process doesn&#x27;t usually take longer than 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a week for the past couple months</li>
            <li> I used up every drop of the small bottle and forgot about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not that the mask broke me out, just that it didn&#x27;t prevent my usual break outs.</li>
            <li> I usually do it before I shower</li>
            <li> Sounds like common sense, but common sense is not common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now use this at least 2 - 3 times a week</li>
            <li> the pores in my nose are still visible, at least to me.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly - if you coat to thickly</li>
            <li> I used it before bed (washed it off and moisturized before bed) and when I woke up, my really bad areas were dried up and flat, and the redness was gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle while on the face</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is...</li>
            <li> but this masque is really thin.</li>
            <li> one is broken i received.</li>
            <li> skin- unheard of for me during the dry, cold winter!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in the package I received, 1 of the 2 bottles was broken when I opened it.</li>
            <li> You can feel the tingling as soon as you put it on, but not in an uncomfortable way.</li>
            <li> Sadly I had to throw this stuff away.</li>
            <li> smelled wrong.</li>
            <li> looks wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 24 now, and recently went through another horrible acne phase.</li>
            <li> I must have ordered wrong because this is what came.  </li>
            <li> what a fail (</li>
            <li> stinks, but bearable.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; that people are talking about wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m always disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this about twice a month to suck the crap out of my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad skin all my life (24 years!).</li>
            <li> seems to pull out the nasty stuff so that it doesn&#x27;t turn into cysts.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product but not good smell.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, is nice and cooling and my favorite mask out there right now.</li>
            <li> great product if used minimally and not everyday. love it</li>
            <li> Love it!! This great classic makes my skin tingle and the smell brings back great memories of years past!  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> You can feel the tingling as soon as you put it on, but not in an uncomfortable way. It smells great (to my surprise) and is so far the only thing that has helped to shrink the size of the large pores on my nose. I&#x27;ve been applying it to the needed areas 1 to 2 times daily simply because I love it so much! My extremely dry skin is now soft and smooth and my complexion has improved. Definitely worth the price for the unbelievable quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Been using it since I was a child.  Works great to clear pores - you can see the oil surfacing in the clay as it dries, which offers instant gratification.</li>
            <li> stinks, but bearable. works wonders. I&#x27;ve used many masks and this one seems to really make a difference on my cystic acne. seems to pull out the nasty stuff so that it doesn&#x27;t turn into cysts. So I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed there product or what but this masque is really thin. The last bottle I had was nice and thick and this bottle is a lot thinner then my last. It seems like they watered it down or something. But still a great masque.</li>
            <li> This feels great going on, and makes your skin refreshed. I have combination skin and when my skin feels particularly greasy, this soaks the oil up and make it feel less greasy for a couple of days. However, it smells a bit of spackle/clay/mud. It is a little messy getting it off (as they suggested, rub off with warm water and towel). I have also tried leaving it on my zits/pimples/itchy spots overnight, and I think it helps. If your skin is raw from winter/exfoliation, this may hurt a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is great for the price. It cleanse and make your skin feel refreshed, altho I have not seen a pore reduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: unfortunately it dries up (i.e. color got darker and more difficult to get it out of the tube) after 2-3 years. It&#x27;s still a great buy since it&#x27;s so cheap ($3-4/tube) and if you use it twice a week or something.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this product despite the raving reviews because of my aversion to mint. I can eat breath mints, but have no desire for mint ice cream, chocolate mints or a minty mojito. However, the mint scent of this particular mask is not over powering. Yes, it smells like mint but I don&#x27;t mind leaving it on my face for a few minutes. Using my fingers (not a fan brush), the mint mask like it&#x27;s sister mud mask was easy to apply. However, I feel that this mask was more effective and much more noticeably clear pores. Make sure to lather it in to cover all pores and allow to dry completely before rinsing off. The mask needs to get into the pore in order to attach and pull out the dried oils and dirt. By the way, the green mask will dry and change to a different shade of green, plus it will be dry to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal sequence at night time is:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cleanse using an exfoliating wash and Clarisonic brush, then dry face.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply a (papaya) enzyme mask using a fan brush (at least twice a week), then dry face.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply a mask, such as the mint or mud mask (about 1-2 times a week), then dry face.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply an eye gel (better than cream), such as the Avalon lavender (daily).&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply Vitamic C serum, such as that by Avalon (at least 1 time per week).&lt;br /&gt;6. Apply hyaluronic acid gel (great moisturizer) (every other day at minimum).&lt;br /&gt;7. Apply a non-greasy night moisturizer (daily).&lt;br /&gt;Note: Make sure to use a new face towel every 1-2 days to keep your face clean after washing. Sounds like common sense, but common sense is not common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be one of my main masks that I rotate through in my beauty tool box. Since I rotate through, the 2 tubes should last me a few months. I definitely recommend this mint mask to friends and family!</li>
            <li> No matter what other masques I try, and some have been very pricey,  I always come back to this one. It makes my skin feel smooth, soft and really clears up blackheads like no other.</li>
            <li> This masque is a lifesaver for me. I&#x27;ve suffered from moderate acne ever since I was 13 and have been on and off several medications whilst dabbling in a range of beauty products. The Mint Julep Masque literally does suck the oil out of your face. I apply it every night; after washing it off in the morning, my face is more even and softer whilst pimples are smoothed out. I&#x27;d suggest that you buy this item in bulk; just wish that I&#x27;d discovered this product sooner!</li>
            <li> This mask works well for me! My first time I applied it right after taking a shower and it stung for a few moments (I assumed it was the mint in it?). I let it dry completely before washing off. I noticed that my skin felt smoother and the pores around my nose and cheek area were smaller :D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency was kind of strange when I squeezed it out, not like your typical face mask. It&#x27;s really heavy and thick, not much movement to it. But putting it on your face is exactly the same. Make sure none of the spots look \\&quot;wet (dark greensih color) before you wash it off (should be a light/pastel green)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come out a bit messy sometimes. There&#x27;s moisture inside the tube to keep the clay from drying out and one time it splattered everywhere. Other than that I have no problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great mask overall! I&#x27;m just beginning to discover how wonderful Queen Helene products are! (:</li>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile, it is very good and I definitely can see a difference when I don&#x27;t keep up with it, I use several of the masks in the line and I normally try to use one at least 2-3x per week. My complexion is smoother, more refined and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;These products are definitive proof that a product need not be expensive to do the job. Do I have a perfect complexion after using it? No, of course not, but it is clearer, more radiant and makes a marked difference in my overall appearance. With regular use, I look refreshed with a glow and at this price I can&#x27;t afford to be without it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for years. I recently moved and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere near me so i looked here and loved that amazon had it. This product works great. I buy it for myself and my teenage niece. It does wonders on her acne and it helps to shrink my pores. We sit down once a week with our funky masks on together. I will be a lifelong buyer of this product!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t fool by it&#x27;s price!  used it daily for a week and wow! definitely an OMG product.  will order some more</li>
            <li> This stuff hurts! I cleaned my face with a warm wash cloth and applied the mask. Promptly 5 seconds later I feel an intense burning sensation that doesn&#x27;t stop until the mask dries. It was all I could do to wait it out and leave it on. Once I took if off my skin did feel tight and clean, however this is not enough pros to outweigh the con of my face feeling like it is on fire. Sadly I had to throw this stuff away. I do not consider myself to have sensitive skin. Beware!</li>
            <li> I wish this mask didn&#x27;t have so much coloring and fragrance - regardless it really helps my skin. I use it every other day after showering and leave it on for thirty minutes or so, followed by cleansing with albolene. Keeps my skin happy! Also can be used as an excellent spot treatment! Reduces redness almost immediately!</li>
            <li> youtube regular Dylan Barger recommended this for at home summer skin care. I loved it! Great for oily skin really reduces summer/oil break outs. Its so easy to master as well! Areas that take longest to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; are your problem areas, do them a little more often!</li>
            <li> I love this mask. Excellent for acne, I recommend using it as an over night spot treatment as well.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite masks! It works so well for acne prone skin. I put it on before a bath and when I get out my skin just feels refreshed, clean and glowing.</li>
            <li> This mask makes my face feel amazing, I cant use any of my acne medicine in the sun- so i put this on every night and it doesnt make me break out as much. It smells good, fells amazing and it makes my pimples very tiny, my face is OBVIOUSLY more clear with my acne medicine but unless I want to have sunburns and red peeling I cant use it and this mask makes my pimples tiny little whiteheads which I dont mind (as long as my cystic acne is gone)&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered the atzec healing clay- so I do use both masks in combination. It has only been one week but I&#x27;m already loving it.</li>
            <li> This mask is pretty awesome. I realized the chemicals are a bit strong so i used it every other day. my face is not one hat has many breakouts (just a few here and there) but what it does have is blackheads on the tip of my nose. after the third time using it, the blackheads were completely cleared. Im a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;when applying this, it does smell minty, which i love. As it sits, it caused very slight burning, not one that caused me worry, just one that made you know it was working. This sensation was literally only on my problem sites, despite the fact i put it all over my face. I use this product for 15 minutes each time. It leaves the skin feeling so smooth and tight. definitely will purchase again once it has ran out.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing. Your skin will get smoother, and softer with a few applications. Totally worth to try for the cost and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Receivd the Masque today -- a quality and effective product; however, I ordered a set of two tubes and only one arrived in a HUGE box!  No way to feedback, apparently, except through this Review.  Hopefully the supplier will fix the problem and ship me the second tube.  Effective product; well-meaning supplier; sloppy quality control in fulfillment!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this. We got a two pack this time, because I liked it so much. It makes skin nice and smooth after you rinse it off, and smells great.</li>
            <li> The best face mask out there</li>
            <li> I love Queen Helene products! I&#x27;ve used the scrubs and masks, and all of them have worked wonders. I love this mask; it makes your face so smooth after one use, it doesn&#x27;t make your face dry up or breakout, and you can&#x27;t beat the price ($8 for 2 large containers!) I definitely recommend this and will be buying more ~</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love this mask. I put it on, rinse it off in the shower, and boom - I feel great and look great. It really tightens up your skin and makes you feel refreshed. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so messy to put on, but hey, a little mess is worth it. Just make sure you have a wet towel to wipe off your hands after you&#x27;re done applying it!</li>
            <li> So many people use and love this but Check the ingredients!!! One of them is Methyl Paraben, it combines benzoic acid with the methyl group of chemicals... Highly toxic, you don&#x27;t want to be letting parabens absorb in your face! And anything with unnatural coloring and fragrance is not good at all for delicate facial skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect as prize for my Kentucky Derby Hat Party with a mint julep theme.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  I have used many different face masks and this one is hands down my favorite.  It is very thick and cool when you put it on.  It dries in about 10 minutes and in those 10 minutes magic happens.  It dries to a lighter color and you can see where it pulls the gunk out of your pores.  It literally vacuums out your pores.  It also has a very nice mint scent, which while prominent is not overwhelming.  I use it twice a week.  I have oily skin and it does not make mine overly dry, but I can see how it would if your skin is more sensitive.  Like I said, this is my favorite mask and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> After reading the great reviews, I decided to try this product. I have combination, acne-prone skin and wanted to even out texture and limit my breakouts. For the first two weeks, I used this 2-3 times a week. I noticed a lot of purging on my forehead and cheeks. My skin definitely looked worse before it got better. Now I have been using it for about 3 weeks and all the clogged pores are gone, and I have almost totally clear skin- unheard of for me during the dry, cold winter! I am looking forward to continuing to use it and hopefully my great results will continue. I also use a witch hazel toner after I rinse the masque off, which stings, but seems to make a big difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask sinceI was about 17. I am now 50. Although my family medical history does not include acne, I experienced occasional breakouts. Once, I ate then wore a Snickers bar on my cheek for a month...PRE MINT JULEP. A boyfriend toughed my face in 1982 and I woke up the next day with a series of pimples in the same spot...POST MINT JULEP. Had I known about this mask sooner I know it would not have stuck around so darn long. After the cheek touching incident, I put a thin layer of the mask just on the pimples and within a day or two, my skin was clear.  At 50 I still have an occasional pimple and still use the Mint Julep mask to get rid of it.  To begin using a mask at such an early age has had its benefits. I recently heard that proper care of young skin is prep for great skin when you&#x27;re in your 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s. Care of your skin in your 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s is skin prep for skin in your 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s. I believe I am proof of this.</li>
            <li> one is broken i received.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product worked very well with me the first day I used it. I was highly impressed by the way it worked. It made my skin smooth, soft, tightened my pores, remove pimples, and its minty tingly sensation when you first apply it on the skin. First it alarmed me but it feels good and cool. I love it and will buy again! Works well and affordable :)</li>
            <li> Great product, but one is fairly hard with watery stuff and the other is perfectly fine. I love using this about once a week to clean my pores and make them noticably tighter.</li>
            <li> This is the best face mask of them all by far and I have tried many many face masks. I have oily skin and the occasional pimple. For the pimples, I put a dab on them and sleep in it overnight. Dries them right up. As a clay mask, it cleans my pores out really good. I have been using this same product for many decades and I always come back to it!</li>
            <li> This crap does absolutely nothing but dry my face out. Got 2 tubes of crappy mint pudding, that&#x27;s what it should be called. Only thing that I&#x27;ve tried that actually does help with blackheads is the St. Ives blemish and blackhead control apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells and feels like minty toothpaste. But is actually pleasant despite that. However, I did notice there was a slight &#x27;after smell&#x27; that you get after application (reason for 4 stars). It&#x27;s subtle while on the face but when you rinse it off you may notice it. It smells similar to that of nair hair remover. Once off of the face you won&#x27;t smell it anymore, however say you put this on at night, rinse it off, go to bed, etc...That morning when washing your face you might smell it again. (the nair smell) Like before it goes away quickly but made me feel like there was a residue on my face. I&#x27;m not saying there is because my face still feels way cleaner and my pores are much smaller (but I do not use just this product for my face routine) I bought this in the store and unfortunately they only carry the small 2oz tubes. Despite the after smell I feel it&#x27;s well worth it for what I got in return: smooth, fresh, and clean skin. Be aware that if you have scrubbed your face and/or have a minor cut applying this may sting. It&#x27;s menthol effect is strong. It was a little drying so make sure you have a moisturizer that will not clog pores (because that would be wasting your julep&#x27;s efforts) and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> the only thing that makes it an okay product is that it is thick, so you need to work out the lumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, its a great product</li>
            <li> I used this several times a week but didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. It goes on smooth and rinses clear. I have more natural mask that seem more effective. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I had a lemon mask I used to use a lot but I use this one as well and it works just as great. Your skin comes out feeling refreshed and rejuvenated and your pores are clean and look clean! Noticeably smaller as well, which is always a plus. When it comes to pimples I think it helps a bit, not sure, because I have acne products I already use for that type of thing. I ended up needing to order this online because for some reason I can&#x27;t find any mint masks sold in stores nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway you won&#x27;t regret getting this because it works and its a deal - two for one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite facial mask.  Absorbs oil and makes pores look smaller and cleaner.  Inexpensive, easy to use, and pleasant.  I&#x27;ve used it for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li> smelled wrong. looks wrong. would not put on my face!! I had to throw out. this was a wast of money!</li>
            <li> I love this, because it really helps to reduce the black head. And  it is large volumn, can hold for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have literally been using this since I was a teen.  I had trouble finding it at the local stores and pharmacy&#x27;s and finally found at Walmart and Amazon.  Amazon was cheaper.  I was delighted to find and so happy to be using again.  It tightens and reduces poors without all these chemicals.  So worth it</li>
            <li> I tried this a few months ago at a friend&#x27;s house, and since then it has been a love story! When applying, the minty freshness has a cool, tingly feel on your skin. The drying process doesn&#x27;t usually take longer than 10-15 minutes. As you take it off, the mask becomes silky smooth again, and your face is glowing! The green part of the mask also calms redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would warn is that I&#x27;ve been doing the acne.org benzoyl peroxide-based regimen, and on some parts of my face this mask is on the verge of burning instead of tingling. With that said, it does not actually burn or have any negative effects to my skin, and actually complements my current routine quite nicely. I plan to use this mask 2x a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, been using 20 years. The seller shipped quick, price was right. It cleans the pores without drying the skin. Does not burn or hurt in anyway. Goes on easy, covers well. washes off taking away oil and dirt. I will continue to use forever, if the price stays right here, will be a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product. I&#x27;ve had moderate acne problems, especially after switching birth control pills and this was the first product (I had tried many) that prevents breakouts and keeps my skin smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a week for the past couple months and I love that fact that I don&#x27;t feel the need to put foundation on before I leave the house any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The masque has a nice, tingly feeling when applied and dries quickly. It&#x27;s worth every penny and I would recommend it to anyone with acne problems!</li>
            <li> With so many expensive masks out there now, it can be tempting to spend the extra money because you may be convinced that expensive means it will work better. That is not the case, and this mask proves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a small bottle of this mask from Sally&#x27;s when I was in high school going through the typical teenage acne phase. It worked wonders and completely cleared my skin. I used up every drop of the small bottle and forgot about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 24 now, and recently went through another horrible acne phase. I felt like nothing was working to clear up my skin. I stumbled upon this product on Amazon, and decided to try it again. For the price, it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, I noticed my skin feeling tighter and cleaned out. I used it before bed (washed it off and moisturized before bed) and when I woke up, my really bad areas were dried up and flat, and the redness was gone. I used the mask every night for a few days, and by the end of it, my skin was clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use this mask once a week or as needed when I feel like my skin needs a good cleaning. I first wash my face with a scrub, dry my face and apply a moderately thick layer of the mask, and wait about 20 minutes for it to dry completely and let it go to work. If I&#x27;m in a rush, I&#x27;ll use my hair dryer on the cool setting to speed the drying process. Then I rinse it off in the shower and afterward, apply a toner, acne treatment lotion, and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried leaving it on for extended periods of time, and I feel like that&#x27;s actually counterproductive. My skin starts to try and produce more oil to counteract the drying effect of the mask, and that&#x27;s what may make you break out. I have heard of people leaving masks on overnight, but I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend that.</li>
            <li> Very glad that this product came in a pack of two for a good price. It smells ok but really works. It also goes fast so again, am glad it comes in a pack.</li>
            <li> Everyone says this product is amazing, especially for acne so I tried it and I really don’t get what the type is about. I use this once a week all over my face and the first few times I tried it was borderline uncomfortable how much it tingled but now it’s fine. I don’t notice a huge difference in my blackheads after using it. They do look a little bit light but that effect usually only lasts for a day and the next day my blackheads look exactly the same. I also didn’t notice less oil formation in my t-zone after using this. I also didn’t notice any benefits from this for my acne. Because it dries up your skin I can see how some people like it for their acne but it just made my spots more irritated because now they were drier and flakier. The mask isn’t super expensive so there’s no harm in having it around and using it every once in a while to clean your skin (superficially) but I don’t really think it does anything for my skin that any other clay mask wouldn’t do.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in the package I received, 1 of the 2 bottles was broken when I opened it. That left me 1 bottle left to use. Overall, I enjoy the minty feeling on my face. In terms of helping my acne prone skin, I haven&#x27;t seen a difference.</li>
            <li> This mask is a hidden gem.  It can literally clear up my face in a couple days if I use it both days.  I have recommended it to tons of people and they all love it.  My sister was having some breakouts and now she swears by this too.  I have tried tons of more expensive masks but this will always be my go-to.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly - if you coat to thickly it burns skin...Also, my face seems to break out a few days after use. I have a clear complexion and this actually makes it worse...</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it&#x27;s very minty but I love mint. It smells like spearmint gum! It&#x27;s a green mask, so it&#x27;s fun to walk around the house with it on while it dries.  I scared my puppies with it. Haha It has the texture of clay and dries like clay.  It also stings a bit when you first rub it on.  You&#x27;re supposed to leave it on for 15 minutes or until it dries. Then you rinse it off with warm water and a wash cloth.  And then... brighter, tighter skin!  I swear after one use, the pores on my nose shrank.  The big pores on the apples of my cheeks not so much, but there was still a noticeable difference.  I&#x27;m going to use this everyday to see what happens.  I bought it at Walgreens for $5.  A great product to use before the mask is Garnier The Brusher Microbead Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use this mask every night on my chin, nostrils, and around my mouth (right up to my lips) because of hormonal acne.  Every since I started using it every night a few days before my period, I no longer get hormonal pimples.  I also use it as a spot treatment when I sometimes get pimples in other places, but those are rare. I&#x27;ll use it day and night for those times.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing mask.</li>
            <li> I thought I was purchasing the mint julep facial scrub.  I used to use it years ago, remember liking it, so I thought I&#x27;d try it again.  I must have ordered wrong because this is what came.  Since it was cheap, I decided to keep it and try it.  BURN!!! It works great at opening pores and tightening skin but for the first minute or so after showering and applying, it burns awful - I can barely keep my eyes open because of the sting on the skin.  After about a minute, the burn subsides but I&#x27;ve used products that don&#x27;t burn and do just as good, if not better of a job - like Freeman&#x27;s Avocado and Oatmeal mask.  That&#x27;s a bit more expensive.  I would not buy this again because of the burn but if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap that gets the job done and you don&#x27;t mind the initial burning sensation from the mint, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face mask for about a year now and I must say I just love it!!!! It makes the skin very soft cleaning and tightening it at the same time....the smell is good...an excellent value for money....a great product delivering great results at a very low price...I will definitely keep using it....</li>
            <li> Great mask to use for weekly use to control t zone.  I use it overnight for spot treatment om acne.</li>
            <li> I really love how the mask works. I&#x27;ll note that it helps me if I put some sort of moisturizer on afterwards, because using the mask by itself can make my skin dry. But otherwise, my face always feels fresh and clean from this product. Will buy again :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update&lt;br /&gt;I originally gave this product 4 stars, but I now give it five. Whenever I use it, my face always feel fresher, smoother, softer, and just all around better! LOVE</li>
            <li> I love Queen Helene. This was the first mask that I tried and I love it. It really cleans up my face and I can see little dots where my blackheads or pimples are. I feel like it washes them away and looks like it does as well. I use this one the most.</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t do much for my acne. it did feel nice and tingly though and is a fun thing to do with friends! but would not recommend if your looking for a beneficial mask.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find this at Walgreens but I think they stopped carrying it for some reason. I used it frequently and my face was incredibly clear, never any black heads. I stopped using it and I had some breakouts here and there, I finally decided to try it again and it did not disappoint. After just three consecutive days of using I saw improvement. This stuff is great XD</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin. I can&#x27;t really say it helped dry my acne but it does cool down your face and relaxes you. I would leave it on for half hour while I watch a TV show and when you wash it off it cleans all the dirt in your pores. Overall very good for the cheap price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad skin all my life (24 years!). Acne as a teen and now in my adult life I have combination skin (oily &amp; dry at the same time ugh!!). It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s hot outside or cold, the pores in my face seem to stay open and clogged. If you look up close to my nose area, you can literally see the dirt in the pores. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds over the years on products which would be fine if they worked but I&#x27;m always disappointed. While researching cleansing facial pores, I came across this inexpensive product with great reviews. The reviews really sold me &amp; how harmless could a product under $10 be!? I put a biore strip on my nose for 20 minutes and then put the mask on for another 20 minutes. When the warm sensation started, I knew my pores would feel the heat and open. After washing the mask off and looking at my face, my nose area was immediately different. I now use this at least 2 - 3 times a week and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t change the oil problem but it keeps your pores clean &amp; closed &amp; gives you a clean look. I&#x27;m so happy I found this product! Once of the few times researching during working hours turned out great lol</li>
            <li> The masque tingles a lot, which I really like. My skin always feels soft and tight after I use it and the pores on my nose are definitely smaller after each use. I did not give it a five because after almost a year of consistent use the pores in my nose are still visible, at least to me. I am not sure if there is a product on the market which can shrink them completely, but this one is not going to. I use it weekly and the effects are mostly temporary. I do, however, get significantly less pimples.</li>
            <li> Another product that I use for myself about twice a week, and sure is soothing!!! works extremely well!! also, if doggies break out, yep, they get this on also and it works!!!!! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face mask to help dry up problem areas like white heads and pimples.  I use it sporadically on any problem spots that pop up.</li>
            <li> I have small blackheads and within two days after applying and removing this masque for 15 minutes, most of the blackheads are gone! I now have significantly less blackheads on my cheeks... yesterday I woke up with a small pimple on my forehead, like most people I was foolishly impulsed to try to pop it... didn&#x27;t turn out so well... now it&#x27;s a red blotch almost centered above my nose... what a fail (and I have school tomorrow hahah), but fortunately I applied this masque and although the redness isn&#x27;t completely gone... it is reduced... definitely would recommend... what is there to lose? $8 isn&#x27;t lost! It&#x27;s an investment on your face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for years and I absolutely love it (and love Amazon&#x27;s S&amp;S option, saves lots of $)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels nice and refreshing yet not too minty. Your pores will shrink and your face will be tightened, your skin feels really soft after washing it off and it does not dry you out. It def helps reduce size of pimples too, I don&#x27;t know if it helps prevents acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with the face scrub [[ASIN:B002LMD4XK Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque, 8 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] which I also love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people commented that it&#x27;s messy - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any messier than other masks. It&#x27;s very thick consistency and when your done applying simply wash off your fingers.</li>
            <li> smear it on your face, let it dry-feels tight. rinse or wash it off and your skin feels smooth and not oily at all. i&#x27;m not sure if it helps with pores or blackheads like it says, but it feels great and can&#x27;t hurt. will revisit if it shows any long term benefits, but will contunue to use for the feeling alone.</li>
            <li> i have been using Queen Helene products for YEARS-awesome products! No animal testing for one and this \\&quot;masque\\&quot; is the best for drying out skin blemishes-i have used NOTHING better! Sure, pay alot for those tv products but this is the real deal. Just dab a bit on the blemish, let it dry and your blemish IMMEDIATELY starts to disappear. This stuff is \\&quot;magic\\&quot;-i can&#x27;t say enough good about it! If you use the masque on your entire face, your skin feels fresh and clean-looks younger. i recommend to anyone-perfect for \\&quot;teenage\\&quot; skin and skin affected occassional outbreaks.</li>
            <li> This mask dries up pimples very quickly.  It absorbed excess oil from my face, letting my face glow, instead of shine.  The &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; that people are talking about wasn&#x27;t too bad.  I felt it on my cheeks but it  went away as the mask dried.  The mint scent was very mild compared to what I expected based on a few reviews.  The only thing I don&#x27;t love about the mask is the after-smell.  After the mint scent is washed away, you can really smell the clay.  It&#x27;s not as nice, but it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
            <li> I really like using a Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque in conjunction with the Queen Helene Miny Julep scrub for my face, I use the scrub first and once washed off I use the Masque 3-4 times a week. Order yours today if you want great skin no matter what color your skin tone is (I am a Afro-American male).</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s similar to the &amp;#34;Mayan Healing Clay&amp;#34; that&#x27;s all the rage these days but not as harsh. It cleans up theface well and tightens pores while still being pretty simple to clean off. Just make sure you clean up well, I have been called out for green streaks across my face sometimes haha.</li>
            <li> This is an old and classic product that still works. A staple for anyone that loves to dry out a zit quick and take care of their skin.</li>
            <li> Very good to clean your skin. It might burn a bit sometimes, but it is efficient and clears the pores very well</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. Absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great item that does exactly what it supposed to do. It feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I got the two pack of this and I am so happy I did. I love it. My skin looks and feels so great after using. I had some large pores on my chest and tried everything to make them appear smaller and nothing worked. But this did. The pores look smaller and less clogged. I use this on my face and any other area where I get pimples. I usually don&#x27;t have acne problems but in the last 6 months I have started to have them and this product is getting rid of them! Love it.</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived on time. They were exactly what i wanted. The pricing is a bargain. Fast and easy service. :)</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this mask.  Works so well and keeps me beautiful.  I occasionally substitute it with expensive masks on Sephora but for the most part this gets the job done.  I highly recommend this product and honestly cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this masque and the corresponding scrub for almost a year. My face is really sensitive, dries out easily, but also breaks out easily. Overall my face has been noticeably clearer and my pores are smaller. The scrub is a gentile exfoliator that removes all of your dead skin. I use it every time I shower. The masque helps reduce blackheads and I use that 1-2 times/month. These are very affordable products that will do wonderful things for your skin. The 2 pack is nice and will last you a very long time (still going strong, mine might last another 6 months so like 1.5 - 2 yrs depending on how you use it)</li>
            <li> I use this about twice a month to suck the crap out of my pores. It&#x27;s not too drying, makes your skin feel super soft and smooth after use, and it has a pleasant mint scent. There is also a nice tingling sensation during use. Great product.</li>
            <li> Purchased after reading these raving reviews. I have recently started a new regimen for oily skin so I figured this would help. I have been using this mask for about 2 weeks now and have not noticed any huge changes in my skin. My boyfriend actually made the comment that my face was still pretty broke out... Not that the mask broke me out, just that it didn&#x27;t prevent my usual break outs. After using for 2 weeks at roughly 3 times a week, I still have blackheads, pores still look huge, and my acne remains untouched. I love the way it feels- painful at first but very refreshing afterwards. I can certainly feel that my skin has tightened. My only recommendation is do not use a minty/tingly face wash or a face scrub before using this as it will burn your face off. I will continue to use this since I purchased a pack of two so hopefully I will see a change.</li>
            <li> This product coupled with benzoyl peroxide completely cleared up my acne in a few weeks. Now i don&#x27;t even use either and think it was definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is easy to give your face a quick pick me up.  Minty fresh, dries in about 10 minutes.  Only down side is that you need to work to get it all off.  I usually do it before I shower so I can follow up with a good rinse in there.</li>
            <li> It definitely reduced the size of my pores. Blackheads on my face vanished. Skin felt clean and replenished. Definitely a tingling experience! Have used product for 7 years.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I thought my skin was burning, but this was just caused by the &#x27;mint&#x27; in the product. Don&#x27;t worry, it wasn&#x27;t burning off. Once I got over the initial shock and discomfort I realized that this mask is by far the best I have ever used. I tend to have very large pores and while it didn&#x27;t &#x27;shrink&#x27; them as such, I did notice that my skin was much firmer and plumper. It was also exceptionally smooth. Since that first time I have used it many many times, and now that I know what to expect with the &#x27;tingling&#x27; sensation, it is very enjoyable and refreshing especially in summer.</li>
            <li> I had seen this product advertised by a doctor as safe to use during pregnancy when most acne products are a no no.  Love this mask for helping to heal and clear the awful pregnancy acne that is such a frustrating part of the pregnancy journey.  It won&#x27;t completely stop the acne, but it HELPS a ton!  It contains sulfur but really does not smell like sulfur (smells like mint).  It has an aftermath of a very minor sulfur smell after you wash it off which fades, but for me this is totally worth it because it works!  I highly recommend it to all pregnant friends!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Too messy for me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely THE BEST masque out there. Better than at a spa! When I start to get a pimple or blemish, i even dab a bit right on it and it seems to clear it up quickly...without doing the whole masque thing! So its not just for facials.</li>
            <li> It is really good and you can tell the difference right away. I bought one for me and one for my sister and we both love it. The only bad thing is... you will look like Elphaba (Wicked) when you have it on, and your kids will laugh a lot.</li>
            <li> Love it, use it whenever I can :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my skin for multiple reasons, but this product is a miracle! Using it once makes a SIGNIFICANT difference. I can&#x27;t imagine my skin care regiment without it.</li>
            <li> An old stand-by that works! I have tried many facial masks over the years---some very pricey---and none have compared.</li>
            <li> My HG product, I love this item so much. I have the glam glow supermud clearing treatment which is $69 for a whole lot less and this works a whole lot better, on me at least. It smells good, feels wonderful, &amp; I can see some results immediately. It clears out and tightens my pores and gets rid of break outs.</li>
            <li> love it. i use it all the time. i need more words to send this, and i dont know why i want to write a review</li>
            <li> Its a good product and i like it</li>
            <li> I used to use this product years ago and came back to it looking for a good, cheap face mask. I still love this product and I&#x27;m so glad I went back. It makes my skin softer and smoother and gets rid of some of the redness. It smells great, too. I put it on about 15 minutes before I take a shower and it rinses away really quickly under the spray.</li>
            <li> I will be the first to say that this product is WONDERFUL. I have had terrible acne ever since I was a teenager and this has helped me the breakouts under control. This mask along with a good diet and exercise routine keeps my skin looking clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still break out when my hormones are all out of balance, but using this helps tame the breakout until the hormones are back in balance.</li>
            <li> Love this mask! My skin always feels so clean &amp; the pores really do shrink down. The skin does feel a bit tight afterwards but a little moisturizer fixes that. It&#x27;s a green clay so you won&#x27;t want to use a white or light colored washcloth to remove.</li>
            <li> I love this facial masque. It works so well, and it smells good. It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean and soft. It makes my pores smaller and my face not so greasy. This is probably the best facial masque that I&#x27;ve ever used, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This mask is so great, and this 2-pack is a good value. I&#x27;m in my 20s but I still break out, despite doing all the recommended things to take care of my skin (drinking lots of water, eating well, taking off my makeup every day, etc). This definitely reduces oiliness but doesn&#x27;t make your skin super dry or flaky. It smells amazing, feels nice, and is fun to apply, plus you get the enjoyment of having a vibrant mint-colored face for 10-15 minutes while you&#x27;re using. I originally bought this at a store but they discontinued it, so I&#x27;m glad to see it on here!</li>
            <li> Great for my oily, sensitive and acne prone skin. Didn&#x27;t work well for my friend (who has dry sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I really like this mask. It&#x27;s mint so it smells and feels very nice while it&#x27;s on and it leave my skin feeling amazing after I wash it off. I feel like it also help clear up my acne when I use it consistently (At least once a day).</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. My fave face mask ever.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for years, and was not able to locate for a few months until now. This mask has a mint smell, and alsoa cooling feel to your face. Happy to have found again.</li>
