            <li>I like the smell, lathers nicely and quickly.</li>
            <li>These have a lovely light scent to them, and it&#x27;s not a scent that lingers on your skin.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I will use a make up remover for my eyes and then wait to wash the area with this soap, then I rinse it away with splashing water on my face and then going over it with a warm wet cloth.  </li>
            <li>Better price than I found in a catalog that sold individual bar.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>For the price it would be easy to take and not worry if it came back with me or not.  </li>

            <li>And I will mention that when companies make soaps for face or make up removers, they can be made to be a bit gently.  </li>
            <li>I think I was expecting too much from the soap, like it would make me look like a cream faced beauty.</li>
            <li>Well it might be smoother because of the intense film this product leaves on your face, not because its making your face smoother.</li>
            <li>#34;those few extra years&amp;#34; and  skin that needs a boost of lightness and youth you will love this product!!  </li>

            <li>Leaves your face  moisturised and gives your skin a lovely  texture after a week or less!!</li>
            <li>The price for the package of 4 is a little more than double what  I paid for 1 cake of soap.</li>
            <li>We must also think that these are old school soaps.  </li>
            <li>but it gets the job done as far as cleansing and makeup removal is concerned without being overly drying.</li>

These have a lovely light scent to them, and it&#x27;s not a scent that lingers on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that as someone else pointed out, this really stings the eyes.  Yes, soap can sting the eyes.  But this STINGS. And I will mention that when companies make soaps for face or make up removers, they can be made to be a bit gently.  We must also think that these are old school soaps.  I will use a make up remover for my eyes and then wait to wash the area with this soap, then I rinse it away with splashing water on my face and then going over it with a warm wet cloth.  Seems to work.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery .  Better price than I found in a catalog that sold individual bar. Love the product! Good for 50+ skin</li>
            <li> I bought one cake of this soap at a gift shop on vacation. Instantly loved it makes my face feel young again. The price for the package of 4 is a little more than double what  I paid for 1 cake of soap. So it is like getting 2 free. I will definitely buy again. I use to wash my face once a day now I can&#x27;t wait to use it in the morning and again just before bed. I have many allergies and this doesn&#x27;t have anything in it that bothers me.</li>
            <li> These are such good soaps,  expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> A wonderful facial soap.  Leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and subtly scented.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, lathers nicely and quickly. I haven&#x27;t noticed a big change, but the scent relaxes me.</li>
            <li> I started using this as a body soap - not just a facial soap - and it completely healed cracked skin that I thought I would have the rest of my life. The scent is very mild and pleasant. I just bought some for my mother, who has a very tough time keeping her skin from drying out. Finding a soap that actually performs better than a cream or lotion is amazing to me.</li>
            <li> I heard about this soap from a beauty blog I follow that only posts about toxic-free products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is really affordable for how many you get and as a face soap, lasts a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the box is super cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it a four out of five stars is because I experience a slight burning sensation&lt;br /&gt;in my eyes when I use it to wash my face. However, I don&#x27;t use a eye makeup remover beforehand so I take&lt;br /&gt;responsibility for scrubbing my eyes pretty good while washing with this soap.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in the quality or texture of my skin since using this soap but I don&#x27;t care because it smells AMAZING. I think I was expecting too much from the soap, like it would make me look like a cream faced beauty.

I&#x27;m buying individual bars as stocking stuffers for my favorite ladies next Christmas and I&#x27;m not wrapping the boxes because doing so would take away from how cute they are.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It&#x27;s not a miracle product (are there any?) but it gets the job done as far as cleansing and makeup removal is concerned without being overly drying. What you&#x27;re paying for is a great smell and great packaging.</li>
            <li> Great year round mild cleanser. I can even use it during the winter when I get dry and flaky (without using a heavy moisturizer). Not the prettiest smelling soap, but the scent is minimal. Lasts a reasonable life and is a good price. I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>

            <li> This is my favorite complexion soap. I appreciate the four pack. I have given there soaps as gifts. I like them so much I enjoy sharing.</li>
            <li> This is great soap - as I&#x27;ve grown older I&#x27;ve found the cheap grocery store soaps are harsher on my face, and after washing my face just doesn&#x27;t feel as good as it should.  This soap is perfect and well made.  It lasts a long time and is great for my &amp;#34;end of the workday I want to wash off my makeup&amp;#34; face wash.  I&#x27;ve purchased it before and will continue to use it in the future.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This soap for women over 30 will understand what I&#x27;m saying when the weather changes so does your skin, This so makes the transition smooth Very comfortable soothing most of all less lotion at night Bravo!!!!!</li>
            <li> Refreshing, wonderful product that doesn&#x27;t dry out you skin.. Leaves your face  moisturised and gives your skin a lovely  texture after a week or less!! If you have sensitive skin that seems to come with &amp;#34;those few extra years&amp;#34; and  skin that needs a boost of lightness and youth you will love this product!!  My evening ritual that my skin looks forward to.  Will search the earth for this sweet little box of silkiness if amazon ever stops carrying this product.</li>
