    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This was an excellent find.</li>
            <li>This lotion is great!  </li>
            <li>My lips showed great improvement within 24 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try it because it was supposed to help reduce redness, and this is a great side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product did not feel good on it.</li>
            <li>comforting lotion feels good on application.</li>
            <li>Also good as a stand-alone eye cream.</li>
            <li>so I was more then happy to try a lotion that promised to reduce that redness.</li>
            <li>When I first put the lotion on I was impressed with the non-greasy feel and the lack of fragrances.</li>
            <li>So it must do more than I thought!</li>
            <li>I would be thrilled</li>
            <li>Each person&#x27;s skin has its own signature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>liked this product.  </li>
            <li>I liked the smell and the silky feel of it.  </li>
            <li>Some nights, I just want a nice, light-feeling moisturizing product that feels like it is hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant smell, didn&#x27;t clog my pools or cause and breakouts.  </li>
            <li>She liked this serum because is moisturized well, without irritation, but needed another layer of face cream on top of it.</li>
            <li>I must say, for a spa product to splurge on I have been pretty happy with this.</li>
            <li>There is no clinical, reported link between parabens and breast cancer according to reputable, national cancer websites.</li>
            <li>I use contain chemicals, as do most household cleaning products (including those that are supposedly safer)...</li>
            <li>But then again, most skin care products don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Most of all, though, was the fact that no discernible change occured.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure others had a better experience.</li>
            <li>had much better results from Mtn.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but I&#x27;ve paid more at the cosmetic counter for so-so results.</li>
            <li>Personally, I find that rotating some quality products like this works best for me.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful facial skin serum.  </li>
            <li>all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using the rest of the bottle and see if it works even better.</li>
            <li>Better off just to look for the organic versions.</li>
            <li>It is very nicely packaged and feels and looks very high end in its presentation</li>
            <li>So far, this serum has done a great job.</li>
            <li>This is just hyaluronic acid, there are a million brands of it available at better prices than this one.</li>
            <li>It is light and does not have a strong odor or a sticky feel to it.  </li>
            <li>I must say, this product did not irritate my skin, which was a huge bonus.  </li>
            <li>I really dont understand that kind chemical reaction when using an organic product, and therefore cannot recommend this concentrate.</li>
            <li>fact that they&#x27;re marketing this as good for sensitive skin blows me away -</li>
            <li>I should have known better, but the \\&quot;high quality ingredients\\&quot; made me think this would be okay.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product as I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use many skin care items.  </li>
            <li>I liked it well enough, but it didn&#x27;t really do anything amazing for my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several \\&quot;redness\\&quot; serums and creams and while most felt good, they didn&#x27;t do much of the redness.  </li>
            <li>Rose Herbs special Classic Rose Facial Oil.</li>
            <li>It feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This is no miracle worker, but it is better than any of the others including my last favorite, Clinique&#x27;s Redness Solutions cream.  </li>
            <li>It has a light, smooth feel and goes on very silkily.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t think I can dismiss it so quickly after</li>
            <li>In my book, that&#x27;s good (not great, just good).</li>
            <li>But at the asking price, I&#x27;d stick to something that already works for me and is free (or nearly free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container in which it comes is lovely, but could easily mislead a consumer into thinking she&#x27;s getting more product than is actually in there</li>
            <li>My favorites are their eye gels or emulsions, which are very light, yet very effective, firming and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin, and I needed a lotion/serum that could moisturize while providing the best ingredients possible to my sensitive</li>
            <li>most folks with sensitive skin cannot tolerate parabens,</li>
            <li>I was pleased that there was no noticeable smell, and it did no harm to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It contains many natural ingredients BUT also has parabens which I try to avoid.  </li>
            <li>That made me smile.</li>
            <li>bright, no little skin bumps or flakes &amp; soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>To my mind, a drop or two of this serum on my face, neck and chest every day is no worse--and probably a lot safer to use--than many, many other things.</li>
            <li>Yours might differ from mine.to use--than many, many other things.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing and is fairly light weight.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t live up to all its fabulous claims.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, react and break out easily.  </li>
            <li>This concentrate sounded very promising as my skin can be a bit sensitive at times, and the ingredients sound</li>
            <li>I finally stopped using it after it made my undereyes sting when using my favorite organic undereye product (Ginzing).</li>
            <li>of the ingredients were not so hot, but I risked them for 30 days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The flakes started diminishing and my hot wind burned</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use the product until it&#x27;s gone, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>have come to the conclusion that just because it says natural it is rarely the case!</li>
            <li>I live in an extremely arid area and since I&#x27;ve used this in addition to my moisturizer my skin is looking good:</li>
            <li>So with propylene glycol at the top, parabens in two places in the middle and the supposed extracts at the very bottom, this stuff is not what their marketing is claiming it to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fact that the item is also devoid of any scent of any kind is another huge plus, they really did go out of their way, it seems to provide a decent sensitive skin product that avoids any possibility of allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All in all, my skin does feel good, hasn&#x27;t dried out and is smooth, but the overall appearance hasn&#x27;t changed, but it also hasn&#x27;t worsened.</li>
            <li>It is also winter time and my skin is very dry and more fussy this time of year.</li>
            <li>This lotion is light and absorbs quickly--no greasy look and it left my skin feeling very silky.</li>
            <li>After lightly towel drying my face, I would apply the product on my entire face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I have really got to respect that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>look it up), I realized I should have just stuck with what I know to be made of real ingredients, not</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see the results of this product.  </li>
            <li>If you do have sensitive skin and are seeking something to help, this might well be worth a try.</li>
            <li>I do not have any real skin problems</li>
            <li>I personally like that frou frou smell in my grooming items, but such additions would not be good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However, if you read on the environmental working group&#x27;s website they clearly inform you that on an ingredients list, those items at the top are what it&#x27;s mostly made of, and the list goes down from most to least.</li>
            <li>When I received the AINHOA Sensitive Skin Concentrate, I was aware that it isn&#x27;t a moisturizer, but instead a pre-moisturizing serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to find good soothing creams and serums for the sensitive face, even from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t see spending money on a calming fluid that doesn&#x27;t calm.</li>
            <li>Honestly (and this is going to sound weird,) vaseline has worked as well as anything else.</li>
            <li>antifreeze de-icer isn&#x27;t something I want to rub into my sensitive skin, and most likely many of the other chemicals in this mix are things I would want to avoid if I were to look each one up (just the parabens and propylene glycol were enough to put me off the product).</li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>other serums I use, Jurlique herbal recovery gel and Ole Henriksen Truth Serum, are both much more natural, with more herbal ingredients and less chemicals and work really well with my sensitive</li>
            <li>I always thought I had normal aging skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive--using medium-to-heavy products for more than a couple of days usually winds up breaking me out and causing clogging/problems.</li>
            <li>My skin loves this light, fast absorbing and long lasting serum.</li>
            <li>Totally hypoallergenic - is that the right word.</li>
            <li>I will update my review if I change my mind, but right now, I am leaning toward getting it again (especially from my husband&#x27;s rating!)</li>
            <li>With the first application, I noticed reduced redness, and after a full week of regular use beneath sensitive skin moisturizer, my rosacea is obviously clearing up!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that product would calm whatever strange rash has taken over my neck and chest.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first day I used this, I braced myself for stinging pain and possibly a rash or breakout afterward, but neither happened.</li>
            <li>The Ainhoa knocks down the redness a little more, absorbs quickly and hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs (been using it for over a month now).  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, not greasy and my skin does feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>ever I needed a skin product that really soothed and brought skin back to normal</li>
            <li>It goes on super smooth and does not leave behind a greasy film.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Senskin products are based on the extraordinary hydrating, nutritive and regenerating properties of different components such as Azulene, Decongestive Plant Extracts and Oat Extract.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I find it to be a little cooling and soaks in smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>With a few wrinkles appearing and my gently aging skin drying out a bit, I am always excited to try new facial care products.</li>
            <li>My personal theory is that I dye my hair, the gentle shampoos and soaps</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this sounded like a gentle and natural fluid.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Senskin Sensitive Skin Concentrate boasts that it is/will:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calm</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the reason I quit looking at products in professional hair salons.</li>
            <li>This lotion comes with a nice, working pump, which dispenses a thin line of the pearlescent moisturizing</li>
            <li>The lotion went on with a smooth coolness that felt good on my skin, but once it was dry a few minutes later, my nose didn&#x27;t appear to be much less red.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super dry, but has spots that definitely need moisture.</li>
            <li>It soaked in quickly and left my skin very very dry, it did nothing to reduce any redness, and in fact my skin felt irritated after using it.</li>
            <li>AND.... it is substantially more expensive than the high quality cream I use on my face with exactly the same results.</li>
            <li>I used it for a week and found although it seemed to calm the redness in my skin down a bit, it wasn&#x27;t a miracle product that had me oohing and ahhing, and for the price, it should make we want to do flips.</li>
            <li>In fact, my facial care routine generally consists of fresh aloe gel, maybe a spritz of rose water, for my moisturizer because most other things will dry my skin out too badly or hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive, which is why I&#x27;m cautious when it comes to facial care products.</li>
            <li>also appreciate that this product plays well with other products with no weird chemical clash, which can result in some unpleasantness.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I dabbed only a small amount around my chin.  </li>
            <li>(Dermalogica usually), cocoa and shea butter, olive oil, and nothing really seems to change my skin a whole lot.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that it didn&#x27;t make my skin worse or better, it basically had zero effect on me.  </li>
            <li>Also, \\&quot;anti-freeze\\&quot; (glycol) is a very common preservative that&#x27;s used in the vast majority of moisturizers and other skin care products, including those for infants, adult sensitive skin, and even labeled and advertised natural products; it keeps the products from becoming rancid, and replaces alcohol and/or petrolium products that are harsher to skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin is now back to normal thanks to this rapidly working, serious fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is much debate about parabens; however, no effective direct links between parabens and cancer have been established.  </li>

            <li> look it up), I realized I should have just stuck with what I know to be made of real ingredients, not</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see the results of this product.  </li>
            <li> If you do have sensitive skin and are seeking something to help, this might well be worth a try.</li>
            <li> I do not have any real skin problems</li>
            <li> I personally like that frou frou smell in my grooming items, but such additions would not be good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, if you read on the environmental working group&#x27;s website they clearly inform you that on an ingredients list, those items at the top are what it&#x27;s mostly made of, and the list goes down from most to least.</li>
            <li> When I received the AINHOA Sensitive Skin Concentrate, I was aware that it isn&#x27;t a moisturizer, but instead a pre-moisturizing serum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find good soothing creams and serums for the sensitive face, even from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t see spending money on a calming fluid that doesn&#x27;t calm.</li>
            <li> Honestly (and this is going to sound weird,) vaseline has worked as well as anything else.</li>
            <li> antifreeze de-icer isn&#x27;t something I want to rub into my sensitive skin, and most likely many of the other chemicals in this mix are things I would want to avoid if I were to look each one up (just the parabens and propylene glycol were enough to put me off the product).</li>
            <li> and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> other serums I use, Jurlique herbal recovery gel and Ole Henriksen Truth Serum, are both much more natural, with more herbal ingredients and less chemicals and work really well with my sensitive</li>
            <li> I always thought I had normal aging skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive--using medium-to-heavy products for more than a couple of days usually winds up breaking me out and causing clogging/problems.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this light, fast absorbing and long lasting serum.</li>
            <li> Totally hypoallergenic - is that the right word.</li>
            <li> I will update my review if I change my mind, but right now, I am leaning toward getting it again (especially from my husband&#x27;s rating!)</li>
            <li> With the first application, I noticed reduced redness, and after a full week of regular use beneath sensitive skin moisturizer, my rosacea is obviously clearing up!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that product would calm whatever strange rash has taken over my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first day I used this, I braced myself for stinging pain and possibly a rash or breakout afterward, but neither happened.</li>
            <li> The Ainhoa knocks down the redness a little more, absorbs quickly and hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs (been using it for over a month now).  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, not greasy and my skin does feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> ever I needed a skin product that really soothed and brought skin back to normal</li>
            <li> It goes on super smooth and does not leave behind a greasy film.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Senskin products are based on the extraordinary hydrating, nutritive and regenerating properties of different components such as Azulene, Decongestive Plant Extracts and Oat Extract.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I find it to be a little cooling and soaks in smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> With a few wrinkles appearing and my gently aging skin drying out a bit, I am always excited to try new facial care products.</li>
            <li> My personal theory is that I dye my hair, the gentle shampoos and soaps</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this sounded like a gentle and natural fluid.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Senskin Sensitive Skin Concentrate boasts that it is/will:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calm</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the reason I quit looking at products in professional hair salons.</li>
            <li> This lotion comes with a nice, working pump, which dispenses a thin line of the pearlescent moisturizing</li>
            <li> The lotion went on with a smooth coolness that felt good on my skin, but once it was dry a few minutes later, my nose didn&#x27;t appear to be much less red.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t super dry, but has spots that definitely need moisture.</li>
            <li> It soaked in quickly and left my skin very very dry, it did nothing to reduce any redness, and in fact my skin felt irritated after using it.</li>
            <li> AND.... it is substantially more expensive than the high quality cream I use on my face with exactly the same results.</li>
            <li> I used it for a week and found although it seemed to calm the redness in my skin down a bit, it wasn&#x27;t a miracle product that had me oohing and ahhing, and for the price, it should make we want to do flips.</li>
            <li> In fact, my facial care routine generally consists of fresh aloe gel, maybe a spritz of rose water, for my moisturizer because most other things will dry my skin out too badly or hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin is very sensitive, which is why I&#x27;m cautious when it comes to facial care products.</li>
            <li> also appreciate that this product plays well with other products with no weird chemical clash, which can result in some unpleasantness.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I dabbed only a small amount around my chin.  </li>
            <li> (Dermalogica usually), cocoa and shea butter, olive oil, and nothing really seems to change my skin a whole lot.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it didn&#x27;t make my skin worse or better, it basically had zero effect on me.  </li>
            <li> Also, \\&quot;anti-freeze\\&quot; (glycol) is a very common preservative that&#x27;s used in the vast majority of moisturizers and other skin care products, including those for infants, adult sensitive skin, and even labeled and advertised natural products; it keeps the products from becoming rancid, and replaces alcohol and/or petrolium products that are harsher to skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin is now back to normal thanks to this rapidly working, serious fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is much debate about parabens; however, no effective direct links between parabens and cancer have been established.  </li>
            <li> I have been fighting bouts of adult acne due to a hormonal imbalance I am experiencing recently.</li>
            <li> Got this product for my wife (in her 40&#x27;s) - her skin is sensitive and tends to be dry due to regular use of Retin-A.</li>
            <li> This may make your skin soft, but for me, it&#x27;s not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal color after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, anything from plants must be so highly processed and such a tiny amount, there are a few listings at the bottom of extracts, one chamomile and the other corn flower.</li>
            <li> That said, a little does go a long way--to cover my entire face only required two pumps--and using only two pumps twice daily (morning and evening), the entire container lasted six weeks.</li>
            <li> I used this product on one half of my face and used my normal (natural) skin cream on the other half.  </li>
            <li> Besides dry, chapped lips, my face was red, dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> Supposedly for sensitive skin, I put a small amount on my face, and felt no tingling or burning initially.  </li>
            <li> It has a fairly long ingredient label and also contains: Water, cyclopentasoliane, proplyene glycol, polyacrylaminde, dimethicone polysorbate 40 and goes on and on with chemical components.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited to add (2/24): After reading other reviews warning about chemicals in this product, and specifically those related to breast cancer, I stopped using this until I could do some research.</li>
            <li> Left on overnight is one of the few products I have found that seems to make my eye area nicer the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild rosacea for a few years, often made worse by anti-aging products, basic moisturizers and makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was ready to give this a very mediocre review, but figured maybe I was expecting too much.</li>
            <li> It is very dry</li>
            <li> However, even though it hasn&#x27;t made anything worse, I haven&#x27;t really seen an improvement.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Dead Sea cosmetic products and have used Ahava, Avani and Swissa.</li>
            <li> But I suffer from fatty pockets under my eyes that look like white spots.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it would temporarily turn red for a few minutes after applying the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> So I used this for a few days on one side of my face only.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, along with the Purifying Fluid, for approximately 2 weeks and starting with somewhat dry skin, feels as though it is dryer than before.  </li>
            <li> Please note, a little goes a long way; two pumps will cover face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of reducing acne or other issues.  </li>
            <li> However, when it arrived and I read the label, an extensive list of chemicals including those known to be irritating such as parabens and propylene glycol (that&#x27;s antifreeze, used as an airplane de-icer...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the design of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The way the tube is made makes it impossible to see how much of the product is left.</li>
            <li> range carries no fragrance or artificial colors, with preservatives reduced to a minimum and all raw materials have been tested in such a way that the final products are essentially hypoallergenic.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have found that it soothes my irritation and lets my other products do their job without further irritating me.  </li>
            <li> I stuck with it for a month and found little or no change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disturbed by the ingredients and despite the fact that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d spend the money on this one.  </li>
            <li> I felt a little irritated in the evenings after I had put it on in the morning.  </li>
            <li> , it is an expensive cream, but if it helps reduce the fatty pockets I&#x27;m willing to try it, since I haven&#x27;t (yet) noticed any negative side effects.</li>
            <li> stuff has all the types of parabens women with, or previously had, breast cancer should avoid!</li>
            <li> I found that my skin felt very tight and not at all moisturized after using.</li>
            <li> That said, this product did absolutely nothing for my skin--good, bad, or otherwise--in the 6 weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Indoors was no better, with the furnace drying the air further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say the benefits outweigh the cost on this one.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what it does at all.</li>
            <li> I think the price is higher, but it is comparable to even items from a supermarket (some of those little tubes are very expensive per ounce!)</li>
            <li> In other words, it&#x27;s been difficult for me to find face care products that don&#x27;t make it worse, and nothing has actually cleared it up...</li>
            <li> So, I decided I would faithfully use it for at least four weeks and note any changes to my skin&#x27;s appearance and texture.</li>
            <li> Well you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing I&#x27;ve found has helped eliminate them.  </li>
            <li> tried everything for chapped lips on my seriously chapped lips to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I no longer look papery and dried out from the ill effects of winter weather and the arid Wyoming plains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> peroxide is a caustic chemical, folks.</li>
            <li> I had to go behind it and use another lotion.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist said it is excema, but it looks like acne to me and itches like crazy.  </li>
            <li> suffered from terrible wind burn during this past snow blizzard.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to gauge the amount remaining because the interior wall is opaque.</li>
            <li> once it arrived and I looked at the ingredients list, I was appalled because the company touted it as being another \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had high hopes that product would calm whatever strange rash has taken over my neck and chest. The dermatologist said it is excema, but it looks like acne to me and itches like crazy.  I applied this product to my face neck and chest nightly after washing my face, and sometimes in the morning after my shower.  All I can say is that it didn&#x27;t make my skin worse or better, it basically had zero effect on me.  It isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing and is fairly light weight.  It has a light pleasant smell, didn&#x27;t clog my pools or cause and breakouts.  It did soften the feel of my skin some, but any facial fluid will do that.  If it calmed my itch or lessened my skin irritation I would be thrilled but it just didn&#x27;t.  I really can&#x27;t see spending money on a calming fluid that doesn&#x27;t calm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild rosacea for a few years, often made worse by anti-aging products, basic moisturizers and makeup. In other words, it&#x27;s been difficult for me to find face care products that don&#x27;t make it worse, and nothing has actually cleared it up... until now! When I received the AINHOA Sensitive Skin Concentrate, I was aware that it isn&#x27;t a moisturizer, but instead a pre-moisturizing serum. With the first application, I noticed reduced redness, and after a full week of regular use beneath sensitive skin moisturizer, my rosacea is obviously clearing up! HURRAY! I&#x27;ll keep buying this product for the forseeable future. Please note, a little goes a long way; two pumps will cover face, neck and chest. If you have rosacea, please let me encourage you to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add (2/24): After reading other reviews warning about chemicals in this product, and specifically those related to breast cancer, I stopped using this until I could do some research. I had DCIS in 1999, and my mom had a mastectomy in July 2012 for stage 4 invasive ductal carcinoma. There is no clinical, reported link between parabens and breast cancer according to reputable, national cancer websites. Also, \\&quot;anti-freeze\\&quot; (glycol) is a very common preservative that&#x27;s used in the vast majority of moisturizers and other skin care products, including those for infants, adult sensitive skin, and even labeled and advertised natural products; it keeps the products from becoming rancid, and replaces alcohol and/or petrolium products that are harsher to skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m once again using the product, because for *me* it works. It obviously doesn&#x27;t for everyone. My personal theory is that I dye my hair, the gentle shampoos and soaps I use contain chemicals, as do most household cleaning products (including those that are supposedly safer)... peroxide is a caustic chemical, folks. To my mind, a drop or two of this serum on my face, neck and chest every day is no worse--and probably a lot safer to use--than many, many other things. Have you seen the chemical listings for sunscreen? It&#x27;s a personal choice. Yours might differ from mine.to use--than many, many other things. Have you seen the chemical listings for sunscreen?

            <li> With a few wrinkles appearing and my gently aging skin drying out a bit, I am always excited to try new facial care products. This concentrate sounded very promising as my skin can be a bit sensitive at times, and the ingredients sound beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for about a week, always in the evening after a shower. After lightly towel drying my face, I would apply the product on my entire face and neck.  I found that my skin felt very tight and not at all moisturized after using. I do understand that this is supposed to go on before a moisturizer, but it seemed like it worked counter-intuitively with the follow-up moisturizer. I finally stopped using it after it made my undereyes sting when using my favorite organic undereye product (Ginzing). I really dont understand that kind chemical reaction when using an organic product, and therefore cannot recommend this concentrate.</li>
            <li> I must say, for a spa product to splurge on I have been pretty happy with this. I live in an extremely arid area and since I&#x27;ve used this in addition to my moisturizer my skin is looking good: bright, no little skin bumps or flakes &amp; soft to the touch. ie. I no longer look papery and dried out from the ill effects of winter weather and the arid Wyoming plains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the item is also devoid of any scent of any kind is another huge plus, they really did go out of their way, it seems to provide a decent sensitive skin product that avoids any possibility of allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that this product plays well with other products with no weird chemical clash, which can result in some unpleasantness. I have used this with both my moisturizer and a variety of sunscreens with no problems. I have really got to respect that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do intend to keep this product in with my facial repertoire.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several \\&quot;redness\\&quot; serums and creams and while most felt good, they didn&#x27;t do much of the redness.  This is no miracle worker, but it is better than any of the others including my last favorite, Clinique&#x27;s Redness Solutions cream.  The Ainhoa knocks down the redness a little more, absorbs quickly and hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs (been using it for over a month now).  I have not seen any overall improvement - the effect seems to last only when it&#x27;s on.  But I&#x27;ll take whatever I can get - even if it is only temporary!</li>
            <li> I should have known better, but the \\&quot;high quality ingredients\\&quot; made me think this would be okay. However, when it arrived and I read the label, an extensive list of chemicals including those known to be irritating such as parabens and propylene glycol (that&#x27;s antifreeze, used as an airplane de-icer...look it up), I realized I should have just stuck with what I know to be made of real ingredients, not chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the description and claim by the manufacturer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Senskin products are based on the extraordinary hydrating, nutritive and regenerating properties of different components such as Azulene, Decongestive Plant Extracts and Oat Extract.&lt;br /&gt;This range carries no fragrance or artificial colors, with preservatives reduced to a minimum and all raw materials have been tested in such a way that the final products are essentially hypoallergenic.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that they&#x27;re marketing this as good for sensitive skin blows me away - most folks with sensitive skin cannot tolerate parabens, antifreeze de-icer isn&#x27;t something I want to rub into my sensitive skin, and most likely many of the other chemicals in this mix are things I would want to avoid if I were to look each one up (just the parabens and propylene glycol were enough to put me off the product). Also, anything from plants must be so highly processed and such a tiny amount, there are a few listings at the bottom of extracts, one chamomile and the other corn flower. However, if you read on the environmental working group&#x27;s website they clearly inform you that on an ingredients list, those items at the top are what it&#x27;s mostly made of, and the list goes down from most to least. So with propylene glycol at the top, parabens in two places in the middle and the supposed extracts at the very bottom, this stuff is not what their marketing is claiming it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YUCK!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see the results of this product.  It didn&#x27;t live up to all its fabulous claims.  But then again, most skin care products don&#x27;t.  I was pleased that there was no noticeable smell, and it did no harm to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting bouts of adult acne due to a hormonal imbalance I am experiencing recently. I&#x27;ve been treating my skin with acne products only to find that it is red, flaky with dryness and irritated.  I started using this under my daily moisturizer and I have found that it soothes my irritation and lets my other products do their job without further irritating me.  I find it to be a little cooling and soaks in smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. It feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I always thought I had normal aging skin. This product did not feel good on it. I stuck with it for a month and found little or no change in my skin. I also didn&#x27;t like the smell that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the ingredients were not so hot, but I risked them for 30 days. Most of all, though, was the fact that no discernible change occured. I&#x27;m sure others had a better experience. Each person&#x27;s skin has its own signature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had much better results from Mtn. Rose Herbs special Classic Rose Facial Oil. It has no chemicals and every ingredient is organic.</li>
            <li> I used this product on one half of my face and used my normal (natural) skin cream on the other half.  In terms of the response, it was the same.  I did not see any change.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product.  I liked the smell and the silky feel of it.  It is light and does not have a strong odor or a sticky feel to it.  AND.... it is substantially more expensive than the high quality cream I use on my face with exactly the same results.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, react and break out easily.  It is also winter time and my skin is very dry and more fussy this time of year. I must say, this product did not irritate my skin, which was a huge bonus.  There was no stinging, burning or added redness after applying. I use before bedtime.  It absorbs quickly, not greasy and my skin does feel smooth.  However, even though it hasn&#x27;t made anything worse, I haven&#x27;t really seen an improvement.  So I&#x27;m stuck in neutral about this product.  I&#x27;m a little disturbed by the ingredients and despite the fact that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d spend the money on this one.  There is much debate about parabens; however, no effective direct links between parabens and cancer have been established.  Nonetheless, this product has them.  All in all, my skin does feel good, hasn&#x27;t dried out and is smooth, but the overall appearance hasn&#x27;t changed, but it also hasn&#x27;t worsened.</li>
            <li> This lotion comes with a nice, working pump, which dispenses a thin line of the pearlescent moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered from terrible wind burn during this past snow blizzard. Besides dry, chapped lips, my face was red, dry and flakey. Indoors was no better, with the furnace drying the air further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If ever I needed a skin product that really soothed and brought skin back to normal, it was now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything for chapped lips on my seriously chapped lips to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comforting lotion feels good on application. My lips showed great improvement within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flakes started diminishing and my hot wind burned skin took on it&#x27;s normal color after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is now back to normal thanks to this rapidly working, serious fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did wonders for me and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Some nights, I just want a nice, light-feeling moisturizing product that feels like it is hydrating my skin. My skin is very sensitive--using medium-to-heavy products for more than a couple of days usually winds up breaking me out and causing clogging/problems. So far, this serum has done a great job. It has a light, smooth feel and goes on very silkily. If you do have sensitive skin and are seeking something to help, this might well be worth a try. It is a bit pricey, but I&#x27;ve paid more at the cosmetic counter for so-so results. Personally, I find that rotating some quality products like this works best for me. For my use, it&#x27;s definitely 5-star.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this serum. I have sensitive skin and this sounded like a gentle and natural fluid.  The write up mentions that it contains marigold, camomile and lime tree extracts but doesn&#x27;t mention all the chemical components. It has a fairly long ingredient label and also contains: Water, cyclopentasoliane, proplyene glycol, polyacrylaminde, dimethicone polysorbate 40 and goes on and on with chemical components.  After using it for a week and ended up getting a rash so I stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other serums I use, Jurlique herbal recovery gel and Ole Henriksen Truth Serum, are both much more natural, with more herbal ingredients and less chemicals and work really well with my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this facial fluid.</li>
            <li> This lotion is light and absorbs quickly--no greasy look and it left my skin feeling very silky. It contains many natural ingredients BUT also has parabens which I try to avoid.  For that reason I would not use it again.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  It is very dry and I have a lot of allergies.  This product does provide some moisture but I did not feel that it \\&quot;calmed\\&quot; my face.  I felt a little irritated in the evenings after I had put it on in the morning.  It&#x27;s really hard to find good soothing creams and serums for the sensitive face, even from the dermatologist.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say the benefits outweigh the cost on this one.  It is very nicely packaged and feels and looks very high end in its presentation I will say.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Dead Sea cosmetic products and have used Ahava, Avani and Swissa. My favorites are their eye gels or emulsions, which are very light, yet very effective, firming and long lasting. If you&#x27;ve visited the malls, you know they cost you an arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;So this AINHOA emulsion feels just like the above. A little goes a long way. My skin loves this light, fast absorbing and long lasting serum. Totally hypoallergenic - is that the right word. Well you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit - I don&#x27;t know about ingredients in standard facial products.  But I suffer from fatty pockets under my eyes that look like white spots.  Nothing, and I mean nothing I&#x27;ve found has helped eliminate them.  This works.  I decided to try it because it was supposed to help reduce redness, and this is a great side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it is an expensive cream, but if it helps reduce the fatty pockets I&#x27;m willing to try it, since I haven&#x27;t (yet) noticed any negative side effects.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial skin serum.  No irritation, no itching, not oily - just softness.  I really enjoyed this product as I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use many skin care items.  This was an excellent find.</li>
            <li> I tried the concentrate for about a week. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. In fact, it would temporarily turn red for a few minutes after applying the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary...</li>
            <li> Got this product for my wife (in her 40&#x27;s) - her skin is sensitive and tends to be dry due to regular use of Retin-A. She liked this serum because is moisturized well, without irritation, but needed another layer of face cream on top of it. Also good as a stand-alone eye cream.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, and I needed a lotion/serum that could moisturize while providing the best ingredients possible to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AINHOA Senskin Sensitive Skin Concentrate boasts that it is/will:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calm and Restorative&lt;br /&gt;Relaxes Irritated skin&lt;br /&gt;Reduces Redness&lt;br /&gt;Revitalizes and Renews&lt;br /&gt;Hydrating and Replenishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing. It soaked in quickly and left my skin very very dry, it did nothing to reduce any redness, and in fact my skin felt irritated after using it. It is not moisturizing what so ever. I am not sure what it does at all. I had to go behind it and use another lotion.</li>
            <li> I will never use this product again.  Supposedly for sensitive skin, I put a small amount on my face, and felt no tingling or burning initially.  An hour later, my skin was burning.  It actually woke me from sleep.  Fortunately, I dabbed only a small amount around my chin.  This may make your skin soft, but for me, it&#x27;s not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great!  It goes on super smooth and does not leave behind a greasy film. I have seen a noticeable difference in the amount of dryness in my skin since I have been using this item.  My only complaint is the design of the bottle.  The way the tube is made makes it impossible to see how much of the product is left. Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> I get redder around my nose than the rest of my face so I was more then happy to try a lotion that promised to reduce that redness. When I first put the lotion on I was impressed with the non-greasy feel and the lack of fragrances. I personally like that frou frou smell in my grooming items, but such additions would not be good for sensitive skin. The lotion went on with a smooth coolness that felt good on my skin, but once it was dry a few minutes later, my nose didn&#x27;t appear to be much less red. I used it for a week and found although it seemed to calm the redness in my skin down a bit, it wasn&#x27;t a miracle product that had me oohing and ahhing, and for the price, it should make we want to do flips. I&#x27;ll use the product until it&#x27;s gone, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> I liked it well enough, but it didn&#x27;t really do anything amazing for my skin. Actually, NOTHING seems to work any miracles. I have tried cheaper stuff, more expensive stuff (Dermalogica usually), cocoa and shea butter, olive oil, and nothing really seems to change my skin a whole lot. It isn&#x27;t super dry, but has spots that definitely need moisture. Honestly (and this is going to sound weird,) vaseline has worked as well as anything else. Yes, the greasy slimy stuff. Left on overnight is one of the few products I have found that seems to make my eye area nicer the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to give this a very mediocre review, but figured maybe I was expecting too much. So I used this for a few days on one side of my face only. I didn&#x27;t seem to feel any difference whatsoever, BUT! I asked my husband to touch both sides of my face to see if he noticed any difference between the two. And he (after one touch on each) immediately picked the side where I used this. So it must do more than I thought! So I don&#x27;t think I can dismiss it so quickly after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using the rest of the bottle and see if it works even better. I think the price is higher, but it is comparable to even items from a supermarket (some of those little tubes are very expensive per ounce!) I will update my review if I change my mind, but right now, I am leaning toward getting it again (especially from my husband&#x27;s rating!)</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different. That means not every product will work the same for everyone. That said, this product did absolutely nothing for my skin--good, bad, or otherwise--in the 6 weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive, which is why I&#x27;m cautious when it comes to facial care products. In fact, my facial care routine generally consists of fresh aloe gel, maybe a spritz of rose water, for my moisturizer because most other things will dry my skin out too badly or hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I used this, I braced myself for stinging pain and possibly a rash or breakout afterward, but neither happened. That made me smile. So, I decided I would faithfully use it for at least four weeks and note any changes to my skin&#x27;s appearance and texture. Six weeks later and nothing. In my book, that&#x27;s good (not great, just good). But at the asking price, I&#x27;d stick to something that already works for me and is free (or nearly free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container in which it comes is lovely, but could easily mislead a consumer into thinking she&#x27;s getting more product than is actually in there (it&#x27;s a double-walled frosted container) and it&#x27;s impossible to gauge the amount remaining because the interior wall is opaque. That said, a little does go a long way--to cover my entire face only required two pumps--and using only two pumps twice daily (morning and evening), the entire container lasted six weeks. YMMV.</li>
            <li> I must admit I haven&#x27;t used this product. I read what I could about it before ordering it and once it arrived and I looked at the ingredients list, I was appalled because the company touted it as being another \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has all the types of parabens women with, or previously had, breast cancer should avoid! It has been awhile since I have come across a product that still uses these preservatives. It&#x27;s the reason I quit looking at products in professional hair salons. When will they stop? I know several breast cancer victims who avoid the parabens like the plague!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have come to the conclusion that just because it says natural it is rarely the case! Better off just to look for the organic versions.</li>
            <li> This is just hyaluronic acid, there are a million brands of it available at better prices than this one.</li>
            <li> I would not call this product \\&quot;hydrating and replenishing\\&quot;.  I have been using this product, along with the Purifying Fluid, for approximately 2 weeks and starting with somewhat dry skin, feels as though it is dryer than before.  I have noticed no difference in the \\&quot;expression\\&quot; lines on my face.  I do not have any real skin problems so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of reducing acne or other issues.  I am going to stop using this and go back to Oil of Olay</li>
