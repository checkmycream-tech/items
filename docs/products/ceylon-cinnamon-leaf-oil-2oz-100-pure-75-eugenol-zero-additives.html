            <li>Great product, many uses!  </li>
            <li>An excellent product at a fair price delivered right on time.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cinnamon oil and eugenol are effective snake and cat repellents.</li>
            <li>Excellent as a natural disinfectant and so much more!</li>
            <li>Not working that well plus very strong smell</li>
            <li>I do love all of Cinnamon Vogue products.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Well, the ants love it.  </li>
            <li>Most of the eugenol in cinnamon is in the leaves.</li>
            <li>Most cinnamon used in foods and to make cinnamon oil is from Cinnamomum cassia.</li>
            <li>C. verum is rarer and more expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Burns more than any Listerine too</li>
            <li>So many uses for this and the scent lasts a longtime.</li>
            <li>I also made sure to wash my shirts/pijamas in hot water after just one use, to make sure I wasn&#x27;t re-infecting anywhere else)</li>
            <li>works well - blade fit</li>
            <li>Also great oil for pedicures especially if you always wear socks.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>You just have to find the main ant entrance (the queen&#x27;s location) to effectively eradicate them.  </li>
            <li>I first rubbed organic, unrefined coconut oil and then sprayed the cinnamon on top of that.</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell for fungus seems very effective at keeping things dry.</li>
            <li>From what I know it is true cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon\\&quot; means Cinnamomum verum, or \\&quot;true cinnamon\\&quot;, from Sri Lanka (which used to be called Ceylon).</li>
            <li>C. cassia is no less real or true cinnamon than C. verum; it just doesn&#x27;t happen to have the word \\&quot;verum\\&quot;, which means \\&quot;true\\&quot; or \\&quot;real\\&quot;, in its scientific name.</li>
            <li>but so worth</li>
            <li>Did the trick - now to find other good purposes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly use this seller again!</li>
            <li>I have been taking this for 2 months and saw parasites leave my body and after HERXing I have only continued to quickly see all of my symptoms going away!!</li>
            <li>Read up on cinnamon before taking internally and only take alone, but this is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>also, have a chaser of water ready!</li>
            <li>The label says, \\&quot;Pure Ceylon Cinnamon Leaf Oil With 75% Eugenol</li>
            <li>I decided to try ceylon cinnamon leaf oil after much reading.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>I only used the product twice and its really a powerful smell, kept me awake all night; so stopped.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to purchase a new jig saw</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing , it killed all our little ants</li>
            <li>I bought this expensive snake oil because it was advertised as a sure fire way to safely rid my kitchen of black ants.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> An excellent product at a fair price delivered right on time. I&#x27;ll certainly use this seller again!</li>
            <li> Helps with candida. Great taste and this seller is very good.</li>
            <li> I had a spot of ringworm on my back and I didn&#x27;t want to use OTC creams as they contain harsh chemicals, so I decided to try ceylon cinnamon leaf oil after much reading. I first rubbed organic, unrefined coconut oil and then sprayed the cinnamon on top of that. With the coconut oil it didn&#x27;t burn my skin, but I could definitely feel it working on the red fungal patch. (It seemed to help to let it airdry uncovered for a while after applying. I also made sure to wash my shirts/pijamas in hot water after just one use, to make sure I wasn&#x27;t re-infecting anywhere else) After a week and a half (using once a day) what was an ugly, red, raised patch is gone, but I&#x27;m going to use for just a few more days to be completely sure. I would definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. I am using this to treat toenail fungus and it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> This cinnamon oil is really good! I use it internally and it doesn&#x27;t burn or make my stomach feel weird.</li>
            <li> Excellent as a natural disinfectant and so much more! I have been using this for about 6 months, with great results. I&#x27;ve also used it as an insect repellent, mouthwash, and added it to lotions and other oils to help with circulation and massage. Check their website for additional uses. I will buy this again when I need to replace. 2 ozs will last me about a year because I  still have about half left.</li>
            <li> I do love all of Cinnamon Vogue products. From what I know it is true cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I used this product, after diluting some of it, to kill ants in my brother&#x27;s house.  It&#x27;s very good for deterring ants.  You just have to find the main ant entrance (the queen&#x27;s location) to effectively eradicate them.  I love the smell.  It is very powerful.  I also used a dab to brush my teeth.  WOW!!!  Very refreshing.  Be careful to only use a tiny, tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it as a mosquito deterrent.  You have to be very careful of the ratio of the oil to water.  A few  drops in a 20 oz. bottle of water and spray on your extremities.  Acts as a very good deterrent for flies and mosquitos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the real cinnamon oil - I got it on the recommendation of my doctor to help with a pesky case of ringworm on my leg. Did the trick - now to find other good purposes.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations!  Wonderful product doesn&#x27;t get better than this, 5 star product which I recommend this product to those who demand quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this expensive snake oil because it was advertised as a sure fire way to safely rid my kitchen of black ants.  Well, the ants love it.  They have told all their friends and now I&#x27;m infested with ants.  I must have misunderstood.  I thought the ad said it eliminates ants, not attracts them by the hundreds!</li>
            <li> I only used the product twice and its really a powerful smell, kept me awake all night; so stopped. Dont know what the results would have been because have not used it consecutively.</li>
            <li> works well - blade fit so I didn&#x27;t have to purchase a new jig saw</li>
            <li> This oil has a very nice fragrance. The label says, \\&quot;Pure Ceylon Cinnamon Leaf Oil With 75% Eugenol Content\\&quot;. \\&quot;Ceylon Cinnamon\\&quot; means Cinnamomum verum, or \\&quot;true cinnamon\\&quot;, from Sri Lanka (which used to be called Ceylon). I&#x27;m assuming \\&quot;Cinnamon Leaf Oil\\&quot; means it was made from the leaves and not the bark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil smells a little like cloves due to the high eugenol content. Most of the eugenol in cinnamon is in the leaves. Cinnamon oil made from bark has a lot lower eugenol content. Ceylon cinnamon oil made from cinnamon bark, which I haven&#x27;t tried yet, might have a different fragrance than oil made from leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several different kinds of cinnamon trees used to make cinnamon. Most cinnamon used in foods and to make cinnamon oil is from Cinnamomum cassia. C. cassia is no less real or true cinnamon than C. verum; it just doesn&#x27;t happen to have the word \\&quot;verum\\&quot;, which means \\&quot;true\\&quot; or \\&quot;real\\&quot;, in its scientific name. C. cassia also has a very nice fragrance and flavor. C. verum is rarer and more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamon oil and eugenol are effective snake and cat repellents. So if you try this oil and your cat gets cranky or your snake leaves this might be why. Dogs and deer don&#x27;t like it either.</li>
            <li> Knocks out bad breath better than any Listerine I&#x27;ve ever bought. WARNING: Burns more than any Listerine too but so worth it just dilute it to your preference (Trial and error). Also great oil for pedicures especially if you always wear socks. I also use it to increase blood flow to the scalp to stimulate hair growth before a shampoo. Does wonders!</li>
            <li> Works&lt;br /&gt;Removed fungus from big toe nail</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing , it killed all our little ants</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this, but I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> So many uses for this and the scent lasts a longtime. Also used for keeping ants away!!</li>
            <li> I had read about how small doses(taken with NO other vitamins or medications, or people with liver problems), 1-3 drops a day for 2 1/2 months, could help eliminate tick born illnesses, fungus, parasites, etc,... I was diagnoses with Lymes disease and anaplasmosis and was on antibiotics for 2 months.  I still had symptoms!  I have been taking this for 2 months and saw parasites leave my body and after HERXing I have only continued to quickly see all of my symptoms going away!! Great product, many uses!  Read up on cinnamon before taking internally and only take alone, but this is amazing!  Put lanolin or chap stick on before you drop in mouth!  It is a burning oil!  also, have a chaser of water ready!</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work on ants.  Didn&#x27;t think that it would, and it does not.  Back to using salt, which makes a mess, but it works.</li>
            <li> Not working that well plus very strong smell</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell for fungus seems very effective at keeping things dry.</li>
