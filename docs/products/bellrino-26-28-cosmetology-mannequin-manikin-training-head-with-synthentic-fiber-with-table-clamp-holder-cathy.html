            <li>Pretty good for styling, I would be scared to use heat on it.</li>
            <li>and I want my money like seriously do not buy! !!!</li>
            <li>My niece absolutely loved it and has already learned how to fishbone braid at 9 years old</li>
            <li>The head is very stable on the stand and attaches very securely to any table.</li>
            <li>The hair feels very real and is easy to style and comb.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for up dos and such.</li>
            <li>13 year old daughter likes to practice different braiding hair styles and the mannequin is great for this</li>
            <li>It is good for training , but the hair seems to be not natural and i cannot do curly, the hair is very stright ...</li>
            <li>Full head of hair and parts realisticly.</li>
            <li>but it has been thoroughly brushed, combed, braided, clipped, and put through the ringer by an eager little girl with special needs and has held up beautifully.  </li>
            <li>My grandson who plans to go to cosmetology school when he graduates, just love it &amp; uses daily</li>
            <li>but I think the color it is, is pretty.</li>
            <li>When we first got it the hair was super soft and she had no problem braiding it.</li>
            <li>The only real downside is that it will NOT hold any type of curl, so if that is important to you, get another mannequin.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves this mannequin.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as pictured and she loves playing with it and learning new braiding techniques.  </li>
            <li>but it left her hair feeling funny.</li>
            <li>So much more fun, less expensive, and a far better value than any toy styling head designed for children on the market.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 9 year old for Christmas because she loves doing hair.  </li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter loves it.</li>

            <li>The company&#x27;s service was good but the product is of very poor quality</li>
            <li>So far it has held up well with daily use from a 6 year old.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old has gotten a lot of use out of this as she experiments with braiding and such.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this as a gift for my 11 year old niece because she loves to style and braid hair.</li>

            <li> I tried to use my flat iron on her</li>
            <li> you can curl it flat iron</li>
            <li> I bought this just to practice braids, it is a bit difficult to brush and quite a bit of hair come out, but will work just fine for my needs.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and shiny but isn&#x27;t very thick which is why i only gave it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> The stand holds the head firmly in place and she can brush harder with no fear of it coming loose.  </li>
            <li> Just a heads up the hair is like a dark brown/red color.</li>
            <li> After a few days of braiding the hair started getting tangled and the hair kept falling</li>
            <li> *** definitely not easy to cutt</li>
            <li> i usually don&#x27;t write any reviews on amazon but for this product I had to.</li>
            <li> I honestly never had to write a negative review on amazon before</li>
            <li> and i bought thisto practice with and The hair quality was so s***ty felt so FAKE!</li>

            <li> NOT  get this product because you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hated it the hair got too tangled</li>
            <li> The hair is very bad quality after using it for 4-5 days and I would not recommend for anyone spending 30 dollars on a product like this.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s nice for up dos and such. I tried to use my flat iron on her but it left her hair feeling funny. Although it says you can heat I wouldn&#x27;t. If your looking for a doll for blow outs or to curl I&#x27;d recommend a human hair doll.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Just as described! My daughter loved this item :)</li>
            <li> My niece absolutely loved it and has already learned how to fishbone braid at 9 years old</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves to braid hair. This was perfect. She has come up with so many ideas and use it for many hours at a time.</li>
            <li> The doll is wonderful. I just got mine today and I can&#x27;t stop playing with it. Just a heads up the hair is like a dark brown/red color. It was not the color I was expecting but I think the color it is, is pretty.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. My daughter loves it but hair falls out bad.</li>
            <li> Very fake hair. Cannot use heat. Tangles very easily</li>
            <li> My 10 year old has gotten a lot of use out of this as she experiments with braiding and such.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it one day.. And the hair is already falling out! Its everywhere!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old for Christmas because she loves doing hair.  It looks exactly as pictured and she loves playing with it and learning new braiding techniques.  The stand holds the head firmly in place and she can brush harder with no fear of it coming loose.  I&#x27;ve read reviews complaining about the hair holding up under heat, but I cannot comment on that because she only brushes and styles it, no curling or straightening.  She&#x27;s very happy with it, so I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my granddaughter to practice fancy braiding.  She loves it and we all take turns combing and styling hair.  Full head of hair and parts realisticly.</li>
            <li> I love the hair on this you can curl it flat iron it and more i like it. It was sent how j want it and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> Perfect for the young person wanting to learn and experiment with hair styles.</li>
            <li> It is good for training , but the hair seems to be not natural and i cannot do curly, the hair is very stright ...</li>
            <li> 13 year old daughter likes to practice different braiding hair styles and the mannequin is great for this</li>
            <li> I actually bought this as a gift for my 11 year old niece because she loves to style and braid hair. The head is very stable on the stand and attaches very securely to any table. The hair feels very real and is easy to style and comb.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I did not buy it for the purpose it is actually intended but it has been thoroughly brushed, combed, braided, clipped, and put through the ringer by an eager little girl with special needs and has held up beautifully.  So much more fun, less expensive, and a far better value than any toy styling head designed for children on the market.  Best gift ever.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a Christmas gift. So far it has held up well with daily use from a 6 year old. The hair is soft and shiny but isn&#x27;t very thick which is why i only gave it 4 stars.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to matter to my daughter. If you are looking for one for your child then this is a great purchase! Especially for the price!!! The table clamp works perfectly too.</li>
            <li> I honestly never had to write a negative review on amazon before but this is Totally not what i wanted. I am a hair dresser and i bought thisto practice with and The hair quality was so s***ty felt so FAKE! Wtf! im extremly pissed off and I want my money like seriously do not buy! !!! And*** definitely not easy to cutt***</li>
            <li> I bought  this for my granddaughter who is a Hair dresser so she could practice braiding techniques, and she is very happy with it.</li>

            <li> Hated it the hair got too tangled</li>
            <li> i usually don&#x27;t write any reviews on amazon but for this product I had to. My 12 year old daughter loves to learn and do braids on dolls so we decided to get this head for her. When we first got it the hair was super soft and she had no problem braiding it. After a few days of braiding the hair started getting tangled and the hair kept falling and she couldn&#x27;t even do one braid on it. I am telling you DO NOT  get this product because you will be disappointed. The hair is very bad quality after using it for 4-5 days and I would not recommend for anyone spending 30 dollars on a product like this.</li>
            <li> Like real!!!! My daughter loved it!!</li>
