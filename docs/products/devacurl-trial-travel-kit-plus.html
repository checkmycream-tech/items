            <li>I&#x27;m using the Organix Keratin Treatment shampoo and conditioner right now and get great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Organix Coconut Milk serum, but just switched to Organix Argan OIl of Morocco dry body oil because I heard argan oil is great for smoothing frizz and just great for your hair....</li>
            <li>The leave in conditioner is nothing more than conditioner in a spray bottle, well I can go by a cheaper conditioner and put it in a spray bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The book also gives suggestions on care for various kinds of curls and the steps suggested made my hair look the best it ever has.</li>
            <li>- so it has been interesting to learn more and improve my technique.&lt;br</li>

            <li>My hair looked sexy :-)</li>

            <li>gel is the magic.</li>
            <li>The book and DVD are critical to understanding how to use the Deva products to get your best curly hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t love this product</li>
            <li>Love deva curl</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had my hair look better</li>
            <li>I am in love with my hair, once again.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel so confident of the way I look.</li>
            <li>When I follow the directions to a T, I get perfect curls, which people comment on all day long.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but the Poo-Free Cleanser leaves your hair feeling clean but not dry, the condition is just the perfect amount of hydration.</li>
            <li>I loved the whole package.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love deva curl, the book the trial/travel kit came with was very informative, will continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li>The problem when I first tried the DevaCurl gel was that I didn&#x27;t know how to use it right... and there is so much more to getting nice, smooth, curls than just throwing in the gel.</li>
            <li>I also like the Light Defining Gel</li>
            <li>Fantastic packaging.</li>
            <li>This makes a great gift for anyone starting out with the curly hair method.</li>
            <li>shampoo and conditioner are nice, but you can find other products (the book also teaches you how to find good products for your hair - which ingredients to look for and which to avoid, etc.)</li>
            <li>Love everything about the DevaCurl line and this travel kit was great to decide if I liked the line enough to invest in the larger bottles.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t notice a significant impact on my curls, either.  </li>
            <li>The spray oil is not my favorite as it can feel oily and makes me want to wash more frequently.</li>
            <li>No other &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hair products available at the grocery store (and I&#x27;ve tried sooo many over the years) could ever contain my used-to-be-unmanageable hair like DevaCurl does!</li>
            <li>Bought this to have all four without breaking my wallet, but will be buying full size bottles before these run out.</li>
            <li>I have since ordered full sizes of all these products.  </li>
            <li>helped my hair curl up more and look really</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much difference in this product compared to many others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Best of all, no more frizz!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it for my hair to finally look good without  2 hours of straightening</li>
            <li>The most amazing thing in this kit it is the curly handbook, very helpful, especially when you are a beginner.  </li>
            <li>Although I usually don&#x27;t ever &#x27;buy into&#x27; fad hair products, I heard great reviews of this and found out that the shampoo is Poo Free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back in the Deva shop to look for more products now that I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li>This kit was definitely worth it for the book and the bottles.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of tips and stories of people who learned how to love their naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Becoming a true Curly Girl actually takes practice with the techniques and products.  </li>
            <li>Try it if you always feel ;ike your natural curls look messy-made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I asked her exactly how she did it, and she told me all about DevaCurl, which she learned about from her hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, I can safely toss the 46 bottles of shampoos, conditioners, gels, and everything else and simply have these four bottles to take care of my hair for the rest of my days.  </li>
            <li>this would have been my first time using.</li>
            <li>A couple hours later (at work), when my hair was dry, it looked amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another tip is, if you have long curly hair like mine, you might need to get some of the length cut off of your top layer of hair.</li>
            <li>I was not a fan of the no lather shampoo, without the lather she tended to overdo how much she needed.</li>
            <li>If someone feels they have straight hair...</li>
            <li>thanks Deva Curl</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having the DVD and book was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>This will not make your straight hair curly.  </li>
            <li>and I realize I have so much to learn about taking care of my wavy/swavy hair</li>
            <li>Her hair is just like mine; very curly (Botticelli curls - who knew??)</li>
            <li>I could not get over how fantastic she looked with these luscious curls framing her face, and I complemented her numerous times.  </li>
            <li>This was someone I have known over 25 years, and I was simply stunned as to how fantastic her hair looked.  </li>
            <li>Trying out the travel size allowed me to decide which products I really needed.</li>
            <li>I just switched hair stylists to one who is really good with curly hair (and it doesn&#x27;t have to be a super expensive stylist either), and just taking off that weight</li>
            <li>Have fought my curls more than half my existence.</li>
            <li>My hair actually looked better the second day.  </li>
            <li>, my hair is healthier than it has been in years and my color stays vibrant and hasn&#x27;t faded.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely buying more for myself and for my friends who have the same &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; with their curly hair.</li>
            <li>Found the odour of the products are highly chemical, my husband described &amp;#34;like a permanent.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting and reading the Curly Girl book (included with this kit) if you are trying the line cause</li>
            <li>You really need SOME natural wave or curl for this to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The book that came with this was helpful and useful, but that was the only item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The no-poo and conditioner are nice and thick, so I could get away with diluting them because I have wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I smartly read the &#x27;Curly Girl&#x27; book that came with this trial sized kit, and read how I should be washing my hair, drying my hair, and in general, how to not look like a pot scrubber gone awry!!  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great kit, expensive but if anything I would go for the conditioner and gel only and continue my baking-soda poo free routine and no oil.</li>
            <li>The moisture lock spray was new to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Watch some videos if you are new to Deva Curl to learn the process.  </li>
            <li>this will prove their hair is naturally wavy or curly!</li>
            <li>The Curly Girl book and bonus DVD were just what I needed to become one with my natural curls!  </li>
            <li>But, as soon as you shake your hair out (wait til it&#x27;s completely dry first!)</li>
            <li>It was soft not stiff or oily!</li>
            <li>glad I only bought the trial and not full version, otherwise my pockets would have been hurting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since refilled it from the large bottles to lend to friends who want to try and get in touch with their inner curly girl.  </li>
            <li>I urge anyone with natural curls to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>This is a brand that gives my wavy hair bounce with soft, shiny waves.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to commit to  regular size devacurl products especially BC</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s some major tips in there</li>
            <li>She is biracial and has very kinky curly hair, that tends to remain very dry.</li>
            <li>The first day I used this, it was raining -- my hair was still wet when I left the house for work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of gel that leaves your hair crunchy, but it was worth a try.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend getting and reading the Curly Girl book (included with this kit) if you are trying the line cause</li>
            <li> You really need SOME natural wave or curl for this to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The book that came with this was helpful and useful, but that was the only item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The no-poo and conditioner are nice and thick, so I could get away with diluting them because I have wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I smartly read the &#x27;Curly Girl&#x27; book that came with this trial sized kit, and read how I should be washing my hair, drying my hair, and in general, how to not look like a pot scrubber gone awry!!  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great kit, expensive but if anything I would go for the conditioner and gel only and continue my baking-soda poo free routine and no oil.</li>
            <li> The moisture lock spray was new to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Watch some videos if you are new to Deva Curl to learn the process.  </li>
            <li> this will prove their hair is naturally wavy or curly!</li>
            <li> The Curly Girl book and bonus DVD were just what I needed to become one with my natural curls!  </li>
            <li> But, as soon as you shake your hair out (wait til it&#x27;s completely dry first!)</li>
            <li> It was soft not stiff or oily!</li>
            <li> glad I only bought the trial and not full version, otherwise my pockets would have been hurting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since refilled it from the large bottles to lend to friends who want to try and get in touch with their inner curly girl.  </li>
            <li> I urge anyone with natural curls to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> This is a brand that gives my wavy hair bounce with soft, shiny waves.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to commit to  regular size devacurl products especially BC</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s some major tips in there</li>
            <li> She is biracial and has very kinky curly hair, that tends to remain very dry.</li>
            <li> The first day I used this, it was raining -- my hair was still wet when I left the house for work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of gel that leaves your hair crunchy, but it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> It freaked me out at first because you put a ton of it in your hair and, when it dries, it dries hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I am no longer a slave to the hair dryer and flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> and/or give your curls a few scrunches with your hands, your curls come out soft and defined with no crunch and no frizz!</li>
            <li> After 30 something years of trying sooo hard to straighten my hair to &amp;#34;fit in&amp;#34; I have finally had enough and I have decided to finally embrace my naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I like the haircare products well enough, but there are a lot more less expensive alternatives out there.</li>
            <li> and I actually liked the scent even though there were some bad reviews about it.</li>
            <li> Definitely not soft; could not run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> A couple of my friends have been trying to get me to use DevaCurl for my curly hair for a long time now.</li>
            <li> I dilute the leave-in conditioner b/c its much too thick.</li>
            <li> wish I had tried earlier and not been scared away by the comments about scents from other reviewers.</li>
            <li> However, it did leave a tacky &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; in my loose waves.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try them because reviews mentioned that the products had strong scents, and one even said they smelled like pine cleaners.  </li>
            <li> Even my stylist was shocked since I started using Deva Curl at how much better my color looks between visits.  </li>
            <li> But I finally got tired of fighting with my hair (taming the frizz, but keeping it soft and curly and not crunchy)</li>
            <li> DevaCurl products worked for my 2b hair, and a little of all the products went a long way for me.</li>
            <li> It was hard to judge if she had enough.</li>
            <li> I literally came home from dinner with her, sat myself down at Amazon, and ordered the trial kit to &#x27;play with.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> I typically have problems tolerating</li>
            <li> It defined my curls, there was no frizz, and I did not have to spray it in place with a half can of hairspray to keep it from flying away.  </li>
            <li> This product brought out the curl in my hair without weighing it down, making it stiff, sticky, or oily looking.  </li>
            <li> I used a little of the spray and scruntched before misting in the shower to reset the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This time I will save the little travel sized bottles and fill them myself when I travel.</li>
            <li> After doing a little research, I found this product</li>
            <li> also like having the little bottle of the &amp;#34;Set it free&amp;#34; spray for spritzing up (then shaking out)</li>
            <li> and she has always straightened it to try and tame it.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair and have been using Ouidad for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, curly hair and do not blow dry.</li>
            <li> Sephora stopped carrying Ouidad at their retail stores, I ran out of my usual products, and decided to order a DevaCurl trial kit.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, I asked her if I could get this through Amazon (she is as addicted to Amazon as I am!!), and she urged me to take a look.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love devacurl products!! The best part of the kit was the book. Excellent tips on making your curls look their best and lots of DIY hair products that actually work. I dilute the leave-in conditioner b/c its much too thick.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this product to me for my daughters hair. She is biracial and has very kinky curly hair, that tends to remain very dry. She uses DevaCurl in her salon and swears by it. However, it did not work in my daughters hair. I was not a fan of the no lather shampoo, without the lather she tended to overdo how much she needed. It was hard to judge if she had enough. The leave in conditioner is nothing more than conditioner in a spray bottle, well I can go by a cheaper conditioner and put it in a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book that came with this was helpful and useful, but that was the only item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I only bought the trial and not full version, otherwise my pockets would have been hurting.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter kit.  It has the components for every hair type.  If someone feels they have straight hair...this will prove their hair is naturally wavy or curly!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. My curls are hydrated,  and 100% renewed. I&#x27;m very happy, so happy I purchased everything in its full size....thanks Deva Curl</li>
            <li> did not work on my hair.</li>
            <li> DevaCurl products worked for my 2b hair, and a little of all the products went a long way for me. However, it did leave a tacky &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; in my loose waves. Definitely not soft; could not run my fingers through it. I did like the smell, though. I won&#x27;t be buying again, but it was a relatively inexpensive way to see if these products would work for me.</li>
            <li> All the products are great. The moisture lock spray was new to me. It is terrific. I have thin, curly hair and do not blow dry. It gave me some hold without crunchiness, even in hat weather (-1 here ) and moisture without weight. Great way to try the Deva Curl line. The book also gives suggestions on care for various kinds of curls and the steps suggested made my hair look the best it ever has. Try it if you always feel ;ike your natural curls look messy-made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li> The Curly Girl book and bonus DVD were just what I needed to become one with my natural curls!  And having travel-sized bottles of the products is just perfect since I travel often.  Becoming a true Curly Girl actually takes practice with the techniques and products.  Now I have all the tools to keep practicing and perfect my curly-ness!</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair and have been using Ouidad for the past few years.  A friend recommended this line of products to me.  I was afraid to try them because reviews mentioned that the products had strong scents, and one even said they smelled like pine cleaners.  I typically have problems tolerating perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sephora stopped carrying Ouidad at their retail stores, I ran out of my usual products, and decided to order a DevaCurl trial kit.  I bought this kit because it has the basic products + the Curly Girl handbook which comes with a DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the DVD and book was very helpful.  I followed the directions and my hair came out looking great.  This product brought out the curl in my hair without weighing it down, making it stiff, sticky, or oily looking.  The scents were natural-smelling and did not bother me.  My hair actually looked better the second day.  I used a little of the spray and scruntched before misting in the shower to reset the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had tried earlier and not been scared away by the comments about scents from other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I loved the whole package. The noo poo shampoo and conditioner were great and I actually liked the scent even though there were some bad reviews about it. I also like the Light Defining Gel and it smells really good. I watched the DVD and read the book and I can take care of my curls now. I used this one time and my curls instantly came back. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting the bigger size soon. Between this and Shea Moisture, my hair is moisturizer and has more life than ever!</li>
            <li> The most amazing thing in this kit it is the curly handbook, very helpful, especially when you are a beginner.  The products are ok, if you want to try the devacurl products and learn about curly hair this kit is perfect, however if you just want to be knowledge of the curls hair world then just buy the book.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Deva Curl system for awhile and had to order this set for my vacation.  Because I was visiting friends and family, I simply had it shipped to my destination and had plenty for the week - plus the product is sized so I could take the rest of it home and be TSA compliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never ordered a kit with the book or DVD with my initial purchase - or with my refills - so it has been interesting to learn more and improve my technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a s-wavey girl (basically the bottom of the Deva Curl-chain) ;)  and absolutely love this stuff.  I have bounce and shine and body.  I am no longer a slave to the hair dryer and flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Deva Curl seals in moisture, my hair is healthier than it has been in years and my color stays vibrant and hasn&#x27;t faded.  Even my stylist was shocked since I started using Deva Curl at how much better my color looks between visits.  (Color resistant gray here and this shampoo has been a hair changer for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch some videos if you are new to Deva Curl to learn the process.  I had have a bit of a learning curve as I was basically changing everything I thought I knew about washing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, my hair is s-wavy.  This will not make your straight hair curly.  You really need SOME natural wave or curl for this to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - this kit is great for trial or travel.  I will NOT use anything else so this was my 2nd trial kit.  This time I will save the little travel sized bottles and fill them myself when I travel.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love deva curl, the book the trial/travel kit came with was very informative, will continue to use this product.  Bought this to have all four without breaking my wallet, but will be buying full size bottles before these run out.</li>
            <li> After two pregnancies and two babies, my hair lost all it&#x27;s curl and luster..motherhood will do that to you. Although I usually don&#x27;t ever &#x27;buy into&#x27; fad hair products, I heard great reviews of this and found out that the shampoo is Poo Free, I had to try it. It is pricey, but the Poo-Free Cleanser leaves your hair feeling clean but not dry, the condition is just the perfect amount of hydration. The gel is the best, not crunchy, not greasy, just holds the curl perfectly. The spray oil is not my favorite as it can feel oily and makes me want to wash more frequently. Overall, a great kit, expensive but if anything I would go for the conditioner and gel only and continue my baking-soda poo free routine and no oil. Really glad I got to try all of them though.</li>
            <li> After 30 something years of trying sooo hard to straighten my hair to &amp;#34;fit in&amp;#34; I have finally had enough and I have decided to finally embrace my naturally wavy hair. After doing a little research, I found this product and I thought I&#x27;d try this starter kit. The first day I used this, it was raining -- my hair was still wet when I left the house for work. A couple hours later (at work), when my hair was dry, it looked amazing! No frizz! It was soft not stiff or oily! My hair looked sexy :-) LOL  I am reading the book and I realize I have so much to learn about taking care of my wavy/swavy hair but this is a very good start. If I hadn&#x27;t used this product that day, my hair would have been a disaster! No other &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hair products available at the grocery store (and I&#x27;ve tried sooo many over the years) could ever contain my used-to-be-unmanageable hair like DevaCurl does! Thank you for creating this great product!! I am definitely buying more for myself and for my friends who have the same &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; with their curly hair. I&#x27;m sure they will be happy, too. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> I recently met my girlfriend for dinner one night.  Her hair is just like mine; very curly (Botticelli curls - who knew??) and she has always straightened it to try and tame it.  When I met her out, her hair was GORGEOUS!  I could not get over how fantastic she looked with these luscious curls framing her face, and I complemented her numerous times.  This was someone I have known over 25 years, and I was simply stunned as to how fantastic her hair looked.  I asked her exactly how she did it, and she told me all about DevaCurl, which she learned about from her hairdresser.  Naturally, I asked her if I could get this through Amazon (she is as addicted to Amazon as I am!!), and she urged me to take a look.  I literally came home from dinner with her, sat myself down at Amazon, and ordered the trial kit to &#x27;play with.&#x27;  Oh...my....gosh.  This stuff worked wonders!  I smartly read the &#x27;Curly Girl&#x27; book that came with this trial sized kit, and read how I should be washing my hair, drying my hair, and in general, how to not look like a pot scrubber gone awry!!  I have to say, I can safely toss the 46 bottles of shampoos, conditioners, gels, and everything else and simply have these four bottles to take care of my hair for the rest of my days.  It worked just that well on my hair. I have since ordered full sizes of all these products.  It defined my curls, there was no frizz, and I did not have to spray it in place with a half can of hairspray to keep it from flying away.  I urge anyone with natural curls to give this a try.  It is worth the price!</li>
            <li> These products helped me decide if I wanted to buy them for my hair.  All of these products were what I had been hoping they would be.</li>
            <li> A couple of my friends have been trying to get me to use DevaCurl for my curly hair for a long time now. I&#x27;ve been reluctant because of the price and because I tried the gel once and I didn&#x27;t feel like I got great results. But I finally got tired of fighting with my hair (taming the frizz, but keeping it soft and curly and not crunchy) so, when I saw that this starter kit was only $25 and came with a book and DVD to teach you how to use the products, I finally gave in and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now I&#x27;m totally in love. The problem when I first tried the DevaCurl gel was that I didn&#x27;t know how to use it right... and there is so much more to getting nice, smooth, curls than just throwing in the gel. The book and DVD teach you how to care for your hair better from the time you get in the shower to the finished style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are nice, but you can find other products (the book also teaches you how to find good products for your hair - which ingredients to look for and which to avoid, etc.) that work great and are cheaper. I&#x27;m using the Organix Keratin Treatment shampoo and conditioner right now and get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is the magic. It freaked me out at first because you put a ton of it in your hair and, when it dries, it dries hard and crunchy. But, as soon as you shake your hair out (wait til it&#x27;s completely dry first!) and/or give your curls a few scrunches with your hands, your curls come out soft and defined with no crunch and no frizz! Seriously, it&#x27;s magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an oil under the gel because I think it adds shine and softness. I&#x27;ve been using the Organix Coconut Milk serum, but just switched to Organix Argan OIl of Morocco dry body oil because I heard argan oil is great for smoothing frizz and just great for your hair.... And the body oil has the same stuff for waaay cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip is, if you have long curly hair like mine, you might need to get some of the length cut off of your top layer of hair. I just switched hair stylists to one who is really good with curly hair (and it doesn&#x27;t have to be a super expensive stylist either), and just taking off that weight helped my hair curl up more and look really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Have fought my curls more than half my existence. But, Deva Curl makes me a Diva Girl!!!</li>
            <li> The book and DVD are critical to understanding how to use the Deva products to get your best curly hair. When I follow the directions to a T, I get perfect curls, which people comment on all day long. I&#x27;m back in the Deva shop to look for more products now that I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much difference in this product compared to many others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love this product</li>
            <li> Love deva curl I&#x27;ve never had my hair look better wish it was cheaper but it&#x27;s worth it for my hair to finally look good without  2 hours of straightening</li>
            <li> This kit was definitely worth it for the book and the bottles. I love the book! It has a lot of tips and stories of people who learned how to love their naturally curly hair. I like the haircare products well enough, but there are a lot more less expensive alternatives out there. The no-poo and conditioner are nice and thick, so I could get away with diluting them because I have wavy hair. The spray smells like skittles. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of gel that leaves your hair crunchy, but it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> The book was a nice bonus, and it has a DVD.  Trying out the travel size allowed me to decide which products I really needed.</li>
            <li> Liked the info included in this order regarding my curly hair.  Found the odour of the products are highly chemical, my husband described &amp;#34;like a permanent.&amp;#34;  Ick.  Don&#x27;t notice a significant impact on my curls, either.  Oh, well.</li>
            <li> Love everything about the DevaCurl line and this travel kit was great to decide if I liked the line enough to invest in the larger bottles.  I&#x27;ve since refilled it from the large bottles to lend to friends who want to try and get in touch with their inner curly girl.  I highly recommend getting and reading the Curly Girl book (included with this kit) if you are trying the line cause there&#x27;s some major tips in there (like **DON&#x27;T** rinse out the conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like having the little bottle of the &amp;#34;Set it free&amp;#34; spray for spritzing up (then shaking out) my curls when I&#x27;m at the beach or when I get off a motorcycle to combat helmet curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been rocking the curls for 9 months now with only two rogue days back at the straightener.</li>
            <li> Fantastic packaging. The deva curl kit is an amazing hair care range. I am in love with my hair, once again. Makes me feel so confident of the way I look. This is a brand that gives my wavy hair bounce with soft, shiny waves. Best of all, no more frizz! The curly girl handbook is perfect for someone looking to be able to tell your curls what to do, and so much more! A must have bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be continuing to use Deva curl products..</li>
            <li> This makes a great gift for anyone starting out with the curly hair method. The sizes and product were all perfect.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to commit to  regular size devacurl products especially BC this would have been my first time using. The products are definitely great and the book is great. I read the book then tried out the products with the regimen outlined for my curl type... I haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
