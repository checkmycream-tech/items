            <li>/&gt;It also smells really great on its own, kind of a musky scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It reminds me of an very popular perfume which is kind of nice, but will not compliment your coctail dress.</li>

            <li>The response from men has been amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed the amazing results that my friend had insisted happened to her.</li>
            <li>This product is just amazing.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and has fantastic results.</li>
            <li>I have that kind of luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly believe so.</li>
            <li>It has been just as effective as the oil for me.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any difference, although it does smell really nice.</li>
            <li>I feel like it has to have its own sort of smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>I can not say that this is effective at all.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice too.</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange of my honest review.</li>
            <li>And it has a really nice smell.</li>
            <li>Hubby said smell nice.</li>
            <li>I personally liked the smell and it is a confidence booster.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any kind of difference since I began using this product.  </li>
            <li>My friend who used it also found it giving her nice results.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice linger.</li>
            <li>it kind of worked in steps for me.</li>
            <li>I followed up with some of my own perfume.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34; kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>I just put it on with my own perfume.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wash it off, so I tried putting my own perfume over it, but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>but it smells nice.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if this works or</li>
            <li>Nice spray application.  </li>
            <li>Four stars because it is yet to proove effective on others.</li>
            <li>I sprayed my own perfume over the PherX and went to work.</li>
            <li>I liked this product because it affected my relationship with my husband.</li>
            <li>Spend on pair of nice jeans instead or jewelry.</li>
            <li>And to be honest, I&#x27;m a bit dense when it comes to noticing when men are attracted to me.</li>
            <li>That being said, I do prefer to cover it up with my own perfume.</li>
            <li>The spray bottle is handy and works well.</li>
            <li>This has a nice scent to it</li>
            <li>I do not use it every day, and now even I don’t use it, I feel more attractive and confident.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to see the \\&quot;gentlemen\\&quot; still exists.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really liked it too (and I did not tell him it included</li>
            <li>The spray itself has a pleasant odor that can easily be masked by a perfume.</li>
            <li>Honestly it smells good, but nothing huge.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel good and more confident...</li>
            <li>The smell is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I just received this item, the smell is very very strong.</li>
            <li>the scent was very strong to me.</li>
            <li>I had great expectations in this product because I saw some buyers said after using it people are more friendly to them and some even attract strangers to stare at them.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, the scent itself isn&#x27;t at all pleasing to me though; I&#x27;ve tried to cover it with my own perfume, but it still smells a bit like cat pee.</li>
            <li>at all :) It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Something about it just makes her more confident and feels sexy!</li>
            <li>the oil and this spray did seem to have men giving me more attention (like standing/sitting closer when speaking to me, and also speaking more candidly, I think).</li>
            <li>the product was ok but was very strong smell</li>
            <li>but when you put it on on use 1 spray because if you use more than this you will definately get a headache from the smell because he has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>The pheromone blend in this product smells great, and the effect on people is that they are more relaxed around me, chatty and smile more, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s its a bit strong but you can add you own perfume to mask the scent.</li>
            <li>Smells really good,  shipped really quickly.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant smile</li>
            <li>I had originally bought the oil, which was very enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell of this perfume and it makes me feel more confident!</li>
            <li>The more potent the product, the smellier it is.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I feel happier, more talkative, when I wear it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>up&amp;#34; kinda feeling when you wear it, but I&#x27;ve tried better.</li>
            <li>I have that, too, and I like it better.</li>
            <li>I have that, too, and I like it better.</li>
            <li>what I can say about wearing it is that it gave me more confidence</li>
            <li>There was a day or two that I thought I could tell a difference, but I am not so sure.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I find people respond better to me when I wear it</li>
            <li>and I feel more confident.</li>
            <li>It smells okay</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments from customers at work.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great product!</li>
            <li>Frankly, I get more attention when I wear a hat.</li>
            <li>He just thinks that it is one of my many perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>maybe I need to wait more time....</li>
            <li>and I love it too</li>
            <li>I got this product on an impulse to get more hugs from my husband.</li>
            <li>and I work in an office with mostly males.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this.</li>
            <li>and I feel sexy.</li>
            <li>but I have been getting a lot more attention.</li>
            <li>Ok so here is my review...</li>
            <li>I got approach by men many times.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you put your perfume somewhere else not where the product was placed.</li>
            <li>The scent is okay, but I prefer the more feminine scent tgat the Pherx oil has.</li>
            <li>because they love \\&quot;my\\&quot; smell....  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my husband is more touchy feely when I wear it.</li>
            <li>turns him on like a light!</li>
            <li>If you want more attention then you might want to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Which has to be the quickest I&#x27;ve received shipping for free!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it out yet, but will be sure to keep you all posted.</li>
            <li>More of a musky powder scent.  </li>
            <li>I just put it on then follow up with one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>They are more chatty these days.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered the oil to see if it has more staying power on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in strangers striking up conversations with me.</li>
            <li>he hates most perfumes I have</li>
            <li>and I get more attention when I wear</li>
            <li>The spray sticks around for about 4-5 hours and seems to relax guys more than anything.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>This has made me more confident in my courtship skills.</li>
            <li>I like the spray better than the oil for distribution.</li>
            <li>Maybe 3 sprays is the magic number for me.  </li>
            <li>SAFE YOUR MONEY PLEASE</li>
            <li>sure was more frisky when I was around him.</li>
            <li>Men are more focused when they interact with me.</li>
            <li>I like this a lot better.</li>
            <li>No calmer voice nor more cuddling, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I prefer the smell of the perfume way more.</li>
            <li>I do think over the oil works better though but the perfume does not make me dizzy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the results from this.</li>
            <li>I notice I get more attention from men.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy all the attention!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product overall.</li>
            <li>I prefer the spray because the scent stays on me better</li>
            <li>In love with Pherlure for life</li>
            <li>Conforme con el producto, fue un regalo para mi harmana y ella quedó muy contenta con este detalle! &#x3D;) ...</li>
            <li>Put some on before a business meeting and you&#x27;ll find you are given the floor more.  </li>
            <li>Also I love this company and their customer service</li>
            <li>and I have received many compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li>My woman friends were complimenting me quite a bit and almost seemed to want me involved with their conversations more.</li>
            <li>So to summarize my experience, it made ladies want to be my best friend and it made men kind of dopey around me, which is at least good for entertainment.  </li>
            <li>and I still have a lot more experimentation to do.</li>
            <li>Like I said, there is still more places I need to try this product.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure it will do wonders.</li>
            <li>Oh and one more thing, pheromone products are not used for you to believe anyone that your attracting will just pounce on you in the shack</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that I am more confident when I wear it.</li>
            <li>\\&quot; Love it</li>
            <li>Great prize and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t have intense effects, it still smells great</li>
            <li>Have heard alot of interesting things about Pheromones</li>
            <li>I have noticed people are more relaxed and at ease around me.</li>
            <li>will be buying some more...</li>
            <li>He was more touchy and sweeter, which is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second night, more touchy and wanting to be close.</li>
            <li>and he was more receptive and responsive.</li>
            <li>More intense.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can say is when I wear it, I get more/noticeable attention ( nozzles, cuddles, idle touching).</li>
            <li>Ordered this product and just put it on as it comes in a spray bottle which I love.  </li>
            <li>This product really works and it smells great also.  </li>
            <li>you guessed it, I am sure to spray some of this PherX Pheromone Perfume on just for the heck of it as you never know who you can or will attract.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s more to</li>
            <li>Spray is nice and light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it more time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in a better mood as well.</li>
            <li>This product continues to give me the confidence to be more outgoing.</li>
            <li>I love it. :)</li>
            <li>i really enjoyed my spray for women it attracted three people in one day .i</li>
            <li>The spray is more convenient for me, however they both work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t over powering like most perfumes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in the men around me, but I&#x27;m still pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I think when you use this, it&#x27;s more of a state of mind than anything else.</li>
            <li>And I think men did notice more when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>More like curiosity.</li>
            <li>Second, this product smell wonderful by itself.</li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>it make sex more enjoyable with my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I am more aggressive during sex and he is not.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know WHY they would love it...</li>
            <li>I feel more confident wearing it</li>
            <li>like is more of a baby powder smell after applied.</li>
            <li>After using it I apply bath and body peony cream on top.</li>
            <li>He is more attracted to me and accepting me the way I am.</li>
            <li>It wored well, I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I regret falling for this although it was more of an experiment.</li>
            <li>The guys I work with were friendlier, more helpful, and just hung around for no reason.  </li>
            <li>This gave me more confidence to interact with them and gave me the courage to talk to men</li>
            <li>I have more than 700 bottles in my collection.</li>
            <li>However, even my teenage daughter said, that the smell of PherX is awesome on my neck.</li>
            <li>Nothing more than kissing happened yet.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying it around more people.</li>
            <li>when I wear it, more guys are asking my name, and they introduce themselves to me.  </li>
            <li>, if this Perfume can assist in making a handful of men be mindful how they treat women, then I will wear this all the time making the world a better place, not just Friday nights!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>do agree that the label on the bottle could be more discreet.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that she is attracting more interactions, but it seems to give her more confidence.</li>
            <li>I noticed an increase in attention from men, which was very fun!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for three days, I&#x27;ve noticed that people have been very nice to me!</li>
            <li>All day long I feel as if I have just met for coffee with my best friend.  </li>
            <li>Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>A perfume to use on the days you don&#x27;t want a strong or outstanding scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible - I&#x27;d say it smells like a strong, musky soap.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product quite a bit and have noticed that many more people have approached me and talked to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been good at attracting attention from males, but when I really like that one guy and want to be more than friends, luck is not on my side.</li>
            <li>thing I don&#x27;t like is the sprayer needs to be more of a fine mist or something it seems to come out way too much.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>The pheromones combined with the confidence it gives, does help to gain more attention from men and they do seem to be more friendly.</li>
            <li>Confidence is a huge attraction factor, for instance psychopaths (extremely confident and</li>
            <li>Best money spent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only worn this product for a couple of days but the change in my life has been incredible.  </li>
            <li>but my SO has been more attentive</li>
            <li>THIS IS NOTHING BUT ALCOHOL WITH A CHEAP BABY PRODUCT SMELL, NOTHING MORE.</li>
            <li>Day three and great results so far.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have a good relationship, I bought it to give a try and see if really make a difference, but nothing &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>great item, fast shipping, no bad smell.</li>
            <li>If this product does not attract any men, it is still worth for the nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>:) I will absolutely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>I just want people to be more friendly.</li>
            <li>and I did not notice any change with my husbad, may be it works with other men :D</li>
            <li>Sweet smell too!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried a product like this, and I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really easy to pop in your purse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in an easy spray bottle&lt;</li>
            <li>Product came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I tend to be strong anyway</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not as strong from when you put it on.</li>
            <li>I recommend wearing perfume with it since it does have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of the PherX is fine with me</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer!</li>
            <li>For one, the smell is strong and cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a clean, fresh kind of smell, like a more masculine kind of soap almost.</li>
            <li>So I think combining the two is best a little bit of both.</li>
            <li>Even if it&#x27;s just a smile, a small.compliment, or someone holding the door open for me - it makes me feel very good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in how men act</li>
            <li>I was sitting in a HUGE library at school.</li>
            <li>I very much enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I did receive this free to review.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent for me.  </li>
            <li>It is really light.</li>
            <li>I am 100% happy with this product, and would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone looking to attract a man or bring back the passion in a relationship!</li>
            <li>Its just a cheap perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing this product.  </li>
            <li>It smells cheap.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit musky, but light, not offensive to me.</li>
            <li>She reported a multitude of happenstance interactions with men (a free oil change, conversations sparked at the grocery store, eye contact, extended glances...)</li>
            <li>Perhaps I just need to learn how to enjoy the attention without feeling obligated to go out with every guy who asks.</li>
            <li>I am not noticing any real change in attitude but its nice feeling like MAYBE its giving a boost?</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent and the people around me seem to enjoy it also.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t wearing the store logo, and the door was held opened for me when I had 2 free hands.</li>
            <li>As far as the scent, it smells good like something youd wear to a fancy dinner.</li>
            <li>The spray bottle does spritz out a bit too much perfume in one go, so it&#x27;s best to unscrew the lid and just dab on a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For example, one time I wore it and my fiance was super sweet and lovable toward me, but</li>
            <li>PherX is something I will order in the future for sure!!</li>
            <li>I loved the fragance it does fade pretty fast</li>
            <li>purchased this product to try it out, and so far I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I give it a 4/5 rating, based solely on the fact that the smell can be overwhelming at first</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Also pretty sure for something like this to work it can&#x27;t be covered up by a fragrance.</li>
            <li>Guys just seem to be MUCH more interested in you when you wear it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my wife.</li>
            <li>Well even in my feed and clean the chickens get on, I was turning my hubby on.</li>
            <li>Strange as it may sound, I&#x27;m also attracted to my own scent!</li>
            <li>Like clean skin.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love to make love, but sometimes during our busy schedules, the drive goes by the way side.</li>
            <li>Some of us smell the nice side only, while others can smell the &amp;#34;cat pee&amp;#34; side :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Used this thinking it would enhance my Friday night love life with hubby, ended up having having men be extremely nice to me when visiting a local grocery store.</li>
            <li>The scent is overall pleasant, and I would use it sparingly rather than bathe in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Zyloo Labs promptly refunded me with no questions asked so it was a pleasant buying experience overall.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I have noticed that I receive more positive attention when I wear this pheromone perfume.</li>
            <li>Nice soft scent!</li>
            <li>The men at the party (Most of whom I have known for 10+ years) seemed very engaged with me and almost acted like I was more funny than I already am.</li>
            <li>Even better, I like the smell, though it seems to fade pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tested the product now for some weeks, using it in special occasions, and I must say that I have found a difference in the way men interact with me.</li>
            <li>The actual scent is pretty strong and is not as pleasant.</li>
            <li>Great smell and and great value I love it definitely noticed more attention in the work place as well as other public domains.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used this product, I&#x27;ve been amazed at how effective it&#x27;s really been.</li>
            <li>I work in customer service, and that day I had a great deal more men than usual flirt with me.</li>
            <li>I was torn between rating this product 3 or 4 stars, but since I like the oil better (and rate it 4 stars), this really does merit 3.  </li>
            <li>Then later I was sitting out in front of my apartment building and another really good looking girl who was just walking by on the street stopped to say hello and ask me for directions to some place.  </li>
            <li>I looked around and it appeared that I was getting more attention than I&#x27;m used to, but I still didn&#x27;t think much of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not ugly</li>
            <li>kind of old woman ish-</li>
            <li>Literally, we only have sex like once a month on a good month.</li>
            <li>but nothing like full blown</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;m a dollop of sweet ice cream pie they must have.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think guys are more \\&quot;attracted\\&quot; per se, but they are much friendlier.</li>
            <li>The comment I received the most was \\&quot;You smell really good\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I will say the scent is not bad.</li>
            <li>LIKE POWDER , not bad at all</li>
            <li>I find the scent pleasant and anecdotally, I find that when I wear this men tend to be a little friendlier and more flirtatious.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try to hide it with perfume, because I thought that might skew the results of my experiment, but I think that you could hide the scent pretty easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>Strong at first</li>
            <li>anyway,Little strong at first but dosent stay that way.</li>
            <li>But if all that wasn&#x27;t enough, the company truly values your reviews enough to offer you free products for an honest review- good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is MILD compared to ones I&#x27;ve tried with copulins, so if you think this is smelly, don&#x27;t buy Eros or Liquid Trust, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At the same time, my attitude changes when I wear because I feel more confident.</li>
            <li>The oil may be better for a date whereas the perfume would be better in a big crowd.</li>
            <li>I got lucky that night.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that you can spray this on, but it does wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t been so close recently, so I&#x27;ve been wearing it, more as an experiment, but I notice he&#x27;s in a better mood when he&#x27;s around me.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older and able to buy things online myself, I just HAD to give this a try.</li>
            <li>When I run out, I&#x27;ll most likely purchase again :)</li>
            <li>Quick answer to my questions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure if someone were extra close to you (like snuggling) it would work better.</li>
            <li>One star for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The perfume is too strong for my nostrils and it hasn&#x27;t had a positive effect on him.</li>
            <li>arrived on time, Has a nice pleasant smell, can easily be used with other scents,only had for a short time, waiting to see results.</li>
            <li>the most even got a few numbers, ordering more for sure</li>
            <li>Husband likes it very much!</li>
            <li>I love the smell, smells great, better than some expensive perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I work in a male dominated industry and I am friendly and well liked.</li>
            <li>More importantly, I like it, and contrary to other reviews, I like the smell and find it makes me more receptive.</li>
            <li>The first day I used PherX a good looking gal walked up and started talking to me at my local supermarket.  </li>
            <li>He can&#x27;t keep his hands off me, he is wanting to be near me and talk all the time, he has a sense of calmness around me and he&#x27;s constantly telling me how beautiful I am....</li>
            <li>This seemed strong and very alcohol smelling.</li>
            <li>he works many long  hours many days in a row and doesn&#x27;t notice when we lack in just being close to one another.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely worked for me and  all my girlfriends!!</li>
            <li>REALLY!!</li>
            <li>I love the soft powdered smell of this scent!</li>
            <li>I do feel the time it was used that men around me seemed pretty friendly...</li>
            <li>** for no reason at the same supermarket, and the most I did to her was say \\&quot;excuse me\\&quot; very nicely with a smile while passing by her to get bottled water.  </li>
            <li>The cheap spray bottle sprays way too much product to use at one time.  </li>
            <li>worked amazing, wore it and was instantly noticed and commented on.</li>
            <li>but I just cover with lotion to calm the scent.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a HUGE change in the way men act around me</li>
            <li>Not to sound conceited, haha).</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it, I saw a huge difference in my husband&#x27;s energy level and sex drive, that has continued thanks to this spray!</li>
            <li>I wanted to test it on my boyfriend, whom is affectionate enough on his own.</li>
            <li>The smell reminded me of an older woman&#x27;s perfume; strong and floral.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t for everyone though I like to mix with my own, and I only use about one squirt</li>
            <li>The oil has a powdery fresh floral scent.</li>
            <li>soo much fun</li>
            <li>Is worth mentioning that my hubby does not like almost any perfumes or candles etc.</li>
            <li>Mostly just a lot of offers to help carry my groceries and assist me when I&#x27;m out and about.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth giving a try.</li>
            <li>We wore it out to a restaurant and had a lot of attention from the opposite sex even though we were minding our own business.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both worked equally well with my husband, maybe because the oil needs closer contact to be effective?</li>
            <li>This is really rare for him.</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>They also seem to be more conversational with me and look at me directly in the eyes.</li>
            <li>I recently tried this product and as of yet I have not seen any kind of result</li>
            <li>like its smell also - fresh and unostentatious.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun item.</li>
            <li>Some smelled flowers, baby powder, and fresh laundry.</li>
            <li>Have tried others without success.  </li>
            <li>Also, I am writing professional reviews  for many beauty websites.</li>
            <li>It was a great deal, and I was very happy to pay less than half of the actual price.</li>
            <li>Spray is a light, floral fragrance, not something I would normally choose, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>are more friendly and open to my presence.</li>
            <li>First, product arrived so quick exceed my expectional.</li>
            <li>I went to work and didn&#x27;t have much good response as I have with other pheromones</li>
            <li>highly recommend thus vim isn&#x27;t and their products and recommend you be sure you&#x27;re ready for the results because you&#x27;ll begin a news era in your life</li>
            <li>; sticker right on the bottle.</li>
            <li>; sticker right on the bottle.</li>
            <li>tried it right away</li>
            <li>So ladies go right now to Amazon and get buy it</li>
            <li>Me, I noticed right away.</li>
            <li>I also noticed people being more friendly in general, starting conversations more often or complimenting me on one thing or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absolutely doesn&#x27;t smell like cat piss, more like old hair spray at first and then fades into a clean musky scent.</li>
            <li>of my latest experience, i got free tickets , free car repair, free parking passes and at least 2 guys numbers per night.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>This is first time I am using pheromones, just wanted to spice up my life, so results are what expected, first time I used this product two guys to came up to me and started conversation, also this product relaxing me, i am more confident around people and easygoing around guys, I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because the smell is made to attract men</li>
            <li>I was really hoping the hype was true.</li>
            <li>ok i just gave it 3 starts because i received last week, and i&#x27;m ready to start using it today!!</li>
            <li>, I thought I might like it at first, but when I sprayed it on, it smells just like some sweet smelling carpet cleaning chemicals, and makes me want to throw up, and also makes me wonder if this is all it really is.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product 2 times so far and on both occations ive had good resaults.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>I think its just a soft and easy to used,</li>
            <li>and I believe that the perfume in it is far too strong.</li>
            <li>but it actually blends very well with my own perfumes.</li>
            <li>Touching me more, doing things that making me laugh more( being silly).</li>
            <li>He had a very unusual reaction.</li>
            <li>Shipment was very fast.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rub your wrists and other &#x27;hot spots&#x27; quickly after applying as the spray dries up quickly.</li>
            <li>Sprays a little too much though, other wise good product.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the first &amp;#34;note&amp;#34; you will smell.</li>
            <li>In example, he caresses my arm out of nowhere, walks up behind me and nuzzles my neck while I wash the dishes, and cuddles more while on the sofa while we enjoy our favorite shows/play video games.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll grow to love it&#x27;s scent, and It did technically &amp;#34;attract&amp;#34; men to me.</li>
            <li>you.ll grow to love it&#x27;s scent, and It did technically &amp;#34;attract&amp;#34; men to me.</li>
            <li>No scent product will help you keep a mate, but I believe this one will definitely open the door for more opportunities.  </li>
            <li>But hey, if it does work, then I am willing to give up my scent \\&quot;pleasures\\&quot; to continue using this product.</li>
            <li>You can always add more later.  </li>
            <li>I got much more male attention...</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it was at work, the guys I work with are flirty</li>
            <li>When I wear PherX, I notice that my male co-workers treat me with more respect.  </li>
            <li>I am married and have not noticed any attraction benefits...  maybe.  </li>
            <li>When I wore this the last couple of days at work, the men were more talkative to me and seemed to want to be around me all day.</li>
            <li>I definitely get more attention from men.  </li>
            <li>When I bought this I was with doubt about this product but the first week I used.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten that I applied PherX that first morning rather than my every day body spray.</li>
            <li>I get alot more male attention!</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s see what happens , i&#x27;ll keep you all updated ;-)</li>
            <li>but it can intimidate men and by using the pheremones it can even the playing field a bit and make them more open to sharing ideas.  </li>
            <li>Works better on men who don&#x27;t have low</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I find that my regular J&#x27;adore or Eclat d&#x27;arpege is much more of an attractant.  </li>
            <li>be there is auto-suggestion, but it seems to me that men especially look at me :)</li>
            <li>&gt; the first night, when he got home from work</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>: THE FIRST DAY I tried this</li>
            <li>Oil is also light, not heavy.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent and long lasting!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve taken advantage of the multi pack on my second order because I&#x27;m that satisfied with the product that I wanted to take advantage of the discount price for the multi pack.</li>
            <li>Third, I got many compliments while wearing this product, including my boyfriend and his brother.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it...</li>
            <li>day I wore this perfume to work for the first time, I immediately noticed a difference in both my confidence, and the way men behaved around me.</li>
            <li>First of all: DON&#x27;T smell this product on your skin.</li>
            <li>I will write more later on my experience.</li>
            <li>I would love to come back and tell you my end results....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to cover with similar fresh scent type perfumes, so it wears well in</li>
            <li>So far Pherx Pheromone  is like any other refreshing fragrance, I used it after I shower or before making love to my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li>but I will wear a light body spray just to sweeten it up a little more.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell too unlike some other brands.</li>
            <li>So I spayed over with my current perfume and the two fragrances mixed together pretty good.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, it can be applied with other perfumes if you want to cover it up.</li>
            <li>but I start to feel different when I wear it, like more confident which enhances my allure which enhances my chances with the opposite sex, so it is more of a mental programming product</li>
            <li>but I noticed a real difference in their attitudes towards me, still flirty but more actual conversations now.</li>
            <li>This smells really great: very subtle pleasant smell, a little powdery - my bf likes it.</li>
            <li>The first time it was a guy who made very bold comment about my appearance, while following me at the store.</li>
            <li>man did react positively to it though.</li>
            <li>Interviews, meetings, or anything where to help promote a positive atmosphere.</li>
            <li>is it easy to use, but the fragrance is a little strong.  </li>
            <li>seems to be calm, esp the ones who are normally on the edge.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and whether or not it attracts any guys, who knows for sure?</li>
            <li>Not so much with strangers (Which i don&#x27;t need since Im married)</li>
            <li>If you are willing to experience the advantage that pheromones has to offer, then I&#x27;ll say that this product will guarantee you promising results.</li>
            <li>The first time I only sprayed it twice and both men and women were coming up to me and being more chatty then normal, also brought up conversations were about relationships.</li>
            <li>He is way more passionate in the bedroom</li>
            <li>Does not have a funky smell as some pheromones do, though this one has a mild perfume, doesn&#x27;t last long &amp; can be covered by your own perfume brand if its bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use the &amp;#34;dipstick&amp;#34; method, the small bottle will last a very good while.</li>
            <li>It can also easily be covered up with regular perfume.</li>
            <li>I found it was easy to combine with my regular perfume.  </li>
            <li>It smells a bit masculine, but the scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love each other very much</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t super powerful, so it didn&#x27;t bother me a lot, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t what I would buy just as a perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a gay male</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much happier and problems don&#x27;t seem as large while I&#x27;m wearing the pheromones.</li>
            <li>pump sprays out way too much.</li>
            <li>It smells very musty.  </li>
            <li>Very responsive to inquiries and helpful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more partial to fruity smells.</li>
            <li>, does it really work?</li>
            <li>Even the customers seem a whole lot nicer to me.</li>
            <li>Really dose work.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express an opinion, because I don&#x27;t know if the product really works...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fussy and won&#x27;t wear anything overpowering, sickly-sweet, or cheap-smelling.</li>
            <li>the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommended to any girl out there</li>
            <li>than that I really have no complaints</li>
            <li>if used too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>It has caused me to be very relaxed.</li>
            <li>I wore the oil to work with not much reaction but the spray yielded a lot more attention from co-workers.</li>
            <li>All night he was really cuddly and touchy feely.</li>
            <li>very attractive).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>Attract Men) really does work.  </li>
            <li>I did not use any perfume with this product and I used a light mist (1 pump) on my upper body--around the neck.</li>
            <li>It really works.&lt;br /&gt;Men will hit on you.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell, so I don&#x27;t wear it much.  </li>
            <li>&gt; The spray bottle is too much.</li>
            <li>This product really works,</li>
            <li>even so haha</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t think much about it then.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>very close contact with people all day.</li>
            <li>I did not receive one compliment while wearing this for 4 days straight.</li>
            <li>The spray comes out fast and a lot of it too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 days already, nothing unusual happened.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get one thing straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using it because I&#x27;ve paid so much for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very musty smelling</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap cologne for a teenage boy.</li>
            <li>Too much comes out of the spray.</li>
            <li>My husband is normally very affectionate with me, but this repelled him.</li>
            <li>And also I assume it depends on how much you apply.</li>
            <li>But I really haven&#x27;t notice that it really does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My bf kissing my neck much often now)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it around men much yet.  </li>
            <li>My partner is away and am waiting for him to return to get a real evaluation.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is very affectionate and intimate while I wear this product versus not wearing it.  </li>
            <li>This way I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about someone finding out what it really</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this nice cologne for a few weeks at my university and classes</li>
            <li>However, some scientists who have developed human pheromone enhanced products state that they exist and also work on increasing sexual attractiveness.</li>
            <li>The men, however, became very talkative, felt at ease around me,and offered me more services than I would have expected.  </li>
            <li>had read previous reviews about the smell being very strong and almost pungent, so I did not spray the perfume on myself with the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li>LIKE MUSTY 4 DAY OLD UNWASHED \\&quot;FEET\\&quot;!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a little bit strong, but not unpleasant, I prefer to cover it up with my own perfume, but DEFINITELY works, but I still prefer the one I used before, only if I could find it again.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday wear - however it doesn&#x27;t last very long - smell fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very interesting a little strong but it does wear down to a nice musk scent I noticed a little attention</li>
            <li>My opinion is not negative or positive.</li>
            <li>I also noticed other men (co-workers) being more chatty with me.</li>
            <li>so u better use something onthe product to cover it other way it is alright,good even</li>
            <li>smell though, unlike in some other comments, is not disgusting (like a cat pee)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this product daily and must say that it has an unique influence on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 17 year old junior in high school who rarely gets recognized.</li>
            <li>Im not sure if this really works or not to be completely honest.</li>
            <li>The scent is not your usual modern pungent-sweet perfume smell that is so popular nowadays.  </li>
            <li>but when it dies down it is a nice soft musky smell.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to compair with a different brand, and I can honestly say that this one actually works, whereas, the other only had a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I personally like the scent but understand why some say it is sweetly and over barring.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty without being overpowering, and it can really add chemistry to your encounter with your significant other.</li>
            <li>in all, not a bad choice if you&#x27;re starting out,</li>
            <li>in all, not a bad choice if you&#x27;re starting out,</li>
            <li>My educated guess is, that when one uses a pheromone enhanced product, his or her confidence increases and this puts his or her boundaries and defenses down, which makes that person look more approachable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even place this on his favorite places to explore, I place it on odd areas to make sue it works; it does.</li>
            <li>the opposite sex is definitely more open to interaction when wearing it.</li>
            <li>Id rate this a decent product</li>
            <li>we play around in the BDSM category, but last night, there was love mixed in with it as well.</li>
            <li>I read in an article that some of us can not recognize the smell of the main component of the pheromone (which is the smell of sweat and urine).</li>
            <li>my mother braggs on how the lucky guy is constantly persistent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be nice if they&#x27;d package it in something more discrete at least, so if it rolls out of your handbag in the middle of your date, you&#x27;re not trying to open a vein with your soup spoon out of mortification.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be nice if they&#x27;d package it in something more discrete at least, so if it rolls out of your handbag in the middle of your date, you&#x27;re not trying to open a vein with your soup spoon out of mortification.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone thinking about purchasing it, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>Since wearing it on an almost daily basis, my boyfriend (whom I live with) has been more physical.</li>
            <li>Men seem to be want to talk a little bit more when I&#x27;ve used this product at work.  </li>
            <li>I think people seem to be a little more talkative around me.</li>
            <li>and I know that it drives him wild!!  </li>
            <li>smell is not too strong and could be overworn with other fragrances​.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the most effective way for me to do this is to dab a little PherX on my wrists after I get out of the shower in the morning, then on other pulse points, then allow it to dry while I start getting ready.</li>
            <li>Like I previously stated, the smell was something that kind of threw me off a little at first, but I have grown to like it very much.</li>
            <li>From a marriage that was lacking so much in communication and affection it has completely taken180 degree turn.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it that much, but so far it seems to be working, I did notice people looking at me</li>
            <li>I have to say men do look at me longer than normal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually been fun to experiment with.  </li>
            <li>it at least smelled nice</li>
            <li>What I Normally Like To wear</li>
            <li>The oil seems to last longer and the fragrance isn&#x27;t as powerful.</li>
            <li>Okay, as for the scent, it&#x27;s harsh.</li>
            <li>Just bought my second bottle, I have a lot of fun with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice so far, but each time I have seen more response in the opposite sex.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only strong and a little too &#x27;musky&#x27; for me personally, and it seems more like something my mother would wear.</li>
            <li>I was wondering if I had gotten the right one at first, as it was him who I expected to be getting amped up.</li>
            <li>I have heard a lot about this kind of product and really was not sure what to actually believe..</li>
            <li>I ordered this product wanting to try something new.</li>
            <li>My husband didn&#x27;t know I was trying out a new \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I recevied a new item like I ordered.</li>
            <li>Every perfume and cologne smells different on an individual but with that said this product is fantastic</li>
            <li>I got no attention other than the normal attention I normally would get from males, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>The perfume has a very light baby powder-like smell, which mixes well with other (regular) perfumes, if you want to apply one.</li>
            <li>Received my PherX very quickly and was very anxious to try it right away.</li>
            <li>It is more subtle with maybe a hint of old-fashioned in a positive way.  </li>
            <li>This person left right after me and literary followed me to the parking lot continuing talking to me.</li>
            <li>Thought it would wrk better than it did :\</li>
            <li>&quot; my husband is back to the way he was when we first dated...</li>
            <li>Four stars for now, I bought the oil and the first night I used it, I wore it to a party which had a mixed crowd (men and women).  </li>
            <li>He seemed all of a sudden very inspired!</li>
            <li>but the two times I&#x27;ve worn it, I have gotten more attention than I usually do.</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments when I wear it mixed with my other musky fragrances.</li>
            <li>People usually do not have that type of reaction to my perfume.</li>
            <li>I think I hold my weight pretty well for being this short.</li>
            <li>When he got near me, he said, \\&quot;Whoa!</li>
            <li>I wore it out to a restaurant with lots of coworkers and I got attention more than usual.</li>
            <li>I found out that it is a little strong scented</li>
            <li>The combination of both is so amazing, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It IS strong at first, but after about 10 minutes the smell becomes subtle.</li>
            <li>After years of being married that spark seemed to dwindle between my husband and I. I purchased several different pheromone products to spice things up but nothing seemed to be working very well.</li>
            <li>B0002UEVCQ Pherone Formula D-17X Pheromone Cologne for Men to Attract Women, with Pure Human Pheromones]]</li>
            <li>I prefer the pure instinct brand i actually got results .</li>
            <li>I am about to try the oil version of it and see if its any better, scent is hard for me to get used to</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had much luck in attracting men with this scent (except for the regular \\&quot;supermarket\\&quot; men who try and make convo with me).</li>
            <li>Clearly she didn&#x27;t need directions.  </li>
            <li>People actually approached me directly &amp; looked me in the eye as they spoke, they became very chatty.</li>
            <li>I notice women are nicer (not as catty men on the third day became indifferent and that professor even seemed ANNOYED at the following class (2 days later) lol Very neat experiment.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer said it smells like an old lady</li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer the oil because the Perfume has a much stronger smell.</li>
            <li>So, far it hasn&#x27;t worked.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy scent.  </li>
            <li>It really works I finally got every man ever want to hook up with.</li>
            <li>it has a spray as far as attracting men</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast but it was not to discreet on the label I suggest if you can put instead only perfume or beauty supply because I will buy again from this company.</li>
            <li>My friend had one of these &amp;#34;love potions&amp;#34; and hers smelled completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just received it and so far</li>
            <li>The smell is like an old lady musky smell.</li>
            <li>So far, no men (or women) have complimented me on my scent.  </li>
            <li>It was passionate, and intense!</li>
            <li>It smells like old lady or funeral house.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised at how ineffective it is.</li>
            <li>Just not liking it so far.</li>
            <li>this spray makes him like a wild animal in the sack.</li>
            <li>Guys were acting really freakin</li>
            <li>it smells like old lady roses smell...</li>
            <li>The product arrived fast enough.</li>
            <li>I do like the soft scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure if it works, since I have not been around too many people lately.</li>
            <li>The fragaranc left much to be desired but had to wear it in order to see the effects which were no effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Too expensive too see any good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a social recluse at work, and try to retain a sense of professionalism, but I didn&#x27;t mind the small conversations during break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Normally, I am unapproachable, but this product made me strangely social.  </li>
            <li>It is not completely alcohol based like most perfumes, but has oil in it, and so it takes a little longer to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff, subtle &amp; it works</li>
            <li>I did an experiment where I used the spray on one day and not use it the next day to observe this particular guy&#x27;s responses towards me.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s the spray or a sudden sense of sexual confidence that is giving her the results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s funny that he doesn&#x27;t know that I&#x27;m actually making him physically do that.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because it&#x27;s a little too strong for me</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to hear about it, feel free to skip down to the next paragraph.</li>
            <li>He made me a real from the 50 Shades of Grey book while he was playing.</li>
            <li>but it gave my normal perfume a different smell.</li>
            <li>and they did definitely seem friendlier than normal.</li>
            <li>what I&#x27;ve learned from the little available articles on human pheromones is that 20% of the population had lost its ability to smell pheromones, so statistically pheromones will not work for every fifth person that you are trying to attract.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t found much difference after wearing it, but i just use a little since it is very strong[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Those of us who use the product connected with guys in less than 1 hr of being at the bar, the other girls did not... call it luck or PhernX, but we filled it work!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to know what I&#x27;m perceiving as different because I&#x27;m paying attention to it more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily on my pulse points but haven&#x27;t gotten any &#x27;new&#x27; changes.  </li>
            <li>I hated the smell, no difference in attraction abilities, Buy yourself a nice chanell chance istead, trust me, will be better results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a major effect using this product.</li>
            <li>Public places like grocery store lines, at work, my significant other kept saying, \\&quot;what did u do different?</li>
            <li>This is easy, doesn&#x27;t leak, and small enough to put in a handbag and not get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not going to say that it does not work because apparently it has worked for some.</li>
            <li>So far, after trying it out only 2x (and I applied it to the clothes and not on my skin as the product instructions says)</li>
            <li>I will try it out next by applying it directly to my skin.</li>
            <li>I wore this on multiple occasions and never really got any consistent results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure the effect the manufacturer describes is true</li>
            <li>It was slow then weirdly bizarre.</li>
            <li>Hands down, this spray really works!</li>
            <li>wore this scent every day at first, but I&#x27;ve gone down to wearing it once or twice per week.</li>
            <li>I had hoped I would find that the other reviewers and I just had different taste, but sadly not.</li>
            <li>Not only have I received compliments on the scent, but the male attraction, wow!</li>
            <li>I did not notice any major effects this product had on me, but I was calm the entire time even as the smell started to wear off (a few hours).</li>
            <li>mixed it in a little bottle with some un scented lotion to calm it</li>
            <li>I wear pheromone based perfumes for social occasions.</li>
            <li>it sprays a lot at once, be careful not to spray close to delicate fabrics, like a silk cami top, or blazer.</li>
            <li>so far I have gotten  more complements  and men would start random conversations</li>
            <li>I mean this guy was so excited after smelling my wrist.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I put a little bit on my pressure points.  </li>
            <li>Other men seem to be nicer, I will order this again and really test the second trial.</li>
            <li>but if its not you and your significant other isn&#x27;t being attentive, I would just flat out , ask whats wrong or what you could do to improve your relationship.  </li>
            <li>It can also be mixed with other soft scent and it wont harm the smell, nor will you have a stink smell.!!!</li>
            <li>Anyway, the perfumes I regularly buy are either musky or clean smelling - lately Acqua di Gioia by Armani.</li>
            <li>a little more attention but not much more than usual&lt;</li>
            <li>We have not been intimate for quite some time due to my pregnancy and some physical and emotional changes in me.</li>
            <li>I put some on right before an interview a few days ago and got an email today that I got the job!</li>
            <li>but, i was feeling slightly neglected in the area of intimate( as in the real meaning: of closeness) closeness and was missing him.</li>
            <li>This, I don&#x27;t use everyday because I&#x27;m saving it for a certain time of use.</li>
            <li>The second time, I sprayed 4 sprays, and the attention that I received was almost a little too much.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It also smells really great on its own, kind of a musky scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It reminds me of an very popular perfume which is kind of nice, but will not compliment your coctail dress.</li>

            <li> The response from men has been amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed the amazing results that my friend had insisted happened to her.</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and has fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I have that kind of luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly believe so.</li>
            <li> It has been just as effective as the oil for me.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference, although it does smell really nice.</li>
            <li> I feel like it has to have its own sort of smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I liked the smell.</li>
            <li> I can not say that this is effective at all.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange of my honest review.</li>
            <li> And it has a really nice smell.</li>
            <li> Hubby said smell nice.</li>
            <li> I personally liked the smell and it is a confidence booster.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any kind of difference since I began using this product.  </li>
            <li> My friend who used it also found it giving her nice results.  </li>
            <li> It was a nice linger.</li>
            <li> it kind of worked in steps for me.</li>
            <li> I followed up with some of my own perfume.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> I just put it on with my own perfume.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wash it off, so I tried putting my own perfume over it, but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if this works or</li>
            <li> Nice spray application.  </li>
            <li> Four stars because it is yet to proove effective on others.</li>
            <li> I sprayed my own perfume over the PherX and went to work.</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it affected my relationship with my husband.</li>
            <li> Spend on pair of nice jeans instead or jewelry.</li>
            <li> And to be honest, I&#x27;m a bit dense when it comes to noticing when men are attracted to me.</li>
            <li> That being said, I do prefer to cover it up with my own perfume.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle is handy and works well.</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent to it</li>
            <li> I do not use it every day, and now even I don’t use it, I feel more attractive and confident.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to see the \\&quot;gentlemen\\&quot; still exists.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really liked it too (and I did not tell him it included</li>
            <li> The spray itself has a pleasant odor that can easily be masked by a perfume.</li>
            <li> Honestly it smells good, but nothing huge.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel good and more confident...</li>
            <li> The smell is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I just received this item, the smell is very very strong.</li>
            <li> the scent was very strong to me.</li>
            <li> I had great expectations in this product because I saw some buyers said after using it people are more friendly to them and some even attract strangers to stare at them.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, the scent itself isn&#x27;t at all pleasing to me though; I&#x27;ve tried to cover it with my own perfume, but it still smells a bit like cat pee.</li>
            <li> at all :) It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Something about it just makes her more confident and feels sexy!</li>
            <li> the oil and this spray did seem to have men giving me more attention (like standing/sitting closer when speaking to me, and also speaking more candidly, I think).</li>
            <li> the product was ok but was very strong smell</li>
            <li> but when you put it on on use 1 spray because if you use more than this you will definately get a headache from the smell because he has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> The pheromone blend in this product smells great, and the effect on people is that they are more relaxed around me, chatty and smile more, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s its a bit strong but you can add you own perfume to mask the scent.</li>
            <li> Smells really good,  shipped really quickly.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant smile</li>
            <li> I had originally bought the oil, which was very enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell of this perfume and it makes me feel more confident!</li>
            <li> The more potent the product, the smellier it is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I feel happier, more talkative, when I wear it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> up&amp;#34; kinda feeling when you wear it, but I&#x27;ve tried better.</li>
            <li> I have that, too, and I like it better.</li>
            <li> I have that, too, and I like it better.</li>
            <li> what I can say about wearing it is that it gave me more confidence</li>
            <li> There was a day or two that I thought I could tell a difference, but I am not so sure.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I find people respond better to me when I wear it</li>
            <li> and I feel more confident.</li>
            <li> It smells okay</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments from customers at work.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> Frankly, I get more attention when I wear a hat.</li>
            <li> He just thinks that it is one of my many perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> maybe I need to wait more time....</li>
            <li> and I love it too</li>
            <li> I got this product on an impulse to get more hugs from my husband.</li>
            <li> and I work in an office with mostly males.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of this.</li>
            <li> and I feel sexy.</li>
            <li> but I have been getting a lot more attention.</li>
            <li> Ok so here is my review...</li>
            <li> I got approach by men many times.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you put your perfume somewhere else not where the product was placed.</li>
            <li> The scent is okay, but I prefer the more feminine scent tgat the Pherx oil has.</li>
            <li> because they love \\&quot;my\\&quot; smell....  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my husband is more touchy feely when I wear it.</li>
            <li> turns him on like a light!</li>
            <li> If you want more attention then you might want to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Which has to be the quickest I&#x27;ve received shipping for free!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it out yet, but will be sure to keep you all posted.</li>
            <li> More of a musky powder scent.  </li>
            <li> I just put it on then follow up with one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li> They are more chatty these days.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered the oil to see if it has more staying power on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in strangers striking up conversations with me.</li>
            <li> he hates most perfumes I have</li>
            <li> and I get more attention when I wear</li>
            <li> The spray sticks around for about 4-5 hours and seems to relax guys more than anything.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> This has made me more confident in my courtship skills.</li>
            <li> I like the spray better than the oil for distribution.</li>
            <li> Maybe 3 sprays is the magic number for me.  </li>
            <li> SAFE YOUR MONEY PLEASE</li>
            <li> sure was more frisky when I was around him.</li>
            <li> Men are more focused when they interact with me.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot better.</li>
            <li> No calmer voice nor more cuddling, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I prefer the smell of the perfume way more.</li>
            <li> I do think over the oil works better though but the perfume does not make me dizzy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the results from this.</li>
            <li> I notice I get more attention from men.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy all the attention!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product overall.</li>
            <li> I prefer the spray because the scent stays on me better</li>
            <li> In love with Pherlure for life</li>
            <li> Conforme con el producto, fue un regalo para mi harmana y ella quedó muy contenta con este detalle! &#x3D;) ...</li>
            <li> Put some on before a business meeting and you&#x27;ll find you are given the floor more.  </li>
            <li> Also I love this company and their customer service</li>
            <li> and I have received many compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> My woman friends were complimenting me quite a bit and almost seemed to want me involved with their conversations more.</li>
            <li> So to summarize my experience, it made ladies want to be my best friend and it made men kind of dopey around me, which is at least good for entertainment.  </li>
            <li> and I still have a lot more experimentation to do.</li>
            <li> Like I said, there is still more places I need to try this product.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m sure it will do wonders.</li>
            <li> Oh and one more thing, pheromone products are not used for you to believe anyone that your attracting will just pounce on you in the shack</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that I am more confident when I wear it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot; Love it</li>
            <li> Great prize and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t have intense effects, it still smells great</li>
            <li> Have heard alot of interesting things about Pheromones</li>
            <li> I have noticed people are more relaxed and at ease around me.</li>
            <li> will be buying some more...</li>
            <li> He was more touchy and sweeter, which is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second night, more touchy and wanting to be close.</li>
            <li> and he was more receptive and responsive.</li>
            <li> More intense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can say is when I wear it, I get more/noticeable attention ( nozzles, cuddles, idle touching).</li>
            <li> Ordered this product and just put it on as it comes in a spray bottle which I love.  </li>
            <li> This product really works and it smells great also.  </li>
            <li> you guessed it, I am sure to spray some of this PherX Pheromone Perfume on just for the heck of it as you never know who you can or will attract.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s more to</li>
            <li> Spray is nice and light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in a better mood as well.</li>
            <li> This product continues to give me the confidence to be more outgoing.</li>
            <li> I love it. :)</li>
            <li> i really enjoyed my spray for women it attracted three people in one day .i</li>
            <li> The spray is more convenient for me, however they both work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t over powering like most perfumes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in the men around me, but I&#x27;m still pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I think when you use this, it&#x27;s more of a state of mind than anything else.</li>
            <li> And I think men did notice more when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> More like curiosity.</li>
            <li> Second, this product smell wonderful by itself.</li>
            <li> Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> it make sex more enjoyable with my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I am more aggressive during sex and he is not.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know WHY they would love it...</li>
            <li> I feel more confident wearing it</li>
            <li> like is more of a baby powder smell after applied.</li>
            <li> After using it I apply bath and body peony cream on top.</li>
            <li> He is more attracted to me and accepting me the way I am.</li>
            <li> It wored well, I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I regret falling for this although it was more of an experiment.</li>
            <li> The guys I work with were friendlier, more helpful, and just hung around for no reason.  </li>
            <li> This gave me more confidence to interact with them and gave me the courage to talk to men</li>
            <li> I have more than 700 bottles in my collection.</li>
            <li> However, even my teenage daughter said, that the smell of PherX is awesome on my neck.</li>
            <li> Nothing more than kissing happened yet.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying it around more people.</li>
            <li> when I wear it, more guys are asking my name, and they introduce themselves to me.  </li>
            <li> , if this Perfume can assist in making a handful of men be mindful how they treat women, then I will wear this all the time making the world a better place, not just Friday nights!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> do agree that the label on the bottle could be more discreet.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that she is attracting more interactions, but it seems to give her more confidence.</li>
            <li> I noticed an increase in attention from men, which was very fun!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for three days, I&#x27;ve noticed that people have been very nice to me!</li>
            <li> All day long I feel as if I have just met for coffee with my best friend.  </li>
            <li> Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> A perfume to use on the days you don&#x27;t want a strong or outstanding scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible - I&#x27;d say it smells like a strong, musky soap.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product quite a bit and have noticed that many more people have approached me and talked to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been good at attracting attention from males, but when I really like that one guy and want to be more than friends, luck is not on my side.</li>
            <li> thing I don&#x27;t like is the sprayer needs to be more of a fine mist or something it seems to come out way too much.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> The pheromones combined with the confidence it gives, does help to gain more attention from men and they do seem to be more friendly.</li>
            <li> Confidence is a huge attraction factor, for instance psychopaths (extremely confident and</li>
            <li> Best money spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only worn this product for a couple of days but the change in my life has been incredible.  </li>
            <li> but my SO has been more attentive</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOTHING BUT ALCOHOL WITH A CHEAP BABY PRODUCT SMELL, NOTHING MORE.</li>
            <li> Day three and great results so far.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have a good relationship, I bought it to give a try and see if really make a difference, but nothing &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> great item, fast shipping, no bad smell.</li>
            <li> If this product does not attract any men, it is still worth for the nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> :) I will absolutely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I just want people to be more friendly.</li>
            <li> and I did not notice any change with my husbad, may be it works with other men :D</li>
            <li> Sweet smell too!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried a product like this, and I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really easy to pop in your purse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in an easy spray bottle&lt;</li>
            <li> Product came very quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I tend to be strong anyway</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not as strong from when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I recommend wearing perfume with it since it does have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of the PherX is fine with me</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> For one, the smell is strong and cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a clean, fresh kind of smell, like a more masculine kind of soap almost.</li>
            <li> So I think combining the two is best a little bit of both.</li>
            <li> Even if it&#x27;s just a smile, a small.compliment, or someone holding the door open for me - it makes me feel very good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in how men act</li>
            <li> I was sitting in a HUGE library at school.</li>
            <li> I very much enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I did receive this free to review.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent for me.  </li>
            <li> It is really light.</li>
            <li> I am 100% happy with this product, and would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone looking to attract a man or bring back the passion in a relationship!</li>
            <li> Its just a cheap perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing this product.  </li>
            <li> It smells cheap.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit musky, but light, not offensive to me.</li>
            <li> She reported a multitude of happenstance interactions with men (a free oil change, conversations sparked at the grocery store, eye contact, extended glances...)</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just need to learn how to enjoy the attention without feeling obligated to go out with every guy who asks.</li>
            <li> I am not noticing any real change in attitude but its nice feeling like MAYBE its giving a boost?</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent and the people around me seem to enjoy it also.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t wearing the store logo, and the door was held opened for me when I had 2 free hands.</li>
            <li> As far as the scent, it smells good like something youd wear to a fancy dinner.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle does spritz out a bit too much perfume in one go, so it&#x27;s best to unscrew the lid and just dab on a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For example, one time I wore it and my fiance was super sweet and lovable toward me, but</li>
            <li> PherX is something I will order in the future for sure!!</li>
            <li> I loved the fragance it does fade pretty fast</li>
            <li> purchased this product to try it out, and so far I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4/5 rating, based solely on the fact that the smell can be overwhelming at first</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Also pretty sure for something like this to work it can&#x27;t be covered up by a fragrance.</li>
            <li> Guys just seem to be MUCH more interested in you when you wear it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my wife.</li>
            <li> Well even in my feed and clean the chickens get on, I was turning my hubby on.</li>
            <li> Strange as it may sound, I&#x27;m also attracted to my own scent!</li>
            <li> Like clean skin.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love to make love, but sometimes during our busy schedules, the drive goes by the way side.</li>
            <li> Some of us smell the nice side only, while others can smell the &amp;#34;cat pee&amp;#34; side :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Used this thinking it would enhance my Friday night love life with hubby, ended up having having men be extremely nice to me when visiting a local grocery store.</li>
            <li> The scent is overall pleasant, and I would use it sparingly rather than bathe in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Zyloo Labs promptly refunded me with no questions asked so it was a pleasant buying experience overall.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I have noticed that I receive more positive attention when I wear this pheromone perfume.</li>
            <li> Nice soft scent!</li>
            <li> The men at the party (Most of whom I have known for 10+ years) seemed very engaged with me and almost acted like I was more funny than I already am.</li>
            <li> Even better, I like the smell, though it seems to fade pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tested the product now for some weeks, using it in special occasions, and I must say that I have found a difference in the way men interact with me.</li>
            <li> The actual scent is pretty strong and is not as pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great smell and and great value I love it definitely noticed more attention in the work place as well as other public domains.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used this product, I&#x27;ve been amazed at how effective it&#x27;s really been.</li>
            <li> I work in customer service, and that day I had a great deal more men than usual flirt with me.</li>
            <li> I was torn between rating this product 3 or 4 stars, but since I like the oil better (and rate it 4 stars), this really does merit 3.  </li>
            <li> Then later I was sitting out in front of my apartment building and another really good looking girl who was just walking by on the street stopped to say hello and ask me for directions to some place.  </li>
            <li> I looked around and it appeared that I was getting more attention than I&#x27;m used to, but I still didn&#x27;t think much of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ugly</li>
            <li> kind of old woman ish-</li>
            <li> Literally, we only have sex like once a month on a good month.</li>
            <li> but nothing like full blown</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m a dollop of sweet ice cream pie they must have.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think guys are more \\&quot;attracted\\&quot; per se, but they are much friendlier.</li>
            <li> The comment I received the most was \\&quot;You smell really good\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I will say the scent is not bad.</li>
            <li> LIKE POWDER , not bad at all</li>
            <li> I find the scent pleasant and anecdotally, I find that when I wear this men tend to be a little friendlier and more flirtatious.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try to hide it with perfume, because I thought that might skew the results of my experiment, but I think that you could hide the scent pretty easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> Strong at first</li>
            <li> anyway,Little strong at first but dosent stay that way.</li>
            <li> But if all that wasn&#x27;t enough, the company truly values your reviews enough to offer you free products for an honest review- good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is MILD compared to ones I&#x27;ve tried with copulins, so if you think this is smelly, don&#x27;t buy Eros or Liquid Trust, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the same time, my attitude changes when I wear because I feel more confident.</li>
            <li> The oil may be better for a date whereas the perfume would be better in a big crowd.</li>
            <li> I got lucky that night.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that you can spray this on, but it does wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t been so close recently, so I&#x27;ve been wearing it, more as an experiment, but I notice he&#x27;s in a better mood when he&#x27;s around me.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older and able to buy things online myself, I just HAD to give this a try.</li>
            <li> When I run out, I&#x27;ll most likely purchase again :)</li>
            <li> Quick answer to my questions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure if someone were extra close to you (like snuggling) it would work better.</li>
            <li> One star for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The perfume is too strong for my nostrils and it hasn&#x27;t had a positive effect on him.</li>
            <li> arrived on time, Has a nice pleasant smell, can easily be used with other scents,only had for a short time, waiting to see results.</li>
            <li> the most even got a few numbers, ordering more for sure</li>
            <li> Husband likes it very much!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, smells great, better than some expensive perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I work in a male dominated industry and I am friendly and well liked.</li>
            <li> More importantly, I like it, and contrary to other reviews, I like the smell and find it makes me more receptive.</li>
            <li> The first day I used PherX a good looking gal walked up and started talking to me at my local supermarket.  </li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t keep his hands off me, he is wanting to be near me and talk all the time, he has a sense of calmness around me and he&#x27;s constantly telling me how beautiful I am....</li>
            <li> This seemed strong and very alcohol smelling.</li>
            <li> he works many long  hours many days in a row and doesn&#x27;t notice when we lack in just being close to one another.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely worked for me and  all my girlfriends!!</li>
            <li> REALLY!!</li>
            <li> I love the soft powdered smell of this scent!</li>
            <li> I do feel the time it was used that men around me seemed pretty friendly...</li>
            <li> ** for no reason at the same supermarket, and the most I did to her was say \\&quot;excuse me\\&quot; very nicely with a smile while passing by her to get bottled water.  </li>
            <li> The cheap spray bottle sprays way too much product to use at one time.  </li>
            <li> worked amazing, wore it and was instantly noticed and commented on.</li>
            <li> but I just cover with lotion to calm the scent.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a HUGE change in the way men act around me</li>
            <li> Not to sound conceited, haha).</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it, I saw a huge difference in my husband&#x27;s energy level and sex drive, that has continued thanks to this spray!</li>
            <li> I wanted to test it on my boyfriend, whom is affectionate enough on his own.</li>
            <li> The smell reminded me of an older woman&#x27;s perfume; strong and floral.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t for everyone though I like to mix with my own, and I only use about one squirt</li>
            <li> The oil has a powdery fresh floral scent.</li>
            <li> soo much fun</li>
            <li> Is worth mentioning that my hubby does not like almost any perfumes or candles etc.</li>
            <li> Mostly just a lot of offers to help carry my groceries and assist me when I&#x27;m out and about.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> We wore it out to a restaurant and had a lot of attention from the opposite sex even though we were minding our own business.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both worked equally well with my husband, maybe because the oil needs closer contact to be effective?</li>
            <li> This is really rare for him.</li>
            <li> so I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> They also seem to be more conversational with me and look at me directly in the eyes.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product and as of yet I have not seen any kind of result</li>
            <li> like its smell also - fresh and unostentatious.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun item.</li>
            <li> Some smelled flowers, baby powder, and fresh laundry.</li>
            <li> Have tried others without success.  </li>
            <li> Also, I am writing professional reviews  for many beauty websites.</li>
            <li> It was a great deal, and I was very happy to pay less than half of the actual price.</li>
            <li> Spray is a light, floral fragrance, not something I would normally choose, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> are more friendly and open to my presence.</li>
            <li> First, product arrived so quick exceed my expectional.</li>
            <li> I went to work and didn&#x27;t have much good response as I have with other pheromones</li>
            <li> highly recommend thus vim isn&#x27;t and their products and recommend you be sure you&#x27;re ready for the results because you&#x27;ll begin a news era in your life</li>
            <li> ; sticker right on the bottle.</li>
            <li> ; sticker right on the bottle.</li>
            <li> tried it right away</li>
            <li> So ladies go right now to Amazon and get buy it</li>
            <li> Me, I noticed right away.</li>
            <li> I also noticed people being more friendly in general, starting conversations more often or complimenting me on one thing or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absolutely doesn&#x27;t smell like cat piss, more like old hair spray at first and then fades into a clean musky scent.</li>
            <li> of my latest experience, i got free tickets , free car repair, free parking passes and at least 2 guys numbers per night.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> This is first time I am using pheromones, just wanted to spice up my life, so results are what expected, first time I used this product two guys to came up to me and started conversation, also this product relaxing me, i am more confident around people and easygoing around guys, I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because the smell is made to attract men</li>
            <li> I was really hoping the hype was true.</li>
            <li> ok i just gave it 3 starts because i received last week, and i&#x27;m ready to start using it today!!</li>
            <li> , I thought I might like it at first, but when I sprayed it on, it smells just like some sweet smelling carpet cleaning chemicals, and makes me want to throw up, and also makes me wonder if this is all it really is.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 2 times so far and on both occations ive had good resaults.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I think its just a soft and easy to used,</li>
            <li> and I believe that the perfume in it is far too strong.</li>
            <li> but it actually blends very well with my own perfumes.</li>
            <li> Touching me more, doing things that making me laugh more( being silly).</li>
            <li> He had a very unusual reaction.</li>
            <li> Shipment was very fast.</li>
            <li> Make sure to rub your wrists and other &#x27;hot spots&#x27; quickly after applying as the spray dries up quickly.</li>
            <li> Sprays a little too much though, other wise good product.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the first &amp;#34;note&amp;#34; you will smell.</li>
            <li> In example, he caresses my arm out of nowhere, walks up behind me and nuzzles my neck while I wash the dishes, and cuddles more while on the sofa while we enjoy our favorite shows/play video games.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll grow to love it&#x27;s scent, and It did technically &amp;#34;attract&amp;#34; men to me.</li>
            <li> you.ll grow to love it&#x27;s scent, and It did technically &amp;#34;attract&amp;#34; men to me.</li>
            <li> No scent product will help you keep a mate, but I believe this one will definitely open the door for more opportunities.  </li>
            <li> But hey, if it does work, then I am willing to give up my scent \\&quot;pleasures\\&quot; to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> You can always add more later.  </li>
            <li> I got much more male attention...</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it was at work, the guys I work with are flirty</li>
            <li> When I wear PherX, I notice that my male co-workers treat me with more respect.  </li>
            <li> I am married and have not noticed any attraction benefits...  maybe.  </li>
            <li> When I wore this the last couple of days at work, the men were more talkative to me and seemed to want to be around me all day.</li>
            <li> I definitely get more attention from men.  </li>
            <li> When I bought this I was with doubt about this product but the first week I used.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten that I applied PherX that first morning rather than my every day body spray.</li>
            <li> I get alot more male attention!</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s see what happens , i&#x27;ll keep you all updated ;-)</li>
            <li> but it can intimidate men and by using the pheremones it can even the playing field a bit and make them more open to sharing ideas.  </li>
            <li> Works better on men who don&#x27;t have low</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I find that my regular J&#x27;adore or Eclat d&#x27;arpege is much more of an attractant.  </li>
            <li> be there is auto-suggestion, but it seems to me that men especially look at me :)</li>
            <li> &gt; the first night, when he got home from work</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> : THE FIRST DAY I tried this</li>
            <li> Oil is also light, not heavy.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent and long lasting!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve taken advantage of the multi pack on my second order because I&#x27;m that satisfied with the product that I wanted to take advantage of the discount price for the multi pack.</li>
            <li> Third, I got many compliments while wearing this product, including my boyfriend and his brother.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it...</li>
            <li> day I wore this perfume to work for the first time, I immediately noticed a difference in both my confidence, and the way men behaved around me.</li>
            <li> First of all: DON&#x27;T smell this product on your skin.</li>
            <li> I will write more later on my experience.</li>
            <li> I would love to come back and tell you my end results....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to cover with similar fresh scent type perfumes, so it wears well in</li>
            <li> So far Pherx Pheromone  is like any other refreshing fragrance, I used it after I shower or before making love to my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li> but I will wear a light body spray just to sweeten it up a little more.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell too unlike some other brands.</li>
            <li> So I spayed over with my current perfume and the two fragrances mixed together pretty good.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, it can be applied with other perfumes if you want to cover it up.</li>
            <li> but I start to feel different when I wear it, like more confident which enhances my allure which enhances my chances with the opposite sex, so it is more of a mental programming product</li>
            <li> but I noticed a real difference in their attitudes towards me, still flirty but more actual conversations now.</li>
            <li> This smells really great: very subtle pleasant smell, a little powdery - my bf likes it.</li>
            <li> The first time it was a guy who made very bold comment about my appearance, while following me at the store.</li>
            <li> man did react positively to it though.</li>
            <li> Interviews, meetings, or anything where to help promote a positive atmosphere.</li>
            <li> is it easy to use, but the fragrance is a little strong.  </li>
            <li> seems to be calm, esp the ones who are normally on the edge.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and whether or not it attracts any guys, who knows for sure?</li>
            <li> Not so much with strangers (Which i don&#x27;t need since Im married)</li>
            <li> If you are willing to experience the advantage that pheromones has to offer, then I&#x27;ll say that this product will guarantee you promising results.</li>
            <li> The first time I only sprayed it twice and both men and women were coming up to me and being more chatty then normal, also brought up conversations were about relationships.</li>
            <li> He is way more passionate in the bedroom</li>
            <li> Does not have a funky smell as some pheromones do, though this one has a mild perfume, doesn&#x27;t last long &amp; can be covered by your own perfume brand if its bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use the &amp;#34;dipstick&amp;#34; method, the small bottle will last a very good while.</li>
            <li> It can also easily be covered up with regular perfume.</li>
            <li> I found it was easy to combine with my regular perfume.  </li>
            <li> It smells a bit masculine, but the scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love each other very much</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t super powerful, so it didn&#x27;t bother me a lot, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t what I would buy just as a perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gay male</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much happier and problems don&#x27;t seem as large while I&#x27;m wearing the pheromones.</li>
            <li> pump sprays out way too much.</li>
            <li> It smells very musty.  </li>
            <li> Very responsive to inquiries and helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more partial to fruity smells.</li>
            <li> , does it really work?</li>
            <li> Even the customers seem a whole lot nicer to me.</li>
            <li> Really dose work.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express an opinion, because I don&#x27;t know if the product really works...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fussy and won&#x27;t wear anything overpowering, sickly-sweet, or cheap-smelling.</li>
            <li> the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommended to any girl out there</li>
            <li> than that I really have no complaints</li>
            <li> if used too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It has caused me to be very relaxed.</li>
            <li> I wore the oil to work with not much reaction but the spray yielded a lot more attention from co-workers.</li>
            <li> All night he was really cuddly and touchy feely.</li>
            <li> very attractive).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Attract Men) really does work.  </li>
            <li> I did not use any perfume with this product and I used a light mist (1 pump) on my upper body--around the neck.</li>
            <li> It really works.&lt;br /&gt;Men will hit on you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, so I don&#x27;t wear it much.  </li>
            <li> &gt; The spray bottle is too much.</li>
            <li> This product really works,</li>
            <li> even so haha</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t think much about it then.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> very close contact with people all day.</li>
            <li> I did not receive one compliment while wearing this for 4 days straight.</li>
            <li> The spray comes out fast and a lot of it too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 days already, nothing unusual happened.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get one thing straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using it because I&#x27;ve paid so much for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very musty smelling</li>
            <li> It smells like cheap cologne for a teenage boy.</li>
            <li> Too much comes out of the spray.</li>
            <li> My husband is normally very affectionate with me, but this repelled him.</li>
            <li> And also I assume it depends on how much you apply.</li>
            <li> But I really haven&#x27;t notice that it really does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My bf kissing my neck much often now)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it around men much yet.  </li>
            <li> My partner is away and am waiting for him to return to get a real evaluation.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is very affectionate and intimate while I wear this product versus not wearing it.  </li>
            <li> This way I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about someone finding out what it really</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this nice cologne for a few weeks at my university and classes</li>
            <li> However, some scientists who have developed human pheromone enhanced products state that they exist and also work on increasing sexual attractiveness.</li>
            <li> The men, however, became very talkative, felt at ease around me,and offered me more services than I would have expected.  </li>
            <li> had read previous reviews about the smell being very strong and almost pungent, so I did not spray the perfume on myself with the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> LIKE MUSTY 4 DAY OLD UNWASHED \\&quot;FEET\\&quot;!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is a little bit strong, but not unpleasant, I prefer to cover it up with my own perfume, but DEFINITELY works, but I still prefer the one I used before, only if I could find it again.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday wear - however it doesn&#x27;t last very long - smell fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very interesting a little strong but it does wear down to a nice musk scent I noticed a little attention</li>
            <li> My opinion is not negative or positive.</li>
            <li> I also noticed other men (co-workers) being more chatty with me.</li>
            <li> so u better use something onthe product to cover it other way it is alright,good even</li>
            <li> smell though, unlike in some other comments, is not disgusting (like a cat pee)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product daily and must say that it has an unique influence on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 17 year old junior in high school who rarely gets recognized.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this really works or not to be completely honest.</li>
            <li> The scent is not your usual modern pungent-sweet perfume smell that is so popular nowadays.  </li>
            <li> but when it dies down it is a nice soft musky smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to compair with a different brand, and I can honestly say that this one actually works, whereas, the other only had a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I personally like the scent but understand why some say it is sweetly and over barring.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty without being overpowering, and it can really add chemistry to your encounter with your significant other.</li>
            <li> in all, not a bad choice if you&#x27;re starting out,</li>
            <li> in all, not a bad choice if you&#x27;re starting out,</li>
            <li> My educated guess is, that when one uses a pheromone enhanced product, his or her confidence increases and this puts his or her boundaries and defenses down, which makes that person look more approachable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even place this on his favorite places to explore, I place it on odd areas to make sue it works; it does.</li>
            <li> the opposite sex is definitely more open to interaction when wearing it.</li>
            <li> Id rate this a decent product</li>
            <li> we play around in the BDSM category, but last night, there was love mixed in with it as well.</li>
            <li> I read in an article that some of us can not recognize the smell of the main component of the pheromone (which is the smell of sweat and urine).</li>
            <li> my mother braggs on how the lucky guy is constantly persistent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be nice if they&#x27;d package it in something more discrete at least, so if it rolls out of your handbag in the middle of your date, you&#x27;re not trying to open a vein with your soup spoon out of mortification.</li>

            <li> So I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone thinking about purchasing it, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Since wearing it on an almost daily basis, my boyfriend (whom I live with) has been more physical.</li>
            <li> Men seem to be want to talk a little bit more when I&#x27;ve used this product at work.  </li>
            <li> I think people seem to be a little more talkative around me.</li>
            <li> and I know that it drives him wild!!  </li>
            <li> smell is not too strong and could be overworn with other fragrances​.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the most effective way for me to do this is to dab a little PherX on my wrists after I get out of the shower in the morning, then on other pulse points, then allow it to dry while I start getting ready.</li>
            <li> Like I previously stated, the smell was something that kind of threw me off a little at first, but I have grown to like it very much.</li>
            <li> From a marriage that was lacking so much in communication and affection it has completely taken180 degree turn.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it that much, but so far it seems to be working, I did notice people looking at me</li>
            <li> I have to say men do look at me longer than normal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually been fun to experiment with.  </li>
            <li> it at least smelled nice</li>
            <li> What I Normally Like To wear</li>
            <li> The oil seems to last longer and the fragrance isn&#x27;t as powerful.</li>
            <li> Okay, as for the scent, it&#x27;s harsh.</li>
            <li> Just bought my second bottle, I have a lot of fun with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice so far, but each time I have seen more response in the opposite sex.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only strong and a little too &#x27;musky&#x27; for me personally, and it seems more like something my mother would wear.</li>
            <li> I was wondering if I had gotten the right one at first, as it was him who I expected to be getting amped up.</li>
            <li> I have heard a lot about this kind of product and really was not sure what to actually believe..</li>
            <li> I ordered this product wanting to try something new.</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t know I was trying out a new \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I recevied a new item like I ordered.</li>
            <li> Every perfume and cologne smells different on an individual but with that said this product is fantastic</li>
            <li> I got no attention other than the normal attention I normally would get from males, nothing special.  </li>
            <li> The perfume has a very light baby powder-like smell, which mixes well with other (regular) perfumes, if you want to apply one.</li>
            <li> Received my PherX very quickly and was very anxious to try it right away.</li>
            <li> It is more subtle with maybe a hint of old-fashioned in a positive way.  </li>
            <li> This person left right after me and literary followed me to the parking lot continuing talking to me.</li>
            <li> Thought it would wrk better than it did :\</li>
            <li> &quot; my husband is back to the way he was when we first dated...</li>
            <li> Four stars for now, I bought the oil and the first night I used it, I wore it to a party which had a mixed crowd (men and women).  </li>
            <li> He seemed all of a sudden very inspired!</li>
            <li> but the two times I&#x27;ve worn it, I have gotten more attention than I usually do.</li>
            <li> and I get many compliments when I wear it mixed with my other musky fragrances.</li>
            <li> People usually do not have that type of reaction to my perfume.</li>
            <li> I think I hold my weight pretty well for being this short.</li>
            <li> When he got near me, he said, \\&quot;Whoa!</li>
            <li> I wore it out to a restaurant with lots of coworkers and I got attention more than usual.</li>
            <li> I found out that it is a little strong scented</li>
            <li> The combination of both is so amazing, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It IS strong at first, but after about 10 minutes the smell becomes subtle.</li>
            <li> After years of being married that spark seemed to dwindle between my husband and I. I purchased several different pheromone products to spice things up but nothing seemed to be working very well.</li>
            <li> B0002UEVCQ Pherone Formula D-17X Pheromone Cologne for Men to Attract Women, with Pure Human Pheromones]]</li>
            <li> I prefer the pure instinct brand i actually got results .</li>
            <li> I am about to try the oil version of it and see if its any better, scent is hard for me to get used to</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had much luck in attracting men with this scent (except for the regular \\&quot;supermarket\\&quot; men who try and make convo with me).</li>
            <li> Clearly she didn&#x27;t need directions.  </li>
            <li> People actually approached me directly &amp; looked me in the eye as they spoke, they became very chatty.</li>
            <li> I notice women are nicer (not as catty men on the third day became indifferent and that professor even seemed ANNOYED at the following class (2 days later) lol Very neat experiment.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said it smells like an old lady</li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer the oil because the Perfume has a much stronger smell.</li>
            <li> So, far it hasn&#x27;t worked.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy scent.  </li>
            <li> It really works I finally got every man ever want to hook up with.</li>
            <li> it has a spray as far as attracting men</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast but it was not to discreet on the label I suggest if you can put instead only perfume or beauty supply because I will buy again from this company.</li>
            <li> My friend had one of these &amp;#34;love potions&amp;#34; and hers smelled completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just received it and so far</li>
            <li> The smell is like an old lady musky smell.</li>
            <li> So far, no men (or women) have complimented me on my scent.  </li>
            <li> It was passionate, and intense!</li>
            <li> It smells like old lady or funeral house.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised at how ineffective it is.</li>
            <li> Just not liking it so far.</li>
            <li> this spray makes him like a wild animal in the sack.</li>
            <li> Guys were acting really freakin</li>
            <li> it smells like old lady roses smell...</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast enough.</li>
            <li> I do like the soft scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if it works, since I have not been around too many people lately.</li>
            <li> The fragaranc left much to be desired but had to wear it in order to see the effects which were no effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Too expensive too see any good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a social recluse at work, and try to retain a sense of professionalism, but I didn&#x27;t mind the small conversations during break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Normally, I am unapproachable, but this product made me strangely social.  </li>
            <li> It is not completely alcohol based like most perfumes, but has oil in it, and so it takes a little longer to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff, subtle &amp; it works</li>
            <li> I did an experiment where I used the spray on one day and not use it the next day to observe this particular guy&#x27;s responses towards me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the spray or a sudden sense of sexual confidence that is giving her the results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s funny that he doesn&#x27;t know that I&#x27;m actually making him physically do that.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because it&#x27;s a little too strong for me</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to hear about it, feel free to skip down to the next paragraph.</li>
            <li> He made me a real from the 50 Shades of Grey book while he was playing.</li>
            <li> but it gave my normal perfume a different smell.</li>
            <li> and they did definitely seem friendlier than normal.</li>
            <li> what I&#x27;ve learned from the little available articles on human pheromones is that 20% of the population had lost its ability to smell pheromones, so statistically pheromones will not work for every fifth person that you are trying to attract.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t found much difference after wearing it, but i just use a little since it is very strong[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Those of us who use the product connected with guys in less than 1 hr of being at the bar, the other girls did not... call it luck or PhernX, but we filled it work!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know what I&#x27;m perceiving as different because I&#x27;m paying attention to it more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily on my pulse points but haven&#x27;t gotten any &#x27;new&#x27; changes.  </li>
            <li> I hated the smell, no difference in attraction abilities, Buy yourself a nice chanell chance istead, trust me, will be better results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a major effect using this product.</li>
            <li> Public places like grocery store lines, at work, my significant other kept saying, \\&quot;what did u do different?</li>
            <li> This is easy, doesn&#x27;t leak, and small enough to put in a handbag and not get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not going to say that it does not work because apparently it has worked for some.</li>
            <li> So far, after trying it out only 2x (and I applied it to the clothes and not on my skin as the product instructions says)</li>
            <li> I will try it out next by applying it directly to my skin.</li>
            <li> I wore this on multiple occasions and never really got any consistent results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the effect the manufacturer describes is true</li>
            <li> It was slow then weirdly bizarre.</li>
            <li> Hands down, this spray really works!</li>
            <li> wore this scent every day at first, but I&#x27;ve gone down to wearing it once or twice per week.</li>
            <li> I had hoped I would find that the other reviewers and I just had different taste, but sadly not.</li>
            <li> Not only have I received compliments on the scent, but the male attraction, wow!</li>
            <li> I did not notice any major effects this product had on me, but I was calm the entire time even as the smell started to wear off (a few hours).</li>
            <li> mixed it in a little bottle with some un scented lotion to calm it</li>
            <li> I wear pheromone based perfumes for social occasions.</li>
            <li> it sprays a lot at once, be careful not to spray close to delicate fabrics, like a silk cami top, or blazer.</li>
            <li> so far I have gotten  more complements  and men would start random conversations</li>
            <li> I mean this guy was so excited after smelling my wrist.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I put a little bit on my pressure points.  </li>
            <li> Other men seem to be nicer, I will order this again and really test the second trial.</li>
            <li> but if its not you and your significant other isn&#x27;t being attentive, I would just flat out , ask whats wrong or what you could do to improve your relationship.  </li>
            <li> It can also be mixed with other soft scent and it wont harm the smell, nor will you have a stink smell.!!!</li>
            <li> Anyway, the perfumes I regularly buy are either musky or clean smelling - lately Acqua di Gioia by Armani.</li>
            <li> a little more attention but not much more than usual&lt;</li>
            <li> We have not been intimate for quite some time due to my pregnancy and some physical and emotional changes in me.</li>
            <li> I put some on right before an interview a few days ago and got an email today that I got the job!</li>
            <li> but, i was feeling slightly neglected in the area of intimate( as in the real meaning: of closeness) closeness and was missing him.</li>
            <li> This, I don&#x27;t use everyday because I&#x27;m saving it for a certain time of use.</li>
            <li> The second time, I sprayed 4 sprays, and the attention that I received was almost a little too much.</li>
            <li> , my older women friends thought it was hilarious, I thought it was a little creepy.</li>
            <li> you need to know the other products I&#x27;ve tried pls respond here since I&#x27;m only leaving a feed back for PherX Pheromone so far</li>
            <li> you need to know the other products I&#x27;ve tried pls respond here since I&#x27;m only leaving a feed back for PherX Pheromone so far</li>
            <li> Then he started paying extra attention to me little by little, by the end of the night, he was in full dom mode.</li>
            <li> but seriously, being attractive helps but isn&#x27;t enough since I&#x27;m the shy type...</li>
            <li> Other products have caused other women to become \\&quot;catty\\&quot; and less friendly.</li>
            <li> Have not tried other brands but will work on natural body production instead after sufficient research.</li>
            <li> so I also spritz on a little of my normal perfume.</li>
            <li> I first had a hard time unwrapping this product, I guess they don&#x27;t want the smell to leak out during shipping, then I opened it and smelled it</li>
            <li> I have noticed some difference in behavior, nothing overwhelming, very subtle changes but that is what I am after!  </li>
            <li> However, I used it yesterday by dabbing only a little bit behind my ear and people did seem more at ease with me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really does attract guys</li>
            <li> The scent does not last long.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> This bottle won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I was still very skeptical because I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work.</li>
            <li> To use the product I unscrew the cap and use the spray wand to put a single drop on my wrist, then spread it around to where I want it, then cover it with my regular perfume.    </li>
            <li> I felt different and other people reacted differently to me.</li>
            <li> Very delicate and fresh.</li>
            <li> That could change in long term review though, will see how this holds up two month from now.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product is really strange.</li>
            <li> since I think I haven&#x27;t used it long</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this PherX Pheromone Perfume with not much expectations, but to my amazement it worked instantly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been curious to try a scent with pheromones, just to see if they actually work.</li>
            <li> downwind(I work outdoors) will find an excuse to work closer.</li>
            <li> I hate to leave negative reviews, but this stuff really doesn&#x27;t smell good.  </li>
            <li> However, I must also say that I have gotten more attention by random guys just walking down the street using the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used less expensive ones that worked better.</li>
            <li> I mean the smell just really turns me off...</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I am in live with this, but it seems to work on some people.</li>
            <li> I finally had to drop some serious hints that I was busy and needed to be left alone.</li>
            <li> This is simply because, after going on dates with 5 different guys in a 2 week period, I got a little overwhelmed.</li>
            <li> The spray doesn&#x27;t stay very long on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very strange.</li>
            <li> I did find that a few of my guy friends started more random conversation</li>
            <li> Major waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got one to try for myself and got another to give to a single friend as a gift.  </li>
            <li> I definitely would not want the opposite sex to immediately identify the bottle as what it truly is, and therefore I hide it from plain view.  </li>
            <li> but doesn&#x60;t last that long, but it comes in a small enough bottle so you can put it in your purse and reapply as needed.</li>
            <li> Men I&#x27;ve known to be very shy have become more talkative around me when I use this.      </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to loose.</li>
            <li> but I do get compliments by both men and women about my \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; and once in a while I&#x27;ll notice men randomly staring or watching me more than usual.</li>
            <li> A week later, my teacher revealed who was the test subject</li>
            <li> Never using this type of product before, I was skeptical but that was put to rest from the very first.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different...</li>
            <li> does not smell bad at all....but use it with caution, using it on one person (love interest)...</li>
            <li> Shy, calm</li>
            <li> Of course, I take care of my hair, feet, nails,, clothes, soft and delicate perfume, etc.</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have is not buying enough.</li>
            <li> I could not really recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> brought back some spark that  we had been missing for some time</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li> REALLY NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.</li>
            <li> The smell is as expected.</li>
            <li> I was really curious when I came across this product.</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps for anyone who is curious on buying this product.</li>
            <li> like I expected.</li>
            <li> but  curious to see if it would work for me...</li>
            <li> and I was curious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about this product for a while</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste of money and can not be returned.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no difference in anyone&#x27;s behaviour when I wore it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am hesitant about is the smell: its not very attractive, but we are all different.</li>
            <li> Ideally, a little should go a long way.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t over do it because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> scent was a little strange.</li>
            <li> it smells a little strange.</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;m pretty funny, but to see people laughing really hard at stuff that was almost not funny, was just weird.</li>
            <li> I have noticed when I use this product people are nicer around me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to wear perfume over it because it has a rather unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> ;, there are other stronger products on the market.m</li>
            <li> ;, there are other stronger products on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used similar products in the past, but couldn&#x27;t find them</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any effect on other women.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product work at first</li>
            <li> For other women now talk to me as never before.  </li>
            <li> at first when I was reviewing the product I was skeptical, but decide to try it anyway.</li>
            <li> I recently received a small promotion and I feel this product played a role in me attaining it.     </li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of the reviews from other customer.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> (well I dont get so close to other males anyways)</li>
            <li> I have used similar products in the past, but couldn&#x27;t find them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone noticed the smell other than myself, though, so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> Tip: Don&#x27;t spray too much - a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Not mentioning all the other men I am attracting.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first ordered the PherX perfume, but I thought it defintiely couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if is due to the  \\&quot;perfume oils\\&quot;, but</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it stays on me longer than other pheromones.</li>
            <li> too long I think they get desensitized after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this product works like it is advertised, but such &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; smells like woman sweat...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not going to say much other than yes I would purchase this again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty insecure as well.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m surrounded by strangers because I&#x27;m in college</li>
            <li> Other than that observation...</li>
            <li> , rather I even had a very negative response from one male coworker who was next to me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way (spray lightly as it has a musk fragrance--it does not smell bad, but it can be over powering if you use a lot).  </li>
            <li> I mean, it practically has an &amp;#34;I&#x27;m middle aged and desperate&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I mean, it practically has an &amp;#34;I&#x27;m middle aged and desperate&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It was not right away that it started working</li>
            <li> My other half loves it on me...and still does not know what it is.  </li>
            <li> and I was not givingany signals that there was a slight chance of me pursuing any contact with other people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not worth wasting your money.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have too much of expectation, I like to try weird things like this out.  </li>
            <li> People who were normally rude were suddenly smiling and wanted to please.</li>
            <li> She took a random kid from our class (without telling anyone) and for a whole week she sprayed this kid down with some pheromone spray to see how others would react.</li>
            <li> Hits you hard, fades quickly, but for 5 minutes, you&#x27;ll smell like a doctors office, or a falling down drunk.  </li>
            <li> This product has NO effect on the same sex, and as a matter of fact, it slightly created a negative effect with women (standoffish).  </li>
            <li> Walked through the grocery and a few other stores.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any trouble attracting guys to begin with, and so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell if I&#x27;m attracting guys because of the pheromones or if it&#x27;s my personality (I like to think the latter!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been wearing this for about a week,</li>
            <li> I like the smell, it’s not very strong, but</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight difference in my interaction with men.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but definitely noticeable!</li>
            <li> I tried applying it on my wrists rather on my neck where the scent would bother me less.  </li>
            <li> You will be amazed before you are half way through with the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of them shy, quiet girls who sits in the back of the room and never gets approached.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice slight differences</li>
            <li> I should say that I have previously tried the oil version of this product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d say manly made older men a little weird.  </li>
            <li> The unsuspecting \\&quot;older men\\&quot; get a little weird though &amp; sometimes stare at me</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to fragrance, and extremely disliked the base notes of the scent, kind of like baby powder, flowers, and dirty underwear.</li>
            <li> All I know is it worked DANGEROUSLY well the first time... and nothing after that.</li>
            <li> starter product for someone not familiar with pheromone scents.</li>
            <li> The scent does smell a little bit like a floor cleaning product combined with cologne</li>
            <li> A little coconut oil maybe?</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on my pulse points and neck and when the hubby went for a hug was like \\&quot;hmm you smell so good\\&quot; and lingered a little longer.</li>
            <li> maybe a little</li>
            <li> This works and sometimes a little too well.</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little musky, a little powdery, but I can see why it wouldn&#x27;t agree with some people.  </li>
            <li> My husband seemed a little cuddly while i was wearing this</li>
            <li> Anyways, the teacher gave us a little lecture on pheromones</li>
            <li> I apply as directed and see little to no effect.</li>
            <li> It seemed to make people a little nicer to me.</li>
            <li> any little effort which boost your confidence and Might work?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the spray nozzle, just a few drops.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> There were a few times that I had to get away for a minute.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I received this item just a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> NOW that I&#x27;ve been using PherX Pheromone for about 3 WEEKS here are a few AHA moments...</li>
            <li> a few follow me around literally</li>
            <li> Same age men seem confused around me.</li>
            <li> waste your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the teacher waited a few weeks so we&#x27;d forget about the lecture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few days</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I bought a pheromone spray that worked.</li>
            <li> I do not use it everyday, but when I use it, I don&#x27;t feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I decided I would try it consecutively for a few days.</li>
            <li> PherX blended well with my everyday cologne.  </li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> do not like to wear artificial scents, but this blend has virtually no scent after a few minutes, but the effect lasts for the whole day.</li>
            <li> and I recommend PherX perfume or cologne to anyone who has tried other pheromones and was disappointed or wants to try a pheromone product!</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but I usually just use a small spray of pherx on one wrist and a spray of a brand name perfume on the other.</li>
            <li> Not a strong odor if sprayed once.</li>
            <li> The oils can leak, and they&#x27;re not easy to apply if you&#x27;re in the car, or out.  </li>
            <li> But i think it at least has somewhat of a placebo affect so why not right???</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the attracting men part, I have never had a problem in that arena.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not confident that it works like it should .</li>
            <li> Maybe I am too old-or past menopause-</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Not Sexy</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not sure about how the pheromone works yet.</li>
            <li> As for myself and the spray, i&#x27;m not sure if it was the product or not</li>
            <li> I was not sure, but it is work!&lt;br /&gt;May</li>
            <li> The hug I got when he got in the door turned into nuzzling and pressing closer than usual.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working, haven&#x27;t notice any changes that would indicate otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure if it attracts men to me.</li>
            <li> I love staying out of the spotlight because I have horrible anxiety, so I&#x27;m not doing this for attention.</li>
            <li> Since I had luck with pheromone sprays in the past, I figured I&#x27;d try this out.</li>
            <li> Not sure...</li>
            <li> but I did get a response from this guy who sits next to me in class, who kept squirming uncomfortably and checking me out.</li>
            <li> He usually doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Also, not sure</li>
            <li> Im not sure if the product works as advertised  </li>
            <li> I usually apply my perfume and then this product, and it works well.</li>
            <li> For one the smell that was very heavy colone</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not very pleasant to me.</li>
            <li> the past, I&#x27;ve read that human pheromones cannot be extracted or artificially created.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because this product wasn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> It has been hard for me at work.</li>
            <li> It is hard to say with precision....</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell how well the perfume</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li> I have had negative responses from women though, so</li>
            <li> It can have a negative effect on women</li>
            <li> This is not instant attraction or someone going crazy for you...</li>
            <li> I am not an ugly, old fat hag either.</li>
            <li> So I was curious and quite skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> No one had as negative reaction to it as I did.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> if not better!</li>
            <li> mean towards u</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy and was not able to even get an email back...</li>
            <li> Smells not good.</li>
            <li> I expected a crazy whirl of passion...</li>
            <li> However, i dont see other men going crazy</li>
            <li> Had a weird smelled did not notice anything... :/</li>
            <li> The cologne version does actually smell a little unpleasant (unlike the oil) but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations but was sadly disappointed!</li>
            <li> he even turned it into a game.</li>
            <li> I sprayed the PherX on my wrists, neck and behind the ears, as prescribed.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all and the scent was unappealing.</li>
            <li> People beside me, across from me, and behind me all wanted my attention.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a false sense of confidence, hoping for a change in people&#x27;s behavior towards me.</li>
            <li> I had serious doubts, but this stuff worked!</li>
            <li> Smells bad but DEFINITELY works would be 5 stars if the smell was raunchy and makes me sick.  </li>
            <li> Considering the sprayer, don&#x27;t expect a bottle to last terribly</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about a pheromone perfume, but my curiosity peaked and took a hold of me.</li>
            <li> Instead, I twisted the cap off and used the spray &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; like a dipstick and dabbed on some of the perfume on the side of my neck beneath my ears, my wrists, and my clavicle/bosom area.</li>
            <li> I am usually shy but</li>
            <li> The one person I had hoped would respond favorably did seem to notice, but it did not affect him as it did random guys.  </li>
            <li> Nothing creepy.  </li>
            <li> give three stars despite the fact that the product did not meet my expectations because I had to instances where creepy guys bothered me.</li>
            <li> I wore it in the mall and had all kinds of guys staring at me and talking to me randomly...</li>
            <li> They give me really weird looks now and act all weird at me...</li>
            <li> I was  skeptical  </li>
            <li> I almost feel they&#x27;re suddenly shy and have become the person I am.</li>
            <li> Sorry, this will not be a repurchase for me.</li>
            <li> &#x27; weird.</li>
            <li> My age unfortunately has classed me as \\&quot;mom\\&quot; so I am checking to see if attitudes shift with use of this product.</li>
            <li> I have noticed random men</li>
            <li> Smells awful - like the worst cheap knock-off perfume from a drug store.  </li>
            <li> Women on the other hand absolutly hate it!</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this he goes crazy for me.</li>
            <li> I have worn it 4 times &amp; nothing, plus it stinks.</li>
            <li> my guy friend is crazy about me</li>

            <li> and I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I will try it for a while longer, but that is if I don&#x27;t get sick from the smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was torn between rating this product 3 or 4 stars, but since I like the oil better (and rate it 4 stars), this really does merit 3.  Here&#x27;s why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good starter product for someone not familiar with pheromone scents. The more potent the product, the smellier it is.  This is MILD compared to ones I&#x27;ve tried with copulins, so if you think this is smelly, don&#x27;t buy Eros or Liquid Trust, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really easy to pop in your purse. The oils can leak, and they&#x27;re not easy to apply if you&#x27;re in the car, or out.  This is easy, doesn&#x27;t leak, and small enough to put in a handbag and not get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like CK1- in my opinion. It&#x27;s got a clean, fresh kind of smell, like a more masculine kind of soap almost. It&#x27;s easy to cover with similar fresh scent type perfumes, so it wears well in warmer seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts several hours. Two sprays can last 4-6 hours, longer on the skin, which is unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I feel happier, more talkative, when I wear it. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s purely psychological, but there&#x27;s something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol base...and that&#x27;s the first &amp;#34;note&amp;#34; you will smell. Hits you hard, fades quickly, but for 5 minutes, you&#x27;ll smell like a doctors office, or a falling down drunk.  For this reason, I actually avoid spraying it while I&#x27;m in the car, just in case I get pulled over.  I have that kind of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump sprays out way too much. Think deluge, tsunami, tidal wave...you get my point. Ideally, a little should go a long way. Considering the sprayer, don&#x27;t expect a bottle to last terribly long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it sprays a lot at once, be careful not to spray close to delicate fabrics, like a silk cami top, or blazer. Yeah. Just don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;bang&amp;#34; I was hoping for. It&#x27;s okay, there&#x27;s that &amp;#34;pick me up&amp;#34; kinda feeling when you wear it, but I&#x27;ve tried better. For the price, if I had to pick this or the oil, I&#x27;d pick the oil from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is...well...ugly. It&#x27;d be nice if they&#x27;d package it in something more discrete at least, so if it rolls out of your handbag in the middle of your date, you&#x27;re not trying to open a vein with your soup spoon out of mortification. I mean, it practically has an &amp;#34;I&#x27;m middle aged and desperate&amp;#34; sticker right on the bottle. And face it, if you&#x27;re getting the spray, you&#x27;re planning on taking this bad boy on the road with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not a bad choice if you&#x27;re starting out, but I&#x27;d go with the oil if you&#x27;re going to buy on Amazon. I have that, too, and I like it better. If you don&#x27;t mind upping the stink factor, and want something that screams &amp;#34;these eggs ain&#x27;t got all night, buddy!&amp;#34;, there are other stronger products on the market.m this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is...well...ugly.

            <li> I noticed an increase in attention from men, which was very fun!</li>
            <li> I have used the product for almost a week now.  Based on my observation, sometimes I can sense that the person in front of me will give me a second or third look. I don&#x27;t know if the product is working but what I can say about wearing it is that it gave me more confidence and I feel more beautiful...oh yeah!</li>
            <li> I tried it several times but it didnt make a difference. The actual scent is pretty strong and is not as pleasant. Not worth wasting your money.</li>
            <li> I RECENTLY PURCHASED PHER X AND I FOUND THAT IT SOED NOT HAVE THE SKINKY SMELL IT HAD BEFORE.  I THINK THE INGREDIENTS HAVE CHANGED AND IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. I WOULD NOT RECOMMNEND THIS TO ANY ONE, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! [[ASIN:B0002UEVCQ Pherone Formula D-17X Pheromone Cologne for Men to Attract Women, with Pure Human Pheromones]]</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if anything is different or not when I use this product. There was a day or two that I thought I could tell a difference, but I am not so sure. I hate to leave negative reviews, but this stuff really doesn&#x27;t smell good.  I had hoped I would find that the other reviewers and I just had different taste, but sadly not. I do not like the way it smells and wish I could return it. It smells very musty.  Another reviewer said it smells like an old lady and I have to agree. I could not really recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I find people respond better to me when I wear it and I feel more confident. It has a nice smell too unlike some other brands. The seller is great too. Very responsive to inquiries and helpful.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this nice cologne for a few weeks at my university and classes and I even got a date, but it could have been that I have been trying to, dressing well and wearing makeup overall. The scent does smell a little bit like a floor cleaning product combined with cologne but I start to feel different when I wear it, like more confident which enhances my allure which enhances my chances with the opposite sex, so it is more of a mental programming product however I have noticed guys looking at me like a deer in headlights, it must work in some way.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about a pheromone perfume, but my curiosity peaked and took a hold of me. I wanted to test it on my boyfriend, whom is affectionate enough on his own. I just sometimes crave his attention and like to get spoiled with cuddles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read previous reviews about the smell being very strong and almost pungent, so I did not spray the perfume on myself with the spray nozzle. Instead, I twisted the cap off and used the spray &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; like a dipstick and dabbed on some of the perfume on the side of my neck beneath my ears, my wrists, and my clavicle/bosom area. The smell reminded me of an older woman&#x27;s perfume; strong and floral. It IS strong at first, but after about 10 minutes the smell becomes subtle. I have grown to like it, actually. I&#x27;m more partial to fruity smells. The last time I used it, I actually sprayed it upon my chest/neck area, and dabbed my wrists. Like I said, I have grown to like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, does it really work? I honestly believe so. Since wearing it on an almost daily basis, my boyfriend (whom I live with) has been more physical. In example, he caresses my arm out of nowhere, walks up behind me and nuzzles my neck while I wash the dishes, and cuddles more while on the sofa while we enjoy our favorite shows/play video games. I also noticed other men (co-workers) being more chatty with me. I&#x27;m more of a social recluse at work, and try to retain a sense of professionalism, but I didn&#x27;t mind the small conversations during break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product to try it out, and so far I am very pleased with it. Like I previously stated, the smell was something that kind of threw me off a little at first, but I have grown to like it very much. If you use the &amp;#34;dipstick&amp;#34; method, the small bottle will last a very good while. I give it a 4/5 rating, based solely on the fact that the smell can be overwhelming at first, however, don&#x27;t let that deter you from purchasing this pheromone perfume. You&#x27;ll grow to love it&#x27;s scent, and It did technically &amp;#34;attract&amp;#34; men to me. Just don&#x27;t expect them to pounce and claim you.ll grow to love it&#x27;s scent, and It did technically &amp;#34;attract&amp;#34; men to me. Just don&#x27;t expect them to pounce and claim you.</li>
            <li> I did try this one and I have to say I noticed the difference in a couple of peoples behavior towards me. I can say for me it worked.</li>
            <li> To put it bluntly, it doesnt work. Ive given it tons of chances and it doesnt work. It smells okay but it doesnt do what it says it should.</li>
            <li> This smells really great: very subtle pleasant smell, a little powdery - my bf likes it. Great for everyday wear - however it doesn&#x27;t last very long - smell fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> Love it. smell is not too strong and could be overworn with other fragrances​.</li>
            <li> I have used similar products in the past, but couldn&#x27;t find them so I took a chance on this.      If it didn&#x27;t stink so horribly and came in a glass bottle I would have given it a 5.  The cheap spray bottle sprays way too much product to use at one time.  To me, the product smells of baby powder and cat pee.      To use the product I unscrew the cap and use the spray wand to put a single drop on my wrist, then spread it around to where I want it, then cover it with my regular perfume.    Frankly, it works better than anything I have tried before!  No scent product will help you keep a mate, but I believe this one will definitely open the door for more opportunities.  I get more compliments from customers at work.  Men I&#x27;ve known to be very shy have become more talkative around me when I use this.      I haven&#x27;t seen any effect on other women.  Other products have caused other women to become \\&quot;catty\\&quot; and less friendly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I do feel like the opposite sex is definitely more open to interaction when wearing it. My only concern is it does not spray out of the nozzle, it comes out like a stream. The smell is pleasant and I get tons of compliments! Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> I first had a hard time unwrapping this product, I guess they don&#x27;t want the smell to leak out during shipping, then I opened it and smelled it, I thought I might like it at first, but when I sprayed it on, it smells just like some sweet smelling carpet cleaning chemicals, and makes me want to throw up, and also makes me wonder if this is all it really is. I went to work and didn&#x27;t have much good response as I have with other pheromones, rather I even had a very negative response from one male coworker who was next to me. I will try it for a while longer, but that is if I don&#x27;t get sick from the smell.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I get more attention when I wear a hat. I would return this but I haven&#x27;t started the process.</li>
            <li> This spray is amazing.  I am not sure about the attracting men part, I have never had a problem in that arena.  I will say the reason I buy it is because my sister had purchased it and I loved the smell, and figured the pheromones would not hurt.  My other half loves it on me...and still does not know what it is.  He just thinks that it is one of my many perfumes.  When I ran out he commented about my being out of that perfume he loves, I said yes that I was and he wanted to buy me more!  I said it was already on its way.  I have very expensive perfumes....yet this is the one everyone compliments me on....male and female!  I am a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had much luck in attracting men with this scent (except for the regular \\&quot;supermarket\\&quot; men who try and make convo with me). I have had negative responses from women though, so I&#x27;m guessing this scent is repulsive against women. There was this one girl who called me a b**** for no reason at the same supermarket, and the most I did to her was say \\&quot;excuse me\\&quot; very nicely with a smile while passing by her to get bottled water.  I&#x27;m thinking it might not work...but I&#x27;m giving it another week, tops. Truthfully, the scent itself isn&#x27;t at all pleasing to me though; I&#x27;ve tried to cover it with my own perfume, but it still smells a bit like cat pee. But hey, if it does work, then I am willing to give up my scent \\&quot;pleasures\\&quot; to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> After purchasing the PerX Pheromone Oil for Women, the company contacted me and asked if I would review the Perfume.  It works - but just like the oil, don&#x27;t over do it because a little goes a long way.  You can always add more later.  Personally, I prefer the oil because the Perfume has a much stronger smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was skeptical about the product work at first but it is phenomenal!!!  Best money spent.</li>
            <li> The first day I used PherX a good looking gal walked up and started talking to me at my local supermarket.  Then later I was sitting out in front of my apartment building and another really good looking girl who was just walking by on the street stopped to say hello and ask me for directions to some place.  Clearly she didn&#x27;t need directions.  She just wanted to talk to me...and must have smelled me before she walked by where I was sitting!  Anyway, I got her email address and we&#x27;re chatting and will date soon.  So yeah, this PherX stuff definitely works.  For other women now talk to me as never before.  So I highly recommend this product. For sure!</li>
            <li> worked amazing, wore it and was instantly noticed and commented on. I got much more male attention...also it smells great.</li>
            <li> I think it might actually work!&lt;br /&gt;The best way to explain this is after one week of wearing a girlfriend (you know the one girlfriend that all the guys flock to) and I went out to a lounge.  After about ten minutes my friend brought to my attention that all the guys seemed to be looking at me. I never notice things like that... I&#x27;m a wall flower.  I looked around and it appeared that I was getting more attention than I&#x27;m used to, but I still didn&#x27;t think much of it.  I even bumped into a couple guys that I knew, who commented on great I looked.  Then a total stranger interrupted his conversation as I walked to tell me that he thought I was simply \\&quot;stunning\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m not ugly but I haven&#x27;t heard \\&quot;stunning\\&quot; from a perfect stranger since I was 25!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I did different is PherX.  I&#x27;m going to keep wearing it.</li>
            <li> So, far it hasn&#x27;t worked.  Smells good though</li>
            <li> Thought it would wrk better than it did :\</li>
            <li> at first when I was reviewing the product I was skeptical, but decide to try it anyway. The first time I wore it was at work, the guys I work with are flirty but I noticed a real difference in their attitudes towards me, still flirty but more actual conversations now. Even the customers seem a whole lot nicer to me. The smell isn&#x27;t for everyone though I like to mix with my own, and I only use about one squirt so it&#x27;s going to last me a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily on my pulse points but haven&#x27;t gotten any &#x27;new&#x27; changes.  It&#x27;s been just a couple of weeks of use, so I&#x27;m guessing I have to give it the test of time?  It smells good tho</li>
            <li> I think it works. Just for one or two hours tho. I am about to try the oil version of it and see if its any better, scent is hard for me to get used to but its not that bad. I just dont like powdery scents .my man did react positively to it though.</li>
            <li> I very much enjoy this product. I have noticed a lot more people approach me, and i am all in all happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Really dose work. I got my shipment next day!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express an opinion, because I don&#x27;t know if the product really works... maybe I need to wait more time....</li>
            <li> I dont know what possessed me to buy this</li>
            <li> This works well! Lots of compliments on the scent by men I&#x27;m dating and I love it too &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product quite a bit and have noticed that many more people have approached me and talked to me. Very nice purchase for me</li>
            <li> I got this product on an impulse to get more hugs from my husband. I&#x27;ve only had it for three days, I&#x27;ve noticed that people have been very nice to me! Even better, I like the smell, though it seems to fade pretty quickly. Every time I put it on I smell something different in it. A little coconut oil maybe? Anyway, the perfumes I regularly buy are either musky or clean smelling - lately Acqua di Gioia by Armani. I&#x27;m very fussy and won&#x27;t wear anything overpowering, sickly-sweet, or cheap-smelling. So if you want to try this but are worried about the smell, don&#x27;t worry. Give it a shot - I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised and packaged well. Spray is a light, floral fragrance, not something I would normally choose, but not unpleasant. So far, I have only used it once and did not really notice any extra attention from my husband. He said it smelled like baby powder...I plan to try it again and hope to try the oil when it is back in stock.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and I work in an office with mostly males.  When I wear PherX, I notice that my male co-workers treat me with more respect.  I recently received a small promotion and I feel this product played a role in me attaining it.     I am married and have not noticed any attraction benefits...  maybe.  I think you need to be looking for it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this. It lasts a long time and whether or not it attracts any guys, who knows for sure? I can tell you I feel good about me when I put it on and I feel sexy. It&#x27;s maybe in the mind but I have been getting a lot more attention.</li>
            <li> Ok so here is my review... I have tried all sorts of pheromone products this one tops them all!!!! After years of being married that spark seemed to dwindle between my husband and I. I purchased several different pheromone products to spice things up but nothing seemed to be working very well. So I gave it once last chance and tried Pherx.... All I have to say is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; my husband is back to the way he was when we first dated... He can&#x27;t keep his hands off me, he is wanting to be near me and talk all the time, he has a sense of calmness around me and he&#x27;s constantly telling me how beautiful I am.... I have even caught him just staring at me or checking me out when he thinks I&#x27;m not looking. From a marriage that was lacking so much in communication and affection it has completely taken180 degree turn. I can&#x27;t thank you PherX enough. Great product!!!! Great smell!!! And amazing results!!!!</li>
            <li> Did not try for purpose yet but I like the aroma</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 2 times so far and on both occations ive had good resaults. The smell of it is exactly the best in my opinoin but the guys seem to like it. Id rate this a decent product</li>
            <li> Had a weird smelled did not notice anything... :/</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of the reviews from other customer. At first, I was skeptical about it. But, what a surprise! This product actually works! I put it the day I got it and went to the mall to see what would happened by using this product. I got approach by men many times. They would flirt and I felt confident! I am usually shy but there something in this product that made me get out of my shell. It&#x27;s awesome I will repurchase. I recommend just dabbing the product in your pulse points. It&#x27;s its a bit strong but you can add you own perfume to mask the scent. Just make sure you put your perfume somewhere else not where the product was placed. Very pleased with the purchased and the shipping was really fast. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this really works or not to be completely honest. But i think it at least has somewhat of a placebo affect so why not right???</li>
            <li> Smells really good,  shipped really quickly.  Sprays a little too much though, other wise good product. I will purchase again.  Just not the spray version.</li>
            <li> The Pherx perfume Spray for women does seem to get people&#x27;s attention. The scent is okay, but I prefer the more feminine scent tgat the Pherx oil has. This seemed strong and very alcohol smelling. Not my preference at all. The oil has a powdery fresh floral scent. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Both the oil and this spray did seem to have men giving me more attention (like standing/sitting closer when speaking to me, and also speaking more candidly, I think). The one person I had hoped would respond favorably did seem to notice, but it did not affect him as it did random guys.  Oh, well.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.. It smells lie cat piss... I got into a car with a group of girls on numerous occasions and heard things lie \\&quot;do you smell that\\&quot;  and \\&quot;it smells like cat piss in here\\&quot;  I tried contacting the company for my money back with no response... I am very unhappy and was not able to even get an email back...I am using pheromone additive, which has a \\&quot;man&#x27;s\\&quot; smell  and I get complimented alot... when i ask girls what i smell like they say \\&quot;you smell like you\\&quot; which is a very good answer.. because they love \\&quot;my\\&quot; smell....  If anyone from This company reads this. please contact me.. i might have got a faulty bottle.. and we can resolve this mix up...&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your time..</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this! Its easier to apply than the oil. Wish the bottle was bigger! I&#x27;ve noticed that my husband is more touchy feely when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This is a bit over bearing. I don&#x27;t use the spray nozzle, just a few drops. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different. I did receive this free to review.</li>
            <li> it works! turns him on like a light! brought back some spark that  we had been missing for some time</li>
            <li> Great smell and and great value I love it definitely noticed more attention in the work place as well as other public domains.</li>
            <li> This spray has the same powder scent as the oil but with an alcohol aroma that makes the scent stronger and last longer. It has been just as effective as the oil for me. If you want more attention then you might want to give it a try. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because it&#x27;s a little too strong for me but I just cover with lotion to calm the scent.</li>
            <li> This spray smells very good  and I get a lot of compliments when wearing it. Absolutely recommended to any girl out there</li>
            <li> This re revered the engine under the hood of my hubby, caught his attention several times, I even experimented with it to see if the stuff could work in any situation..... Well even in my feed and clean the chickens get on, I was turning my hubby on. So I say it must work..&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the sprayer needs to be more of a fine mist or something it seems to come out way too much.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I really have no complaints</li>
            <li> Men seem to be want to talk a little bit more when I&#x27;ve used this product at work.  Does not work on my boyfriend at all and that is why I bought the product. Oh well.</li>
            <li> 5 different people asked what was that smell, one said it smelled like squirrel pee. And it can not be returned! Waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not confident that it works like it should . I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks under my perfume , and haven&#x27;t noticed a dam thing. I prefer the pure instinct brand i actually got results .</li>
            <li> Nice soft scent! Didn&#x27;t get reactions any abnormal reaction. It has a baby powder kinda scent. A perfume to use on the days you don&#x27;t want a strong or outstanding scent. It can also be mixed with other soft scent and it wont harm the smell, nor will you have a stink smell.!!!</li>
            <li> Which has to be the quickest I&#x27;ve received shipping for free! As far as the scent, it smells good like something youd wear to a fancy dinner. Its a very warm scent to me. I haven&#x27;t worn it out yet, but will be sure to keep you all posted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy scent.  It probably just smells different on different folks.  It has a light scent for me.  More of a musky powder scent.  I just put it on then follow up with one of my favorite perfumes.  I have noticed a slight difference in my interaction with men.  They are more chatty these days.  The spray doesn&#x27;t stay very long on my skin.  I have ordered the oil to see if it has more staying power on me.</li>
            <li> When I wore this the last couple of days at work, the men were more talkative to me and seemed to want to be around me all day. It has been hard for me at work. I work in a machine shop with people who were not to accepting of me (being a girl) and I think this has helped. The ones that wouldn&#x27;t speak to me at all, spoke to me on the days I wore this. The one that I wanted extra attention from, gave me plenty!</li>
            <li> Just buy it. It really works I finally got every man ever want to hook up with. It can be addicting and soo much fun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in strangers striking up conversations with me. At the same time, my attitude changes when I wear because I feel more confident. Either way, it works and gets results.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on my pulse points and neck and when the hubby went for a hug was like \\&quot;hmm you smell so good\\&quot; and lingered a little longer. Is worth mentioning that my hubby does not like almost any perfumes or candles etc. he hates most perfumes I have but this he said smells great on me. So I dont know if is the pheromone he is smelling but it works with him. However, i dont see other men going crazy (well I dont get so close to other males anyways) so I dont know if it attracts mates but my hubby loves the smell and therefore I would re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell of this perfume and it makes me feel more confident! I put some on right before an interview a few days ago and got an email today that I got the job! Would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have used similar products in the past, but couldn&#x27;t find them so I took a chance on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it that much, but so far it seems to be working, I did notice people looking at me and I get more attention when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little bit strong, but not unpleasant, I prefer to cover it up with my own perfume, but DEFINITELY works, but I still prefer the one I used before, only if I could find it again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff, subtle &amp; it works</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping I got it in 2 days... tried it right away I loved the fragance it does fade pretty fast or I just got use to the smell I sprey my perfume with it I dab it on even tho it has a spray as far as attracting men even tho I have a husband I wanted to see if it made him handsy maybe a little but I&#x27;d say manly made older men a little weird.  wanting to hug me or just be close to me. I have to say men do look at me longer than normal but the smell I do think it reved me up. I can&#x27;t keep my hands off my hubby he has no complaints.  And neither do I will buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know what I&#x27;m perceiving as different because I&#x27;m paying attention to it more or if it&#x27;s actually effecting things, but it does seem to work. The spray sticks around for about 4-5 hours and seems to relax guys more than anything. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in women, but it isn&#x27;t geared towards them. It absolutely doesn&#x27;t smell like cat piss, more like old hair spray at first and then fades into a clean musky scent. It can also easily be covered up with regular perfume.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the oil because i feel the Perfume is stronger and last longer. A little goes a long way. Even 6 hours later i could still smell the scent.  It made me feel happy, confident and feminine. I also got plenty of stares from men.</li>
            <li> I used this on two different days, without my husband&#x27;s knowledge, in an attempt to see if it actually does anything. He didn&#x27;t act any differently than usual.&lt;br /&gt;The scent was a little strange. It wasn&#x27;t super powerful, so it didn&#x27;t bother me a lot, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t what I would buy just as a perfume. I don&#x27;t think anyone noticed the smell other than myself, though, so that&#x27;s a plus. I didn&#x27;t try to hide it with perfume, because I thought that might skew the results of my experiment, but I think that you could hide the scent pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am too old-or past menopause-but this didn&#x27;t do anything but stink!</li>
            <li> I simply like this.I wish they&#x27;d have it in bigger sizes.</li>
            <li> The product smells similar to baby powder. I think people seem to be a little more talkative around me. But don&#x27;t expect guys killing themselves to get to you though. I would give it 5 stars if it stayed on longer, so therefore I will try the oil instead and see if that makes a difference. But I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Always get compliments! I love the scent.  Makes you feel sexy! Highly recommend this product. Just ordered the pheromones for men to attract women for my husband.</li>
            <li> This product works.  When I wear it I definitely get more attention from men.  Nothing creepy.  Mostly just a lot of offers to help carry my groceries and assist me when I&#x27;m out and about.  It&#x27;s actually been fun to experiment with.  Definitely worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> Smelly and does not work. Give this product to a friend and is very disappointed. It was a bad buy. I have also personally smelled the product and that has no effect. money shot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had one day with the product and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s working. Not so much with strangers (Which i don&#x27;t need since Im married) but my husband seems to be extra extra cuddly and extra understanding when I get cranky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pretty strong. It smells like baby powder- kind of old woman ish- if used too much. So don&#x27;t use the spray nozzle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been good at attracting attention from males, but when I really like that one guy and want to be more than friends, luck is not on my side. I see this beautiful guy, but I don&#x27;t get this beautiful guy. Hands down, this spray really works! I did an experiment where I used the spray on one day and not use it the next day to observe this particular guy&#x27;s responses towards me. I&#x27;ve noticed that on the days when I used the spray, he was more receptive to my flirting even getting all touchy feely with me (Score!). This has made me more confident in my courtship skills. Without the spray, he was responding to my flirtations, but it lacked that excitement the spray brings. The spray itself has a pleasant odor that can easily be masked by a perfume. If you are willing to experience the advantage that pheromones has to offer, then I&#x27;ll say that this product will guarantee you promising results. Hopefully I&#x27;ll get this guy to go to a fancy event with me coming up soon.</li>
            <li> I like the spray better than the oil for distribution. I find the scent pleasant and anecdotally, I find that when I wear this men tend to be a little friendlier and more flirtatious.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was with doubt about this product but the first week I used. I noticed start working. The delivery was fast but it was not to discreet on the label I suggest if you can put instead only perfume or beauty supply because I will buy again from this company. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference, although it does smell really nice.</li>
            <li> Great product. I can see it working.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the smell. Also pretty sure for something like this to work it can&#x27;t be covered up by a fragrance. I feel like it has to have its own sort of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not my cup of tea. My friend had one of these &amp;#34;love potions&amp;#34; and hers smelled completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly......it&#x27;s a hoax, I fell for it and I am telling you from experience, DON&#x27;T GET IT!</li>
            <li> This works and sometimes a little too well. I tried it on two separate occasions at public events. The first time I only sprayed it twice and both men and women were coming up to me and being more chatty then normal, also brought up conversations were about relationships. The second time, I sprayed 4 sprays, and the attention that I received was almost a little too much. There were a few times that I had to get away for a minute. Maybe 3 sprays is the magic number for me.  Also, I liked the smell. I couldn&#x27;t even smell it after I sprayed it on. I definitely recommend  it.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  It says you can wear it with your regular perfume but it gave my normal perfume a different smell.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference from men. :/&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t mind the scent tho. I&#x27;m going to stick with cheaper oils. Oh well</li>
            <li> I hated the smell, no difference in attraction abilities, Buy yourself a nice chanell chance istead, trust me, will be better results. Then, I tried to retun this product, they would not take it because of the substance content. But how did you ship it to me, was not a problem. ??? They, company emailed me if I give a great review, they will send me a free additional product That is how we see some great reviews.  DOES NOT WORK. SAFE YOUR MONEY PLEASE</li>
            <li> I will say the scent is not bad. I&#x27;ve tried it alone as well as with a fragrance. I will testify that the guy I like sure was more frisky when I was around him. Other men seem to be nicer, I will order this again and really test the second trial.</li>
            <li> We went on a test drive with some friends, some of us weared it others did not.  Those of us who use the product connected with guys in less than 1 hr of being at the bar, the other girls did not... call it luck or PhernX, but we filled it work!</li>
            <li> PACKAGING WAS TERRIABLE, IT SMELLS TERRIABLE. REALLY NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THE PRODUCT. WOULD LIKE TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only worn this product for a couple of days but the change in my life has been incredible.  It has caused me to be very relaxed. All day long I feel as if I have just met for coffee with my best friend.  Men are more focused when they interact with me. I&#x27;m much happier and problems don&#x27;t seem as large while I&#x27;m wearing the pheromones.</li>
            <li> Did not work on me at all. Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as it was promoted to.  I can&#x27;t stand the smell.&lt;br /&gt;If it at least smelled nice I wouldn&#x27;t be totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten that I applied PherX that first morning rather than my every day body spray. So I was a little bewildered when men (and women) stood a little closer and struck up friendly conversations during the course of my day. Strange as it may sound, I&#x27;m also attracted to my own scent! I&#x27;ve already praised PherX to my friends and sisters when they asked what scent I was wearing!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very interesting a little strong but it does wear down to a nice musk scent I noticed a little attention but that&#x27;s fine I like wearing pheromone based products they boost my mood.</li>
            <li> I can not say that this is effective at all. I have seen no difference in how anyone responds at all.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve Noticed That Mans Do Like The Smell But As For Me The Smell it&#x27;s Not Sexy, It&#x27;s Nit That Bad .. It Just not What I Normally Like To wear</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely worked for me and  all my girlfriends!! We wore it out to a restaurant and had a lot of attention from the opposite sex even though we were minding our own business.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells really great on its own, kind of a musky scent.&lt;br /&gt;My Tip: Don&#x27;t spray too much - a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had originally bought the oil, which was very enjoyable. Then I received the perfume. I like this a lot better. The scent is the same but it&#x27;s a spray and the scent lasts a lot longer. I wore the oil to work with not much reaction but the spray yielded a lot more attention from co-workers. Both worked equally well with my husband, maybe because the oil needs closer contact to be effective? I&#x27;d still recommend both products. The oil may be better for a date whereas the perfume would be better in a big crowd.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Me and my boyfriend have been together for five years. Ever since year two our sex life has went out the window. Literally, we only have sex like once a month on a good month. I got this in the mail and took a shower and applied this when I got out. Within the next hour my boyfriend came home from work. I greeted him at the door and he nuzzled into my neck and started kissing me all over. This is really rare for him. He is not an affectionate man. All night he was really cuddly and touchy feely. I got lucky that night. Everytime I wear this he goes crazy for me. It smells really nice too. Its a powdery/flowery perfume. It is really light. I used some of my regular perfume over it. I definately recommend this product. I will be buying another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange of my honest review. I&#x27;ve used it for over 10 days and I can draw my conclusion. I was hoping that my partner will  get attracted to me again. We have not been intimate for quite some time due to my pregnancy and some physical and emotional changes in me. Well, no change in his behavior at all. No calmer voice nor more cuddling, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I did my research and what I&#x27;ve learned from the little available articles on human pheromones is that 20% of the population had lost its ability to smell pheromones, so statistically pheromones will not work for every fifth person that you are trying to attract. Also, do not overdo with spraying the pheromone enhanced perfumes because you may get a reverse effect. Even if you are not sensing the perfume fragrance, this has nothing to do with the pheromones.&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I&#x27;ve read that human pheromones cannot be extracted or artificially created. Moreover, there is no evidence of their existence. However, some scientists who have developed human pheromone enhanced products state that they exist and also work on increasing sexual attractiveness. My educated guess is, that when one uses a pheromone enhanced product, his or her confidence increases and this puts his or her boundaries and defenses down, which makes that person look more approachable. Confidence is a huge attraction factor, for instance psychopaths (extremely confident and very attractive).&lt;br /&gt;I give three stars despite the fact that the product did not meet my expectations because I had to instances where creepy guys bothered me. The first time it was a guy who made very bold comment about my appearance, while following me at the store. The second time it was an older super creepy guy trying to have conversation with me while I was having lunch with my friend. This person left right after me and literary followed me to the parking lot continuing talking to me. In these two instances I was with my baby and I was not givingany signals that there was a slight chance of me pursuing any contact with other people.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this product and if I register any change in my partner&#x27;s attraction to me, I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The fragrance is neither bad, not fancy. It reminds me of an very popular perfume which is kind of nice, but will not compliment your coctail dress. So I spayed over with my current perfume and the two fragrances mixed together pretty good.</li>
            <li> Amazing product...works like a charm. I believe I will be sticking with this product indefinitely. And it has a really nice smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to put some spice in my marriage. If it is supposed to attract males it doesn&#x27;t work. I have worn it 4 times &amp; nothing, plus it stinks. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have the oil and the perfume. I prefer the smell of the perfume way more. Pleasant smell. I do think over the oil works better though but the perfume does not make me dizzy. So I think combining the two is best a little bit of both. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in how men act but my SO has been more attentive so I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Boy oh boy, this is MAGNIFICENT. The man I like is 14 younger than I am and fell in the trap as soon as I wanted it. Not mentioning all the other men I am attracting. Of course, I take care of my hair, feet, nails,, clothes, soft and delicate perfume, etc. So ladies go right now to Amazon and get buy it, IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money on this, it doesn&#x27;t work. Very disappointed. My husband and I have a good relationship, I bought it to give a try and see if really make a difference, but nothing &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;. Hubby said smell nice.</li>
            <li> Love the scent!  Little did I know it acts like a perfume.  I just received it and so far and I very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I had great expectations in this product because I saw some buyers said after using it people are more friendly to them and some even attract strangers to stare at them. But on me, it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I used it and went to take a bus. Even the person sitting next to me didn&#x27;t have a look at me. No matter where I go, no one even glances at me. I don&#x27;t get any attention at all. I just want people to be more friendly. But the person who hates me still hates me. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gay male and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the results from this. I notice I get more attention from men. They also seem to be more conversational with me and look at me directly in the eyes. I really enjoy all the attention! It&#x27;s subtle but definitely noticeable!</li>
            <li> I like the smell. Strong at first but when it dies down it is a nice soft musky smell. I always feel good using it.</li>
            <li> I personally liked the smell and it is a confidence booster. The pheromones combined with the confidence it gives, does help to gain more attention from men and they do seem to be more friendly. I will continue to use this and see how things go. Wonderful product overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.  A definite difference.</li>
            <li> I like the aroma. I&#x27;m not sure the effect the manufacturer describes is true but I still like it. A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smile but it does not attract the opposite sex at all.</li>
            <li> This has a very nice smell to it. Like clean skin. Its very nice. It also works for me! I get alot more male attention!</li>
            <li> The smell is as expected. Not sure about how the pheromone works yet.</li>
            <li> ok i just gave it 3 starts because i received last week, and i&#x27;m ready to start using it today!! let&#x27;s see what happens , i&#x27;ll keep you all updated ;-)</li>
            <li> I got the spray and the oil.  I prefer the spray because the scent stays on me better and I like the convenience of it.  I have noticed some difference in behavior, nothing overwhelming, very subtle changes but that is what I am after!  I personally like the smell, it&#x27;s a little musky, a little powdery, but I can see why it wouldn&#x27;t agree with some people.  Overall recommended.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a HUGE change in the way men act around me but I do get compliments by both men and women about my \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; and once in a while I&#x27;ll notice men randomly staring or watching me more than usual. It does have a very nice smell but wears off after a while so I also spritz on a little of my normal perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells bad but DEFINITELY works would be 5 stars if the smell was raunchy and makes me sick.  In love with Pherlure for life</li>
            <li> I was really curious when I came across this product. I found out that it is a little strong scented and I personally don&#x27;t like it, But my husband LOVES it!! He is way more passionate in the bedroom and I know that it drives him wild!!  I wore it in the mall and had all kinds of guys staring at me and talking to me randomly... They immediatly offer up a seat on the bus! LOL!!!!!  Women on the other hand absolutly hate it! They give me really weird looks now and act all weird at me... Must be the Alpha Female Jealousey Syndrome!!</li>
            <li> Conforme con el producto, fue un regalo para mi harmana y ella quedó muy contenta con este detalle! &#x3D;) ...</li>
            <li> I bought it to see if it will work for me. So far Pherx Pheromone  is like any other refreshing fragrance, I used it after I shower or before making love to my boyfriend.  I think its just a soft and easy to used,</li>
            <li> I wear pheromone based perfumes for social occasions. Interviews, meetings, or anything where to help promote a positive atmosphere. It seems to work quite well as others similar</li>
            <li> Pheremones can give an unspoken edge to a situation.  Put some on before a business meeting and you&#x27;ll find you are given the floor more.  It can have a negative effect on women but I think that might be just the woman to woman jealousy that exists already.  I am not an unattractive woman and I tend to be strong anyway but it can intimidate men and by using the pheremones it can even the playing field a bit and make them more open to sharing ideas.  Works better on men who don&#x27;t have low testosterone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the PherX is fine with me but I will wear a light body spray just to sweeten it up a little more.</li>
            <li> This product definitely doesn&#x27;t works...smell like cat pis. Nothing happen!!! I used the product with my boyfriend and nothing happens, I lost my money!!!</li>
            <li> It was just like all the reviews I read before I bought it. Smells feminine and definitely do the recommendation of unscrewing it and using the rod to apply instead of spraying.</li>
            <li> Every perfume and cologne smells different on an individual but with that said this product is fantastic and I recommend PherX perfume or cologne to anyone who has tried other pheromones and was disappointed or wants to try a pheromone product! Also I love this company and their customer service is incredible I have nothing but good things to say about Zyloo.</li>
            <li> Smelled great every kept asking what I was wearing men loved it the most even got a few numbers, ordering more for sure</li>
            <li> arrived on time, Has a nice pleasant smell, can easily be used with other scents,only had for a short time, waiting to see results.</li>
            <li> Received my PherX very quickly and was very anxious to try it right away. It smells wonderful and I have received many compliments on the scent. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the summer weather and everyone&#x27;s in a great mood or if it the PherX but things are definitely heating up.</li>
            <li> Four stars for now, I bought the oil and the first night I used it, I wore it to a party which had a mixed crowd (men and women).  My woman friends were complimenting me quite a bit and almost seemed to want me involved with their conversations more. The men at the party (Most of whom I have known for 10+ years) seemed very engaged with me and almost acted like I was more funny than I already am. I mean I&#x27;m pretty funny, but to see people laughing really hard at stuff that was almost not funny, was just weird. No one knew I was wearing it so they all had no idea that they were basically enchanted by me, lol. So to summarize my experience, it made ladies want to be my best friend and it made men kind of dopey around me, which is at least good for entertainment.  The smell is like an old lady musky smell. I cover it up with a Michael Kors perfume and no one suspects a thing, they even complimented me on hoe good I smelled. (you&#x27;re welcome).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be purchasing the spray to try it out as well, and I&#x27;ll be back to review that too.</li>
            <li> Alright so I just received this product in the mail and I still have a lot more experimentation to do. Although, I did go to the gym today after I applied some of this pheromone spray. While at the gym I noticed women looking at me and men too (probably because i&#x27;m cute! Not to sound conceited, haha). As for myself and the spray, i&#x27;m not sure if it was the product or not but I did have sort of a headache. Like I said, there is still more places I need to try this product. I have a lot of faith in it and i&#x27;m sure it will do wonders. ;) All it takes is about 1-2 squirts under the jaw line around the neck and wah-lah that&#x27;s all you need for the magic to begin! If you over apply the product it will only just repel. I&#x27;ve done extensive research on pheromones that&#x27;s why you hear customers complaining on it not working if you use it improperly. It&#x27;s not a purfume, it&#x27;s a purfume based pheromone so dont be too generous! The smell is nice, it can be applied with other perfumes if you want to cover it up. Make sure to rub your wrists and other &#x27;hot spots&#x27; quickly after applying as the spray dries up quickly. I hope this review helps for anyone who is curious on buying this product. Oh and one more thing, pheromone products are not used for you to believe anyone that your attracting will just pounce on you in the shack, you gotta use your own mojo too! This pheromone is just to enhance how amazing you are to that person/people to begin with!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I have noticed that I receive more positive attention when I wear this pheromone perfume. I have also noticed that I am more confident when I wear it. Great product! \\&quot;</li>
            <li> The pheromone blend in this product smells great, and the effect on people is that they are more relaxed around me, chatty and smile more, too.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like to wear artificial scents, but this blend has virtually no scent after a few minutes, but the effect lasts for the whole day.</li>
            <li> PherX Pheromone for Women (Attract Men) really does work.  A little goes a long way (spray lightly as it has a musk fragrance--it does not smell bad, but it can be over powering if you use a lot).  I created a baseline by using this product before a doctor&#x27;s appointment.  I did not use any perfume with this product and I used a light mist (1 pump) on my upper body--around the neck. This product has NO effect on the same sex, and as a matter of fact, it slightly created a negative effect with women (standoffish).  The men, however, became very talkative, felt at ease around me,and offered me more services than I would have expected.  I did not notice any major effects this product had on me, but I was calm the entire time even as the smell started to wear off (a few hours).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any kind of difference since I began using this product.  I have both the oil and the perfume and neither one has yielded the intended results.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product and as of yet I have not seen any kind of result and I believe that the perfume in it is far too strong.</li>
            <li> I had serious doubts, but this stuff worked! I definitely saw a difference in the way guys acted around me!!</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but I usually just use a small spray of pherx on one wrist and a spray of a brand name perfume on the other. \\&quot; Love it</li>
            <li> great item, fast shipping, no bad smell. would buy this product again. definetly works great, my boyfriend cant keep his hands off me</li>
            <li> Smells awful - like the worst cheap knock-off perfume from a drug store.  The scent does not last long.  I tried applying it on my wrists rather on my neck where the scent would bother me less.  I found no attraction affect at all.   I find that my regular J&#x27;adore or Eclat d&#x27;arpege is much more of an attractant.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I was not sure, but it is work!&lt;br /&gt;May be there is auto-suggestion, but it seems to me that men especially look at me :)&lt;br /&gt;I like its smell also - fresh and unostentatious.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for my English!</li>
            <li> The perfume has a very light baby powder-like smell, which mixes well with other (regular) perfumes, if you want to apply one. I have not tested it on the dating scene, but it definitely helps you get noticed when you walk into an office or a store.</li>
            <li> It is hard to say with precision....I have tested the product now for some weeks, using it in special occasions, and I must say that I have found a difference in the way men interact with me. At any rate it smells good. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I got one to try for myself and got another to give to a single friend as a gift.  I found that there is something to this product.  This is not instant attraction or someone going crazy for you... it is just enhancing what is already there.  Make you a bit more attractive.  I found it was easy to combine with my regular perfume.  My friend who used it also found it giving her nice results.  Great prize and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good. Not a strong odor if sprayed once. I got this for me and my girlfriend to spice things up in the bedroom. Performance is slightly better, I did not turn into the Incredible Hulk like I expected. That could change in long term review though, will see how this holds up two month from now.</li>
            <li> I received this item just a few days ago. I used it when going out with some guy friends just as a test and they did definitely seem friendlier than normal. Even if it doesn&#x27;t have intense effects, it still smells great and I had several compliments on my perfume. I&#x27;ll still be testing it to see the results I get from guys. I would definitely buy this item again, if even just as a perfume.</li>
            <li> Have heard alot of interesting things about Pheromones so I thought I&#x27;d&lt;br /&gt;give them a try.  Have noticed that I am being approached by men alot more&lt;br /&gt;often.  So Primal!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Honestly it smells good, but nothing huge. My husband seemed a little cuddly while i was wearing this but nothing like full blown i&#x27;m going to rip your clothes off and make you hate sex.  So i was kinda dissapointed. I was really hoping the hype was true. I guess not. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on it. Its great to get attention but if its not you and your significant other isn&#x27;t being attentive, I would just flat out , ask whats wrong or what you could do to improve your relationship.  Dont waste your money. Trust me. I got so bored of researching this pile of crap for a week.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love to make love, but sometimes during our busy schedules, the drive goes by the way side. I was skeptical when I first ordered the PherX perfume, but I thought it defintiely couldn&#x27;t hurt. The first time I applied it, I saw a huge difference in my husband&#x27;s energy level and sex drive, that has continued thanks to this spray! I am 100% happy with this product, and would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone looking to attract a man or bring back the passion in a relationship!</li>
            <li> This product works great! I have noticed my boyfriend loves it as well.  I have noticed people are more relaxed and at ease around me.</li>
            <li> I brought this product because a friend recommended it. I was  skeptical  but  curious to see if it would work for me... so far I have gotten  more complements  and men would start random conversations I don&#x27;t know if is due to the  \\&quot;perfume oils\\&quot;, but I like It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sassy</li>
            <li> It really works.&lt;br /&gt;Men will hit on you. I also notice that girls that likes girls will also hit on you.&lt;br /&gt;Some of my latest experience, i got free tickets , free car repair, free parking passes and at least 2 guys numbers per night.&lt;br /&gt;Even my guy friend is crazy about me LOL&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS LIKE POWDER , not bad at all</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different...but I have had people tell me I smell good!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, so I don&#x27;t wear it much.  So far, no men (or women) have complimented me on my scent.  So I think I will stick with my Oscar de la Renta, which I always get compliments on.</li>
            <li> excellent product! I see a difference in the way men treat me. They like to gather around my desk at work!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to compair with a different brand, and I can honestly say that this one actually works, whereas, the other only had a nice smell. I do like the fact that you can spray this on, but it does wear off quickly. I would like to try the oil, being that it is stronger and should last a bit longer.  I am very happy with this product. It does what it says!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was skeptical at first. But I ordered it and gave myself a week to test it out. You will be amazed before you are half way through with the bottle. I use it just as if it were cologne. It scent is great and I could feel my confidence rise. I have a lot of people come up to me and ask what is the name of the scent that I wear. PherX Pheromone is a magnet for women. I&#x27;m definite will be buying some more... the only complaint I have is not buying enough.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF STINKS!! IT SMELL LIKE MUSTY 4 DAY OLD UNWASHED \\&quot;FEET\\&quot;!!! IT SMELL LIKE SOMEBODY&#x27;S DEODORANT STOP WORKING BEFORE IT STARTED!!! REALLY!! ATTRACT MEN?? THIS STUFF WILL MAKE A MAN GO UP SIDE UR HEAD FOR NOT WASHING!!!THANK GOD I&#x27;M CUTE!!!</li>
            <li> Things to know:&lt;br /&gt; The spray bottle is too much. I unscrew it and rub the tub on my wrist like a dipper bottle. Two or three drops on wrist, behinds ears,&lt;br /&gt;You do not need a lot. I personally like the scent but understand why some say it is sweetly and over barring. JUST USE A LITTLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it in a little bottle with some un scented lotion to calm it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I didn&#x27;t have too much of expectation, I like to try weird things like this out.  My husband and I love each other very much but, i was feeling slightly neglected in the area of intimate( as in the real meaning: of closeness) closeness and was missing him. he works many long  hours many days in a row and doesn&#x27;t notice when we lack in just being close to one another. I thought I would try this to see as he is receptive to the way I smell. He notices when I switch hair products and soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; the first night, when he got home from work I wore it. The hug I got when he got in the door turned into nuzzling and pressing closer than usual. It was a nice linger. He was more touchy and sweeter, which is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second night, more touchy and wanting to be close. Over the next week or so I wore it and he was more receptive and responsive. Touching me more, doing things that making me laugh more( being silly). More intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped wearing it for about two weeks to see if it made a difference and&lt;br /&gt;what I can say is when I wear it, I get more/noticeable attention ( nozzles, cuddles, idle touching). So it works on some level for me.</li>
            <li> This product really works, when you used  it you noticed the difference in people around you. If you want to catch the attention of people you just have to use this product.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOTHING BUT ALCOHOL WITH A CHEAP BABY PRODUCT SMELL, NOTHING MORE. PRODUCT IS NOT AS REPRESENTED.</li>
            <li> This really works! Thank you</li>
            <li> The seller is perfect A++++.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. Its just a cheap perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Does not work.</li>
            <li> Husband likes it very much!</li>
            <li> I have heard a lot about this kind of product and really was not sure what to actually believe..So, I figured the best thing was to just give it a try, and that is what I did.  Ordered this product and just put it on as it comes in a spray bottle which I love.  Walked through the grocery and a few other stores.  Attraction is what it does, guys stopped me to ask about something where I was looking, just to talk.  This product really works and it smells great also.  Now when I go someplace different and I know there are going to be men around...you guessed it, I am sure to spray some of this PherX Pheromone Perfume on just for the heck of it as you never know who you can or will attract.</li>
            <li> SO here&#x27;s the story...&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 different types of Pheromone for women &amp; each one seems to give me results but I like this one the best because...&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s in an easy spray bottle&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not have a funky smell as some pheromones do, though this one has a mild perfume, doesn&#x27;t last long &amp; can be covered by your own perfume brand if its bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY PERSONALITY TYPE: Shy, calm but I do get my share of attention even so haha no but seriously, being attractive helps but isn&#x27;t enough since I&#x27;m the shy type... besides every girl needs more than just being oggled at &amp; being called \\&quot;sweety\\&quot; !!! I look way younger than my years, doesn&#x27;t help at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS: THE FIRST DAY I tried this I was going to an art opening &amp; I noticed a couple of things. People actually approached me directly &amp; looked me in the eye as they spoke, they became very chatty. I did have a couple of crazy incidents with men but things like that have happened even otherwise so I didn&#x27;t think much about it then.&lt;br /&gt;BUT NOW that I&#x27;ve been using PherX Pheromone for about 3 WEEKS here are a few AHA moments...&lt;br /&gt;1. Women seem to  talk to me constantly &amp; tell me I have a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; &amp; I look amazing! I personally feel it&#x27;s my makeup skills but there&#x27;s more to it.&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;ve noticed whenever I have this on every one around me seems to be calm, esp the ones who are normally on the edge. People talk to me with respect &amp; look me in the eye &amp; don&#x27;t treat me like \\&quot;sweety\\&quot;, I hate that.&lt;br /&gt;3. The unsuspecting \\&quot;older men\\&quot; get a little weird though &amp; sometimes stare at me like I&#x27;m a dollop of sweet ice cream pie they must have. I swear I&#x27;ve had a few follow me around literally, my older women friends thought it was hilarious, I thought it was a little creepy. One gave me a peck on my cheek out of the blue :/&lt;br /&gt;4. Same age men seem confused around me. I almost feel they&#x27;re suddenly shy and have become the person I am. I&#x27;m still experimenting on this segment... give me time ladies &amp; I&#x27;ll get back to you with this bit.&lt;br /&gt;If you need to know the other products I&#x27;ve tried pls respond here since I&#x27;m only leaving a feed back for PherX Pheromone so far Fav. TRY IT!ime ladies &amp; I&#x27;ll get back to you with this bit.&lt;br /&gt;If you need to know the other products I&#x27;ve tried pls respond here since I&#x27;m only leaving a feed back for PherX Pheromone so far Fav. TRY IT!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really does attract guys but it smells really good and gives me a confidence boost!  Have both the spray and the oil - like them both equally. Both smell the same to me. Spray is nice and light. Oil is also light, not heavy. I will be reordering this product!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working, haven&#x27;t notice any changes that would indicate otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasant, there&#x27;s days where it even gives me a headache. One spray on the wrist rubbed together and hope not to get a headache. Sorry, this will not be a repurchase for me.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I am in live with this, but it seems to work on some people. The only thing I am hesitant about is the smell: its not very attractive, but we are all different. Other than that, it stays on me longer than other pheromones.</li>
            <li> I tried the PherXPheromone  to see if I could get some attention from my husband and he didn&#x27;t even notice me I was very very disappointed</li>
            <li> I like the spray is it easy to use, but the fragrance is a little strong.  It doesn&#x27;t last long.  The oil seems to last longer and the fragrance isn&#x27;t as powerful.</li>
            <li> The perfume is too strong for my nostrils and it hasn&#x27;t had a positive effect on him. I&#x27;ll give it more time.</li>
            <li> I work n very close contact with people all day. I did not receive one compliment while wearing this for 4 days straight. The spray comes out fast and a lot of it too. This bottle won&#x27;t last long. I have quit using it. Too expensive too see any good results.</li>
            <li> Works...believe it or not! I work in a situation of &amp;#34;no fragrance allowed&amp;#34;  but this item works as well as any perfume...if not better!</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this and I think my boyfriend does too. We haven&#x27;t been so close recently, so I&#x27;ve been wearing it, more as an experiment, but I notice he&#x27;s in a better mood when he&#x27;s around me. I&#x27;ve been in a better mood as well. I think the pheromones must also increase happiness. :) I will absolutely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This product worked wonders! it kind of worked in steps for me. At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything. Then I started feeling all kinds of forward and frisky. I was wondering if I had gotten the right one at first, as it was him who I expected to be getting amped up. Then he started paying extra attention to me little by little, by the end of the night, he was in full dom mode. we play around in the BDSM category, but last night, there was love mixed in with it as well. he even turned it into a game. He made me a real from the 50 Shades of Grey book while he was playing. If I stopped reading, he stopped playing. He seemed all of a sudden very inspired! It was passionate, and intense! Definitely using again.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend &amp; I have been together for 2.5 years, sex stopped after 2 months. I&#x27;ve tried everything. We recently found out that his testosterone level is low but I was hoping this may help. It didn&#x27;t at all. No reaction from him whatsoever! I used this when we went away in addition to when we have time together. I had high expectations but was sadly disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have noticed when I use this product people are nicer around me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to wear perfume over it because it has a rather unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This product continues to give me the confidence to be more outgoing. The response from men has been amazing. I love it. :)</li>
            <li> This product definitely works...does not smell bad at all....but use it with caution, using it on one person (love interest)... too long I think they get desensitized after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I try the product yesterday and I did not notice any change with my husbad, may be it works with other men :D But I will use and I&#x27;ll tell you if it works or not.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase for my girl friend as a sticking stuffer and she absolutely loved it! It has a great scent and long lasting! Something about it just makes her more confident and feels sexy! Would recommend to all</li>
            <li> I recently had my second child and I gained about 20 pounds I can&#x27;t seem to loose. Though my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t complain about my looks, I still have the desire to feel good as well. After reading reviews, I was still very skeptical because I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work. I have only had it about a week but the two times I&#x27;ve worn it, I have gotten more attention than I usually do. Granted, guys aren&#x27;t chasing after me or anything but I do like the feedback I&#x27;m getting. Even if it&#x27;s just a smile, a small.compliment, or someone holding the door open for me - it makes me feel very good. PherX is something I will order in the future for sure!!</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks. I mean the smell just really turns me off...can&#x27;t see how it could attract anyone...It is more like a repellant..yuck!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 days already, nothing unusual happened.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend hated the smell. It smells like old lady or funeral house. Gosh!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff smells like a funeral home and it doesnt work!!!! do not buy it is a total scam. NOT WORTH IT!!!</li>
            <li> i really enjoyed my spray for women it attracted three people in one day .i think i will order this again and will keep using it in the further.</li>
            <li> :( so disappointed this product stink really bad i used for christmas party and mi boy-friends say i smell like i didn&#x27;t take a shower and girls says i smell like i dont used deodorant  can i return it im so  disappointed</li>
            <li> I am not sure this product works like it is advertised, but such &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; smells like woman sweat...</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing this product.  The smell is musky and I get many compliments when I wear it mixed with my other musky fragrances. It makes me feel good and more confident...not sure if it attracts men to me. Still testing it out.</li>
            <li> I purchased the oil as well as the spray. Let&#x27;s talk about the spray. I sprayed the PherX on my wrists, neck and behind the ears, as prescribed. I followed up with some of my own perfume. (You could still smell the PherX.) I went into a store an hour later to purchase something as decided to ask the guy at the counter to smell the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; on my wrist. He had a very unusual reaction. I mean this guy was so excited after smelling my wrist. People usually do not have that type of reaction to my perfume. Let me just say I get attention without the PherX spray. However, I must also say that I have gotten more attention by random guys just walking down the street using the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one is best??? The spray is more convenient for me, however they both work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my review on the oil - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MOP5VYXN7IMD</li>
            <li> This product does everything you would be purchasing it for. From the first time I used this product, I&#x27;ve been amazed at how effective it&#x27;s really been. Never using this type of product before, I was skeptical but that was put to rest from the very first. I can&#x27;t thank this company enough for bringing back the spark in my marriage. Plus they&#x27;re discreet with their billing and their packaging so you need not be worried that the neighbors will guess what you&#x27;re having sent to your home. Now I&#x27;ve taken advantage of the multi pack on my second order because I&#x27;m that satisfied with the product that I wanted to take advantage of the discount price for the multi pack. But if all that wasn&#x27;t enough, the company truly values your reviews enough to offer you free products for an honest review- good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend thus vim isn&#x27;t and their products and recommend you be sure you&#x27;re ready for the results because you&#x27;ll begin a news era in your life if lists of shared gun sigh the partner of our choice!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice smell. I have another review in this so I&#x27;m not going to say much other than yes I would purchase this again</li>
            <li> I ordered this product wanting to try something new. I am very pleased with the scent. It isn&#x27;t over powering like most perfumes. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in the men around me, but I&#x27;m still pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all and the scent was unappealing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a lot from this, but wanted to see if it worked anyway.  The first time I used it, I put a little bit on my pressure points.  After that, I was off to the airport to catch a flight.  While waiting at the gate, everyone wanted to chat with me, men and women both.  People beside me, across from me, and behind me all wanted my attention.  Normally, I am unapproachable, but this product made me strangely social.  It happened throughout the rest of that trip.  People who were normally rude were suddenly smiling and wanted to please.</li>
            <li> I think when you use this, it&#x27;s more of a state of mind than anything else. Sort of a &amp;#34;if you think it&#x27;s working, then you&#x27;ll feel sexier and if you feel sexier you&#x27;ll look sexier..&amp;#34; kind of thing.  It smells a bit masculine, but the scent fades quickly. I just put it on with my own perfume. Would I recommend this? Yes .. sure! It&#x27;s a fun item.</li>
            <li> I love the soft powdered smell of this scent! And I think men did notice more when I&#x27;m wearing it. My husband kept kissing my neck and sniffing me. And acted like an animal. Yeah.... I&#x27;d say they respond to it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, smells great, better than some expensive perfumes.  I already started wearing it and have been complimented on it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> I did find that a few of my guy friends started more random conversation some even played around n nudged me .. And my boyfriend has a love/hate thing with it.. Lol he said to give it away.. But i love it!! Sweet smell too! One pump is enough!</li>
            <li> I just received this item, the smell is very very strong. almost like a mans underarms. i dont know if this is what is supposed to smell like or not. i havent been outside yet to notice the affect but my husband couldn&#x27;t smell anything bad when he smelt it yet the scent was very strong to me.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was quite ecstatic to try this product out. I&#x27;m a 17 year old junior in high school who rarely gets recognized. I&#x27;m one of them shy, quiet girls who sits in the back of the room and never gets approached. Let&#x27;s get one thing straight. I love staying out of the spotlight because I have horrible anxiety, so I&#x27;m not doing this for attention. More like curiosity. I remember in 8th grade doing an experiment with my science class. If you don&#x27;t want to hear about it, feel free to skip down to the next paragraph. Anyways, the teacher gave us a little lecture on pheromones and I was curious. She took a random kid from our class (without telling anyone) and for a whole week she sprayed this kid down with some pheromone spray to see how others would react. Me, I noticed right away. But the teacher waited a few weeks so we&#x27;d forget about the lecture.  I remember looking back at him from my seat and wondering what on earth made me so attracted to him. I&#x27;ve never noticed him before. Why now? I know it wasn&#x27;t because he was \\&quot;attractive\\&quot;, because he wasn&#x27;t. To me, anyways. Acne face, dyed blonde, &#x27;emo&#x27; hair cut, not my type. A week later, my teacher revealed who was the test subject and I was shocked. Now that I&#x27;m older and able to buy things online myself, I just HAD to give this a try. I did a lot of research and I figured this would be the one to try.      I&#x27;m pretty insecure as well. I&#x27;m 5&#x27; even and over 250lbs. I think I hold my weight pretty well for being this short. Anyways, I see no effect using this product. I apply as directed and see little to no effect. It gives me a false sense of confidence, hoping for a change in people&#x27;s behavior towards me. And as the day went on, I couldn&#x27;t help but roll my eyes at how ineffective this product is. Once it came to 5th hour, English class, a guy I sit next to said my name and I felt a gleam of hope within me. My doubts on this product momentarily disappeared until he asked to borrow my pencil... to write hisnumber on a piece of paper for me!!!    Sike..I wish. He just needed to write his name on an assignment he was turning in and that was the end to that. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few days and I&#x27;m surprised at how ineffective it is. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this product, further your research. Read reviews, even look it up online know what you&#x27;re paying for before you buy it.    Okay, as for the scent, it&#x27;s harsh. I couldn&#x27;t make out what it was, but it&#x27;s definitely not \\&quot;floral\\&quot; and it definitely doesn&#x27;t go away. It&#x27;s just not as strong from when you put it on. The closest I can describe it is urine. I have to cover it up with my perfume, which makes me wonder if that&#x27;s what might be canceling out the effect of the pheromones. But I can&#x27;t just leave it on without nothing to cover the scent. It&#x27;ll drive guy away from me! Not attract them! This product might work for some, just not for me. I&#x27;ll continue using it because I&#x27;ve paid so much for it. 3 stars because I still have hope for this product. Just not liking it so far. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried a product like this, and I love it! The spray doesn&#x27;t smell at all like cat piss (this was said in a review about this product), but it does smell a bit like baby powder. Oh well. I don&#x27;t think guys are more \\&quot;attracted\\&quot; per se, but they are much friendlier. When I run out, I&#x27;ll most likely purchase again :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it attracts men.. it smells a little strange. It&#x27;s very musty smelling but it actually blends very well with my own perfumes.</li>
            <li> First, product arrived so quick exceed my expectional. Thank you to the seller. Second, this product smell wonderful by itself. If this product does not attract any men, it is still worth for the nice fragrance. Third, I got many compliments while wearing this product, including my boyfriend and his brother. Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> the product was ok but was very strong smell so u better use something onthe product to cover it other way it is alright,good even</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!!!. it make sex more enjoyable with my boyfriend. I am more aggressive during sex and he is not. this spray makes him like a wild animal in the sack. I shall keep this on stand by at all times. I don&#x27;t even place this on his favorite places to explore, I place it on odd areas to make sue it works; it does. treat yourself ladies. If your man needs a boost, give it to him!!!!</li>
            <li> I repeat, do not buy! I&#x27;ve been curious about this product for a while and I had to know for myself once and for all. I tried using the product on several occasions by itself or layered underneath a lotion or perfume. For one, the smell is strong and cheap. You&#x27;ll like it for you want that smell of musk. I noticed no difference in the way men responded or interacted with me any of the times when I wore the scent. Do yourselves a favor and avoid this dud. I believe in the power of pheromones but this is not the one!</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I bought a pheromone spray that worked. It seemed to make people a little nicer to me. Since I had luck with pheromone sprays in the past, I figured I&#x27;d try this out. It smells like cheap cologne for a teenage boy. I only sprayed it once and gave me a headache. Too much comes out of the spray. My husband didn&#x27;t know I was trying out a new \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;. When he got near me, he said, \\&quot;Whoa! That&#x27;s a lot of perfume!\\&quot; He didn&#x27;t like the smell, so I tried to wash it off. I couldn&#x27;t wash it off, so I tried putting my own perfume over it, but that didn&#x27;t help. My husband is normally very affectionate with me, but this repelled him. I was thinking that this product didn&#x27;t work. However, I used it yesterday by dabbing only a little bit behind my ear and people did seem more at ease with me. I still haven&#x27;t made up my mind about it.</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste of money and can not be returned. It repelled my husband, not attracted him. It smells cheap.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product is really strange. The first day I used it... it was FREAKY...  Guys were acting really freakin&#x27; weird. I was sitting in a HUGE library at school. This guy just came over sat next to me and started talking. He then came to sit next to me on the couch within 1 min, moved my phone FOR me and grazed my thigh as he set it on my lap... once I had enough I left to go on the computer.... weirdo followed me I finally had to drop some serious hints that I was busy and needed to be left alone. He mentioned something about being sorry for touching me which yea I didn&#x27;t like. Anyway he finally left. Later that afternoon it even got my professor being... lol very happy to see me that day lol I don&#x27;t know how else to explain it... Guys would notice the smell they loved it.. I don&#x27;t know WHY they would love it... it smells like old lady roses smell... with ALL that said... it stopped working.. at the reactions I was getting disappeared... I tried not using it for a while... even a month or two.. try again... nothing... I notice women are nicer (not as catty men on the third day became indifferent and that professor even seemed ANNOYED at the following class (2 days later) lol Very neat experiment. I wonder if it went stale/bad? Not sure... lol I wear it once in a while but I don&#x27;t see it doing anything. Perhaps the pheromones died off in it and the smell is just left. All I know is it worked DANGEROUSLY well the first time... and nothing after that. Very strange.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a major effect using this product. I do not use it everyday, but when I use it, I don&#x27;t feel a difference. I&#x27;m gonna give it a shot for a while, since I think I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.&lt;br /&gt;The smell though, unlike in some other comments, is not disgusting (like a cat pee) at all :) It has a nice smell. I read in an article that some of us can not recognize the smell of the main component of the pheromone (which is the smell of sweat and urine). This explains the opposite comments in product review. Some of us smell the nice side only, while others can smell the &amp;#34;cat pee&amp;#34; side :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it for a longer while and then will share my final review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it lures men or not but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice slight differences&lt;br /&gt;Get a little more attention but not much more than usual&lt;br /&gt;Especially when I get a compliment on my scent&lt;br /&gt;Plus I feel more confident wearing it</li>
            <li> It works but you have to get close to someone. You just don&#x27;t walk around, attracting people.</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast enough. I recevied a new item like I ordered. It was a great deal, and I was very happy to pay less than half of the actual price.</li>
            <li> I am not going to say that it does not work because apparently it has worked for some. However, I did not notice any effects from using this product. I am not an ugly, old fat hag either. I was very disappointed because this product wasn&#x27;t cheap. I have used less expensive ones that worked better.</li>
            <li> I should say that I have previously tried the oil version of this product. The cologne version does actually smell a little unpleasant (unlike the oil) but nothing too bad. And also I assume it depends on how much you apply. I just spray my wrist once and then rub my 2 wrists together. It works I think. I wore it out to a restaurant with lots of coworkers and I got attention more than usual. To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if this works or it is just placebo effect. But I had a good experience.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything. I think any perceived changes you may experience after using this are just a placebo effect. I wore this on multiple occasions and never really got any consistent results. For example, one time I wore it and my fiance was super sweet and lovable toward me, but then another time I wore it and we got in an argument. I wore it to work and didn&#x27;t notice any changes in behavior from any of my coworkers. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t smell terribly great. It&#x27;s not horrible - I&#x27;d say it smells like a strong, musky soap. It gave me a terrible headache a couple of the times I wore it, so I don&#x27;t think the scent is for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This perfume smell good but when you put it on on use 1 spray because if you use more than this you will definately get a headache from the smell because he has a very strong smell. But I really haven&#x27;t notice that it really does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Excellent client service. Quick answer to my questions. I have not tried the prouct yet, but I will do it asap.</li>
            <li> So I was curious and quite skeptical about this product. It was not right away that it started working and I almost quit using it -but I decided I would try it consecutively for a few days. It was slow then weirdly bizarre. It was working. So I noticed a great deal of attention from men- everywhere. Public places like grocery store lines, at work, my significant other kept saying, \\&quot;what did u do different? You look so pretty.\\&quot; It not only seemed to work on men but the women I interacted were gentler. I started feeling different too. I cannot put my finger on it&lt;br /&gt;but I felt different and other people reacted differently to me.</li>
            <li> Smells not good. No result at all. Men&#x27;s attention did not increase.</li>
            <li> I bought the oil version of this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any trouble attracting guys to begin with, and so it&#x27;s hard for me to tell if I&#x27;m attracting guys because of the pheromones or if it&#x27;s my personality (I like to think the latter!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been wearing this for about a week, but I did get a response from this guy who sits next to me in class, who kept squirming uncomfortably and checking me out. He usually doesn&#x27;t do that. Other than that, I&#x27;m surrounded by strangers because I&#x27;m in college so it&#x27;s hard to tell how well the perfume works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure if someone were extra close to you (like snuggling) it would work better.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit musky, but light, not offensive to me. Nice spray application.  However, I can not say that the pheromone aspect works.</li>
            <li> While applying before her date nights my mother braggs on how the lucky guy is constantly persistent.</li>
            <li> I found that this product does not work whatsoever.  I got no attention other than the normal attention I normally would get from males, nothing special.  The product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product daily and must say that it has an unique influence on me. For one the smell that was very heavy colone like is more of a baby powder smell after applied. Also, not sure but I feel it gives me confidence and improves my mood. After using it I apply bath and body peony cream on top. Four stars because it is yet to proove effective on others.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the recommendation of a close friend, who had been using the PherX spray for a couple weeks herself. She reported a multitude of happenstance interactions with men (a free oil change, conversations sparked at the grocery store, eye contact, extended glances...) so I thought &amp;#34;hey! This product is for me!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered in a timely manner and packaged properly. I am very sensitive to fragrance, and extremely disliked the base notes of the scent, kind of like baby powder, flowers, and dirty underwear. I sprayed my own perfume over the PherX and went to work. I work in retail and have noticed on the days that I wear the Pherx, the customers (men and women) are more friendly and open to my presence. I have only tried it for about a week, and will continue to document my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed the amazing results that my friend had insisted happened to her. Not sure if it&#x27;s the spray or a sudden sense of sexual confidence that is giving her the results. I definitely am intrigued by seeing the friendlier demeanor presented towards me by my customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, I had both my neighbors and my coworkers (men and women) smell the scent, and everyone had different opinions. Some smelled flowers, baby powder, and fresh laundry. No one had as negative reaction to it as I did. Plus, you can spray your favorite perfume over the PherX if you want ~ so don&#x27;t let my nose decide against it for you!</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it affected my relationship with my husband. He is more attracted to me and accepting me the way I am. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing.  Have tried others without success.  This product is a bit expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if the product works as advertised  but I do like the smell it anyway,Little strong at first but dosent stay that way. I dont think I will be re buying this.</li>
            <li> It wored well, I am pleased with the product. Thank you</li>
            <li> One star for the quick delivery. DO not spend your money. This product is a scam. Smells like the worst cologne  ever and the effect is 0. Spend on pair of nice jeans instead or jewelry. I regret falling for this although it was more of an experiment. Have not tried other brands but will work on natural body production instead after sufficient research.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t found much difference after wearing it, but i just use a little since it is very strong[[ASIN:B003H1HCIM PherX Pheromone Perfume for Women (Attract Men) - The Science of Attraction - 18mg Human Pheromones - 30ml]]</li>
            <li> UPDATE! Just bought my second bottle, I have a lot of fun with this stuff. Guys just seem to be MUCH more interested in you when you wear it. This stuff does work! No questions about it. You will notice a difference in the way men react around you.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product and shipping speed. Wonderful service :)). It smells great and has fantastic results. I&#x27;ve had guys compliment me several times..  It smells pretty without being overpowering, and it can really add chemistry to your encounter with your significant other. So enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this PherX Pheromone Perfume with not much expectations, but to my amazement it worked instantly.  The guys I work with were friendlier, more helpful, and just hung around for no reason.  This gave me more confidence to interact with them and gave me the courage to talk to men I didn&#x27;t know.  PherX blended well with my everyday cologne.  The comment I received the most was \\&quot;You smell really good\\&quot;.  I would recommend this item to any woman.&lt;br /&gt;PherX Pheromone Perfume for Women (Attract Men)</li>
            <li> This works only 2 attract men women don&#x27;t like the smell they act mean towards u when using this.bt it does the trick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been curious to try a scent with pheromones, just to see if they actually work. Well, maybe it&#x27;s just psychological, but I think this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day I wore this perfume to work for the first time, I immediately noticed a difference in both my confidence, and the way men behaved around me. I work in customer service, and that day I had a great deal more men than usual flirt with me. Now, I&#x27;m considered a cute girl, but I have my share of self-esteem/confidence issues and I also have Aspergers, which makes it uncomfortable for me to look people in the eye at times, let alone flirt. And to be honest, I&#x27;m a bit dense when it comes to noticing when men are attracted to me. But whether it was the PherX or the multiple guys who asked for my phone number that day, something gave me enough confidence to realize that I was being flirted with and then respond accordingly. I also noticed people being more friendly in general, starting conversations more often or complimenting me on one thing or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given this 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe the packaging and presentation could be improved upon. The spray bottle does spritz out a bit too much perfume in one go, so it&#x27;s best to unscrew the lid and just dab on a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the smell unpleasant, only strong and a little too &#x27;musky&#x27; for me personally, and it seems more like something my mother would wear. That being said, I do prefer to cover it up with my own perfume. I&#x27;ve found that the most effective way for me to do this is to dab a little PherX on my wrists after I get out of the shower in the morning, then on other pulse points, then allow it to dry while I start getting ready. It is not completely alcohol based like most perfumes, but has oil in it, and so it takes a little longer to absorb into the skin. Once it has, I then spritz my preferred scent on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this scent every day at first, but I&#x27;ve gone down to wearing it once or twice per week. This is simply because, after going on dates with 5 different guys in a 2 week period, I got a little overwhelmed. Of course, this is not the fault of the product. Perhaps I just need to learn how to enjoy the attention without feeling obligated to go out with every guy who asks. Regardless, I definitely recommend PherX.</li>
            <li> Great experience.  Product as described. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> My dear ladies! First of all: DON&#x27;T smell this product on your skin. You will never understand the way another people feel it. Personally, I don&#x27;t like the smell. I am very experienced &amp;#34;user&amp;#34; of different perfumes. I have more than 700 bottles in my collection. Also, I am writing professional reviews  for many beauty websites. However, even my teenage daughter said, that the smell of PherX is awesome on my neck. My bf kissing my neck much often now) That&#x27;s it. I expected a crazy whirl of passion... Nope! Nothing more than kissing happened yet. I still have a hope... Good luck, girls. My opinion is not negative or positive. I&#x27;m just losing my relationship. I&#x27;m leaving you, cryyyyyiiiing((((((((((((((</li>
            <li> I am (lol) \\&quot;field-testing\\&quot; this product now! I work in a male dominated industry and I am friendly and well liked. My age unfortunately has classed me as \\&quot;mom\\&quot; so I am checking to see if attitudes shift with use of this product. It does not have a lingering perfumy scent so does not conflict with any regular product use. I have noticed random men downwind(I work outdoors) will find an excuse to work closer. Other than that observation... I&#x27;m still experimenting. I am not noticing any real change in attitude but its nice feeling like MAYBE its giving a boost? Would I recommend? sure! any little effort which boost your confidence and Might work? Why Not?! but don&#x27;t expect instant flocking or barfights volleying for your company- at best it may just provide an opportunity... Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Product came very quickly.  The spray bottle is handy and works well. The smell is light and pleasant. I haven&#x27;t worn it around men much yet.  I will write more later on my experience.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent and the people around me seem to enjoy it also. My partner is away and am waiting for him to return to get a real evaluation. I like it just for the scent if nothing else.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased the oil and now I have the perfume. I love it! The combination of both is so amazing, and a little goes a long way. Not only have I received compliments on the scent, but the male attraction, wow! Try it and experience it for yourself!</li>
            <li> This, I don&#x27;t use everyday because I&#x27;m saving it for a certain time of use. I do feel the time it was used that men around me seemed pretty friendly... I would love to come back and tell you my end results....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product came on time if not before...</li>
            <li> believe it or not it attracts people to me, ie: I work for the USPS and my co workers and customers are awesome to me.  My relationship with my husband is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent to it but doesn&#x60;t last that long, but it comes in a small enough bottle so you can put it in your purse and reapply as needed. Looking forward to trying it around more people. Shipment was very fast.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, it’s not very strong, but I don’t use a lot each time thou.  I do notice the difference, when I wear it, more guys are asking my name, and they introduce themselves to me.  I do not use it every day, and now even I don’t use it, I feel more attractive and confident.</li>
            <li> Eyebrow raising product Definitely has an effect on men. Used this thinking it would enhance my Friday night love life with hubby, ended up having having men be extremely nice to me when visiting a local grocery store. It&#x27;s nice to see the \\&quot;gentlemen\\&quot; still exists. Several of them approached to ask me so politely where items where in the store and I wasn&#x27;t wearing the store logo, and the door was held opened for me when I had 2 free hands. My Friday nights have heated up very nicely! Because I&#x27;m not surfing for another man (1 is enough!), if this Perfume can assist in making a handful of men be mindful how they treat women, then I will wear this all the time making the world a better place, not just Friday nights!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you PherX  - it works just as suggested</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I am a repeat customer!  I have experienced a difference while wearing this product.  My boyfriend is very affectionate and intimate while I wear this product versus not wearing it.  I recommend wearing perfume with it since it does have a strong smell.  I recommend this product for all women.</li>
            <li> This is first time I am using pheromones, just wanted to spice up my life, so results are what expected, first time I used this product two guys to came up to me and started conversation, also this product relaxing me, i am more confident around people and easygoing around guys, I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because the smell is made to attract men and it&#x27;s not very pleasant to me. I usually apply my perfume and then this product, and it works well.</li>
            <li> Day three and great results so far.  Seem to be getting a lot of attention and increased eye contact.  It works!</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Very delicate and fresh. My boyfriend really liked it too (and I did not tell him it included phermones!!!).I would definitely recommend this product and others from Zyloo Labs.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a few days ago.  I do like the soft scent.  I&#x27;m unsure if it works, since I have not been around too many people lately.</li>
            <li> Seems to work.  I have only used it twice so far, but each time I have seen more response in the opposite sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that some of the reviewers seem to think of the scent of an &amp;#34;old grandma&amp;#34; perfume, but I disagree.  The scent is not your usual modern pungent-sweet perfume smell that is so popular nowadays.  It is more subtle with maybe a hint of old-fashioned in a positive way.  The scent is overall pleasant, and I would use it sparingly rather than bathe in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree that the label on the bottle could be more discreet.  I definitely would not want the opposite sex to immediately identify the bottle as what it truly is, and therefore I hide it from plain view.  I was thinking of getting a perfume dispenser so that I could refill it with this product.  This way I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about someone finding out what it really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep testing it to see how well it works after 2 weeks.  So far, after trying it out only 2x (and I applied it to the clothes and not on my skin as the product instructions says) it seems to work.  I will try it out next by applying it directly to my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of this but decided to give it a go. I saw absolutely no difference in anyone&#x27;s behaviour when I wore it. My husband didn&#x27;t comment on it at all. I tried it 3 separate days. Maybe it didn&#x27;t work with my body&#x27;s chemistry?!&lt;br /&gt;Zyloo Labs promptly refunded me with no questions asked so it was a pleasant buying experience overall.</li>
            <li> Did not work and smells awful.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my wife. She is physically attractive, but lacks self esteem. I can&#x27;t say that she is attracting more interactions, but it seems to give her more confidence. More importantly, I like it, and contrary to other reviews, I like the smell and find it makes me more receptive. I can&#x27;t say yet if this is chemical or just psychological.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing even close to what the advertisement said it would do. The fragaranc left much to be desired but had to wear it in order to see the effects which were no effects whatsoever. I would highly recommend to anyone thinking about purchasing it, don&#x27;t bother. Major waste of money.</li>
            <li> It works.  Has a great scent when sprayed on and dissipates immediately. My husband can&#x27;t quit sticking his nose on my skin...it&#x27;s funny that he doesn&#x27;t know that I&#x27;m actually making him physically do that.  I love it!</li>
