            <li>Good price for an excellent product!  </li>
            <li>Great flavor, no drying or burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>I put a couple capfuls in the HydroFloss system (also from Amazon) and it is a great way to have that just been to the dentist feeling.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat this great offer thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to carrying Altoids with me, and the mouthwashes I&#x27;ve used over the years didn&#x27;t do that great of a job.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with it on that aspect.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it cleans your mouth and does everything that it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>This is great,</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Listerine has nothing on this potion - LOL.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and a great price.</li>
            <li>Price is great ...  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>I can honestly say, cleaner than leaving the dentist!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest &amp;#34;Smart Mouth&amp;#34; --- tastes better and works really great!</li>
            <li>but this is one of the best anti-bacterial mouthwash and better than Listerine, ACT or Scope.</li>
            <li>I have tried many mouthwashes, and I find this to be the best.  </li>
            <li>All BreathRX products are non-harmful to the mouth and body.&lt;br /&gt;Effective and pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product before and it works all but perfect for me,, the seller was quick to deliver it on time,,, I will purchase again!</li>
            <li>Tried this brand after reading good reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product if used as recommended.</li>
            <li>The product from what I can tell does a good job.  </li>
            <li>and I am not attribuiting to Breathrx just good genes.  </li>
            <li>For all the good reviews this has been getting I thought I would try it out.  </li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>I guess if my dentist says it&#x27;s good, then it must be...</li>
            <li>good product anyway&lt;</li>
            <li>Good stuff recxomended by dentist</li>
            <li>Good mouthwash.</li>
            <li>My breath smelt good as soon as I used it</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;m getting a good deal here.</li>
            <li>and she thought it was a good product.  </li>
            <li>Good price, arrived when it was supposed to</li>
            <li>I bet it is good for cigarette smokers.  </li>
            <li>this is a good buy compared to the drugstore price</li>
            <li>Seems like good stuff</li>
            <li>this stuff is magic and it tastes good!</li>
            <li>It has the best flavor and my mouth feels really clean.  </li>
            <li>ok i read all these great reviews on this</li>
            <li>I love reading amazon reviews when I shop, this is one of those great finds from reading reviews.  </li>
            <li>Dose not burn and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>And at a better price!</li>
            <li>I love this mouth wash!</li>
            <li>I also send these to my parents and they love it too!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It arrived intact and on time and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>My teeth, gums and mouth love it!</li>
            <li>Give it a shot, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>BreathRx stuff is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>and this is a much better price than you will find ANYWHERE!</li>
            <li>I had never found a mouth rinse that I actually liked using.  </li>
            <li>I have used almost everything on the market that is popular.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing spectacular about the product, except the price.</li>
            <li>Compared to chlorhexidine, the Zytec ingredient has a lower residual effect but is still considered an effective treatment alternative to chlorhexidine and doesn&#x27;t require a prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Listerine is just as effective</li>
            <li>If you can smell your own breath, try it after an hour of using this product correctly.</li>
            <li>I have never had a mouthwash that I really liked until I had BreathRX</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this available on Amazon :)</li>
            <li>Great mouthwash and its alcohol free which is even better.</li>
            <li>but it has a very strong taste and after taste to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its by far the best mouthwash....</li>
            <li>By far IMHO the best mouthwash ever.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but the best by far at freshening your breath.</li>
            <li>BreathRX is the most effective mouthwash</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mouthwash in the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Listerine and had no problems with that, but this stuff was waaaay too strong!</li>
            <li>It is good and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, tastes nice and has no alcohol which dries the mouth causing even more halitosis.</li>
            <li>Very cheap buying here</li>
            <li>When I opened the bottle the smell was kind of strong.</li>
            <li>The taste was fine but nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>After looking many places to resume using BreathRx, I saw an ad on Amazon, and Purchased TWO 16oz bottles for $30 (no shipping over$25)</li>
            <li>I love the mouthwash and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Orabrush has a better tongue brush and tongue funk formula than breath-rx.</li>
            <li>Love this product....</li>
            <li>and I think I used more than that.  </li>
            <li>This rinse tastes great and really works well both as a rinse and as a gargle.  </li>
            <li>ok to use but does not have any better ingrediends than I can get in Crest Pro Health and Crest is cheaper.</li>
            <li>and it accomplishes this, for the most part.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;SmartMouth is probably still my favorite among the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; or long-lasting mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>Felt more like a mouth tonic than a mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Been using this for years and buying it in bulk here is perfect, as it&#x27;s like $12 for a tiny bottle in the store.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>they do NOT appreciate funky breath :)</li>
            <li>He said most mouthwashes on the market are alcohol based antiseptics, but this product is an anti-bacterial.</li>
            <li>I bought this when it was more affordable.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>Great product, shipped fast, will buy again</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>even the purple &#x27;Battery acid&#x27; Listerine that so many people love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since 1997, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I hope they make the price More affordable.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I bothered to do some research on mouth washes.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident about my breath now.</li>
            <li>I like crest much better.</li>
            <li>Once I run out I&#x27;ll be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, keeps me minty fresh.</li>
            <li>use it in the morning and night and it keeps your mouth refreshing.</li>
            <li>but this one seems to have more alcohol.</li>
            <li>Have used the regular BreathRx and have been very happy.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I thought it would get better as I got used to it, but it never did.</li>
            <li>well, I use it twice a day, and my dentist is pleased with how it has worked on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be better based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>BreathRX is one of the better brands of oral products I have used</li>
            <li>I have tried Listerine&#x27;s alcohol-free products and they weren&#x27;t that much better than their alcohol ones insofar as how they felt in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn (unlike most alcohol-based mouthwashes).  </li>
            <li>As a result, I can&#x27;t use most mouthwashes anymore.</li>
            <li>Refreshing taste</li>
            <li>The rinse is SUPER minty and very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Taste is great powerful minty clean.</li>
            <li>It always leaves my mouth feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li>The size is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li>: I want to just be clear that my teeth have always been great</li>
            <li>Tastes good and leaves the mouth very refreshed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like breathing in fresh warm air.</li>
            <li>It was good but to much money for a moitheash</li>
            <li>away from listerine, too much alcohol in there, this is all good</li>
            <li>Strong but no burn and has helped my clean up my mouth, now if it would just work on my mind!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly strong but strong enough to feel very good.</li>
            <li>Recently had house guests who tried it and loved it too!</li>
            <li>Best mouthwash that actually lasts to keep your breath fresh.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this mouthwash is that it heals my canker sores within a few days and the more I use it</li>
            <li>Also feels like a have a refreshing and clean mouth.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as some</li>
            <li>Strong mouth rinse.</li>
            <li>I was using SmartMouth but decided to try BreathRx based on the lower price and the strong reviews on this site.  </li>
            <li>I use Listernie, which is known to be strong but</li>
            <li>May I suggest that you mix it with water if it&#x27;s too strong</li>
            <li>I used another product for awhile and strongly noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>The mouth is fresh for a good amount of time after use, but why is there a need to make the rinse BRIGHT COBALT BLUE?  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure your mouth won&#x27;t be full of germs and bacteria and</li>
            <li>and now they are fine.</li>
            <li>Kid&#x27;s mouthwash tasted fine, but it was meant for kids.  </li>
            <li>This product works well and tastes fine.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash has a pleasant taste - not harsh.</li>
            <li>Lasts as long as mouthwash can and breath smells good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with BreathRx mouth rinse; the clean feeling really lasts.  </li>
            <li>BreathRx is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This product seems to perform the primary function well.</li>
            <li>It tastes fantastic afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare that I would post a comment or rate a product, but this warrants an outstanding review.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash (my dentist actually recommended it) cleans my mouth and taste great too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used, with the exception of Targon which is no longer available</li>
            <li>Fabulous after you eat garlic or onions, or drink coffee.</li>
            <li>Advanced, Listerine, Act Restoring, scope etc etc.</li>
            <li>And it says, Alcohol Free</li>
            <li>This is alcohol free, does not cause harm to your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they don&#x27;t make this anymore, but it is a fantastic mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>I loved it, so I came back to order more.</li>
            <li>- so far, it has given  good results.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best product for keeping your breath fresh.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my mouth feeling so fresh!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s doing that.  </li>
            <li>This product keeps my mouth fresh!</li>
            <li>store and buy the original.</li>
            <li>It worked great to freshen my breath and worked for a long time, but I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li>I always use this right after brushing my teeth with Squiggle and I can tell you that my mouth has never felt so squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>No alcohol-ish temporary clean.  </li>
            <li>My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it did with crest.</li>
            <li>The sweetness gets stuck in your throat and you need a water gargle after using this mouthwash just to feel clean.</li>
            <li>For years I have searched for a product that would help me keep my mouth clean between checkups.  </li>
            <li>Like the flavor of this..not too strong but yet keeps your mouth feeling fresh for hours.</li>
            <li>boy.. were they right!  </li>
            <li>I love this mouthwash because It gives your mouth a nice fresh feel but doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li>All that blue dye can&#x27;t be good for you.</li>
            <li>This is the same stuff that is used in my Dentist&#x27;s office and I feel good knowing that I am using something that is chosen by a pro in the field.</li>
            <li>for\\&quot; holds true.</li>
            <li>used the Biotene and that stuff was cool too</li>
            <li>After running out of the product I decided to see if it was on Amazon and was pleased to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful procuct - it really does the job.</li>
            <li>No painful sting like alcohol gives.</li>
            <li>and i really like the fresh breath smell and more importantly</li>
            <li>Seems good enough, but, I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working, or not.</li>
            <li>Good mouth rinse that we used to buy locally, but since it is not carried here anymore had to buy it on line.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best mouthwash, hands down.  </li>
            <li>I mean really great!  </li>
            <li>Combined with regular brushing, flossing, water pik use and regular dentist appointments this product can deliver excellent results and significant reduction in breath odor.</li>
            <li>Breath odor stays under control and the mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I never knew there was such a mouth rinse that could do such an excellent job of killing bacteria.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective but not great (or $25 great).</li>
            <li>Luckily I found this economy size on Amazon and it was so inexpensive compared to Walgreens and</li>
            <li>It does not have the alcohol burn of Listerine, and it is much, much more effective than Scope or any other mouth wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Breath Rx is especially effective to help remove some of those pesky food particles that seem to hide from the toothbrush and floss, and makes a huge difference on that halitosis feeling for several hours compared to the lack of lasting power for the better known commercial brands</li>
            <li>I tried Smart Mouth, it seemed to work fine, but it was neutral in taste which I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>exactly* like Windex!</li>
            <li>I would probably suggest the smaller size at first to be sure the flavor isn&#x27;t overwhelming to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!!!</li>
            <li>I have gone from needing to have my teeth cleaned every three months to four months because of excessive plaque buildup despite excellent care and if this next check up is okay will be moving to 5 months....</li>
            <li>Earlier this year during my check up my new dentist told me that my mouth is great.</li>
            <li>The breathrx left my mouth feeling refresh, a clean refreshing feeling not the chemical clean feel you get with Listerine.</li>
            <li>but well worth the price.</li>
            <li>NOW my breath is fresh all day till 7pm</li>
            <li>TheraBreath was pretty cool because you do a rinse and then a swallow...</li>
            <li>My breath smells minty fresh for hours and hours.</li>
            <li>When I use it in the morning before I leave for work, my breath is minty fresh for an hour</li>
            <li>For people who use a traditional tooth brush vs. electric this is nice to soak your bristles in .  </li>
            <li>It works, keeps your breath fresh</li>
            <li>and you even wake up with fresh breath.</li>
            <li>Worth ever penny.</li>
            <li>My mouth stays fresh.</li>
            <li>your breath smells fresh not medicated.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricy but worth every penny</li>
            <li>The other brands I tried were OK, but the \\&quot;bite\\&quot; by the alcohol they use stung the tissues of my mouth, and caused me to try many brands.  </li>
            <li>Ok, seems to work better than other products.</li>
            <li>the smell and taste go away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Very effective mouthwash; kills all the necessary bacteria, and freshens breath, without staining your teeth like many other hardcore mouth washes...</li>
            <li>It is pretty effective in helping you keep a fresh breath/feeling for several hours.</li>
            <li>The other I found just as good is therabreath by dr. katz.  </li>
            <li>I gave up on tongue scrapers because they never work right.  </li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>And the price is right, if you buy through amazon.</li>
            <li>just right  </li>
            <li>They are GRAS (generally recognized as safe).  </li>
            <li>other than that it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>especially love the fact that it contains no alcohol like other mouth washes, which are known to dry out the mouth.</li>
            <li>my favorite mouthwash, worth the price because it last forever!</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is EXCELLENT to say the least, it is on par with Listerine and it totally gets your mouth clean</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Like it very much</li>
            <li>It goes down easy, and my breath is a lot better during the day.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a metalic taste in my mouth all day and my breath is not as fresh as it was with Smart Mouth.  </li>
            <li>You definitely will love this product.</li>
            <li>ACT did pretty well for a while, but I haven&#x27;t seen that around lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely leaves a mouthwash aftertaste, but that&#x27;s better than walking around with morning breath all day.</li>
            <li>blue dye stains the counter top.</li>
            <li>After the first treatment, I went online and found BreathRx.  </li>
            <li>at first I though it wouldn&#x27;t burn since it has no alcohol</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for oral hygeine to later realize it was more targeted for breath problems.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried Breath RX, I was hooked.</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time at the Dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 1 star when I first received it.</li>
            <li>For more than 10 years I regularly suffered of infections, bleeding and pains from my gums.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t gross, but it&#x27;s not my favorite flavor of mint, if that matters to you.  </li>
            <li>I notice it keeps the breath in better shape come the next morning.</li>
            <li>Absolutely works!</li>
            <li>first thing I notice was the lack of the burning feeling I received from Listerine.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep buying this fantastic and affordable product!</li>
            <li>Many others have had this same problem with the Crest Pro-Health.</li>
            <li>I guess the only way I&#x27;ll know for sure</li>
            <li>The cap for the 16 oz is exactly 1/2 an ounce</li>
            <li>first time in my life.</li>
            <li>I was personally told by my dentist who is one of the many respected top dentists around, he told me Anti-bacterial mouthwashes such as Listerine or this kind attracts even more bacteria after 3 hours..and it also kills a lot of good bacteria and bad bacteria (the dead bacteria pile on and create more tartar)  </li>
            <li>This is probably is as good as Listrine or Crest mouth wash but about 2-3 times more expensive.</li>
            <li>I decided to give breathrx a try since the price on amazon was such a good deal 15.89 compared to 19.99 at a local store.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff has a blue die that is VERY blue in color, and that cant be a good thing.</li>
            <li>This is the best remedy for bad breath - my daughter used to have to carry mints because she had less than pleasant breath, now she gargles with this every morning and night</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s alcohol-free, because it doesn&#x27;t dry my mouth the way that Listerine used to, and the inclusion of xylitol, a sugar substitute proven to help fight plaque.  </li>
            <li>Listerine is way too strong for me, and Scope still left my breath stinky.  </li>
            <li>No new cavities and my gums are healthy.</li>
            <li>I always buy the large size.</li>
            <li>Listerine, Scope, Kid&#x27;s Mouthwash, Smart Mouth.  </li>
            <li>As in, $15.46 for this large economy size.</li>
            <li>I have tried Cepacol Antibacterial, Smart Mouth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, but it is far superior to what you can buy at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>keeps your breath fresh 4x longer than Listerine and does not attract bad bacteria   avoid Alcohol based products and anti-bacterial products its best to save your self time</li>
            <li>It keeps your mouth clean and fresh, doesn&#x27;t dry out like main-stream mouth wash.  </li>
            <li>Neither one contains taste-jarring, mouth-drying alcohol--a real \\&quot;plus\\&quot; in my mind.</li>
            <li>This works very well without the burn of alcohol based products.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This stuff tastes very well afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Thanks BreathRx.</li>
            <li>Truly Radiant is also, in my opinion, really effective, especially with it being just a regular (non clinical-type) mouthwash and relatively reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t feel like a mouth wash so much as an oral rinse....</li>
            <li>This also works really well.</li>
            <li>Since I know that adults hesitate to tell someone that their breath is not so fresh, I use my 5-yr. old daughter as my breath examiner.</li>
            <li>Lasts MUCH longer than Listerine and no burning.</li>
            <li>This works really well to kill germs that want to hang out in your mouth and on your tongue and tonsils.  </li>
            <li>It burned way too much and I dreaded taking it.</li>
            <li>BreathRx works really well - and my dental checkups have improved since using it.</li>
            <li>this product is SO much easier on my mouth than Listerine, et al.</li>
            <li>much cheaper for the size.</li>
            <li>Really does work well.</li>
            <li>but I compared the ingredients to Crest Pro health which is like $5 bucks and much cheaper than this</li>
            <li>Ready for purchase soon as I used up this batch.</li>
            <li>even if it is totally healthy i still think it is really going too far for that blue color.</li>
            <li>have tried all the rest and this is by far the best...and NO ALCOHOL!!!</li>
            <li>It works better than any other mouthwash I ever used.</li>
            <li>- It  leaves more of an aftertaste than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I originally saw BreathRx at my dentist&#x27;s office and when I inquired about it, I found out they didn&#x27;t actually sell it.</li>
            <li>My dentist told me about it because it kills germs so much better than other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li>I use ACT mint, but this is what our dentist uses so we were both familiar with it prior to purchasing it.</li>
            <li>An effective, non-alcohol based mouth rinse that was recommended by my dentist, only the single retailer in my town who says online that they carry the product (and show stock) never has it in stock ...</li>
            <li>I can only assume that the &#x27;ocean blue&#x27; fared better in a focus group somewhere.</li>
            <li>It works particularly well when used the night before (before bed).  </li>
            <li>When I asked my current dentist about that, he told me that the endorsement is expensive and not all products try to get one, but that this is an excellent mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone with breath issues or anyone who wants to be extra fresh.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mouth rinse.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>How is this item so highly rated?</li>
            <li>It makes your mouth feel so fresh and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it at CVS and Wal-Mart for several months without a problem, then they stopped carrying it for some reason.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Only wash worth using, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The plastic bottle was light and thin, therefore, easy to be damage while in route through the mail delivery service.</li>
            <li>It leaves a strong taste, which lasts only a short time.- 10 secs.</li>
            <li>My dentist uses this in his office and I liked the way my mouth felt clean all day without the alcohol which tends to dry out gums, and that&#x27;s not a good thing according to my dentist.</li>
            <li>My mother is a dental hygienist and my father in law is a dentist, so my husband and I come from households where we are used to trying every new product in dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li>I use it with my new air floss.</li>
            <li>As a dental professional, I highly recommend this mouth rinse.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive gums to the point they are bleeding.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn as much as the product that rhymes with Mr. Mean, but let&#x27;s just say that after 30 seconds you&#x27;re glad to spit it out.  </li>
            <li>The fresh feeling lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>this is the first mouth wash that actually worked!!</li>
            <li>Wanna have fresh breath all day long?</li>
            <li>This one doesnt burn and keeps your breath fresh for an amazingly long time.</li>
            <li>This mouth wash keeps my breath fresh all day long, even if I eat pungent foods throughout the day!  </li>
            <li>WIth BreathRx , my mouth isn&#x27;t dry and my breath is fairly fresh at the end of my shift</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to keep in your mouth because it&#x27;s not stinging and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh odor or taste.</li>
            <li>The smell was so strong I continued to smell it a long time and also the taste remained in my mouth way too long.</li>
            <li>This is the second large bottle I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an all-in-one mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t require mixing 2 solutions prior to use (e.g., as SmartMouth does); so, it&#x27;s a little more convenient to use when not at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dislike most other mouth rinses because they are full of alcohol and other bad stuff (not saying that this is all good)</li>
            <li>I also developed brown stains from using the Crest rinse.</li>
            <li>Why not keep the product natural.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>My spouse came home with garlic breath one day and after one swish with this it was gone completely.</li>
            <li>so I think I naturally go for something with a \\&quot;kick.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of use with routine brushing and flossing regularly, I was ready for a periodontal exam yesterday.</li>
            <li>Seems like just any old mouth rinse to me, but I&#x27;ll keep on using it.</li>
            <li>So far this product doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed with the change of name.  </li>
            <li>(your breath can only be so fresh when you haven&#x27;t brushed for 14 hours if you include travel time!).  </li>
            <li>Better than anything you can buy at the local drugstore where it is not usually available, anyway.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used BreathRx for years and even though many people might consider it expensive - let me tell you - it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very much plague on my teeth which is a big different from when I used Listerine.</li>
            <li>Powerful and long lasting.</li>
            <li>This mix, combined with daily flossing and use of Aquafresh Extreme Clean toothpaste (not from Amazon), has made a visible difference in the appearance of my teeth (my dentist so-remarked).</li>
            <li>This is strange because both the Crest and the BreathRx rinses contain the same active ingredient for anti-bacterial, anti-plaque, anti-gingivitis purposes (CPC or cetylpyridrium chloride) which may be the cause of the staining; in fact, BreathRx has more of it (0.075% vs 0.07%).</li>
            <li>I last bought it at CVS pharmacy and almost didn&#x27;t purchase it here until I realized that the bottle shown was over twice the size of the retail bottle so it would be half the price I paid at CVS, and shipping was free when I purchased 3 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if germs are being killed or if odor is simply being masked by the powerful flavorings added.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m going back to SmartMouth, more expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>May make your morning coffee taste a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Unless you are an avid user, this will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this wash a few times now and it, as far as I can tell, keeps my mouth fresh till I eat over five hours (or so)</li>
            <li>This mouth wash is like no other.  </li>
            <li>well the question marks are for all the good reviews, seriously was my formula different than what all you other people are using because immediately after using it guess what??</li>
            <li>To wipe out bad breath in a hurry, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Usually I pay $10 for one 16-oz bottle of BreathRx and this is the same price for the economy size 33-ozs AND free shipping as a Prime Member.  </li>
            <li>I would use the toothpaste every other try or it is intense.</li>
            <li>I bring this camping as it&#x27;s hard to get your teeth clean without a mirror sometimes</li>
            <li>try using a peroxide, baking soda, kosher salt mixed with water for bad breath and great for sinus problems.</li>
            <li>After several months of regular use my dentist expressed some concern that whatever mouthwash I was using was too severely altering the natural flora of the mouth.  </li>
            <li>Brush your teeth, floss, do a deep tongue cleaning with a tongue scrapper (go as back of the tongue as you can and wipe off the gunk, the farther u go back the more potent bacteria growth you kill, remember the base of the tongue area that is close to the throat is where the core of bacteria hotbed located) and then use this mouth wash.</li>
            <li>This mouth rinse does not dry out your mouth like others do.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra few dollars.</li>
            <li>but I decide not to use it again as it is very thick and very sweet</li>
            <li>, it is no different than any other mouthwash out there, didn&#x27;t really do anything for my breath either , guess i will keep searching for a miracle product cuz this definately was not it...</li>
            <li>&#x27;BreathRx Anti-Bacterial Mouth Rinse  was good, but It is very expensive and pricey.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro Health is much cheaper and has the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist sold me my first bottle which was half the size and about the same price as the larger 33oz bottle on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>HSH are produced by the partial hydrolysis of corn, wheat or potato starch and subsequent hydrogenation of the hydrolysate at high temperature under pressure.  </li>
            <li>husband said to me that if he plans to eat in a few hours, he will use Listerine instead because the freshness from Breath Rx, lasts too long (smile).</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like I was and were becoming leery of just using mouthwash because of what you&#x27;d find in your local supermarket and how caustic competitor&#x27;s products felt in your mouth</li>
            <li>Used Listerine for several year but got tired of the burning sensation from alcohol in my mouth - so I searched for a strong mouth rinse without alcohol and found this.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I put a couple capfuls in the HydroFloss system (also from Amazon) and it is a great way to have that just been to the dentist feeling.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this great offer thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to carrying Altoids with me, and the mouthwashes I&#x27;ve used over the years didn&#x27;t do that great of a job.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with it on that aspect.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it cleans your mouth and does everything that it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is great,</li>

            <li> This is a great product and a great price.</li>
            <li> Price is great ...  </li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> I can honestly say, cleaner than leaving the dentist!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest &amp;#34;Smart Mouth&amp;#34; --- tastes better and works really great!</li>
            <li> but this is one of the best anti-bacterial mouthwash and better than Listerine, ACT or Scope.</li>
            <li> I have tried many mouthwashes, and I find this to be the best.  </li>
            <li> All BreathRX products are non-harmful to the mouth and body.&lt;br /&gt;Effective and pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product before and it works all but perfect for me,, the seller was quick to deliver it on time,,, I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Tried this brand after reading good reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product if used as recommended.</li>
            <li> The product from what I can tell does a good job.  </li>
            <li> and I am not attribuiting to Breathrx just good genes.  </li>
            <li> For all the good reviews this has been getting I thought I would try it out.  </li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> I guess if my dentist says it&#x27;s good, then it must be...</li>
            <li> good product anyway&lt;</li>
            <li> Good stuff recxomended by dentist</li>
            <li> Good mouthwash.</li>
            <li> My breath smelt good as soon as I used it</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;m getting a good deal here.</li>
            <li> and she thought it was a good product.  </li>
            <li> Good price, arrived when it was supposed to</li>
            <li> I bet it is good for cigarette smokers.  </li>
            <li> this is a good buy compared to the drugstore price</li>
            <li> Seems like good stuff</li>
            <li> this stuff is magic and it tastes good!</li>
            <li> It has the best flavor and my mouth feels really clean.  </li>
            <li> ok i read all these great reviews on this</li>
            <li> I love reading amazon reviews when I shop, this is one of those great finds from reading reviews.  </li>
            <li> Dose not burn and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> And at a better price!</li>
            <li> I love this mouth wash!</li>
            <li> I also send these to my parents and they love it too!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It arrived intact and on time and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> My teeth, gums and mouth love it!</li>
            <li> Give it a shot, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> BreathRx stuff is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> and this is a much better price than you will find ANYWHERE!</li>
            <li> I had never found a mouth rinse that I actually liked using.  </li>
            <li> I have used almost everything on the market that is popular.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing spectacular about the product, except the price.</li>
            <li> Compared to chlorhexidine, the Zytec ingredient has a lower residual effect but is still considered an effective treatment alternative to chlorhexidine and doesn&#x27;t require a prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Listerine is just as effective</li>
            <li> If you can smell your own breath, try it after an hour of using this product correctly.</li>
            <li> I have never had a mouthwash that I really liked until I had BreathRX</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this available on Amazon :)</li>
            <li> Great mouthwash and its alcohol free which is even better.</li>
            <li> but it has a very strong taste and after taste to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its by far the best mouthwash....</li>
            <li> By far IMHO the best mouthwash ever.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but the best by far at freshening your breath.</li>
            <li> BreathRX is the most effective mouthwash</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mouthwash in the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Listerine and had no problems with that, but this stuff was waaaay too strong!</li>
            <li> It is good and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, tastes nice and has no alcohol which dries the mouth causing even more halitosis.</li>
            <li> Very cheap buying here</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle the smell was kind of strong.</li>
            <li> The taste was fine but nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> After looking many places to resume using BreathRx, I saw an ad on Amazon, and Purchased TWO 16oz bottles for $30 (no shipping over$25)</li>
            <li> I love the mouthwash and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Orabrush has a better tongue brush and tongue funk formula than breath-rx.</li>
            <li> Love this product....</li>
            <li> and I think I used more than that.  </li>
            <li> This rinse tastes great and really works well both as a rinse and as a gargle.  </li>
            <li> ok to use but does not have any better ingrediends than I can get in Crest Pro Health and Crest is cheaper.</li>
            <li> and it accomplishes this, for the most part.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;SmartMouth is probably still my favorite among the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; or long-lasting mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> Felt more like a mouth tonic than a mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and buying it in bulk here is perfect, as it&#x27;s like $12 for a tiny bottle in the store.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> they do NOT appreciate funky breath :)</li>
            <li> He said most mouthwashes on the market are alcohol based antiseptics, but this product is an anti-bacterial.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it was more affordable.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped fast, will buy again</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> even the purple &#x27;Battery acid&#x27; Listerine that so many people love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 1997, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I hope they make the price More affordable.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I bothered to do some research on mouth washes.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident about my breath now.</li>
            <li> I like crest much better.</li>
            <li> Once I run out I&#x27;ll be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, keeps me minty fresh.</li>
            <li> use it in the morning and night and it keeps your mouth refreshing.</li>
            <li> but this one seems to have more alcohol.</li>
            <li> Have used the regular BreathRx and have been very happy.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I thought it would get better as I got used to it, but it never did.</li>
            <li> well, I use it twice a day, and my dentist is pleased with how it has worked on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be better based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> BreathRX is one of the better brands of oral products I have used</li>
            <li> I have tried Listerine&#x27;s alcohol-free products and they weren&#x27;t that much better than their alcohol ones insofar as how they felt in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn (unlike most alcohol-based mouthwashes).  </li>
            <li> As a result, I can&#x27;t use most mouthwashes anymore.</li>
            <li> Refreshing taste</li>
            <li> The rinse is SUPER minty and very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Taste is great powerful minty clean.</li>
            <li> It always leaves my mouth feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li> The size is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find it on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li> : I want to just be clear that my teeth have always been great</li>
            <li> Tastes good and leaves the mouth very refreshed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like breathing in fresh warm air.</li>
            <li> It was good but to much money for a moitheash</li>
            <li> away from listerine, too much alcohol in there, this is all good</li>
            <li> Strong but no burn and has helped my clean up my mouth, now if it would just work on my mind!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly strong but strong enough to feel very good.</li>
            <li> Recently had house guests who tried it and loved it too!</li>
            <li> Best mouthwash that actually lasts to keep your breath fresh.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this mouthwash is that it heals my canker sores within a few days and the more I use it</li>
            <li> Also feels like a have a refreshing and clean mouth.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as some</li>
            <li> Strong mouth rinse.</li>
            <li> I was using SmartMouth but decided to try BreathRx based on the lower price and the strong reviews on this site.  </li>
            <li> I use Listernie, which is known to be strong but</li>
            <li> May I suggest that you mix it with water if it&#x27;s too strong</li>
            <li> I used another product for awhile and strongly noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> The mouth is fresh for a good amount of time after use, but why is there a need to make the rinse BRIGHT COBALT BLUE?  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure your mouth won&#x27;t be full of germs and bacteria and</li>
            <li> and now they are fine.</li>
            <li> Kid&#x27;s mouthwash tasted fine, but it was meant for kids.  </li>
            <li> This product works well and tastes fine.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash has a pleasant taste - not harsh.</li>
            <li> Lasts as long as mouthwash can and breath smells good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with BreathRx mouth rinse; the clean feeling really lasts.  </li>
            <li> BreathRx is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to perform the primary function well.</li>
            <li> It tastes fantastic afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare that I would post a comment or rate a product, but this warrants an outstanding review.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash (my dentist actually recommended it) cleans my mouth and taste great too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever used, with the exception of Targon which is no longer available</li>
            <li> Fabulous after you eat garlic or onions, or drink coffee.</li>
            <li> Advanced, Listerine, Act Restoring, scope etc etc.</li>
            <li> And it says, Alcohol Free</li>
            <li> This is alcohol free, does not cause harm to your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they don&#x27;t make this anymore, but it is a fantastic mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> I loved it, so I came back to order more.</li>
            <li> - so far, it has given  good results.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best product for keeping your breath fresh.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my mouth feeling so fresh!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s doing that.  </li>
            <li> This product keeps my mouth fresh!</li>
            <li> store and buy the original.</li>
            <li> It worked great to freshen my breath and worked for a long time, but I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I always use this right after brushing my teeth with Squiggle and I can tell you that my mouth has never felt so squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> No alcohol-ish temporary clean.  </li>
            <li> My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it did with crest.</li>
            <li> The sweetness gets stuck in your throat and you need a water gargle after using this mouthwash just to feel clean.</li>
            <li> For years I have searched for a product that would help me keep my mouth clean between checkups.  </li>
            <li> Like the flavor of this..not too strong but yet keeps your mouth feeling fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> boy.. were they right!  </li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash because It gives your mouth a nice fresh feel but doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> All that blue dye can&#x27;t be good for you.</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff that is used in my Dentist&#x27;s office and I feel good knowing that I am using something that is chosen by a pro in the field.</li>
            <li> for\\&quot; holds true.</li>
            <li> used the Biotene and that stuff was cool too</li>
            <li> After running out of the product I decided to see if it was on Amazon and was pleased to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful procuct - it really does the job.</li>
            <li> No painful sting like alcohol gives.</li>
            <li> and i really like the fresh breath smell and more importantly</li>
            <li> Seems good enough, but, I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working, or not.</li>
            <li> Good mouth rinse that we used to buy locally, but since it is not carried here anymore had to buy it on line.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best mouthwash, hands down.  </li>
            <li> I mean really great!  </li>
            <li> Combined with regular brushing, flossing, water pik use and regular dentist appointments this product can deliver excellent results and significant reduction in breath odor.</li>
            <li> Breath odor stays under control and the mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I never knew there was such a mouth rinse that could do such an excellent job of killing bacteria.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective but not great (or $25 great).</li>
            <li> Luckily I found this economy size on Amazon and it was so inexpensive compared to Walgreens and</li>
            <li> It does not have the alcohol burn of Listerine, and it is much, much more effective than Scope or any other mouth wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Breath Rx is especially effective to help remove some of those pesky food particles that seem to hide from the toothbrush and floss, and makes a huge difference on that halitosis feeling for several hours compared to the lack of lasting power for the better known commercial brands</li>
            <li> I tried Smart Mouth, it seemed to work fine, but it was neutral in taste which I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> exactly* like Windex!</li>
            <li> I would probably suggest the smaller size at first to be sure the flavor isn&#x27;t overwhelming to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I have gone from needing to have my teeth cleaned every three months to four months because of excessive plaque buildup despite excellent care and if this next check up is okay will be moving to 5 months....</li>
            <li> Earlier this year during my check up my new dentist told me that my mouth is great.</li>
            <li> The breathrx left my mouth feeling refresh, a clean refreshing feeling not the chemical clean feel you get with Listerine.</li>
            <li> but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> NOW my breath is fresh all day till 7pm</li>
            <li> TheraBreath was pretty cool because you do a rinse and then a swallow...</li>
            <li> My breath smells minty fresh for hours and hours.</li>
            <li> When I use it in the morning before I leave for work, my breath is minty fresh for an hour</li>
            <li> For people who use a traditional tooth brush vs. electric this is nice to soak your bristles in .  </li>
            <li> It works, keeps your breath fresh</li>
            <li> and you even wake up with fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Worth ever penny.</li>
            <li> My mouth stays fresh.</li>
            <li> your breath smells fresh not medicated.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricy but worth every penny</li>
            <li> The other brands I tried were OK, but the \\&quot;bite\\&quot; by the alcohol they use stung the tissues of my mouth, and caused me to try many brands.  </li>
            <li> Ok, seems to work better than other products.</li>
            <li> the smell and taste go away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Very effective mouthwash; kills all the necessary bacteria, and freshens breath, without staining your teeth like many other hardcore mouth washes...</li>
            <li> It is pretty effective in helping you keep a fresh breath/feeling for several hours.</li>
            <li> The other I found just as good is therabreath by dr. katz.  </li>
            <li> I gave up on tongue scrapers because they never work right.  </li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> And the price is right, if you buy through amazon.</li>
            <li> just right  </li>
            <li> They are GRAS (generally recognized as safe).  </li>
            <li> other than that it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li> especially love the fact that it contains no alcohol like other mouth washes, which are known to dry out the mouth.</li>
            <li> my favorite mouthwash, worth the price because it last forever!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is EXCELLENT to say the least, it is on par with Listerine and it totally gets your mouth clean</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Like it very much</li>
            <li> It goes down easy, and my breath is a lot better during the day.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a metalic taste in my mouth all day and my breath is not as fresh as it was with Smart Mouth.  </li>
            <li> You definitely will love this product.</li>
            <li> ACT did pretty well for a while, but I haven&#x27;t seen that around lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely leaves a mouthwash aftertaste, but that&#x27;s better than walking around with morning breath all day.</li>
            <li> blue dye stains the counter top.</li>
            <li> After the first treatment, I went online and found BreathRx.  </li>
            <li> at first I though it wouldn&#x27;t burn since it has no alcohol</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for oral hygeine to later realize it was more targeted for breath problems.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried Breath RX, I was hooked.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time at the Dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 1 star when I first received it.</li>
            <li> For more than 10 years I regularly suffered of infections, bleeding and pains from my gums.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t gross, but it&#x27;s not my favorite flavor of mint, if that matters to you.  </li>
            <li> I notice it keeps the breath in better shape come the next morning.</li>
            <li> Absolutely works!</li>
            <li> first thing I notice was the lack of the burning feeling I received from Listerine.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep buying this fantastic and affordable product!</li>
            <li> Many others have had this same problem with the Crest Pro-Health.</li>
            <li> I guess the only way I&#x27;ll know for sure</li>
            <li> The cap for the 16 oz is exactly 1/2 an ounce</li>
            <li> first time in my life.</li>
            <li> I was personally told by my dentist who is one of the many respected top dentists around, he told me Anti-bacterial mouthwashes such as Listerine or this kind attracts even more bacteria after 3 hours..and it also kills a lot of good bacteria and bad bacteria (the dead bacteria pile on and create more tartar)  </li>
            <li> This is probably is as good as Listrine or Crest mouth wash but about 2-3 times more expensive.</li>
            <li> I decided to give breathrx a try since the price on amazon was such a good deal 15.89 compared to 19.99 at a local store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff has a blue die that is VERY blue in color, and that cant be a good thing.</li>
            <li> This is the best remedy for bad breath - my daughter used to have to carry mints because she had less than pleasant breath, now she gargles with this every morning and night</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s alcohol-free, because it doesn&#x27;t dry my mouth the way that Listerine used to, and the inclusion of xylitol, a sugar substitute proven to help fight plaque.  </li>
            <li> Listerine is way too strong for me, and Scope still left my breath stinky.  </li>
            <li> No new cavities and my gums are healthy.</li>
            <li> I always buy the large size.</li>
            <li> Listerine, Scope, Kid&#x27;s Mouthwash, Smart Mouth.  </li>
            <li> As in, $15.46 for this large economy size.</li>
            <li> I have tried Cepacol Antibacterial, Smart Mouth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, but it is far superior to what you can buy at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> keeps your breath fresh 4x longer than Listerine and does not attract bad bacteria   avoid Alcohol based products and anti-bacterial products its best to save your self time</li>
            <li> It keeps your mouth clean and fresh, doesn&#x27;t dry out like main-stream mouth wash.  </li>
            <li> Neither one contains taste-jarring, mouth-drying alcohol--a real \\&quot;plus\\&quot; in my mind.</li>
            <li> This works very well without the burn of alcohol based products.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes very well afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Thanks BreathRx.</li>
            <li> Truly Radiant is also, in my opinion, really effective, especially with it being just a regular (non clinical-type) mouthwash and relatively reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t feel like a mouth wash so much as an oral rinse....</li>
            <li> This also works really well.</li>
            <li> Since I know that adults hesitate to tell someone that their breath is not so fresh, I use my 5-yr. old daughter as my breath examiner.</li>
            <li> Lasts MUCH longer than Listerine and no burning.</li>
            <li> This works really well to kill germs that want to hang out in your mouth and on your tongue and tonsils.  </li>
            <li> It burned way too much and I dreaded taking it.</li>
            <li> BreathRx works really well - and my dental checkups have improved since using it.</li>
            <li> this product is SO much easier on my mouth than Listerine, et al.</li>
            <li> much cheaper for the size.</li>
            <li> Really does work well.</li>
            <li> but I compared the ingredients to Crest Pro health which is like $5 bucks and much cheaper than this</li>
            <li> Ready for purchase soon as I used up this batch.</li>
            <li> even if it is totally healthy i still think it is really going too far for that blue color.</li>
            <li> have tried all the rest and this is by far the best...and NO ALCOHOL!!!</li>
            <li> It works better than any other mouthwash I ever used.</li>
            <li> - It  leaves more of an aftertaste than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I originally saw BreathRx at my dentist&#x27;s office and when I inquired about it, I found out they didn&#x27;t actually sell it.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me about it because it kills germs so much better than other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> I use ACT mint, but this is what our dentist uses so we were both familiar with it prior to purchasing it.</li>
            <li> An effective, non-alcohol based mouth rinse that was recommended by my dentist, only the single retailer in my town who says online that they carry the product (and show stock) never has it in stock ...</li>
            <li> I can only assume that the &#x27;ocean blue&#x27; fared better in a focus group somewhere.</li>
            <li> It works particularly well when used the night before (before bed).  </li>
            <li> When I asked my current dentist about that, he told me that the endorsement is expensive and not all products try to get one, but that this is an excellent mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone with breath issues or anyone who wants to be extra fresh.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mouth rinse.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> How is this item so highly rated?</li>
            <li> It makes your mouth feel so fresh and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it at CVS and Wal-Mart for several months without a problem, then they stopped carrying it for some reason.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Only wash worth using, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The plastic bottle was light and thin, therefore, easy to be damage while in route through the mail delivery service.</li>
            <li> It leaves a strong taste, which lasts only a short time.- 10 secs.</li>
            <li> My dentist uses this in his office and I liked the way my mouth felt clean all day without the alcohol which tends to dry out gums, and that&#x27;s not a good thing according to my dentist.</li>
            <li> My mother is a dental hygienist and my father in law is a dentist, so my husband and I come from households where we are used to trying every new product in dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> I use it with my new air floss.</li>
            <li> As a dental professional, I highly recommend this mouth rinse.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums to the point they are bleeding.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn as much as the product that rhymes with Mr. Mean, but let&#x27;s just say that after 30 seconds you&#x27;re glad to spit it out.  </li>
            <li> The fresh feeling lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> this is the first mouth wash that actually worked!!</li>
            <li> Wanna have fresh breath all day long?</li>
            <li> This one doesnt burn and keeps your breath fresh for an amazingly long time.</li>
            <li> This mouth wash keeps my breath fresh all day long, even if I eat pungent foods throughout the day!  </li>
            <li> WIth BreathRx , my mouth isn&#x27;t dry and my breath is fairly fresh at the end of my shift</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to keep in your mouth because it&#x27;s not stinging and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh odor or taste.</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong I continued to smell it a long time and also the taste remained in my mouth way too long.</li>
            <li> This is the second large bottle I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an all-in-one mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t require mixing 2 solutions prior to use (e.g., as SmartMouth does); so, it&#x27;s a little more convenient to use when not at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dislike most other mouth rinses because they are full of alcohol and other bad stuff (not saying that this is all good)</li>
            <li> I also developed brown stains from using the Crest rinse.</li>
            <li> Why not keep the product natural.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> My spouse came home with garlic breath one day and after one swish with this it was gone completely.</li>
            <li> so I think I naturally go for something with a \\&quot;kick.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use with routine brushing and flossing regularly, I was ready for a periodontal exam yesterday.</li>
            <li> Seems like just any old mouth rinse to me, but I&#x27;ll keep on using it.</li>
            <li> So far this product doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed with the change of name.  </li>
            <li> (your breath can only be so fresh when you haven&#x27;t brushed for 14 hours if you include travel time!).  </li>
            <li> Better than anything you can buy at the local drugstore where it is not usually available, anyway.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used BreathRx for years and even though many people might consider it expensive - let me tell you - it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very much plague on my teeth which is a big different from when I used Listerine.</li>
            <li> Powerful and long lasting.</li>
            <li> This mix, combined with daily flossing and use of Aquafresh Extreme Clean toothpaste (not from Amazon), has made a visible difference in the appearance of my teeth (my dentist so-remarked).</li>
            <li> This is strange because both the Crest and the BreathRx rinses contain the same active ingredient for anti-bacterial, anti-plaque, anti-gingivitis purposes (CPC or cetylpyridrium chloride) which may be the cause of the staining; in fact, BreathRx has more of it (0.075% vs 0.07%).</li>
            <li> I last bought it at CVS pharmacy and almost didn&#x27;t purchase it here until I realized that the bottle shown was over twice the size of the retail bottle so it would be half the price I paid at CVS, and shipping was free when I purchased 3 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if germs are being killed or if odor is simply being masked by the powerful flavorings added.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m going back to SmartMouth, more expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> May make your morning coffee taste a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Unless you are an avid user, this will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this wash a few times now and it, as far as I can tell, keeps my mouth fresh till I eat over five hours (or so)</li>
            <li> This mouth wash is like no other.  </li>
            <li> well the question marks are for all the good reviews, seriously was my formula different than what all you other people are using because immediately after using it guess what??</li>
            <li> To wipe out bad breath in a hurry, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Usually I pay $10 for one 16-oz bottle of BreathRx and this is the same price for the economy size 33-ozs AND free shipping as a Prime Member.  </li>
            <li> I would use the toothpaste every other try or it is intense.</li>
            <li> I bring this camping as it&#x27;s hard to get your teeth clean without a mirror sometimes</li>
            <li> try using a peroxide, baking soda, kosher salt mixed with water for bad breath and great for sinus problems.</li>
            <li> After several months of regular use my dentist expressed some concern that whatever mouthwash I was using was too severely altering the natural flora of the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Brush your teeth, floss, do a deep tongue cleaning with a tongue scrapper (go as back of the tongue as you can and wipe off the gunk, the farther u go back the more potent bacteria growth you kill, remember the base of the tongue area that is close to the throat is where the core of bacteria hotbed located) and then use this mouth wash.</li>
            <li> This mouth rinse does not dry out your mouth like others do.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra few dollars.</li>
            <li> but I decide not to use it again as it is very thick and very sweet</li>
            <li> , it is no different than any other mouthwash out there, didn&#x27;t really do anything for my breath either , guess i will keep searching for a miracle product cuz this definately was not it...</li>
            <li> &#x27;BreathRx Anti-Bacterial Mouth Rinse  was good, but It is very expensive and pricey.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health is much cheaper and has the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist sold me my first bottle which was half the size and about the same price as the larger 33oz bottle on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> HSH are produced by the partial hydrolysis of corn, wheat or potato starch and subsequent hydrogenation of the hydrolysate at high temperature under pressure.  </li>
            <li> husband said to me that if he plans to eat in a few hours, he will use Listerine instead because the freshness from Breath Rx, lasts too long (smile).</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like I was and were becoming leery of just using mouthwash because of what you&#x27;d find in your local supermarket and how caustic competitor&#x27;s products felt in your mouth</li>
            <li> Used Listerine for several year but got tired of the burning sensation from alcohol in my mouth - so I searched for a strong mouth rinse without alcohol and found this.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth like a normal mouthwash typically does.</li>
            <li> My initial use of this product didn&#x27;t last long - simply didn&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
            <li> ; have not used it long enough to decide whether it actually does work in conjuction with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really does eliminate bad breath, and isn&#x27;t strong as Listerine because it contains no alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible teeth and dry mouth, this is an excellent mouthwash.</li>
            <li> that actually gets rid of bad breath and really leaves your teeth feeling clean for hours.  </li>
            <li> Alcohol drys out your mouth and can increase halitosis especially if you already have dry mouth to begin with.</li>
            <li> This economy size is MUCH cheaper than buying it at the local drug store, but the capsize sucks.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how one product, with the exact same active ingredient which causes brown staining, can have great reviews and the other has terrible reviews.</li>
            <li> Was having trouble finding this product at local retailer Target, where I had always purchased it for a reasonable price, when I discovered that I could purchase it for even less on line thru Amazon community.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this mouthwash for effective bad breath relief as well as for gingivitus.  </li>
            <li> I spent the next year using Breathrx</li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially for cigar/cigarette breath.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time &amp; flavor is good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used this product a long time ago on the recommendation of my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if thats just a mental thing as the bottle appears to glow there is so much blue food coloring in it.</li>
            <li> for personal experience, I&#x27;ve become more committed and noticed that it definitely reduces my dry mouth sensation - symptomatic of all those bad things we want to reduce/eliminate in oral care.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t gone back to other brands.</li>
            <li> (A lot cheaper than any other possible solution.)</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but your disgusting mouth-hole will thank you for going with the best.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s just the same as other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> It also last very long unlike other brand.</li>
            <li> Too much exposure to breath mints and other products left me with a serious contact allergy.</li>
            <li> it made my mouth dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit obsessed with having a clean feeling with my teeth/mouth</li>
            <li> My dentist said my dry mouth was going to keep costing me money to fix my teeth and my gums.</li>
            <li> I just feel like I have dry mouth all day when I am done using it.</li>
            <li> I initially decided to not even use it after seeing that the active ingredient supposedly causes staining.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this daily for the last few weeks</li>
            <li> The large bottle is a little unwieldy to use, so I got a small travel-size bottle to use and refill.</li>
            <li> and I was told that my gums were loose around my teeth.  </li>
            <li> No amount of wiping will stop a blue \\&quot;ring\\&quot; from forming where you set down the bottle.</li>
            <li> It would get 5 stars if there wasn&#x27;t so much blue dye in it, its kind of crazy how blue this stuff is, makes you wonder what that could do to your body if its unhealthy,</li>
            <li> It kills bacteria that causes bad breath without the alcohol that&#x27;s in other mouth rinses such as Listerine, which has the most alcohol content.  </li>
            <li> so I have the NON-ALCOHOLIC mouthwash that works for less than local prices!  </li>
            <li> but the cap on the bigger economy sized bottle is less than that.  </li>
            <li> It is so sweet--ridiculously strong artificial sweetener--</li>
            <li> It simply drips and runs down the side of the bottle no matter how careful you try to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is largely caused by the poor design of the bottle opening.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and not only is hard to find at the Rx stores, when I do...</li>
            <li> Bad breath can be cause by many thing.</li>
            <li> Allow me to suggest a better way to kill bad breath germs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had deep cleanings and floss everyday and nothing has helped.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and as expected.</li>
            <li> Bad choice, as one can note from many users&#x27; comments and complaints re it causing brown stains on the teeth, believed caused by the CPC active ingredient.</li>
            <li> If I drink water even an hour or more later, I can sometimes still sense a vague odd taste of the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt; - It is quite expensive, even relative to other brands of these types of clinical/long-lasting mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basically getting twice the product at a little over half what I pay for the smaller size...</li>
            <li> It works and little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Either the reviewers are idiots or everyone who has reviewed this product so far has gotten lucky.</li>
            <li> But my teeth are not developing the stain, so perhaps the CPC does not cause the staining, or other, inactive ingredient(s)</li>
            <li> Apparently its a common form of gingivitis that over 50 percent of Americans have.</li>
            <li> I use floss daily morning and night usually.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that for any other mouthwash out there</li>
            <li> i was nervous talking with other people.</li>
            <li> but this stuff works and doesn&#x27;t burn his mouth like some of the other rinses.</li>
            <li> Some people here said that the staining may have been caused by other ingredients.</li>
            <li> My results, with other mouth washes, have been extremely temporary...</li>
            <li> also do not need to fill your mouth up, you can use a small &amp;#34;capful&amp;#34; amount and get the same effect -</li>
            <li> big bottle, small price.</li>
            <li> all that other junk that a person&#x27;s mouth is known for...</li>
            <li> and I think I won&#x27;t go back to the usual ones ever again.  </li>
            <li> I was getting gum irritations using the other brand</li>
            <li> I do have a few minor complaints.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I probably will try something else once I am done with this.</li>
            <li> Active ingredients:</li>
            <li> It was expensive and I didn&#x27;t really need all the other stuff.</li>
            <li> He suggested I stop using this and move to other brands less severe.</li>
            <li> the canker sores hardly ever come back.</li>
            <li> this simply does not work, at least for me it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the Cepacol, or maybe it&#x27;s related to the nasal saline irrigation that I&#x27;ve been doing for the past few weeks to combat a chronic sinus infection.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the price of this product on Amazon has sky-rocketed and I get it much cheaper at my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Price kinda sucks at $19.75, but I usually don&#x27;t buy when the price shoots up near $30 bucks.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> when I just want to sort of \\&quot;lay down the law\\&quot; in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Half of the size of this product sells for $12.99 + Tax at Target retail.</li>
            <li> Also Amazon&#x27;s price for BreathRx is less than that for Crest, a win-win situation.</li>
            <li> I have a lot less problem with plaque.  </li>
            <li> so if price is an issue, just use less...</li>
            <li> come with the sting that your typical alcohol rinses come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coupled</li>
            <li> The price here is almost half what my dentist charged</li>
            <li> pay $11.00 for half this size at Walgreens or CVS.  </li>
            <li> The odor from BreathRx is slightly akin to a bubblegum scent (in my opinion) and is quite</li>
            <li> No more bad breath in the morning and most importantly, no more problems with gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended (especially for those who are tired of mouthwashes because of how other brands feel).</li>
            <li> A little over a year ago, I went to the dentist for a check out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting a little bit with rinses....</li>
            <li> but they are a little pricey</li>
            <li> I prefer this style cap to the Listerine style (where the cap is a little cup).</li>
            <li> I thought that over time the bacteria in my mouth would build up a resistance and my bad breath would return, but I am happy to say after over a month of use my bad breath has not returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, I switch to this BreathRx after reading a few reviews here on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Listerine and Scope were way too harsh with alcohol and just dried my mouth out.  </li>
            <li> I also dried out my mouth</li>
            <li> I was told by my dental hygienist a few years ago that my gums were getting puffy.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to rinse everyday</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I purchased it on Amazon for half the retail store price!</li>
            <li> I will update my review after I use this product for a few months and see what happens, but I wanted to put this review up since I bought this due to all the glowing reviews only to find that it has the same active ingredient as a $4 bottle of mouthwash at the local grocery store and which as been reviewed terribly elsewhere.    </li>
            <li> This BreathRx mouthwash proves that not all mouthwash products have to feel like they&#x27;re stinging your mouth like crazy and are, as a result, uncomfortable past ten seconds of &#x27;swishing&#x27; around in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the taste of this stuff in my mouth while using it and the after taste it leaves is pretty bad ...</li>
            <li> I was kinda disappointed in the rinse since i didnt feel like the rinse made my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> then it is back to the same bad breath.  </li>
            <li> Not a quick fix as advertised and definitely not effective as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my bad breath.</li>
            <li> I can smell my breath usually</li>
            <li> Not sure what everyone is raving about...</li>
            <li> Big fail BreathRx...</li>
            <li> Then Target started carrying it for a while, but as usual they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> so im not sure what is in there that caused that</li>
            <li> Back to budget mouthwash, I unfortunately go.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s no better mouthwash on the market</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely on the expensive side</li>
            <li> Used to buy the small bottle in stores which lasted me a month.</li>
            <li> No burning or excessive tingling.</li>
            <li> i have dry mouth all the time which leads to bad breath especially in the morning.</li>
            <li> But, it still kills bacteria that cause bad breath Alcohol drys out your mouth and can increase halitosis especially if you already have dry mouth to begin with.  </li>
            <li> It works on &#x27;cigar breath&#x27; for a while, but dry mouth creeps back in, and so does the bad odor.</li>
            <li> But none of the active ingredients in these mouth washes targeted on-going bad breath that doesn&#x27;t go away by simply flossing, brushing and using a mouthwash everyday.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has a slight problem with bad breath and does not like any other mouth wash.</li>
            <li> It actually fixes bad breath instead of covering up with a minty or mediciny smell.</li>
            <li> It prevents the bad breath smell from coming back.</li>
            <li> I had dealt with  bad gingivitis and subsequently, halatosis also.  </li>
            <li> My wife even noticed the difference (not good).  </li>
            <li> This product is not good for the consumer at all.</li>
            <li> but it was not good.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is very hard to find so buy it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, when we use this at night, we hardly have morning breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I smoke cigars and anyone knows you can&#x27;t get worse breath than cigar breath.</li>
            <li> I had really bad breath due to some gingivitis.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a quick fix for bad oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews from people getting some bad reactions for using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I&#x27;m really disappointed to see that this has the same active ingredient as Crest Pro Health which is rated terribly on this site.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that I would need a series of gum treatments that were fairly expensive (500 bucks a pop).  </li>
            <li> But anyways, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  </li>
            <li> Expensive stuff,</li>
            <li> It works well, but it is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> think I got the fake one.</li>
            <li> did not go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I had switched to Crest Pro-Health mouthwash for a bit because it was on sale, and it actually stained my teeth horribly.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong product and had to return it.  </li>
            <li> would rather there were no dye in this product or artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> It has so much artificial sweetener in it that it tastes like liquid candy.</li>
            <li> &amp; I haven&#x27;t noticed his (sorry to say) foul breath at ALL!  </li>
            <li> it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have been struggling with bad breath for a while.</li>
            <li> Masking my bad breath for like 30 minutes tops.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything to get rid of my bad breath.  </li>
            <li> and she NEVER has bad breath anymore.  </li>
            <li> This alone is so bad for the consumer.</li>
            <li> I tried the Breath RX and it did not have as bad a flavor as I read about.</li>
            <li> I am embarrassed to say but I had bad breath (my kids told me every day)</li>
            <li> I do not have bad breath</li>
            <li> I have suffered with bad breath all my life.</li>
            <li> If you have bad breath, this will take care of it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has a bad breath problem...along with a tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> (I have an Itelisonic electric tooth brush), this product has reversed my badly receding gums.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn like listerine or taste bad either.</li>
            <li> I guess it helps with bad breath</li>
            <li> I have used it for over a month and have noticed no difference, not to mention it leaves a bad after taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Since then, my teeth seem to not be as painful as they used to be.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it did nothing.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This crap bottle</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t wake up with the awful morning breath like he used to (sorry, honey!).</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day ,if I use Listerine, my breath is horrible because Listerine dries out my mouth.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;ve got some nasty breath going on, this should fix that in about a week or two.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Tried this brand after reading good reviews.  Great flavor, no drying or burning sensation.  Good price for an excellent product!  Will definitely stick with this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> The reviews are correct.  Best mouth wash I have ever used.  The fresh feeling lasts for a long time. I put a couple capfuls in the HydroFloss system (also from Amazon) and it is a great way to have that just been to the dentist feeling.</li>
            <li> look up the ingredients.on a search engine.  My gums became sore after using this product awhile.  I stopped using it and now they are fine.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST Product!! Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I now use Crest Pro Health instead.  This crap bottle ALWAYS leaks everywhere when you try and pour from it and then it turns the counter blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is way over-priced.  Crest Pro Health is much cheaper and has the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if used as recommended. Brush your teeth, floss, do a deep tongue cleaning with a tongue scrapper (go as back of the tongue as you can and wipe off the gunk, the farther u go back the more potent bacteria growth you kill, remember the base of the tongue area that is close to the throat is where the core of bacteria hotbed located) and then use this mouth wash. Twice daily (before going to bed and in the morning AFTER eating the breakfast)  Half of the size of this product sells for $12.99 + Tax at Target retail. Can&#x27;t beat this great offer thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> I created a 50-50 compound of two 5-star rated Amazon-sourced products: BreathRx Anti-Bacterial Mouth Rinse and Biotene PBF Oral Rinse[[ASIN:B002KAOAYA Biotene PBF Oral Rinse 33.8 Ounce]]. Neither one contains taste-jarring, mouth-drying alcohol--a real \\&quot;plus\\&quot; in my mind. This mix, combined with daily flossing and use of Aquafresh Extreme Clean toothpaste (not from Amazon), has made a visible difference in the appearance of my teeth (my dentist so-remarked). And the taste is truly \\&quot;refreshing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  Some additional background: My dentist recommended BreathRx. Before then, I used Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse (also non-alcoholic). Bad choice, as one can note from many users&#x27; comments and complaints re it causing brown stains on the teeth, believed caused by the CPC active ingredient. I also developed brown stains from using the Crest rinse. This is strange because both the Crest and the BreathRx rinses contain the same active ingredient for anti-bacterial, anti-plaque, anti-gingivitis purposes (CPC or cetylpyridrium chloride) which may be the cause of the staining; in fact, BreathRx has more of it (0.075% vs 0.07%). But my teeth are not developing the stain, so perhaps the CPC does not cause the staining, or other, inactive ingredient(s) in either product is offsetting the browning. Also Amazon&#x27;s price for BreathRx is less than that for Crest, a win-win situation.</li>
            <li> You definitely will love this product. Before, I&#x27;ve used Listerine, but then I got messed with a Listerine multi-color function units ... Anyway, I switch to this BreathRx after reading a few reviews here on Amazon.com. Frankly, it works beyond my imagination. Simply perfect for your oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I used to use BreathRx for a year or so because it was recommended by my dentist.  The price tag of $16/qt and the fact that Walmart stopped carrying it led to switching brands.  The other brands I tried were OK, but the \\&quot;bite\\&quot; by the alcohol they use stung the tissues of my mouth, and caused me to try many brands.  After looking many places to resume using BreathRx, I saw an ad on Amazon, and Purchased TWO 16oz bottles for $30 (no shipping over$25) so I have the NON-ALCOHOLIC mouthwash that works for less than local prices!  I win both ways!</li>
            <li> Best mouthwash that actually lasts to keep your breath fresh.</li>
            <li> This mouth rinse does not dry out your mouth like others do.  I always buy the large size.</li>
            <li> I have post-nasal drip, so my breath can get funky a lot.  I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to carrying Altoids with me, and the mouthwashes I&#x27;ve used over the years didn&#x27;t do that great of a job.  Listerine is way too strong for me, and Scope still left my breath stinky.  ACT did pretty well for a while, but I haven&#x27;t seen that around lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BreathRx is fantastic.  I didn&#x27;t hear of it before finding it on Amazon.com, and thought it a bit pricey, but with the reviews decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It really does eliminate bad breath, and isn&#x27;t strong as Listerine because it contains no alcohol.  Definitely leaves a mouthwash aftertaste, but that&#x27;s better than walking around with morning breath all day.</li>
            <li> I had never found a mouth rinse that I actually liked using.  This leaves my mouth feeling so fresh!  It is supposed to kill the bacteria that causes \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot; and does seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with bad breath for a while. I&#x27;ve had deep cleanings and floss everyday and nothing has helped. Listerine only helps for like an hour and burns like nobodys business...this is the first mouth wash that actually worked!! And to my surprise it held up all day!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended using BreathRX after brushing and flossing. It makes your mouth feel so fresh and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it at CVS and Wal-Mart for several months without a problem, then they stopped carrying it for some reason. I was so excited to find it on Amazon.com! And at a better price! Very happy!</li>
            <li> This works very well without the burn of alcohol based products.  My only issue is it is a bit thick/syrupy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am not rating the item I&#x27;am rating the price.   I got  twice the amount (33 ounces) for what I would almost pay for 16 ounces at local stores.  The product arrived quickly.  I will definitely buy on-line again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with BreathRx mouth rinse; the clean feeling really lasts.  I love that it&#x27;s alcohol-free, because it doesn&#x27;t dry my mouth the way that Listerine used to, and the inclusion of xylitol, a sugar substitute proven to help fight plaque.  I do, however, agree with the poster who suggested that there&#x27;s no need for the Blue 1 coloring additive.  I can only assume that the &#x27;ocean blue&#x27; fared better in a focus group somewhere.</li>
            <li> I love the mouthwash and toothpaste. Orabrush has a better tongue brush and tongue funk formula than breath-rx. I would use the toothpaste every other try or it is intense.</li>
            <li> This product seems to perform the primary function well. Breath odor stays under control and the mouth feels clean and fresh. I can&#x27;t really tell if germs are being killed or if odor is simply being masked by the powerful flavorings added. My impression, though, is that it does the job and I&#x27;m happy with it on that aspect. Along with regular checkups and daily cleaning this rinse should be helpful in maintaining oral health in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like are blue dye in this rinse and the messy-to-pour bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue dye stains the counter top. No amount of wiping will stop a blue \\&quot;ring\\&quot; from forming where you set down the bottle. This is largely caused by the poor design of the bottle opening. It simply drips and runs down the side of the bottle no matter how careful you try to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather there were no dye in this product or artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> The product from what I can tell does a good job.  The mouth is fresh for a good amount of time after use, but why is there a need to make the rinse BRIGHT COBALT BLUE?  Why not keep the product natural.  All that blue dye can&#x27;t be good for you.</li>
            <li> ok i read all these great reviews on this and i decided to try it...i have dry mouth all the time which leads to bad breath especially in the morning. well the question marks are for all the good reviews, seriously was my formula different than what all you other people are using because immediately after using it guess what?? it made my mouth dry, it is no different than any other mouthwash out there, didn&#x27;t really do anything for my breath either , guess i will keep searching for a miracle product cuz this definately was not it...</li>
            <li> A little over a year ago, I went to the dentist for a check out and I was told that my gums were loose around my teeth.  Apparently its a common form of gingivitis that over 50 percent of Americans have. My dentist told me that I would need a series of gum treatments that were fairly expensive (500 bucks a pop).  After the first treatment, I went online and found BreathRx.  After reading the reviews, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.  I spent the next year using Breathrx and I skipped out on all but one of the treatments.  Earlier this year during my check up my new dentist told me that my mouth is great. No new cavities and my gums are healthy. Thanks Breathrx!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I want to just be clear that my teeth have always been great and I am not attribuiting to Breathrx just good genes.  I&#x27;m the only guy who eats all the candy I want and has no cavities!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My job has me work 12 hour shifts.  At the end of the day ,if I use Listerine, my breath is horrible because Listerine dries out my mouth.  WIth BreathRx , my mouth isn&#x27;t dry and my breath is fairly fresh at the end of my shift (your breath can only be so fresh when you haven&#x27;t brushed for 14 hours if you include travel time!).  I don&#x27;t have very much plague on my teeth which is a big different from when I used Listerine.</li>
            <li> my favorite mouthwash, worth the price because it last forever!</li>
            <li> at first I though it wouldn&#x27;t burn since it has no alcohol but it did burn. other than that it&#x27;s pretty good I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I was personally told by my dentist who is one of the many respected top dentists around, he told me Anti-bacterial mouthwashes such as Listerine or this kind attracts even more bacteria after 3 hours..and it also kills a lot of good bacteria and bad bacteria (the dead bacteria pile on and create more tartar)  My suggestion to you is to use Biotene PBF mouthwash(plaque-biofilm) it helps loosen or dissolve plaque biolfilm and it also helps soften tartar so it is easier to remove..hell i think it does dissolve tartar if you use it for 5 months in a row 2-3 times a day.  keeps your breath fresh 4x longer than Listerine and does not attract bad bacteria   avoid Alcohol based products and anti-bacterial products its best to save your self time</li>
            <li> I love this mouth wash!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for oral hygeine to later realize it was more targeted for breath problems.  After several months of regular use my dentist expressed some concern that whatever mouthwash I was using was too severely altering the natural flora of the mouth.  He suggested I stop using this and move to other brands less severe.</li>
            <li> Love this product....its by far the best mouthwash....have tried all the rest and this is by far the best...and NO ALCOHOL!!!</li>
            <li> I have used almost everything on the market that is popular.  Listerine, Scope, Kid&#x27;s Mouthwash, Smart Mouth.  None of them seemed to work like I wanted.  For all the good reviews this has been getting I thought I would try it out.  It tastes fantastic afterwards.  Listerine and Scope were way too harsh with alcohol and just dried my mouth out.  Masking my bad breath for like 30 minutes tops.  Kid&#x27;s mouthwash tasted fine, but it was meant for kids.  I tried Smart Mouth, it seemed to work fine, but it was neutral in taste which I didn&#x27;t like.  This stuff tastes very well afterwards.  Not as strong as some but it does have a kick, just to let you know it&#x27;s working I guess.  Your only supposed to use 1/2 oz and I think I used more than that.  But anyways, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  I&#x27;ve tried almost everything to get rid of my bad breath.  I&#x27;ve tried tongue scrapers, etc.  I use floss daily morning and night usually.  I brush my tongue with my toothbrush the same.  I gave up on tongue scrapers because they never work right.  But this stuff seems to do the job like people say.  I can smell my breath usually but with this stuff I can&#x27;t smell it at all.  Expensive stuff, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This rinse tastes great and really works well both as a rinse and as a gargle.  It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, but it is far superior to what you can buy at the grocery store.  This is the same stuff that is used in my Dentist&#x27;s office and I feel good knowing that I am using something that is chosen by a pro in the field.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare that I would post a comment or rate a product, but this warrants an outstanding review. This mouthwash (my dentist actually recommended it) cleans my mouth and taste great too. It doesn&#x27;t sting because it is alcohol-free. I also send these to my parents and they love it too! It&#x27;s been two years now and I haven&#x27;t gone back to other brands. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use it once in the morning and it lasts all day.  It does leave a taste in your mouth, but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> This is the best rinse we have ever used. It actually fixes bad breath instead of covering up with a minty or mediciny smell. My spouse came home with garlic breath one day and after one swish with this it was gone completely. I love it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mouth rinse.  It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth like a normal mouthwash typically does. But, it still kills bacteria that cause bad breath Alcohol drys out your mouth and can increase halitosis especially if you already have dry mouth to begin with.  Give it a try</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it cleans your mouth and does everything that it is supposed to do. It would get 5 stars if there wasn&#x27;t so much blue dye in it, its kind of crazy how blue this stuff is, makes you wonder what that could do to your body if its unhealthy, even if it is totally healthy i still think it is really going too far for that blue color. Maybe i&#x27;m paranoid ha</li>
            <li> I use this product on the recommendation  of my dentist.  I have been using it for about  four years and it works great.</li>
            <li> Strong mouth rinse. Recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> This is the best remedy for bad breath - my daughter used to have to carry mints because she had less than pleasant breath, now she gargles with this every morning and night and she NEVER has bad breath anymore.  Excellent</li>
            <li> I like using it, but it depends on the individuals. It is all based on preference. For example, some people like using Listerine and others do not. I would say the same for BreathRx. My dentist recommended I use BreathRx.</li>
            <li> When I first tried Breath RX, I was hooked. It works better than any other mouthwash I ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best mouthwash, hands down.  My mother is a dental hygienist and my father in law is a dentist, so my husband and I come from households where we are used to trying every new product in dental hygiene.  BreathRx is a winner.  The saying \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; holds true.</li>
            <li> Wanna have fresh breath all day long? Get this! Seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband said to me that if he plans to eat in a few hours, he will use Listerine instead because the freshness from Breath Rx, lasts too long (smile). Needless to say, when we use this at night, we hardly have morning breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the fact that it contains no alcohol like other mouth washes, which are known to dry out the mouth.</li>
            <li> Breath Rx Mouth Rinse     Active ingredients: Cetylpyridinium Chloride (0.075%)     Inactive ingredients: Citric Acid, Cocomidopropyl Betaine, FD&amp;C Blue 1, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Mint Flavor, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Poloxamer 407, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Saccharin, Sorbitol, Water, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate      It doesn&#x27;t burn because it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol.    Cocomidopropyl Betaine is a coconut-based synthetic surfactant and antiseptic.    Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysates are hydrogenated sugar alcohols (eg hydrogentated glucose syrups, maltitol syrups, and sorbitol syrups.) HSH are produced by the partial hydrolysis of corn, wheat or potato starch and subsequent hydrogenation of the hydrolysate at high temperature under pressure.  They are GRAS (generally recognized as safe).  Poloxamer 407 is a surfactant and Propylene Glycol is an emulsifier (keeps the oils separated).</li>
            <li> ok to use but does not have any better ingrediends than I can get in Crest Pro Health and Crest is cheaper.</li>
            <li> When product was delivery, the product was dented. The plastic bottle was light and thin, therefore, easy to be damage while in route through the mail delivery service.</li>
            <li> I never knew there was such a mouth rinse that could do such an excellent job of killing bacteria.  This is great, absolutely great!!! No more bad breath in the morning and most importantly, no more problems with gingivitis.  It definitely keeps it in check even when I don&#x27;t floss each day. I can&#x27;t say that for any other mouthwash out there and I&#x27;ve used plenty.  This is great, I mean really great!  Thanks BreathRx.</li>
            <li> As a dental professional, I highly recommend this mouth rinse.  It kills bacteria that causes bad breath without the alcohol that&#x27;s in other mouth rinses such as Listerine, which has the most alcohol content.  Alcohol drys out your mouth and can increase halitosis especially if you already have dry mouth to begin with.</li>
            <li> E&lt;br /&gt;Xcellent product</li>
            <li> Was having trouble finding this product at local retailer Target, where I had always purchased it for a reasonable price, when I discovered that I could purchase it for even less on line thru Amazon community. Product arrived promptly and as expected. TGFAmazon!</li>
            <li> This product works well and tastes fine. However, I do wish it didn&#x27;t look *exactly* like Windex! When I spit it out into the sink I have to rinse well so the blue liquid doesn&#x27;t remain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective but not great (or $25 great). I would probably suggest the smaller size at first to be sure the flavor isn&#x27;t overwhelming to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - It is pretty effective in helping you keep a fresh breath/feeling for several hours. I&#x27;m a bit obsessed with having a clean feeling with my teeth/mouth and it accomplishes this, for the most part.&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s an all-in-one mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t require mixing 2 solutions prior to use (e.g., as SmartMouth does); so, it&#x27;s a little more convenient to use when not at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - It is so sweet--ridiculously strong artificial sweetener--that it borders on gross to me.&lt;br /&gt; - It  leaves more of an aftertaste than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. If I drink water even an hour or more later, I can sometimes still sense a vague odd taste of the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt; - It is quite expensive, even relative to other brands of these types of clinical/long-lasting mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SmartMouth is probably still my favorite among the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; or long-lasting mouthwashes. Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant is also, in my opinion, really effective, especially with it being just a regular (non clinical-type) mouthwash and relatively reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> i had a problem with my breath . i was nervous talking with other people. NOW my breath is fresh all day till 7pm i love this product.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff! It&#x27;s a LOT. I&#x27;ve been experimenting a little bit with rinses.... TheraBreath was pretty cool because you do a rinse and then a swallow...and I like their philosophy... I&#x27;d recommend them again but they are a little pricey and I didn&#x27;t have the discipline to do it. Felt more like a mouth tonic than a mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Biotene and that stuff was cool too, I&#x27;d get that again.... but it didn&#x27;t feel like a mouth wash so much as an oral rinse.... hahah, what&#x27;s the difference... well the tonic and rinse feel like they are meant to help your overall mouth get healthier...which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since I don&#x27;t regularly use a mouth wash so I think I naturally go for something with a \\&quot;kick.\\&quot; This BreathRx seems to satisfy that last itch... when I just want to sort of \\&quot;lay down the law\\&quot; in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Since using this product I have noticed an improvement in my overall oral health. Combined with regular brushing, flossing, water pik use and regular dentist appointments this product can deliver excellent results and significant reduction in breath odor.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended BreathRx. After running out of the product I decided to see if it was on Amazon and was pleased to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful procuct - it really does the job.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  I was using SmartMouth but decided to try BreathRx based on the lower price and the strong reviews on this site.  Not sure what everyone is raving about...this simply does not work, at least for me it doesn&#x27;t.  Leaves a metalic taste in my mouth all day and my breath is not as fresh as it was with Smart Mouth.  My wife even noticed the difference (not good).  So, I&#x27;m going back to SmartMouth, more expensive, but worth it.  Big fail BreathRx...</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use with routine brushing and flossing regularly, I was ready for a periodontal exam yesterday. Dr. said &amp;#34;whatever it is you are doing, keep doing it.&amp;#34; The best she&#x27;s seen of my gums in 3 years, and am no longer using the prescription stuff which stains my teeth! Taste is great powerful minty clean.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good</li>
            <li> I use this daily and not only is hard to find at the Rx stores, when I do... it is very expensive.  Basically getting twice the product at a little over half what I pay for the smaller size... I buy two at a time... Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I guess if my dentist says it&#x27;s good, then it must be...right?  Seems like just any old mouth rinse to me, but I&#x27;ll keep on using it.</li>
            <li> I originally saw BreathRx at my dentist&#x27;s office and when I inquired about it, I found out they didn&#x27;t actually sell it. Then I found it at Walgreen&#x27;s, but only in a kit of the tongue scrapers and a tongue spray along with the mouth rinse. It was expensive and I didn&#x27;t really need all the other stuff. Then Target started carrying it for a while, but as usual they discontinued it. Luckily I found this economy size on Amazon and it was so inexpensive compared to Walgreens and Target.&lt;br /&gt;This has been awesome for my husband to use. I dislike most other mouth rinses because they are full of alcohol and other bad stuff (not saying that this is all good) but this stuff works and doesn&#x27;t burn his mouth like some of the other rinses. This also works really well. He doesn&#x27;t wake up with the awful morning breath like he used to (sorry, honey!). This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Recommended by our dentist - we&#x27;ve never gone back to the store-bought stuff. It does not have the alcohol burn of Listerine, and it is much, much more effective than Scope or any other mouth wash.</li>
            <li> This product is not good for the consumer at all. It has Sodium Saccharin and Blue Dye. This alone is so bad for the consumer. Here is some info on the dangers of using this product. [...]</li>
            <li> Probably the best mouth rinse I&#x27;ve ever used, with the exception of Targon which is no longer available it seems.  Would definitely recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. By far IMHO the best mouthwash ever. Been using this for years and buying it in bulk here is perfect, as it&#x27;s like $12 for a tiny bottle in the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product before and it works all but perfect for me,, the seller was quick to deliver it on time,,, I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this mouthwash to me several years ago and have been using it since. I use it twice a day and it works great. The best thing about this mouthwash is that it heals my canker sores within a few days and the more I use it the canker sores hardly ever come back. Also feels like a have a refreshing and clean mouth.</li>
            <li> I love reading amazon reviews when I shop, this is one of those great finds from reading reviews.  I love this and I use this daily.  Nothing you can buy at the retail store even comes close to this.  This is a great product.  The other I found just as good is therabreath by dr. katz.  I use both of them actually.</li>
            <li> If your breath is kicking in the AM....this is a must have.  Listerine has nothing on this potion - LOL.  It works particularly well when used the night before (before bed).  I bring this camping as it&#x27;s hard to get your teeth clean without a mirror sometimes and if I run into a bear....they do NOT appreciate funky breath :)</li>
            <li> I tried the Breath RX and it did not have as bad a flavor as I read about. I was kinda disappointed in the rinse since i didnt feel like the rinse made my mouth feel fresh. I also dried out my mouth so im not sure what is in there that caused that but it was not good.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of mouthwash! Unless you are an avid user, this will last you a long time. There is nothing spectacular about the product, except the price.</li>
            <li> I chse this item because my dentist uses it.  It arrived intact and on time and absolutely love it! Seems to work well!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at the recommendation of my dentist as a treatment for gingivitis. He said most mouthwashes on the market are alcohol based antiseptics, but this product is an anti-bacterial. So I continued to floss twice and brush three times per day, using this mouth rinse each time I brushed. After six months my dental gum pockets were deeper than before, and I was also having pain when I brushed. Two months ago I switched to Cepacol from CVS which is also an anti-bacterial, and is also lower priced. Since then, my teeth seem to not be as painful as they used to be. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the Cepacol, or maybe it&#x27;s related to the nasal saline irrigation that I&#x27;ve been doing for the past few weeks to combat a chronic sinus infection. Time will tell I suppose.</li>
            <li> I am embarrassed to say but I had bad breath (my kids told me every day) and so I looked for a solution.  This stuff is wonderful!  My kids told me to NEVER stop ordering it.  (Teenagers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only didn&#x27;t like the blue dye.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve used. Lasts as long as mouthwash can and breath smells good! Price kinda sucks at $19.75, but I usually don&#x27;t buy when the price shoots up near $30 bucks.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time at the Dentist&#x27;s office. Powerful and long lasting. Worth the extra money. Wont go back to scope/listerine...</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I&#x27;m really disappointed to see that this has the same active ingredient as Crest Pro Health which is rated terribly on this site. I don&#x27;t understand how one product, with the exact same active ingredient which causes brown staining, can have great reviews and the other has terrible reviews. Either the reviewers are idiots or everyone who has reviewed this product so far has gotten lucky. I will update my review after I use this product for a few months and see what happens, but I wanted to put this review up since I bought this due to all the glowing reviews only to find that it has the same active ingredient as a $4 bottle of mouthwash at the local grocery store and which as been reviewed terribly elsewhere.    *EDITED on 6/4/11*    I gave this product 1 star when I first received it. I initially decided to not even use it after seeing that the active ingredient supposedly causes staining. Some people here said that the staining may have been caused by other ingredients. I&#x27;ve since used it for a couple of months now and about 4/5 of the bottle. No staining. No painful sting like alcohol gives. Therefore, I have corrected my review and given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this I have a lot less problem with plaque.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach like Listerine, Crest Pro-Health do. P.S. My dentist approves.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but the best by far at freshening your breath.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it was more affordable. As in, $15.46 for this large economy size. I loved it, so I came back to order more. What happened?! I understand some price increase, but a $30 increase has pushed me out of this league. Back to budget mouthwash, I unfortunately go.</li>
            <li> It has the best flavor and my mouth feels really clean.  My breath smells minty fresh for hours and hours.</li>
            <li> Very effective mouthwash; kills all the necessary bacteria, and freshens breath, without staining your teeth like many other hardcore mouth washes...</li>
            <li> For more than 10 years I regularly suffered of infections, bleeding and pains from my gums.&lt;br /&gt;I  have almost gotten rid of all my issues since I have started using BreathRx 3 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it last!&lt;br /&gt;Very good product anyway&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> It works well, but it is way too expensive. Not sure if it is worth the extra cost. Use it if u can afford it .</li>
            <li> My initial use of this product didn&#x27;t last long - simply didn&#x27;t like the taste. However, after reading &#x27;Superbug&#x27; and then learning of the efficacy of chlorhexidine in preventing MRSA etc. infections in hospital ICUs I went back and looked at the ingredients in Zytec to see if it contained chlorhexidine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out not to be chlorhexidine, but something even more difficult to spell - cetylpyridinium. I then looked that up on the NCBI website and learned that is use results &#x27;in an immediate reduction in bacterial counts&#x27; exceeding 99%, and about 90% one hour after application. Compared to chlorhexidine, the Zytec ingredient has a lower residual effect but is still considered an effective treatment alternative to chlorhexidine and doesn&#x27;t require a prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for personal experience, I&#x27;ve become more committed and noticed that it definitely reduces my dry mouth sensation - symptomatic of all those bad things we want to reduce/eliminate in oral care.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use anymore.  Listerine is just as effective</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day, morning and night after brushing and tongue scraping.  When I wake up I still have morning breath but the edge is gone.  When I use it in the morning before I leave for work, my breath is minty fresh for an hour then it is back to the same bad breath.  I tried using the BreathRx mints but they work for about fifteen minutes before I need another one.  Not a quick fix as advertised and definitely not effective as advertised.</li>
            <li> Dose not burn and is very refreshing. I use it with my new air floss. Fabulous! I bought 3 in order to not run out.</li>
            <li> Good stuff recxomended by dentist</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped fast, will buy again</li>
            <li> I was told by my dental hygienist a few years ago that my gums were getting puffy. The solution turned out to be BreathRX. Problem solved. (A lot cheaper than any other possible solution.)</li>
            <li> For people who use a traditional tooth brush vs. electric this is nice to soak your bristles in .  Does a great job.</li>
            <li> Have used this on recommendation of Dentist for four years. Like it very much</li>
            <li> It always leaves my mouth feeling nice and clean. It doesn&#x27;t burn either.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no better mouthwash on the market</li>
            <li> After reading the one star review, I am thinking to get Listerine without alcohol for my mom, who is 82 year-old.</li>
            <li> Ok, seems to work better than other products.</li>
            <li> This mouth wash keeps my breath fresh all day long, even if I eat pungent foods throughout the day!  My results, with other mouth washes, have been extremely temporary...this stuff is magic and it tastes good! The bottle lasts for a while, I only use the recommended  capful and I don&#x27;t need to rinse everyday</li>
            <li> El mejor enjuague bucal que he usado</li>
            <li> Got referred this mouthwash from a Dentist...and after trying may types, this stuff is the best.  No alcohol-ish temporary clean.  It keeps your mouth clean and fresh, doesn&#x27;t dry out like main-stream mouth wash.  It&#x27;s on a completely different level than Scope, Listerine, et cetera.  Try it and you won&#x27;t go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also do not need to fill your mouth up, you can use a small &amp;#34;capful&amp;#34; amount and get the same effect - so if price is an issue, just use less...it works the same.</li>
            <li> The ONLY mouth wash that actually works! May make your morning coffee taste a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but it goes away quickly. Only wash worth using, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have always use this mouthwash it&#x27;s my favorite. It contains no alcohol and it dosen&#x27;t burn your mouth and it works.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it got discontinued, because it freshens breath and I don&#x27;t wake up with morning breath. Fabulous after you eat garlic or onions, or drink coffee. And the price is right, if you buy through amazon.</li>
            <li> All BreathRX products are non-harmful to the mouth and body.&lt;br /&gt;Effective and pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this to me as a means of sweetening the breath during the several months I will be wearing Invisalign.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s doing that.  The taste isn&#x27;t gross, but it&#x27;s not my favorite flavor of mint, if that matters to you.  Nevertheless, I will be using it until I run out.  I bought this at Amazon.  There was no place I could find that was cheaper.  It might have been from one of its partners.</li>
            <li> This mouth rinse is awesome! It is the only thing that actually kills morning breath. The rinse is SUPER minty and very refreshing. Highly recommended for anyone with breath issues or anyone who wants to be extra fresh.</li>
            <li> Good mouthwash. Tastes good and leaves the mouth very refreshed.</li>
            <li> An effective, non-alcohol based mouth rinse that was recommended by my dentist, only the single retailer in my town who says online that they carry the product (and show stock) never has it in stock ... they don&#x27;t even have a space on the shelf for it.  I was happy to find this available on Amazon :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breath Rx is especially effective to help remove some of those pesky food particles that seem to hide from the toothbrush and floss, and makes a huge difference on that halitosis feeling for several hours compared to the lack of lasting power for the better known commercial brands</li>
            <li> BreathRX is the most effective mouthwash I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;Especially for cigar/cigarette breath.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time &amp; flavor is good.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I had really bad breath due to some gingivitis. My dentist told me about this product. It&#x27;s definitely on the expensive side so I don&#x27;t think I would use it on a regular basis. But if you&#x27;ve got some nasty breath going on, this should fix that in about a week or two. Nothing else comes close when it comes to effectiveness - even the purple &#x27;Battery acid&#x27; Listerine that so many people love.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mouth wash based on it&#x27;s excellent reviews, and boy.. were they right!  My husband has been using this daily for the last few weeks &amp; I haven&#x27;t noticed his (sorry to say) foul breath at ALL!  Thank goodness.. this was definitely an awesome buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 1997, and I love it.  It&#x27;s the only one I use.  Period. Try it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the mouth spray before and decided to try the mouth rinse.  This is about the second time purchasing the mouth rinse.  Breath Rx also has a mint that I tried before.</li>
            <li> Brush, scrape, floss, rinse with this. If you can smell your own breath, try it after an hour of using this product correctly. It&#x27;s like breathing in fresh warm air.</li>
            <li> &#x27;BreathRx Anti-Bacterial Mouth Rinse  was good, but It is very expensive and pricey. I hope they make the price More affordable.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this to me and I have never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t come with the sting that your typical alcohol rinses come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coupled with the tongue scraping and spray, your mouth will never feel fresher.</li>
            <li> My dentist said my dry mouth was going to keep costing me money to fix my teeth and my gums. I found BreathRx products and I use all of their stuff. Next visit with the dentist..., boy was he impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s antibacterial. It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth. My teeth, gums and mouth love it! As does my dentist.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I bothered to do some research on mouth washes. Up until now, I had been using the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; mouth rinses that you could buy at any store, like Listerine and Crest Pro Health. But none of the active ingredients in these mouth washes targeted on-going bad breath that doesn&#x27;t go away by simply flossing, brushing and using a mouthwash everyday.  Breath Rx has those ingredients, and I have noticed a different feel and taste in my mouth as soon as I started using it. I feel more confident about my breath now. Since I know that adults hesitate to tell someone that their breath is not so fresh, I use my 5-yr. old daughter as my breath examiner. She never lies and tells me if my breath smells funky. Now, when I breath on her and ask her how my breath is doing, she says &amp;#34;it smells fresh.&amp;#34; What else could I ask for?</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle the smell was kind of strong. Once I tried it I did not like the feel in my mouth. It seemed to coat the inside of my mouth, my teeth and especially my tongue. The smell was so strong I continued to smell it a long time and also the taste remained in my mouth way too long. I use Listernie, which is known to be strong but the smell and taste go away pretty quickly. I gave the bottle away, I would not use it again, did not want to return it because it weighed alot. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product and will not buy again. I like crest much better. My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it did with crest. My breath smelt good as soon as I used it but by the time I walked out of bathroom it was already gone. I do not have bad breath I bought this based off the reviews. Again I will stick to crest!!</li>
            <li> Strong but no burn and has helped my clean up my mouth, now if it would just work on my mind!</li>
            <li> Like the flavor of this..not too strong but yet keeps your mouth feeling fresh for hours. Will keep using this!!</li>
            <li> This is probably is as good as Listrine or Crest mouth wash but about 2-3 times more expensive. I just tried 1 bottle and then switched to Listrine/Crest with no alcohol as my dentist told to avoid mouth wash with alcohol as it causes abrasion of the gums/teeth.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my mouth fresh! I always use this right after brushing my teeth with Squiggle and I can tell you that my mouth has never felt so squeaky clean! I can honestly say, cleaner than leaving the dentist!</li>
            <li> Been using breathrx since 2007.  Used to buy the small bottle in stores which lasted me a month. Since I can&#x27;t find this brand locally anymore this 33oz  serves me well for 5-6 months of use.</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash because It gives your mouth a nice fresh feel but doesn&#x27;t last all day. It definitely is a keeper</li>
            <li> Great complement to the toothpaste!  Been using for years and i really like the fresh breath smell and more importantly the confidence it gives me.  Great price, w/o tax and delivered to my front door!</li>
            <li> When purchasing this item in the store, I pay $8.99 for 16 ounces.  This is a very good bargain.  The product is the best mouthwash I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Eyes don&#x27;t tear up. The size is pretty good. I notice it keeps the breath in better shape come the next morning. Once I run out I&#x27;ll be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> My dentist uses this in his office and I liked the way my mouth felt clean all day without the alcohol which tends to dry out gums, and that&#x27;s not a good thing according to my dentist. The price here is almost half what my dentist charged so I am very happy. Recently had house guests who tried it and loved it too!</li>
            <li> Great mouthwash and its alcohol free which is even better. Will order again for sure. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Better than anything you can buy at the local drugstore where it is not usually available, anyway. Absolutely works!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, keeps me minty fresh. A little pricey, but your disgusting mouth-hole will thank you for going with the best.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with bad breath all my life. I have tried Cepacol Antibacterial, Smart Mouth Advanced, Listerine, Act Restoring, scope etc etc. The only one that worked was Listerine, but the problem I had with Listerine besides the alcohol is that the effects/fresh breath only last for an hour maybe two. I resorted to chewing gum to hide my breath (a pack a day)and this cause my teeth to develop cavities. I decided to give breathrx a try since the price on amazon was such a good deal 15.89 compared to 19.99 at a local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I notice was the lack of the burning feeling I received from Listerine. The breathrx left my mouth feeling refresh, a clean refreshing feeling not the chemical clean feel you get with Listerine. I used it at 12:45pm that day and at 11:15pm that night my breath was not smelly. I thought that over time the bacteria in my mouth would build up a resistance and my bad breath would return, but I am happy to say after over a month of use my bad breath has not returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a quick fix for bad oral hygiene. Bad breath can be cause by many thing. You still need to floss,brush at \\&quot;least\\&quot; two times a day, use a tongue scraper and have your teeth cleaned/checked my a dentist at \\&quot;least\\&quot; once a year.</li>
            <li> Allow me to suggest a better way to kill bad breath germs. try using a peroxide, baking soda, kosher salt mixed with water for bad breath and great for sinus problems. This stuff has a blue die that is VERY blue in color, and that cant be a good thing. If you have a problem with halitosis this will not cure it but it will mask it for about twenty minutes.</li>
            <li> The taste was fine but nothing amazing. This product did absolutely nothing for my bad breath. I was shocked that it did nothing. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> If you have bad breath, this will take care of it. use it in the morning and night and it keeps your mouth refreshing. It also last very long unlike other brand.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash has a pleasant taste - not harsh. The large bottle is a little unwieldy to use, so I got a small travel-size bottle to use and refill.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested i try this.  - so far, it has given  good results.  but i will need a longer try- out period to determine the effectiveness.  It leaves a strong taste, which lasts only a short time.- 10 secs. or so.  I think it is supposed to prevent tarter build- up&lt;br /&gt; will update later.</li>
            <li> Cannot comment on effectiveness but I decide not to use it again as it is very thick and very sweet (anywhere I can find a not flavored mouth rinse?). Not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the taste of this stuff in my mouth while using it and the after taste it leaves is pretty bad ... I don&#x27;t think it works all that well either.  I&#x27;d suggest &amp;#34;Smart Mouth&amp;#34; --- tastes better and works really great!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has a bad breath problem...along with a tongue scraper. It really works! Use it after you drink your coffee in the morning..........brush, rinse, scrap, rinse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year on the recommendation of my dentist.  I had pre-gingivitis and with daily use along with proper brushing (I have an Itelisonic electric tooth brush), this product has reversed my badly receding gums.  Where the hygenist would mark 4s and 5&#x27;s, I now have 1s 2s and 3s and only two 4s.  Unfortunately, the price of this product on Amazon has sky-rocketed and I get it much cheaper at my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried every brand of mouthwash and every remedy (both organic and medicinal) and this is literally the only one that works. It is not overly medicinal tasting and it definitely gets the job done. Keeps his breath smell-free all day... I will definitely keep buying this fantastic and affordable product!</li>
            <li> First of all, you won&#x27;t find this value size anymore at any store (not sure if Costco carry this size). You will only find it here on Amazon and for a cheaper price. This brand is what they use at my dentist&#x27;s clinic. I read some reviews from people getting some bad reactions for using it everyday. May I suggest that you mix it with water if it&#x27;s too strong but this is one of the best anti-bacterial mouthwash and better than Listerine, ACT or Scope. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW UPDATE (9/13/13):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I got the fake one. The front label is totally different from the pic above. I went to a nearby Walgreens and verified. And it says, Alcohol Free but this one seems to have more alcohol. Go to your local Walgreens, Target etc. store and buy the original. I thought I&#x27;m getting a good deal here. Amazon is a multi-billion dollar company now and can afford to replicate products. This is messed up!</li>
            <li> Have used the regular BreathRx and have been very happy.  So far this product doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed with the change of name.  My husband swears it heals his sore throat when he gargles with it at the 1st tickle.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a great price. My husband and i been using it for years.  They sell this in my dentist office for twice the amount we paid on Amazon.  I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Used Listerine for several year but got tired of the burning sensation from alcohol in my mouth - so I searched for a strong mouth rinse without alcohol and found this.  It works great!  Lasts MUCH longer than Listerine and no burning.</li>
            <li> It works, keeps your breath fresh but it has a very strong taste and after taste to it.&lt;br /&gt;Feels like you put fire in your mouth which is given I guess (Nature of the beast).</li>
            <li> Price is great ...  I love this product. I think this is the best mouth was h in the market...</li>
            <li> I used this product a long time ago on the recommendation of my dentist.  I stopped sing it and then started using listerine on the recommendation of another dentist.  Big mistake.  This works really well to kill germs that want to hang out in your mouth and on your tongue and tonsils.  It prevents the bad breath smell from coming back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Listerine and had no problems with that, but this stuff was waaaay too strong! I thought it would get better as I got used to it, but it never did. It worked great to freshen my breath and worked for a long time, but I will not be buying this again. It burned way too much and I dreaded taking it.</li>
            <li> big bottle, small price. not to mention the benefits. no after taste. very good investment. i believe in the concept of bargain. did not go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> The product works I just feel like I have dry mouth all day when I am done using it. It could just be me, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I last bought it at CVS pharmacy and almost didn&#x27;t purchase it here until I realized that the bottle shown was over twice the size of the retail bottle so it would be half the price I paid at CVS, and shipping was free when I purchased 3 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouth rinse works well, I use it twice a day, and my dentist is pleased with how it has worked on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have terrible teeth and dry mouth, this is an excellent mouthwash. No burning or excessive tingling.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be better based on the reviews. To me, it&#x27;s just the same as other mouthwashes. Doesn&#x27;t burn like listerine or taste bad either.</li>
            <li> When I use this mouthwash in conjunction with the BreathRX toothpaste I feel like my teeth are BULLETPROOF!  This mouthwash is EXCELLENT to say the least, it is on par with Listerine and it totally gets your mouth clean and I&#x27;m sure your mouth won&#x27;t be full of germs and bacteria and all that other junk that a person&#x27;s mouth is known for... BreathRX is one of the better brands of oral products I have used and I think I won&#x27;t go back to the usual ones ever again.  Give it a shot, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> How is this item so highly rated? It has so much artificial sweetener in it that it tastes like liquid candy. The sweetness gets stuck in your throat and you need a water gargle after using this mouthwash just to feel clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using BreathRx for over 6 months.  My dental hygienist sold me my first bottle which was half the size and about the same price as the larger 33oz bottle on Amazon.  I was using a nationally known brand that contained alcohol.  I have problem gums and form tartar and was looking for something that would be anti-bacterial.  I was getting gum irritations using the other brand so she suggested BreathRx because it has no alcohol and she thought it was a good product.  I&#x27;ve found that it has helped reduce the amount of tartar and I have fewer gum irritations.  This is the second large bottle I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.  I guess it helps with bad breath but I bought it to reduce tartar and gum infections.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mouthwash in the market.  I have very sensitive gums to the point they are bleeding. I was given Peridex (Prescription) from the dentist for 2 months.  Was looking for a similar mouthwash to the Peridex.  This is alcohol free, does not cause harm to your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pay $11.00 for half this size at Walgreens or CVS.  Very cheap buying here @Amazon!!!  Highly Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best product for keeping your breath fresh.  Listerine, scope, things like that are not in the same league.  Use morning and night and you even wake up with fresh breath. Bottom line, I will never be without it. The price for this size bottle is wonderful also.  Worth ever penny.</li>
            <li> I have tried many mouthwashes, and I find this to be the best.  It goes down easy, and my breath is a lot better during the day.  Paired with the tongue scraper, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It was good but to much money for a moitheash</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Works great and it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> Good price, arrived when it was supposed to</li>
            <li> I had dealt with  bad gingivitis and subsequently, halatosis also.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve seen on the market.  I  found  it at my dentist/orthodontist.  He was selling it to me at his wholesale price at the  time</li>
            <li> I had switched to Crest Pro-Health mouthwash for a bit because it was on sale, and it actually stained my teeth horribly. Many others have had this same problem with the Crest Pro-Health. My dentist has advised me to only use this mouthwash. BreathRx works really well - and my dental checkups have improved since using it. I purchased it on Amazon for half the retail store price!</li>
            <li> Product works well I suppose.  I haven&#x27;t counted any of my mouth germs to see if they&#x27;re actually dying though.  I guess the only way I&#x27;ll know for sure if this product works is if I still have all of my teeth when I&#x27;m 80.  I do have a few minor complaints.  It doesn&#x27;t burn as much as the product that rhymes with Mr. Mean, but let&#x27;s just say that after 30 seconds you&#x27;re glad to spit it out.  This economy size is MUCH cheaper than buying it at the local drug store, but the capsize sucks.  The cap for the 16 oz is exactly 1/2 an ounce but the cap on the bigger economy sized bottle is less than that.  What were they thinking by making the cap smaller?</li>
            <li> i have been using this for a while and dont plan on switching,&lt;br /&gt;stay away from listerine, too much alcohol in there, this is all good</li>
            <li> Seems good enough, but, I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working, or not.</li>
            <li> I have used it for over a month and have noticed no difference, not to mention it leaves a bad after taste in your mouth. It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong product and had to return it.  I was looking for the mouthwash that goes in pets water bowls for fresher breath and this mouthwash was for people</li>
            <li> I have never seen this low price before.  Usually I pay $10 for one 16-oz bottle of BreathRx and this is the same price for the economy size 33-ozs AND free shipping as a Prime Member.  As a result, I ordered two bottles to use as refills in my bathrooms.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> My mouth stays fresh. It neutralizes the odor from drinking coffee. I bet it is good for cigarette smokers.  It does&#x27;t sting which I like best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve historically been a user of Listerine&#x27;s alcohol-based products, but figured I&#x27;d give this a shot (no pun intended, despite mentioning alcohol based competing products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To best summarize: this product is SO much easier on my mouth than Listerine, et al. I have tried Listerine&#x27;s alcohol-free products and they weren&#x27;t that much better than their alcohol ones insofar as how they felt in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BreathRx stuff is phenomenal! It&#x27;s so easy to keep in your mouth because it&#x27;s not stinging and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh odor or taste. The odor from BreathRx is slightly akin to a bubblegum scent (in my opinion) and is quite pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like I was and were becoming leery of just using mouthwash because of what you&#x27;d find in your local supermarket and how caustic competitor&#x27;s products felt in your mouth, then get this NOW. This BreathRx mouthwash proves that not all mouthwash products have to feel like they&#x27;re stinging your mouth like crazy and are, as a result, uncomfortable past ten seconds of &#x27;swishing&#x27; around in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this wash a few times now and it, as far as I can tell, keeps my mouth fresh till I eat over five hours (or so) later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended (especially for those who are tired of mouthwashes because of how other brands feel).</li>
            <li> The best mouthwash ever!!</li>
            <li> Started using this after years of using listerine. This one doesnt burn and keeps your breath fresh for an amazingly long time.</li>
            <li> The best mouthwash I&#x27;ve used.  It works and cleans your mouth inside.  I used another product for awhile and strongly noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> very good product price just right  size is excellent never seen a bottle that size. much cheaper for the size.</li>
            <li> Its mouthwash and it tastes like chemicals. I don&#x27;t know if thats just a mental thing as the bottle appears to glow there is so much blue food coloring in it. Other than that I probably will try something else once I am done with this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mouth wash for some time now. The only place I can find it is on Amazon. It is good and clean.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this to me years ago and I still prefer it to anything else on the market.  It&#x27;s not overly strong but strong enough to feel very good.</li>
            <li> Good mouth rinse that we used to buy locally, but since it is not carried here anymore had to buy it on line.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Doesn&#x27;t burn (unlike most alcohol-based mouthwashes).  I prefer this style cap to the Listerine style (where the cap is a little cup).</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I&#x27;ve used it for 13 years ever since my dentist recommended it.  You can find this even sometimes in local stores now.  I also keep a tiny spray bottle of this product in the vehicles to squirt on the tongue if I forget to do it before I leave home.  Swish and expel on the go.  Really does work well.</li>
            <li> The best mouthwash on the market.  I am subscribed to this on &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; and believe me this is a superior product!  This mouth wash is like no other.  My dentist told me about it because it kills germs so much better than other mouthwashes.  It leaves no &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; type taste in your mouth and your breath smells fresh not medicated.  It&#x27;s pricy but worth every penny and this is a much better price than you will find ANYWHERE!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used BreathRx for years and even though many people might consider it expensive - let me tell you - it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> To wipe out bad breath in a hurry, this stuff is great. For all day? Nope. I smoke cigars and anyone knows you can&#x27;t get worse breath than cigar breath. I don&#x27;t want to offend anyone, so I have tried a boatload of different mouthwashes. This being one. It works on &#x27;cigar breath&#x27; for a while, but dry mouth creeps back in, and so does the bad odor. Try it, you might like it, but just don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> Too much exposure to breath mints and other products left me with a serious contact allergy. As a result, I can&#x27;t use most mouthwashes anymore. If I do use one, it burns and numbs my tongue, and even one usage takes several days to get over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash does the job, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt me. The dentist recommended it. I think it is not endorsed by the ADA, though. When I asked my current dentist about that, he told me that the endorsement is expensive and not all products try to get one, but that this is an excellent mouthwash.</li>
            <li> For years I have searched for a product that would help me keep my mouth clean between checkups.  I have gone from needing to have my teeth cleaned every three months to four months because of excessive plaque buildup despite excellent care and if this next check up is okay will be moving to 5 months....first time in my life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they don&#x27;t make this anymore, but it is a fantastic mouthwash.  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in local stores.  I can only find on Amazon......thank God.  My dental hygienist recommended this mouthwash for effective bad breath relief as well as for gingivitus.  My dental checkups have improved since using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This is the only mouth wash I use. It works and little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Refreshing taste; have not used it long enough to decide whether it actually does work in conjuction with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> this is the only mouthwash i have ever used that actually gets rid of bad breath and really leaves your teeth feeling clean for hours.  this is a good buy compared to the drugstore price</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is very hard to find so buy it on amazon. The price is also excellent on amazon. Both my husband and I use it and find it the best out there. Definitely worth the extra few dollars.</li>
            <li> Seems like good stuff but I compared the ingredients to Crest Pro health which is like $5 bucks and much cheaper than this and the ingredients are the same so I will probably just buy that from now on and wont bother with buying this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has a slight problem with bad breath and does not like any other mouth wash. I use ACT mint, but this is what our dentist uses so we were both familiar with it prior to purchasing it. It&#x27;s refreshing, tastes nice and has no alcohol which dries the mouth causing even more halitosis.</li>
            <li> I have never had a mouthwash that I really liked until I had BreathRX at my dentist&#x27;s clinic.&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I&#x27;ve been looking for it online and found it here in Amazon! My next purchase is already in my wishlist. Ready for purchase soon as I used up this batch.</li>
