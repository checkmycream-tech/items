            <li>The soap is fine and the seller is fine, but the soap smell is not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller sent the items as requested and in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely without lathering too much.</li>
            <li>It is a square bar of soap that somewhat smells like Moroccanoil--not nearly as rich as the shampoo and conditioners.  </li>

            <li>It smells great, is a lovely bar of soap and does the job however, I would not likely buy this again due to the very high price for a bar of soap ($14-$16) - maybe for a special occasion</li>
            <li>Smells great, but for 9.00 a bar, not sure what the benefit of it is.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It does not leave a residue on my skin like so many other products do.&lt;br /&gt;almost</li>
            <li>This is a nice bar of soap, but I am not sure it justifies the price.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Truly great soap and I love the product. But for 17? It is a relatively small bat of soap.</li>
            <li> Love the bar soap. The smell is wonderful. Even better than the body butter and other items I have purchased from Moroccanoil</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my aunt. A first time purchase for her to try. She is very happy with it. Makes her smell good and softens her skin. She will keep a supply of this in her stock.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this soap after using the moroccan hair oil and shampoo.  No disappointments.  Lovely!</li>
            <li> I saved this brand of soap on wishlist and decided to order it. I will store this bar in my closet along side the one hundred bars I have ordered using my Prime membership. Big fancy package and a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> Received it fast just what I ordered. Love the moroccan oil but so expensive. Maybe you can lower the price and more people will buy.</li>
            <li> This product is garbage.  It is a square bar of soap that somewhat smells like Moroccanoil--not nearly as rich as the shampoo and conditioners.  I felt like it kind of dried out my skin a little bit so I am no longer using it daily. It&#x27;s probably fake.</li>
            <li> This is a luxurious soap. It lathers nicely without lathering too much. It is moisturizing and leaves no residue.  It smells wonderful.  I shave my legs while I have this lathered on and my skin feels very soft afterwards. It is very expensive for one bar but I think I will buy it again because I will not invest in the morrocanoil shimmer oil.</li>
            <li> This soap does not dry your skin out.  I wish the fragrance was a little stronger though.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to order more....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received on time and had no issued....Thanks</li>
            <li> Smells great, but for 9.00 a bar, not sure what the benefit of it is. Bought as a treat, makes a nice gift but for everyday use stick to a cheaper soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap!  It moisturizes and the fragrance is beautiful.  Lives up to Moroccan Oil quality.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!! It makes my skin appear younger and look fresher.&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave a residue on my skin like so many other products do.&lt;br /&gt;almost a s good as the argan oil soap I bought in Morocco.I will surely&lt;br /&gt;be a repeat customer, Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> what a smell, cleans well, leaves you smelling like a million bucks, feels nice to the skin and soft places</li>
            <li> love the scent and the lather.  the only problem is price.  it appears you get 2 bars for this price, but you don&#x27;t.  and it&#x27;s cheaper at Nordstrom&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!  Best facial soap ever.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like Moroccanoil and doesn&#x27;t moistureize.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Moroccanoil products.  This is a nice bar of soap, but I am not sure it justifies the price.</li>

It smells great, is a lovely bar of soap and does the job however, I would not likely buy this again due to the very high price for a bar of soap ($14-$16) - maybe for a special occasion but otherwise, no.
