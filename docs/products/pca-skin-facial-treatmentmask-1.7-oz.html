            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Anyone with rosacea, 1) be sure to wear SPF.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the texture.</li>
            <li>I put a bit more since it is not heavy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I love the way it just melts into my skin.</li>

            <li>but this is more hydrating and stays longer.</li>
            <li>Its good for dry skin,leaves your skin smooth,Its great</li>
            <li>five stars proves how much I love it!</li>
            <li>it does a great job keeping skin soft and hydrated after a treatment.</li>
            <li>I had just undergone a chemical peel and wanted to have a light moisturizer that would provide lots of hydration to my top level skin cells.</li>
            <li>Last week after an isolaze treatment and my semi-annual botox injections with my dearest Dr. Brandt and Dr. Analik (see this month&#x27;s edition of MORE magazine for a great article on Dr. Analik)</li>
            <li>Because of the hydrocortisone ingredient, this product gives me GREAT relief from rosacea flare-ups &amp; really helps calm inflammation.</li>
            <li>A light cream.  </li>
            <li>Sun exposure can cause flare-ups. 2) Products that are overly-drying also exacerbate the condition - but it is important to still 3)</li>
            <li>It is not too greasy and not too light so you can feel it&#x27;s doing the job of moisturizing you</li>
            <li>The facial wash is great as well.  </li>
            <li>looks great non greasy and dry free.</li>
            <li>I order this product before I run out because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>This balm is excellent for calming red sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>clean the skin of theSPF plus anything else at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m not crazy about it</li>
            <li>It also has a fresh soothing scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it during the day right before my makeup</li>
            <li>So if you put it on right before you do your makeup</li>
            <li>I am grateful that Amazon carries it so it can be delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li>It also feels great because of the wonderful moisture it provides here in my hometown in Southern California - which has a dry climate and very hard water.</li>
            <li>I found that it works very well at night if you put it on after a regular moisturizer it kind of leaves a protective layer of moisture on your face</li>
            <li>While I have not gone back to get any more TCA peels I have re-purchased this product again.</li>
            <li>I received my first PCA apres after a laser rejuvenation treatment.  </li>
            <li>I am in the process of changing over to the whole PCA line!  </li>
            <li>Make my face feel and look soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many facial products, but, I have to say,</li>
            <li>I love this product, but did not expect to find it so much cheaper than I could when I purchased it locally.  </li>
            <li>I love the product,its great,I have been using  pca for long time.</li>
            <li>I find the smell of this balm too fruity, and even though the texture feels fine, it definitely doesn&#x27;t go well as an underlayer for makeup.</li>
            <li>I suggest putting it on a while before you do your makeup and not too much of it.  </li>
            <li>it absorbs straight through the skin and in the morning when I wake up my skin</li>
            <li>The scent stays with you and it is very calming.  </li>
            <li>it absorbs fast .</li>
            <li>The pH of this cream seems to help with my occasional acne flair-ups, and clears up the redness pretty quickly while moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>when I use a different moisturizer, even my skin texture is less pleasant.</li>
            <li>To many years of sun, pigmentation, break outs due to loss of estrogen (age 61)</li>
            <li>This product is an excellent moisturizer for dry, middle aged, rosacea prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And look our for the launch of our new pimples and wrinkles site this month with Spa reviews, Treatment reviews and Product reviews.</li>
            <li>It did do a decent job of keep my skin soft and hydrated when I used it at night.</li>
            <li>It is pretty gross.</li>
            <li>I picked up this cream at the Tribeca Med Spa in New York, a renowned med spa that offers a range of laser treatments, injectables and peels.</li>
            <li>I like to use it after I get microdermabrasions, peels or anything that makes your skin sensitive.</li>
            <li>use this frequently as a night cream.</li>
            <li>at night before going to bed wake up and skin feels soft</li>
            <li>My derm doc &amp; facialist both frowned upon frequent use of hydrocortisone because it is a steroid.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>PCA Skin should really provide a small plastic spatula to use when taking the balm out of the jar - for those true germaphobes out there.</li>
            <li>It gets dry here in Los Angeles and I love how this makes my skin feel hydrated without feeling oily or too heavy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to those living in dry climates.</li>
            <li>Btw, I have tried drugstore hydrocortisone cream &amp; gotten a bit of a similar effect from the active ingredient - but the PCA Skin is ever so much nicer.</li>
            <li>Almost like a grapefruit/peach blend - hard to describe but super yummy.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Almost like a grapefruit/peach blend - hard to describe but super yummy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This winter was long and dry and my face never dried, even at my age (55)</li>
            <li> If you have ever had facial peels, laser facial treatments or other cosmetic procedures, you understand how sensitive your skin can be post-treatment.</li>
            <li> This particular cream was a bit too heavy for my skin leaving my face oily after applying makeup .</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is thick and creamy, for skin that really needs extra moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this moisturizer will have you wanting to lather up all day long.  </li>
            <li> I use it as an everyday moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Works super well after a peel though - hardly any peeling with using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite as dry as I thought .</li>
            <li> My husband even started using it on his dry patches.</li>
            <li> I had been using the PCA Skin Collagen Hydrator but my skin still felt dry</li>
            <li> I went in to have a facial a few weeks later</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m careful to keep germs out, I always lose the last little bit because mold starts growing in there.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a fine balance to cleanse and exfoliate without making my skin mad -</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The other product I did buy along with this one is PCA</li>
            <li> wait to try other thing of theirs .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered other products as well.</li>
            <li> Use it when my skin feels especially dry.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was slightly lighter in weight so that during the summer it felt a bit lighter but other than that</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll find that when you wash your face in the morning this product will still have not absorbed through the skin all the way</li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple down sides: as you can see from pic, the product is in a jar.</li>
            <li> I am using it morning and night because the climate is so dry and cold where I live.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for a few days.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use too heavy creams .</li>
            <li> With any other product I would deduct at least one star.</li>
            <li> After a chemical peel she applied this product to my face and offered me a small sample of it.</li>
            <li> I got a small post peel kit and this was in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too lazy to try that, but perhaps it would preserve the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through at least five</li>
            <li> but if I don&#x27;t get those steps right...then my skin is mad anyway).</li>
            <li> No greasy feel or annoying odor.</li>
            <li> I have the worst skin.  </li>

            <li> I really love all pca products! This particular cream was a bit too heavy for my skin leaving my face oily after applying makeup . I&#x27;m not quite as dry as I thought . The silk coat balm is perfect for me. If you have very dry skin this would be a great cream for you!</li>
            <li> I love the way this cream smells when I put it on.  The pH of this cream seems to help with my occasional acne flair-ups, and clears up the redness pretty quickly while moisturizing.  I notice a big difference when I use a different moisturizer, even my skin texture is less pleasant.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but did not expect to find it so much cheaper than I could when I purchased it locally.  I loved the great service, free shipping, and it is the best face cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I discovered PCA through a beauty facialist who  who I have received facials from .  After a chemical peel she applied this product to my face and offered me a small sample of it. I got hooked on this creamy texture  and now use it as a moisturizer during the winter weather. I love the feel and smell of it too. My son uses PCA&#x27;s acne products and his acne and scars have cleared up on his facial wonderfully. It is non drying product and so his face does not peel and his scars have vanished.</li>
            <li> I picked up this cream at the Tribeca Med Spa in New York, a renowned med spa that offers a range of laser treatments, injectables and peels. I tried out a series of TCA peels (a post for another time) but also picked up \\&quot;Apres Peel Soothing Balm\\&quot; by PCA SKin. I had never heard of these products before. While I have not gone back to get any more TCA peels I have re-purchased this product again. Last week after an isolaze treatment and my semi-annual botox injections with my dearest Dr. Brandt and Dr. Analik (see this month&#x27;s edition of MORE magazine for a great article on Dr. Analik) I used this cream for a few days. I like to use it after I get microdermabrasions, peels or anything that makes your skin sensitive. If you have ever had facial peels, laser facial treatments or other cosmetic procedures, you understand how sensitive your skin can be post-treatment. This balm is excellent for calming red sensitive skin. It has a nice consistency and soothes recovering skin. it does a great job keeping skin soft and hydrated after a treatment.

            <li> I received my first PCA apres after a laser rejuvenation treatment.  After the laser treatment healed I continued to use the product.  My skin never felt or looked so good.  It leaves a dewey youthful glow.  I went in to have a facial a few weeks later and the lady said, \\&quot;I am not even going to recommend any products because your skin looks so good.\\&quot;  I am in the process of changing over to the whole PCA line!  I am so glad Amazon has their products!</li>
            <li> I bought this balm because of the word hydrating in its name. I had just undergone a chemical peel and wanted to have a light moisturizer that would provide lots of hydration to my top level skin cells. I find the smell of this balm too fruity, and even though the texture feels fine, it definitely doesn&#x27;t go well as an underlayer for makeup. It did do a decent job of keep my skin soft and hydrated when I used it at night.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer that does not give me acne. I wish it was slightly lighter in weight so that during the summer it felt a bit lighter but other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the product,its great,I have been using  pca for long time.Its good for dry skin,leaves your skin smooth,Its great</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and decided to try this product out for use after my microdermabrasion sessions although this product is great and smells great, kind of like oranges.  I found that it works very well at night if you put it on after a regular moisturizer it kind of leaves a protective layer of moisture on your face but you&#x27;ll find that when you wash your face in the morning this product will still have not absorbed through the skin all the way and you can feel it being washed off.  I&#x27;ve tried using it during the day right before my makeup and it does not mix well with makeup.  So if you put it on right before you do your makeup I suggest putting it on a while before you do your makeup and not too much of it.  Other than that it&#x27;s a good product but i&#x27;m not crazy about it and I would not buy it again.  The other product I did buy along with this one is PCA Re Balance this product I use at night as a moisturizer and its great it absorbs straight through the skin and in the morning when I wake up my skin looks great non greasy and dry free. I do recommend this one.</li>
            <li> A light cream.  Can be used anytime.  No greasy feel or annoying odor.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product of all time. I got a small post peel kit and this was in it. The scent is a nice orange, but very light. The product slips on like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;I use this frequently as a night cream. In the morning when I wash my face, I can still feel it. This winter was long and dry and my face never dried, even at my age (55)</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes your skin feel&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel greasy at all&lt;br /&gt;Wear at night before going to bed wake up and skin feels soft</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s worked wonders on my skin and especially the area around my eyes. My husband even started using it on his dry patches. The order process was simple. The package arrived quickly. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Because of the hydrocortisone ingredient, this product gives me GREAT relief from rosacea flare-ups &amp; really helps calm inflammation. My derm doc &amp; facialist both frowned upon frequent use of hydrocortisone because it is a steroid. However the prescription Metrogel doesn&#x27;t seem to give the relief for rosacea pustules like my beloved Apres Peel. So I will keep using it. Btw, I have tried drugstore hydrocortisone cream &amp; gotten a bit of a similar effect from the active ingredient - but the PCA Skin is ever so much nicer. It also feels great because of the wonderful moisture it provides here in my hometown in Southern California - which has a dry climate and very hard water. My face just drinks it in. I am fair, with dry-to-normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not purchased on here before, but will give it a shot - as price is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple down sides: as you can see from pic, the product is in a jar. To try and prevent contaminating the contents with my finger - I try and always wash my hands before dipping in. PCA Skin should really provide a small plastic spatula to use when taking the balm out of the jar - for those true germaphobes out there. Also (and this is a big one), the product truly does have a shelf life. Even though I&#x27;m careful to keep germs out, I always lose the last little bit because mold starts growing in there. It is pretty gross. With any other product I would deduct at least one star. The fact I am still giving Apres Peel five stars proves how much I love it! I&#x27;ve gone through at least five jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggest you check the expiration date on the package when you receive it. And if you can, maybe even keep it in a refrigerator during the warmer months. I&#x27;m too lazy to try that, but perhaps it would preserve the product a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Anyone with rosacea, 1) be sure to wear SPF. Sun exposure can cause flare-ups. 2) Products that are overly-drying also exacerbate the condition - but it is important to still 3) clean the skin of theSPF plus anything else at the end of the day. And I am also finding that 4) exfoliation is really key (it&#x27;s a fine balance to cleanse and exfoliate without making my skin mad - but if I don&#x27;t get those steps right...then my skin is mad anyway). Hope this helps someone out there!</li>
            <li> PCA Skin pHaze 11+ Apres Hydrating Balm. Make my face feel and look soft and smooth. It is a great cream.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is thick and creamy, for skin that really needs extra moisturizing.  It lasts a long time, smells great, and makes my skin feel great.  Highly recommend to those living in dry climates.</li>
            <li> I have been using PCA products for years. I use this one as my day moisturizer and it is just great</li>
            <li> My skin care provider recommended this product to me after a treatment.  I love the smell and the texture. It hydrates beautifully. I now use it regularly.  Buying from Amazon makes that possible</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and very reasonably priced for the quality.</li>
            <li> My skin is between oily to combination so I can&#x27;t use too heavy creams . That&#x27;s why I find these cream so good for my face  . It is not too greasy and not too light so you can feel it&#x27;s doing the job of moisturizing you face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I use is morning (5 min before makeup) and before bedtime . Tip- before bedtime I put a bit more since it is not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;this is the second one I buy!&lt;br /&gt;And all of the PCA products seems great, I use their Toner as well.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to try other thing of theirs .</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent moisturizer for dry, middle aged, rosacea prone, sensitive skin. I use it alone at night and in conjunction with PCA Skin Hydrator Plus SPF 30 during the day with no irritation.</li>
            <li> The smell of this moisturizer will have you wanting to lather up all day long.  The scent stays with you and it is very calming.  Almost like a grapefruit/peach blend - hard to describe but super yummy.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to get a peel to use it.  I use it as an everyday moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Works super well after a peel though - hardly any peeling with using it.</li>
            <li> I had been using the PCA Skin Collagen Hydrator but my skin still felt dry so I decided to try this hydrating balm and I am so glad that I did. I love the way it just melts into my skin. I find it to be a very light non-greasy product that provides a lot of moisture. It also has a fresh soothing scent. I am using it morning and night because the climate is so dry and cold where I live. This is a product I will not be without. I am grateful that Amazon carries it so it can be delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many facial products, but, I have to say, I have never had any product regardless of price give me what the PCA products have given me.  I have the worst skin.  To many years of sun, pigmentation, break outs due to loss of estrogen (age 61) I can honestly say, I have seen improvements, hydration, clearing of breakouts.  I am so happy. I&#x27;ve ordered other products as well. The facial wash is great as well.  You will be pleased.</li>
            <li> I order this product before I run out because I love it so much! It gets dry here in Los Angeles and I love how this makes my skin feel hydrated without feeling oily or too heavy. Its just the best feeling products on my face that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I discovered this in a high-end spa after having a peel.  Use it when my skin feels especially dry.  Have been resupplying myself via Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this as my nightly moisturizer and it works great!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts. Felt similar to cliniques moisture surge but this is more hydrating and stays longer. Not greasy but you know it works. Use it on the plane and you&#x27;ll this is a good product...</li>
            <li> I wear this after PCA serum and vitamin C products. It makes my skin feel soft and refreshed. It is a very good night cream too. add a lot of moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li> it absorbs fast . used it with exlinea serum when i go to bed</li>
    </ol>
