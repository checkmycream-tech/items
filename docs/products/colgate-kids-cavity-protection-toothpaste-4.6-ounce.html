            <li>My boys love w flavor!</li>
            <li>so it makes brushing teeth much more pleasant.</li>
            <li>He liked to just eat it, which concerned me since it has fluoride in it.  </li>
            <li>:) But its quality toothpaste at a good price.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s nice to have a go between.</li>
            <li>Its nice having it autoshipped, so that I don&#x27;t have to remember to buy it. :)</li>
            <li>Same product as the stores, awesome prive</li>
            <li>kids love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve purchased it many times, its a favorite in our house.</li>
            <li>so what is so great about being soft on enamel ?</li>
            <li>Unless your an extreme couponer, this is a great price for Colgate kids toothpaste and my kids love the taste!</li>
            <li>Cleaned well and no bad breath.</li>
            <li>This is my older daughter&#x27;s favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Not too &#x27;spicy&#x27; for him and gets rid of his morning breath pretty well!  </li>
            <li>they are ready for flouride but not quite ready for potent mint flavor yet.</li>
            <li>Been searching for a good tooth paste for my 3year old and this is it its the only one he will use</li>
            <li>Personally I think this tastes better than the Oral B brand children&#x27;s toothpaste.</li>
            <li>He really likes the &amp;#34;sparklies&amp;#34; in it.</li>
            <li>I did not realize that training toothpaste is different than this and is better for kids this young who still will swallow it all, so we are now using that instead.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy two unless you have a lot of kids or they are older.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I always worry about with trying a new kid toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable when compared to the stores and we will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li>it mentions soft on enamel but see all the inactive ingredients!</li>
            <li>The tube is pretty big.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old son enjoys this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>7yr old likes it,</li>
            <li>4.5 yr old says it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;spicy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t a whole lot of ways to go wrong. :)</li>
            <li>Size is smaller than adult toothpaste; I just wish someone would invent a dispenser which allocated the correct amount of toothpaste for kids to avoid the dreaded &#x27;over-squeeze&#x27;!</li>
            <li>I got this for my son as he is starting to learn to brush his teeth (18 months old).  </li>

            <li> We will try this toothpaste again when he is a little older as he did appear to like the flavor.</li>
            <li> Lasts us a very long time.</li>
            <li> I REALLY do not care for the taste of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste helps them be less resistant to teeth brushing.</li>
            <li> My daughter did not like the regular Crest brand I bought for her since she was starting to have bad breath at 6.  </li>
            <li> My kids did not like the taste unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say they run to brush their teeth since buying, but sadly, I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with Colagate toothpaste for kids/toddlers?</li>
            <li> My child uses it, doesn&#x27;t hate it, but is very messy with the tube.</li>

            <li> I REALLY do not care for the taste of this toothpaste. The kids don&#x27;t like it, either. Yucky.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste for kids ever. It tastes yummy. My daughter loves it</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son enjoys this toothpaste.  Not too &#x27;spicy&#x27; for him and gets rid of his morning breath pretty well!

            <li> My 5 y/I loves this toothpaste. He really likes the &amp;#34;sparklies&amp;#34; in it. Lasts us a very long time.</li>
            <li> My boys love w flavor!</li>

            <li> Great kids toothpaste... Blue, of course</li>
            <li> No complaints about taste from the kids. That&#x27;s what I always worry about with trying a new kid toothpaste. Cleaned well and no bad breath.</li>
            <li> it mentions soft on enamel but see all the inactive ingredients! and the blue # 1 ... so what is so great about being soft on enamel ?</li>
            <li> I have this as one of my monthly subscribe and save purchases. Unless your an extreme couponer, this is a great price for Colgate kids toothpaste and my kids love the taste!</li>
            <li> My kids don&#x27;t mind the taste of this toothpaste so it makes brushing teeth much more pleasant. We have this on subscribe and save so every two months we get another tube and we never have to run out to the store to get it. Great price, great toothpaste, and super convenient.</li>
            <li> My daughter did not like the regular Crest brand I bought for her since she was starting to have bad breath at 6.  I purchased this toothpaste and she no longer hesitates about brushing her teeth and complaining about the toothpaste. The price was very reasonable when compared to the stores and we will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> My kids do not like &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; toothpaste. This toothpaste helps them be less resistant to teeth brushing. I wish I could say they run to brush their teeth since buying, but sadly, I can&#x27;t. :) But its quality toothpaste at a good price. Its nice having it autoshipped, so that I don&#x27;t have to remember to buy it. :)</li>
            <li> Been searching for a good tooth paste for my 3year old and this is it its the only one he will use I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li> kids love this toothpaste. they are ready for flouride but not quite ready for potent mint flavor yet. this buble gum flavored toothpaste is great for them.</li>
            <li> The tube is pretty big.  I would say it will last my toddler for months+++.  Don&#x27;t buy two unless you have a lot of kids or they are older.</li>
            <li> 7yr old likes it, 4.5 yr old says it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;spicy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with Colagate toothpaste for kids/toddlers?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste. There aren&#x27;t a whole lot of ways to go wrong. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son doesn&#x27;t fight against using it, nor does he suck it out of the tube like candy. I think they&#x27;ve struck a solid balance between &amp;#34;tasty enough to be palatable to a child, but not so yummy as to be snack food.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great kids toothpaste. We&#x27;ve purchased it many times, its a favorite in our house.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY BRAND I USE. I LIKE IT</li>
            <li> Good product and price.</li>
            <li> This is my older daughter&#x27;s favorite toothpaste. She feel&#x27;s grown up when using this, vs if I buy her Barbie toothpaste which my younger daughter loves. So it&#x27;s nice to have a go between.</li>
            <li> No compliants. My child uses it, doesn&#x27;t hate it, but is very messy with the tube.</li>
