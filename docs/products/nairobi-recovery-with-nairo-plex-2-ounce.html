    <ol>
            <li>Nairobi is the best hair care</li>
            <li>Great product; I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Give it a chance to see how good it is.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied  with my order and shipment.</li>
            <li>Have used this product with the Nairobi Recovery Scalp Treatment Serum and have found amazing results</li>
            <li>Very best product I&#x27;ve used on my edges and the nap of my hair so far!</li>
            <li>I love how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>MAKES IT LOOK  AND FEEL BETTER</li>
            <li>This product was the bomb I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this product !</li>
            <li>This is a very good product not only do I use it for myself but for my child also.</li>
            <li>Will do another review in a couple of more months to give accurate results.</li>
            <li>Good product and I am really seeing results...</li>
            <li>It makes my hair easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s light on your scalp.</li>
            <li>I know that petrolatum is one of the \\&quot;no no\\&quot; ingredients that is listed in this product, but so does BB Super Gro Maximum strength, which I use on the rest of my hair, and my hair and edges have responded well to both products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d expect more from a professional hair care company.  </li>
            <li>You want to use this cream for your edges because the front of your hair is the most sensitive part of your hair.</li>
            <li>Like one reviewer said (which I read before purchasing), you have to be consistent and patient, its not a &amp;#34;miracle grow&amp;#34;, its not &amp;#34;you didn&#x27;t see me, now you</li>
            <li>and I am almost done with the first one.</li>
            <li>I would assume that it would be good for thinning hair if anyone has that problem because the edges are the easiest to damage but the most difficult to grow back; if it works well on the edges, then I&#x27;m sure it will work well on the rest of the hair.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good but just think the bottle is too small for the price.</li>
            <li>I am of African decent and tried many hair producers that will try to keep the hair moisturized..</li>
            <li>I started using Nairobi Recovery consistently only on my edges, and my edges have truly filled in.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is struggling with thinning edges.  </li>
            <li>I stopped getting relaxers, continued using my regular hair care products on my hair, and incorporated Nairobi Recovery into my regimen by lightly applying it only to my edges on a daily basis, and I can honestly say that my edges are much fuller and has nearly caught up with the rest of my hair with regards to thickness, and I have very thick hair.  </li>
            <li>So all you have to do is just use a little bit wherever you feel you have light spots.</li>
            <li>I put it on my daughters hair at night and in the morning after taking the scarf off the hair is not dried out its shiny and soft..</li>
            <li>I like that the grease made my hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li>Ok...so I am from African decent, I lost my hairline to braids, had it bald and decided to grow it back with the help of braids.</li>

            <li> I love how it made my hair feel. Very best product I&#x27;ve used on my edges and the nap of my hair so far!</li>
            <li> I love this product.. I am of African decent and tried many hair producers that will try to keep the hair moisturized.. I put it on my daughters hair at night and in the morning after taking the scarf off the hair is not dried out its shiny and soft..I can&#x27;t wait to use the shampoo conditioner combo.. Although it has petroleum your not sip pies to use a tin to clog the hair and that&#x27;s where you condition wash black hair requires lots of moisture in order to not break. Wish it came in a bigger container cause I use for all of my girls and myself.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s light on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Nairobi is the best hair care</li>
            <li> Have used this product with the Nairobi Recovery Scalp Treatment Serum and have found amazing results</li>
            <li> Works well with the  Nairobi Recovery  Salp treatment serum</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, a product that claims to recover your hair actually contributed to it&#x27;s thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petrolatum is the base ingredient in this product.  Basically, you&#x27;re putting petroleum jelly on your scalp.  This clogs the hair follicles, which contributes to thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d expect more from a professional hair care company.  I regret using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using Nioxin Hair Booster to try to undo the damage done by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware!</li>
            <li> It is pretty good but just think the bottle is too small for the price.</li>
            <li> This product works well. I was introduced to it by my hair stylist. My edges were fallen out after pregnancy. And this product did wonders! You want to use this cream for your edges because the front of your hair is the most sensitive part of your hair. So all you have to do is just use a little bit wherever you feel you have light spots. I initially bought it for my daughter because her hair on her hairline has fallen out badly. So I am still using it on her. Will do another review in a couple of more months to give accurate results.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS WELL WITH STOPPING YOUR HAIR FROM BREAKING AND COMMING OUT IN YOUR COMB OR BRUSH MAKES IT LOOK  AND FEEL BETTER</li>
            <li> This product was the bomb I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this product ! Its not a miracle but it helps ! Helps grow hair  but not replace damage hair follicles !</li>
            <li> This is a very good product not only do I use it for myself but for my child also. Give it a chance to see how good it is.</li>
            <li> I see hair growing back in where it had broken off from wearing braids.  I rub it in every night around hairline and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed this product.  It makes my hair easy to manage.  Great product; I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Ok...so I am from African decent, I lost my hairline to braids, had it bald and decided to grow it back with the help of braids. After the second time of wearing braids, I decided &amp;#34;no more&amp;#34;, my hairline was going. I decided to corn-row and wear a wig, my hairdresser who does the corn-row saw the damage to my hairline and told me to try the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its now 1 1/2 months, my hairline is almost fully back. Like one reviewer said (which I read before purchasing), you have to be consistent and patient, its not a &amp;#34;miracle grow&amp;#34;, its not &amp;#34;you didn&#x27;t see me, now you do&amp;#34;. its a process, each time I pulled out my hair, I noticed the improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied  with my order and shipment.I only wished the product came in a bigger size</li>
            <li> I like that the grease made my hair shiny and soft - I just don&#x27;t think it improve the overall condition.</li>
            <li> Good product and I am really seeing results...I have actually two and I am almost done with the first one.</li>
            <li> Definitely works! Came in mint condition</li>
            <li> Although I have used my regular hair care products that have proven to be quite beneficial with achieving hair growth, my edges have always been thinner than the rest of my hair.  I started using Nairobi Recovery consistently only on my edges, and my edges have truly filled in.  The biggest contributing factor for the thinning of my edges was the use of relaxers.  I stopped getting relaxers, continued using my regular hair care products on my hair, and incorporated Nairobi Recovery into my regimen by lightly applying it only to my edges on a daily basis, and I can honestly say that my edges are much fuller and has nearly caught up with the rest of my hair with regards to thickness, and I have very thick hair.  I know that petrolatum is one of the \\&quot;no no\\&quot; ingredients that is listed in this product, but so does BB Super Gro Maximum strength, which I use on the rest of my hair, and my hair and edges have responded well to both products.  I do, however, shampoo/co-wash on a regular basis, so I guess there is not enough time for my pores to clog.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is struggling with thinning edges.  I would assume that it would be good for thinning hair if anyone has that problem because the edges are the easiest to damage but the most difficult to grow back; if it works well on the edges, then I&#x27;m sure it will work well on the rest of the hair.</li>
