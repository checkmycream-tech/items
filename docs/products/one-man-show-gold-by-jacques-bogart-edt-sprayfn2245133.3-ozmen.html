            <li>sillage and longevity are quite remarkable, good from 7AM til</li>
            <li>I would have given it a 5-star if I loved the smell 100%</li>
            <li>yes there is a good kind).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it, he loves it!</li>
            <li>This is one of the most sensual fragrances on this earth!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>I thought this one was equally as good or even better</li>
            <li>I love one man show, this one is good, but I dont feel like I am going to buy it again</li>
            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Superior to the original One Man Show,</li>
            <li>This is a very strong fragrance - probably the strongest and most pungent that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It could easily be marketed as ONE WOMAN SHOW for sure!</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for sure, it is really strong and for its price it is a plus!</li>
            <li>GREAT ITEM, THANKS......</li>
            <li>glad to have bought it</li>
            <li>If you like One Million by Paco Rabanne, you&#x27;re going to LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments</li>
            <li>niceee..really strong opening..but</li>
            <li>so go lightly.  </li>
            <li>It is so rich, spicy and unique, you&#x27;ll receive compliment after compliment.  </li>
            <li>so much I had to get him two more set of this colone</li>
            <li>Not bad but not something I would wear often.  </li>
            <li>not a bad product, but wears off within 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>Made a mistake on purchasing this one - smell is too strong and can&#x27;t seem to figure out what it is exactly.  </li>
            <li>love this one has a bit more stronger aroma than the regular!</li>
            <li>Love the smell, better than regular</li>
            <li>that of a super buff porn star i.e. Lee Stone for example.</li>
            <li>Very bold, woody scent.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts pretty much all day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest this cologne, even if it wasn&#x27;t so price friendly.</li>
            <li>This cologne is only mildly offensive sickly sweet odor in the first hour, however it evolves into a musky skanky scent of dry woods and sweaty pubes (the good kind</li>
            <li>but IMO being that I like fresh musky scents.</li>
            <li>The original One Man Show is also nice, but smells nothing like this (original has notes of tobacco and green grass).</li>
            <li>/&gt;6 - For superior performance I suggest eating right, sleeping adequately, and working out hard as attaining a buff body helps improve the image that resonates with this scent...</li>
            <li>I thought ONE MAN SHOW was outstanding enough until I smelled ONE MAN SHOW GOLD!  </li>
            <li>This  is the first time I am using this product.</li>
            <li>I better like the regular one.</li>
            <li>Possibly the most obnoxious overbearing cologne I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I love to wear this cologne at the office for its offensive odor, as three sprays are enough to asphyxiate anyone within a 4 feet radius.&lt;br</li>
            <li>also, quite different from most new colognes/smells, so I suggest trying it in a store first.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t PAY too much though</li>
            <li>Very strong and long lasting</li>
            <li>But some people on fragrance forums really like it, and the price is very low, so it might be worth a shot for you.</li>
            <li>Its longevity is monstrous and spillage is decent as well.</li>
            <li>but it is more of a fall/winter scent being a bit too heavy for summer in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>WOW,  It WILL blow you away, and him too!  </li>
            <li>This is my offensive and intimidating cologne for when I have to use everything to my advantage to get my way in any meeting as fast as possible just to appease me because the clients, co-workers, and upper management start gasping for fresh air whenever they are in my circle of toxic fumes known as One Man Show Gold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cologne might stain certain clothing, especially if the clothing is made of inferior quality i.e. pierre cardin dress shirts.  </li>
            <li>My under shirts still retain the scent of this cologne after after multiple washings, so perhaps it might be imperative to designate a certain undershirt to when wearing this cologne as it can be used to layer the scents</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to my friend and of all a very prompt delivery</li>
            <li>The problem is it smelled to me like the &amp;#34;air freshener&amp;#34; you&#x27;d smell in an old gas station bathroom or porta-john.  </li>
            <li>Might as well be Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Not everyday.</li>
            <li>Powerful and slightly spicy!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Powerful and slightly spicy! Perfect for winter!</li>
            <li> Its a gift from my wife and it&#x27;s very attractive and draws lots of compliment. I would definitely recommend this to my friend and of all a very prompt delivery</li>
            <li> This is a very strong fragrance - probably the strongest and most pungent that I&#x27;ve tried.  The problem is it smelled to me like the &amp;#34;air freshener&amp;#34; you&#x27;d smell in an old gas station bathroom or porta-john.  Was not a fan at all.  But some people on fragrance forums really like it, and the price is very low, so it might be worth a shot for you.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Item received as described!</li>
            <li> I used the other product under the same One Man Show  brand name. I thought this one was equally as good or even better but it turned out rather disappointing. The scent is a big turn off.I sought the opinio of a friend and his verdict was devastating. He pointedly told me this cologne smelled like bug spray.</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEM, THANKS......glad to have bought it, it is perfect , recommend to everyone as a great product. very nice</li>
            <li> This cologne is unreal!  It smells unlike anything else!  I love it, he loves it! Everybody loves this!  It could easily be marketed as ONE WOMAN SHOW for sure! This is one of the most sensual fragrances on this earth!  I thought ONE MAN SHOW was outstanding enough until I smelled ONE MAN SHOW GOLD!  WOW,  It WILL blow you away, and him too!  Don&#x27;t PAY too much though, it doesn&#x27;t last long unless you put a ton of it on!  But man it is wickedly unbelievably awesome!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like it but it is more of a fall/winter scent being a bit too heavy for summer in my opinion.  Very strong and long lasting so go lightly.  Not sure how to describe it other than Spicy.</li>
            <li> This  is the first time I am using this product. I better like the regular one. Next time I will try the silver one.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not something I would wear often.  Smells like a barber shop, reminds me of grandpa.  Might as well be Old Spice.</li>
            <li> have worn one man show since college which has been 30 years. love this one has a bit more stronger aroma than the regular!</li>
            <li> Made a mistake on purchasing this one - smell is too strong and can&#x27;t seem to figure out what it is exactly.  Will not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> not a bad product, but wears off within 3-4 hours. also, quite different from most new colognes/smells, so I suggest trying it in a store first. Amazon does have a great price for it though!</li>
            <li> If you like One Million by Paco Rabanne, you&#x27;re going to LOVE One Man Show Gold Edition!  It is so rich, spicy and unique, you&#x27;ll receive compliment after compliment.  It lasts a lot longer than One Million also.  If you want to stand out from the crown, get this.  I give it 5 stars.  The original One Man Show is also nice, but smells nothing like this (original has notes of tobacco and green grass).</li>
            <li> Long time user.  This is by far the best. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments</li>
            <li> Woah! This fragrance is explosive. Its longevity is monstrous and spillage is decent as well. I would have given it a 5-star if I loved the smell 100% but while I appreciate it for its price and strength I am not so crazy about the scent. It may be a personal thing but IMO being that I like fresh musky scents. It is a cologne I would wear once in a week maybe? Not everyday. Also if you job involves manual labor or you sweat a lot or something then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for sure, it is really strong and for its price it is a plus!</li>
            <li> Very bold, woody scent.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts pretty much all day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest this cologne, even if it wasn&#x27;t so price friendly. I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> niceee..really strong opening..but long lasting..soothing dry down..I don&#x27;t use it too often though..save it for when am putting on a suit</li>
            <li> Love the smell, better than regular</li>
            <li> Possibly the most obnoxious overbearing cologne I have ever tried.  Superior to the original One Man Show, this musky skanky scent reminds me of 70&#x27;s style porn star with hairy chests and thick overbearing facial hair, i.e. Ron Jeremy.  I love to wear this cologne at the office for its offensive odor, as three sprays are enough to asphyxiate anyone within a 4 feet radius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sillage and longevity are quite remarkable, good from 7AM til 11PM.&lt;br /&gt;Couple of afterthoughts though -&lt;br /&gt;1- This cologne is concentrated and will irritate the skin even through clothing.  I would not apply directly on the skin, and spray on the shirts recommending at least a two shirt barrier to protect the chest and arms from any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;2- This cologne might stain certain clothing, especially if the clothing is made of inferior quality i.e. pierre cardin dress shirts.  Geoffrey Beene Sateens and Van Heusens show no signs of discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;3 - My under shirts still retain the scent of this cologne after after multiple washings, so perhaps it might be imperative to designate a certain undershirt to when wearing this cologne as it can be used to layer the scents&lt;br /&gt;4- This cologne is only mildly offensive sickly sweet odor in the first hour, however it evolves into a musky skanky scent of dry woods and sweaty pubes (the good kind yes there is a good kind).&lt;br /&gt;5- This is my Weapon of Mass Destruction cologne.  I wear this cologne when I have a meeting with clients or upper management.  This is my offensive and intimidating cologne for when I have to use everything to my advantage to get my way in any meeting as fast as possible just to appease me because the clients, co-workers, and upper management start gasping for fresh air whenever they are in my circle of toxic fumes known as One Man Show Gold.&lt;br /&gt;6 - For superior performance I suggest eating right, sleeping adequately, and working out hard as attaining a buff body helps improve the image that resonates with this scent... that of a super buff porn star i.e. Lee Stone for example.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my dad he loves it so much I had to get him two more set of this colone</li>
            <li> I love one man show, this one is good, but I dont feel like I am going to buy it again</li>
