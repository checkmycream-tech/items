            <li>Perfect for traveling</li>
            <li>and this is the best i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Great travel kit!</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks great.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I liked the hairspray as well.</li>
            <li>I know the product is brilliant because I use it all the time, I just wish they had been a tad larger to make it good for a vacation not just overnight travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update if anything changes as I continue to try it out for a couple more</li>
            <li>It was the best detangling set I&#x27;ve ever had, but the cleanliness just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Bought the sample set somewhere in town and got so many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>The products were just okay.  </li>
            <li>However, I do love the hairspray.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would be able to use it for more than a weekend getaway.</li>
            <li>Squeeze bottles would have worked better</li>
            <li>Love this product line.</li>
            <li>My hair is really easy to brush out afterwards.</li>
            <li>The oil is nice, but I use pure argan oil to oil my ends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to move to a sulphate/paraben free shampoo</li>
            <li>though, even though it doesn&#x27;t lather like you might be used to, it really does cleanse the scalp and hair nicely.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for products that were fragrance free</li>
            <li>The shampoo seems to leave my hair squeaky clean and</li>
            <li>Each product made me want to buy the full size.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice fragrance and seemed to do a good job on my thick wavy, somewhat frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>The moment I switched back to the Redkin Allsoft my hair looked stunning again - glossy, clean, and with lots of body.</li>
            <li>I love this products, have them for my hair and finally bought for travel</li>
            <li>this wasn&#x27;t enough for more than one wash.</li>
            <li>Love the product but this came open and spilling all over inside of box.</li>
            <li>been using Redkin Allsoft which I actually really like).</li>
            <li>I do really like the shampoo</li>
            <li>No matter how much a rinsed (hot/cold water)</li>
            <li>my hair was really greasy</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to use more shampoo than I did with conventional shampoo, but my hair is softer, not tangly, and with the oil treatment it is not frizzy at all.  </li>
            <li>so 11.99 plus shiping wasn&#x27;t worth what you actually got</li>
            <li>but  not with this brand as it seems to penetrate very readily even if I only leave it in for 2-3 minutes).</li>
            <li>I have the large size of these products, and it&#x27;s not the same shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>People told me how shiny it was and soft looking.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels very soft and smooth, but somewhat dull and greasy.</li>
            <li>Texture of the shampoo/conditioner is somewhat unusual if you are used to standard off-the-shelf products, but no big deal.  </li>
            <li>Nice little package but very small.</li>
            <li>Dermorganic really help my hair be tamable and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t help the little but of acne I get on my neck and around my hairline.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s practically straight with just a little wave.</li>

            <li> This product has a nice fragrance and seemed to do a good job on my thick wavy, somewhat frizzy hair.  I liked the hairspray as well.</li>
            <li> I love this products, have them for my hair and finally bought for travel</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price. The sizes are tiny and the oil is labeled &amp;#34;not for resale&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to move to a sulphate/paraben free shampoo so I go this travel kit to try this brand before buying(I&#x27;ve been using Redkin Allsoft which I actually really like). The shampoo seems to leave my hair squeaky clean and the conditioner detangles well. My hair is really easy to brush out afterwards. However, it seems the conditioner is hard to rinse out because for the past two weeks I&#x27;ve used it my hair has felt a little stringy and greasy. The oil is nice, but I use pure argan oil to oil my ends. My hair feels very soft and smooth, but somewhat dull and greasy. I&#x27;m going to continue to try it and see if I&#x27;m using too much conditioner (I usually need a lot of conditioner to get it into my thick, long hair but  not with this brand as it seems to penetrate very readily even if I only leave it in for 2-3 minutes). It&#x27;s a little hard to get out of the bottles and the product is very thick just FYI. I do really like the shampoo though, even though it doesn&#x27;t lather like you might be used to, it really does cleanse the scalp and hair nicely. I&#x27;ll update if anything changes as I continue to try it out for a couple more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, waist length dark hair. I&#x27;m mixed Spanish and Filipino so it&#x27;s practically straight with just a little wave. I wash my hair every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT/UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued to try and shampoo and conditioner and it just wasn&#x27;t for me. No matter how much a rinsed (hot/cold water) my hair was really greasy and I had to wash every day or it looked limp and unclean the next day. It was the best detangling set I&#x27;ve ever had, but the cleanliness just didn&#x27;t last. It certainly didn&#x27;t help the little but of acne I get on my neck and around my hairline. The moment I switched back to the Redkin Allsoft my hair looked stunning again - glossy, clean, and with lots of body. Guess I&#x27;m stuck with the sulphates.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Bought the sample set somewhere in town and got so many compliments on my hair.  People told me how shiny it was and soft looking.  That is something that curly haired people don&#x27;t hear as often, because shine isn&#x27;t as noticeable.  I was sold!  Here on Amazon to buy bigger sizes and figured I&#x27;d share my review.  Texture of the shampoo/conditioner is somewhat unusual if you are used to standard off-the-shelf products, but no big deal.  This is a great line!</li>
            <li> My hair colorist raved about this shampoo and uses it in her salon. She was out so I bought this here on amazon as well as th enlarge bottles. The shampoo makes my hair feel like straw, the conditioner partially restores normalcy. I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> The sample bottles are very small.  The shampoo was almost solid.  The products were just okay.  However, I do love the hairspray.</li>
            <li> not worth the price this wasn&#x27;t enough for more than one wash. so 11.99 plus shiping wasn&#x27;t worth what you actually got</li>
            <li> Dermorganic really help my hair be tamable and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling</li>
            <li> Nice little package but very small. I don&#x27;t think I would be able to use it for more than a weekend getaway. I&#x27;d be hard pressed to make it last a week. I know the product is brilliant because I use it all the time, I just wish they had been a tad larger to make it good for a vacation not just overnight travel.</li>

            <li> bottles are far too small and difficult to get any product at all out of them. Squeeze bottles would have worked better</li>
            <li> Great travel kit! Each product made me want to buy the full size.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to use more shampoo than I did with conventional shampoo, but my hair is softer, not tangly, and with the oil treatment it is not frizzy at all.  I&#x27;m upgrading to the big bottle!  My thick mane of &amp;#34;silver highlighted&amp;#34; hair used to be oily at the scalp and dry at the ends within 24 hours of washing.  Now it&#x27;s less oily at the scalp and soft all the way through.</li>
            <li> Love this product line.</li>
