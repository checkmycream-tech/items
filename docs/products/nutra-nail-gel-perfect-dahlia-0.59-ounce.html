            <li>but im going to try my own polish and see how that works!</li>
            <li>Lined up the products and went to work working at my own pace ,and they look beautiful .</li>
            <li>sure why they havent placed in the direction to finish with a coat of activator but thats what gives you the nice flawless look-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also I will spend the money on good quality nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions for applying nail gel and was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>, zero is more like it!</li>
            <li>Product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Plus, by using your own nail polish, your nails will not smell like pickle juice.  </li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for over 30 years</li>
            <li>I remember seeing their own brand of remover at the time, should have bought it then.</li>
            <li>Product is combustible so returning is not an optiin unlesss you are licensed to ship hazardous materials in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can so I guess thats why I am loving my nails...</li>
            <li>Good thing I bought cheap!</li>
            <li>Got this today and did it, easy application looks really nice and for 10 bucks!</li>
            <li>And the color is absolutely gorgeous and looks great when first applied.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>Cracks very easily.</li>
            <li>Love amazon and wanted to help the community by posting an honest appraisal of this product which does NOT work.</li>
            <li>wow, I can do gel nails at home, great!</li>
            <li>This product works great if you have patience and follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>and go on :)</li>
            <li>Love the color and the shine though.</li>
            <li>I used a darker color, maybe the lighter ones cover better with just the 2 coats.   </li>
            <li>Finish with a top coat and enjoy your nails!  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Of polish all layered on top of eachother.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t even 24 hours and most of my nails are chipping.  </li>
            <li>The removal takes more time than the application time by</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a fantastic solution to a mani!  </li>
            <li>product is better than the uv nail polish at the salon to me had it done before and</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I went a couple more days</li>
            <li>I had much better results.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Nutra Nail Gel Perfect and had my manicurist apply it according the instructions, one day prior to leaving for vacation.</li>
            <li>Better than ruining your nails trying to scrape it off.  </li>
            <li>I have switched to the Sensationail product and love it.</li>
            <li>I seen this on TV and it looked interesting.</li>
            <li>and I find myself with my nail polish constantly touching up my nails</li>
            <li>This product takes some practice, but done right, it&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
            <li>I had nice long nails that many people have thought were fakes because I take good care of them.</li>
            <li>Be sure to clean the brush between hands and coats or it will get stringy and globby.  </li>
            <li>but it came off easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not being one to give up so easily...</li>
            <li>I made sure I started with clean nails..</li>
            <li>Plus the smell of the activator was so strong it made my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>is Super Super Glue!!</li>
            <li>Glad I did not pay full price for it.</li>
            <li>so things went along just fine .</li>
            <li>It comes with directions that tell you to focus on one hand at a time which if fine with me.</li>
            <li>Just imagine mixing nail polish with super glue!</li>
            <li>Nails did not have that smooth gel look to them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow all the directions per Nutra Nail but just finish each nail with the activator being your \\&quot;last\\&quot; or \\&quot;top\\&quot; coat, believe me after playing around with this product a few times, this $10 kit makes $20 every two weeks great!</li>
            <li>Followed all the steps precisely.</li>
            <li>Was impressed with how quickly it dried.</li>
            <li>Didnt even make it through a trip to the grocery store......not impressed and wont waste my money again</li>
            <li>tried this out and was very impressed with the quickness it dried and the color.</li>
            <li>The color didn&#x27;t look smooth on the activator.</li>
            <li>It looked cheap.</li>
            <li>I am sticking to good old \\&quot;normal\\&quot; polish from here on out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>i do agree that the activator is super glue, however, it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m pretty sure the Activator Coat that comes in this package (and has to be applied 4-5 times)</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it out  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A lot of times I do my manicure by myself, so when I saw the product I got excited -</li>
            <li>Literally perfect nails, high shine &amp; long wearing results.</li>
            <li>Looked great upon application and was dry immediately.</li>
            <li>As the instructions say, your nails have to be completely clean.</li>
            <li>Also, you have to purchase special remover to get it off of your nails.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li>have sent mine in to have a full refund.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that not everything the product promises is true...</li>
            <li>I am a true believer</li>
            <li>First off, the smell is so strong I still have a headache 30 minutes after airing out my house</li>
            <li>3 coats of super glue and 2 coats</li>
            <li>I then realized it was super glue after I had applied it to my nails.  </li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s super glue.</li>
            <li>I thought the shiny look and one that drys quickly so that there are no impressions from sheets while sleeping</li>
            <li>It sticked like a super glue.</li>
            <li>However, it started chipping the very first day.  </li>
            <li>I will admit it was fun putting this polish on--</li>
            <li>Those may take a good 30-45 minutes to complete, but the process it easy, they last a full 10 days AND are ready to wear.</li>
            <li>I opened the activator bottle and the smell was intense, but familiar.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to attempt to do this with the special nail polish remover I bought at the same time which I\\&quot;m sure will work as well as the polish.</li>
            <li>i paint my nails right before I go to bed.i wake up &amp; 2 nails are chipped(wtf)</li>
            <li>Mine was 100% positive!</li>
            <li>Ok first off- dont expect a professional job if YOU cannot polish well...</li>
            <li>I finally found a ladies Blog whom experienced &amp; lived this same nightmare.</li>
            <li>I watched the application video and followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>e-mailed Nutra Nail and they are willing to refund my money, given I send them the receipt &amp; UPC from the box.</li>
            <li>When all 5 nails are done then go back and apply a generous amount of activator over the top.</li>
            <li>Followed the directions exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>To the extent I almost had to abandon ship after the first application of activator on the first two nails--and a catch 22 to try and have a \\&quot;well ventilated\\&quot; space, bc</li>
            <li>4 hours later, chipping more as if I have had it on for a week already.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t feel it was worth one star</li>
            <li>I love the look of polished nails, but dont have the time to do them regularly enough to avoid the chipped look.  </li>
            <li>It was really simple to use, although took me longer than 5 minutes to apply to be sure I didn&#x27;t get it all over my fingers, but thats just my unsteady hand.  </li>
            <li>I made sure I went slowly, especially with the color, and followed all the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>This time it looks much better and over 24 hrs later ...</li>
            <li>this time I&#x27;m going to do only 2 nails at a time in order to get a better look.</li>
            <li>At first I was like &amp;#34;Yayyyy</li>
            <li>First you need to put the activator on all five nails.</li>
            <li>I followed the steps exactly as it said in the directions on one hand.</li>
            <li>The activator reacted exactly like the Krazy Glue.</li>
            <li>I was like REALLY!</li>
            <li>You must purchase their special remover, and as long as you follow those directions, the polish does come off easily and</li>
            <li>much easier and better results if you do one hand completely first and then do second hand.  </li>
            <li>Was super excited about this &amp;#34;all encompassing kit&amp;#34; with no LED lights necessary.</li>
            <li>I applied the activator to my thumb and pointer, then did the gel color, then went on to my middle, ring, and pinky fingers to be sure the activator didn&#x27;t dry before I was able to put the color gel on.  </li>
            <li>Fix is easy but who has time to fix nail chips constantly.</li>
            <li>Paid a lot more than I normally would but figured if I spend $35 in the nail salon every 2 weeks to get the gel polish, then I would be saving money if this did the same thing as it says.</li>
            <li>When I open the Activator I could smell the strong product.</li>
            <li>I believe someone said it&#x27;s pure acetone.  </li>
            <li>Really get into the cuticle area, and make sure you let them dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very busy wife and mother of 3 kids, and have housework, dogs, driving, and just life to keep my manicures from lasting more than a day or so.</li>
            <li>REgular nail polish with a regular topcoat works and looks so much better!  </li>
            <li>I was very meticulous in the application and super careful and it worked fabulously.  </li>
            <li>Again happy with the color and how it dried, but by the next morning... CHIPPING AGAIN.</li>
            <li>DO 3 COATS, unless 2 really looks sufficient to you.</li>
            <li>The polish glides on much smoother.  </li>
            <li>the top for the brush cleaner was loose,the bottle was completely empty.</li>
            <li>and it is very pungent</li>
            <li>, my eyes were watering the whole time I was using it.  </li>
            <li>, if you are going to take the time &amp; money to purchase this product, absolutely invest in their remover.</li>
            <li>After 2 days of scrubbing and a whole bottle of 100% acetone, not one speck came off.</li>
            <li>Expected more for the price that quoted</li>
            <li>feeling like you&#x27;re really getting a formal manicure.</li>
            <li>That is 1/2 the price of this despicable product and so, so, so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>but then what product really delivers on all its promises?</li>
            <li>this is like real gel nails&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>By this point my finger tips ached so much.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to remove the nail polish from one nail and repainting it than any step from this product.</li>
            <li>Really Don&#x27;t Get This Product.</li>
            <li>My regular polish stays on throughout the week on the same kind of vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regular nail color with a decent top coat outperforms this and is far cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I quickly realized this was a waste of time, and I abandoned the whole exercise after the first hand--I quickly grabbed for my acetone.</li>
            <li>I figured it was because I did not wear gloves when cleaning the bathroom and would retry the next day, after I had a chance to pick up the special nail polish remover I needed to get it off.</li>
            <li>It is NOT long lasting--my polish chipped the very next day even when I was not doing any \\&quot;labor\\&quot; with my hands--about the most strenuous thing I did</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s keep this short and sweet.</li>
            <li>As a total novice I was able to apply this, following the directions exactly, and ended with nails that truly looked professionally done!  </li>
            <li>I was even able to clean up the mess it left on my cuticles.</li>
            <li>It lasted less time than most $2 nail polish at the drugstore!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>First, the bottles are so small, that I can&#x27;t imagine you can get more than 3 applications done.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I already had one of those press-on nails soaking things (you can find them next to the press on nails in any drugstore) and that worked like a charm!</li>
            <li>I work in the local hospital and regular polish never lasts more than one day.  </li>
            <li>With all the testing they do on products before selling, this company knew this product would not live up to it&#x27;s description, they absolutely knew it!!!</li>
            <li>it really is that quick to dry .</li>
            <li>HONESTLY, THE PRODUCT SUCKS....</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;ll have to wait months for my nails to regrow and be normal again.</li>
            <li>I tried my normal polish remover--</li>
            <li>All this is is super glue and regular old nail polish.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use regular nail polish and wait a longer time for it to dry and have to paint them more often than use this produce ever again.</li>
            <li>I bought this at a major retailer starting with W, and I&#x27;m glad I did because they take stuff back even if you&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>But I guess live and learn.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, the activator is more or less super glue with a brush</li>
            <li>Of course, it is made of a special formula, so it was torture trying to remove the rest of the polish in the center of my nails.  </li>
            <li>When first applying this product it felt like it was going to last, however, by the end of the day, the tips of my nails were chipping.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>First, I had chipped nail polish the next day after applying.</li>
            <li>It is also somewhat difficult to apply as you have to be quick and careful; the good news is that this chips incredibly fast and needs to be redone almost immediately so you will get lots of practice perfecting your quick and careful technique.</li>
            <li>After spending time in the ocean and pool, less than four days later it was coming off in many places.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this whole system is totally not worth it, so highly suggest sticking to regular manicures or my personal favorite, Gelish UV gel nails.</li>
            <li>I would not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li>wish I had not wasted my money on this trash.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised that I COULD DO THEM .</li>
            <li>the key is you really have to follow the directions with this product or it won&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to bring this to my professional nail artist and ask her to use on my nails</li>
            <li>I felt really accomplished after I finished the entire process</li>
            <li>Now they are damaged and I have to wait for them to completely grow out the damaged</li>
            <li>By mid-day Tuesday the polish was chipped near the cuticles...</li>
            <li>I have always done my own manicures, including UV gel manicures as of late (Gelish), and can properly read/follow directions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Sally Hansens&#x27; Quick Dry.</li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the instructions for cleaning the brush between nails, but instead of relying on the tiny bottle provided, just put a small amount of the 100% acetone in a glass cup or bowl, and swish the brushes around.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the first time I used it it went on well, but it did chip the next day (only one nail chipped).</li>
            <li>your nail in 2 squares of acetone saturated toilet paper &amp; tightly wrap foil around the toilet papered finger for 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;However, make sure to remove one foiled finger at a time, as you will need to quickly use something to scrape off the residue while still wet.</li>
            <li>Normal polish lasts about a week for me and gel manicures last 10-14 days.  </li>
            <li>If they mean one day sure, because it was chipping 1 day later.</li>
            <li>They were very dull in color and when trying to add a top coat they became sticky and did not dry.</li>
            <li>I expected this to replace real gel manicures.</li>
            <li>If done properly no chipping and looks shiny and professional.  </li>
            <li>(and I NEVER have a problem with the smell of regular nail polish or remover), second, the \\&quot;activator\\&quot; is technically brush on super glue that you mix with any regular polish (it even tells you to not let it dry before the color is added-</li>
            <li>By the first evening, half the polish was chipped off.  </li>
            <li>- like just do 2 coats one over the other straight away) coat of the polish.</li>
            <li>The activator was also super runny and was near impossible to control how much you were putting on as you had to do it so quickly (and to try to not get it on the cuticles was also a rough haul).</li>
            <li>The entire idea of it is that it&#x27;s supposed to last longer than normal nail polish, and it chipped the next morning after I did it, and then kept chipping as 2 days went by -- a total pain in the butt.  </li>
            <li>the first time i applied it, i didnt like it because i felt rushed following the directions, and they were a mess.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever written a review, but felt I needed to warn people not to waste their money on this product.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend it if you have thin nails that bend easily.</li>
            <li>Use the activator on only 5 nails (or fewer) at a time, then wait a minute (no more), so it&#x27;s a little more tacky.</li>
            <li>If you want REGULAR nail polish--easy to remove but long lasting and gorgeous--try  Sally Hansen&#x27;s Complete Salon Manicure line.</li>
            <li>The darker color seemed to work a little better than the pale pink</li>

            <li> I remember seeing their own brand of remover at the time, should have bought it then.</li>
            <li> Product is combustible so returning is not an optiin unlesss you are licensed to ship hazardous materials in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can so I guess thats why I am loving my nails...</li>
            <li> Good thing I bought cheap!</li>
            <li> Got this today and did it, easy application looks really nice and for 10 bucks!</li>
            <li> And the color is absolutely gorgeous and looks great when first applied.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> Cracks very easily.</li>
            <li> Love amazon and wanted to help the community by posting an honest appraisal of this product which does NOT work.</li>
            <li> wow, I can do gel nails at home, great!</li>
            <li> This product works great if you have patience and follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> and go on :)</li>
            <li> Love the color and the shine though.</li>
            <li> I used a darker color, maybe the lighter ones cover better with just the 2 coats.   </li>
            <li> Finish with a top coat and enjoy your nails!  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Of polish all layered on top of eachother.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t even 24 hours and most of my nails are chipping.  </li>
            <li> The removal takes more time than the application time by</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a fantastic solution to a mani!  </li>
            <li> product is better than the uv nail polish at the salon to me had it done before and</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I went a couple more days</li>
            <li> I had much better results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Nutra Nail Gel Perfect and had my manicurist apply it according the instructions, one day prior to leaving for vacation.</li>
            <li> Better than ruining your nails trying to scrape it off.  </li>
            <li> I have switched to the Sensationail product and love it.</li>
            <li> I seen this on TV and it looked interesting.</li>
            <li> and I find myself with my nail polish constantly touching up my nails</li>
            <li> This product takes some practice, but done right, it&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
            <li> I had nice long nails that many people have thought were fakes because I take good care of them.</li>
            <li> Be sure to clean the brush between hands and coats or it will get stringy and globby.  </li>
            <li> but it came off easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not being one to give up so easily...</li>
            <li> I made sure I started with clean nails..</li>
            <li> Plus the smell of the activator was so strong it made my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is Super Super Glue!!</li>
            <li> Glad I did not pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> so things went along just fine .</li>
            <li> It comes with directions that tell you to focus on one hand at a time which if fine with me.</li>
            <li> Just imagine mixing nail polish with super glue!</li>
            <li> Nails did not have that smooth gel look to them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow all the directions per Nutra Nail but just finish each nail with the activator being your \\&quot;last\\&quot; or \\&quot;top\\&quot; coat, believe me after playing around with this product a few times, this $10 kit makes $20 every two weeks great!</li>
            <li> Followed all the steps precisely.</li>
            <li> Was impressed with how quickly it dried.</li>
            <li> Didnt even make it through a trip to the grocery store......not impressed and wont waste my money again</li>
            <li> tried this out and was very impressed with the quickness it dried and the color.</li>
            <li> The color didn&#x27;t look smooth on the activator.</li>
            <li> It looked cheap.</li>
            <li> I am sticking to good old \\&quot;normal\\&quot; polish from here on out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> i do agree that the activator is super glue, however, it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m pretty sure the Activator Coat that comes in this package (and has to be applied 4-5 times)</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it out  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lot of times I do my manicure by myself, so when I saw the product I got excited -</li>
            <li> Literally perfect nails, high shine &amp; long wearing results.</li>
            <li> Looked great upon application and was dry immediately.</li>
            <li> As the instructions say, your nails have to be completely clean.</li>
            <li> Also, you have to purchase special remover to get it off of your nails.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> have sent mine in to have a full refund.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that not everything the product promises is true...</li>
            <li> I am a true believer</li>
            <li> First off, the smell is so strong I still have a headache 30 minutes after airing out my house</li>
            <li> 3 coats of super glue and 2 coats</li>
            <li> I then realized it was super glue after I had applied it to my nails.  </li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s super glue.</li>
            <li> I thought the shiny look and one that drys quickly so that there are no impressions from sheets while sleeping</li>
            <li> It sticked like a super glue.</li>
            <li> However, it started chipping the very first day.  </li>
            <li> I will admit it was fun putting this polish on--</li>
            <li> Those may take a good 30-45 minutes to complete, but the process it easy, they last a full 10 days AND are ready to wear.</li>
            <li> I opened the activator bottle and the smell was intense, but familiar.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to attempt to do this with the special nail polish remover I bought at the same time which I\\&quot;m sure will work as well as the polish.</li>
            <li> i paint my nails right before I go to bed.i wake up &amp; 2 nails are chipped(wtf)</li>
            <li> Mine was 100% positive!</li>
            <li> Ok first off- dont expect a professional job if YOU cannot polish well...</li>
            <li> I finally found a ladies Blog whom experienced &amp; lived this same nightmare.</li>
            <li> I watched the application video and followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li> e-mailed Nutra Nail and they are willing to refund my money, given I send them the receipt &amp; UPC from the box.</li>
            <li> When all 5 nails are done then go back and apply a generous amount of activator over the top.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li> To the extent I almost had to abandon ship after the first application of activator on the first two nails--and a catch 22 to try and have a \\&quot;well ventilated\\&quot; space, bc</li>
            <li> 4 hours later, chipping more as if I have had it on for a week already.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t feel it was worth one star</li>
            <li> I love the look of polished nails, but dont have the time to do them regularly enough to avoid the chipped look.  </li>
            <li> It was really simple to use, although took me longer than 5 minutes to apply to be sure I didn&#x27;t get it all over my fingers, but thats just my unsteady hand.  </li>
            <li> I made sure I went slowly, especially with the color, and followed all the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> This time it looks much better and over 24 hrs later ...</li>
            <li> this time I&#x27;m going to do only 2 nails at a time in order to get a better look.</li>
            <li> At first I was like &amp;#34;Yayyyy</li>
            <li> First you need to put the activator on all five nails.</li>
            <li> I followed the steps exactly as it said in the directions on one hand.</li>
            <li> The activator reacted exactly like the Krazy Glue.</li>
            <li> I was like REALLY!</li>
            <li> You must purchase their special remover, and as long as you follow those directions, the polish does come off easily and</li>
            <li> much easier and better results if you do one hand completely first and then do second hand.  </li>
            <li> Was super excited about this &amp;#34;all encompassing kit&amp;#34; with no LED lights necessary.</li>
            <li> I applied the activator to my thumb and pointer, then did the gel color, then went on to my middle, ring, and pinky fingers to be sure the activator didn&#x27;t dry before I was able to put the color gel on.  </li>
            <li> Fix is easy but who has time to fix nail chips constantly.</li>
            <li> Paid a lot more than I normally would but figured if I spend $35 in the nail salon every 2 weeks to get the gel polish, then I would be saving money if this did the same thing as it says.</li>
            <li> When I open the Activator I could smell the strong product.</li>
            <li> I believe someone said it&#x27;s pure acetone.  </li>
            <li> Really get into the cuticle area, and make sure you let them dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very busy wife and mother of 3 kids, and have housework, dogs, driving, and just life to keep my manicures from lasting more than a day or so.</li>
            <li> REgular nail polish with a regular topcoat works and looks so much better!  </li>
            <li> I was very meticulous in the application and super careful and it worked fabulously.  </li>
            <li> Again happy with the color and how it dried, but by the next morning... CHIPPING AGAIN.</li>
            <li> DO 3 COATS, unless 2 really looks sufficient to you.</li>
            <li> The polish glides on much smoother.  </li>
            <li> the top for the brush cleaner was loose,the bottle was completely empty.</li>
            <li> and it is very pungent</li>
            <li> , my eyes were watering the whole time I was using it.  </li>
            <li> , if you are going to take the time &amp; money to purchase this product, absolutely invest in their remover.</li>
            <li> After 2 days of scrubbing and a whole bottle of 100% acetone, not one speck came off.</li>
            <li> Expected more for the price that quoted</li>
            <li> feeling like you&#x27;re really getting a formal manicure.</li>
            <li> That is 1/2 the price of this despicable product and so, so, so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> but then what product really delivers on all its promises?</li>
            <li> this is like real gel nails&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> By this point my finger tips ached so much.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to remove the nail polish from one nail and repainting it than any step from this product.</li>
            <li> Really Don&#x27;t Get This Product.</li>
            <li> My regular polish stays on throughout the week on the same kind of vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regular nail color with a decent top coat outperforms this and is far cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I quickly realized this was a waste of time, and I abandoned the whole exercise after the first hand--I quickly grabbed for my acetone.</li>
            <li> I figured it was because I did not wear gloves when cleaning the bathroom and would retry the next day, after I had a chance to pick up the special nail polish remover I needed to get it off.</li>
            <li> It is NOT long lasting--my polish chipped the very next day even when I was not doing any \\&quot;labor\\&quot; with my hands--about the most strenuous thing I did</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s keep this short and sweet.</li>
            <li> As a total novice I was able to apply this, following the directions exactly, and ended with nails that truly looked professionally done!  </li>
            <li> I was even able to clean up the mess it left on my cuticles.</li>
            <li> It lasted less time than most $2 nail polish at the drugstore!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> First, the bottles are so small, that I can&#x27;t imagine you can get more than 3 applications done.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I already had one of those press-on nails soaking things (you can find them next to the press on nails in any drugstore) and that worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> I work in the local hospital and regular polish never lasts more than one day.  </li>
            <li> With all the testing they do on products before selling, this company knew this product would not live up to it&#x27;s description, they absolutely knew it!!!</li>
            <li> it really is that quick to dry .</li>
            <li> HONESTLY, THE PRODUCT SUCKS....</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;ll have to wait months for my nails to regrow and be normal again.</li>
            <li> I tried my normal polish remover--</li>
            <li> All this is is super glue and regular old nail polish.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use regular nail polish and wait a longer time for it to dry and have to paint them more often than use this produce ever again.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a major retailer starting with W, and I&#x27;m glad I did because they take stuff back even if you&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> But I guess live and learn.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, the activator is more or less super glue with a brush</li>
            <li> Of course, it is made of a special formula, so it was torture trying to remove the rest of the polish in the center of my nails.  </li>
            <li> When first applying this product it felt like it was going to last, however, by the end of the day, the tips of my nails were chipping.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> First, I had chipped nail polish the next day after applying.</li>
            <li> It is also somewhat difficult to apply as you have to be quick and careful; the good news is that this chips incredibly fast and needs to be redone almost immediately so you will get lots of practice perfecting your quick and careful technique.</li>
            <li> After spending time in the ocean and pool, less than four days later it was coming off in many places.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this whole system is totally not worth it, so highly suggest sticking to regular manicures or my personal favorite, Gelish UV gel nails.</li>
            <li> I would not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> wish I had not wasted my money on this trash.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised that I COULD DO THEM .</li>
            <li> the key is you really have to follow the directions with this product or it won&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to bring this to my professional nail artist and ask her to use on my nails</li>
            <li> I felt really accomplished after I finished the entire process</li>
            <li> Now they are damaged and I have to wait for them to completely grow out the damaged</li>
            <li> By mid-day Tuesday the polish was chipped near the cuticles...</li>
            <li> I have always done my own manicures, including UV gel manicures as of late (Gelish), and can properly read/follow directions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Sally Hansens&#x27; Quick Dry.</li>
            <li> Make sure to follow the instructions for cleaning the brush between nails, but instead of relying on the tiny bottle provided, just put a small amount of the 100% acetone in a glass cup or bowl, and swish the brushes around.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the first time I used it it went on well, but it did chip the next day (only one nail chipped).</li>
            <li> your nail in 2 squares of acetone saturated toilet paper &amp; tightly wrap foil around the toilet papered finger for 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;However, make sure to remove one foiled finger at a time, as you will need to quickly use something to scrape off the residue while still wet.</li>
            <li> Normal polish lasts about a week for me and gel manicures last 10-14 days.  </li>
            <li> If they mean one day sure, because it was chipping 1 day later.</li>
            <li> They were very dull in color and when trying to add a top coat they became sticky and did not dry.</li>
            <li> I expected this to replace real gel manicures.</li>
            <li> If done properly no chipping and looks shiny and professional.  </li>
            <li> (and I NEVER have a problem with the smell of regular nail polish or remover), second, the \\&quot;activator\\&quot; is technically brush on super glue that you mix with any regular polish (it even tells you to not let it dry before the color is added-</li>
            <li> By the first evening, half the polish was chipped off.  </li>
            <li> - like just do 2 coats one over the other straight away) coat of the polish.</li>
            <li> The activator was also super runny and was near impossible to control how much you were putting on as you had to do it so quickly (and to try to not get it on the cuticles was also a rough haul).</li>
            <li> The entire idea of it is that it&#x27;s supposed to last longer than normal nail polish, and it chipped the next morning after I did it, and then kept chipping as 2 days went by -- a total pain in the butt.  </li>
            <li> the first time i applied it, i didnt like it because i felt rushed following the directions, and they were a mess.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever written a review, but felt I needed to warn people not to waste their money on this product.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend it if you have thin nails that bend easily.</li>
            <li> Use the activator on only 5 nails (or fewer) at a time, then wait a minute (no more), so it&#x27;s a little more tacky.</li>
            <li> If you want REGULAR nail polish--easy to remove but long lasting and gorgeous--try  Sally Hansen&#x27;s Complete Salon Manicure line.</li>
            <li> The darker color seemed to work a little better than the pale pink</li>
            <li> Good luck getting this crap off, my nails are completely DESTROYED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly upset that I wasted 6 bucks on this..</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping for a long lasting polish.  </li>
            <li> and I spent much time tonight with heavily acetone soaked cotton balls and an orange stick, trying to rub off the gummy application bit by bit.</li>
            <li> Then quickly put a thin layer of the color.</li>
            <li> First the price is ridiculous ($11.99).</li>
            <li> Which leads me to believe that it is their own polish that smells bad.  </li>
            <li> I really thought this product would be the solution to my constant &amp;#34;nail polish chipping problems&amp;#34;, but it turns out it&#x27;s even worse than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> so I read all the reviews and was not surprised...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the first big hunk chipped off the next day, not even 24 hours later!  </li>
            <li> Nail Polish has never lasted too long on me</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and touched up the chips on the second day but by the next day over half the polish was gone.</li>
            <li> A few nails were still a little tacky after the 2 applications, but I brushed a thin coat of the activator on top and that solved it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never wanted to do regular manis due to time challenges.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t turn on a fan as it will prematurely dry.</li>
            <li> i used the lightest color because i like the natural tones, so im not sure if that helps.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is NOT worth the time, effort, and money.</li>
            <li> Lastly, my nails looked like just any other bad paint job that forgot to put the top coat on it.</li>
            <li> 6 hours later, half the paint from all nails have peeled</li>
            <li> When I moved quickly to the color gel, it seemed that every troubleshooting problem was there - not mixing, wrong proportions, stringy, you name it.</li>
            <li> Good idea, bad execution Nutra Nail!</li>
            <li> But it seems that the polish is very brittle, and if the nail beneath it is weak and bends, then the polish will crack and fall off.  </li>
            <li> I SPENT ALMOST AN HOUR DOING MY NAILS WITH THIS POLISH</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> If I could give it minus 10 stars I would.</li>
            <li> so they made it where you have to not only waste your money on one product, but their remover as well....</li>
            <li> five nails while still wet go over the nails with activator to seal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> People either loved it or hated</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t dwell on or make a huge deal over a disappointing product I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I polished my nails at 10 pm and by the next morning I already had a small chip in the corner of one nail.  </li>
            <li> key is to do no more than 5 nails at a time with the activator</li>
            <li> Such a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Less than 12 hours after application one nail was almost entirely chipped off and the others all had small nicks and cracks throughout.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I woke up did light housework and errands all day, looked down at dinner and 8 out of 10 fingernails were BADLY chipped.</li>
            <li> Inevitably, you will get some Activator Coat in or on your cuticle during at least 1 of the 5 times you&#x27;re instructed to apply it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> but they both chipped way to soon and the damage to my nails and cuticles just is not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> this product is a joke and is not worth a penny of anyone&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li> My regular polish holds for at least 3-4 days....</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This is a way to tricking you into buying something else and most gel polish removal kits are LABOR INTENSIVE, requiring stupid-looking foil-wrapped fingers that has to stay on for 15 worthless minutes.</li>
            <li> but I usually can go at least 4 days when they are done before they start to chip no matter if it was a professional job</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re impossible to remove unless you have special nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I would look down and find the fallen chips of polish on the floor, desk, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That was $11.59 down the drain.  </li>
            <li> :  Even though the directions say not to wait until the gel is dry to apply the nail color, you should wait until the gel is between tacky and dry (it is simply a form of liquid glue, think of it as putting on fake lashes) then apply the nail color.  </li>
            <li> Dark, almost like a purple tint to black.</li>
            <li> so, i had one completed hand, and as it dried i started the other hand.</li>
            <li> a thin but even coat of activator then, going back to first nail, apply a thick but even (instructions say thin but definitely needs to be thick</li>
            <li> HALF OF MY NAILS ARE CHIPPED ALREADY.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a chip on one of my fingernails less than 24 hours after I finished painting them with Nutra Nail and my nails continued to chip throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It lasted less than one night.  </li>
            <li> When I was done my finger tips felt odd.</li>
            <li> By the next morning most all of them were chipping and looked horrible.</li>
            <li> NOT worth the money!</li>
            <li> It took a little time of me sitting with cotton wrapped around each of my nails...</li>
            <li> Now I know Amazon has it for a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> (i have crappy nails, since i just removed acrylic), BUT i read the little pamphlet that came in the box, and it says to apply a thin layer of activator and color, and another layer of activator over the entire nail</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to apply neatly because of the process of painting color over wet gel.  </li>
            <li> This is a waste of money it chips</li>
            <li> the day after you apply it don&#x27;t waste your money .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> nails have been damaged since trying it because of the harsh nail polish remover and probably the nail polish too.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money .  </li>
            <li> It looked uneven and bumpy.</li>
            <li> Not sure which</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used $.99 nail polish in the past that lasted way longer than that.</li>
            <li> waste your money OR your time on this one!</li>
            <li> I have used Krazy Glue in the past and accidentally have gotten some on my fingers.</li>
            <li> The activator is Krazy Glue in a different bottle with a brush, with an expensive price tag.</li>
            <li> I have used it now for three applications and this last time was the absolute worst.</li>
            <li> Nutra Nail can keep my money and disregard the obvious fact that their product is HORRIBLE, but I personally believe this goes above and beyond false advertising.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write bad reviews</li>
            <li> Did Not go on smooth and don&#x27;t work, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Besides the reasonable price for what I thought I was going to get, everything after the purchase was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> but I would hardly call this a gel product.</li>
            <li> the today I did dishes and every one of my nails was dull and tacky.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard a scrubbed nothing came off, and my nail was still glued to my skin.</li>
            <li> At least I would have seen the enjoyment of someone finding it.</li>
            <li> Having spent $14 w/tax, was not happy! !</li>
            <li> The removal process sucks</li>
            <li> so, frustrated i waited until the next day to try.</li>
            <li> The product is extremely messy, difficult to use, and I would not recommend this to anyone at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, removing the even partial application was equally as tedious</li>
            <li> As the other reviews say, the polish that doesn&#x27;t chip off is nearly impossible to get off.  </li>
            <li> off.it hasn&#x27;t even been a whole 24 hours &amp; my nails look terrible.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> cause I&#x27;m tired of giving my money away when I can do it myself.</li>
            <li> this is the worse product that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure why people are having such awful experiences.  </li>
            <li> sorry to those who have a hard time and cant seem to get it to work, hopefully you can try again and take your time!</li>
            <li> NOT worth the money:(</li>
            <li> WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> Removing it is even worse!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I threw the receipt away like a dummy.</li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> Tthe worst part is now that I want to take it off, It won&#x27;t come off with regular remover.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Totally lame.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, they are selling this product under false pretences!</li>
            <li> Use a VERY THIN COAT of COLOR, and don&#x27;t go over and over.</li>
            <li> But for the last week I have been dwelling, outraged, ticked-off, annoyed and disgusted in this disappointing product!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid some is going to fall in my food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so frustrated</li>
            <li> You know how it dries all crusty and ugly looking until you peel it off?</li>
            <li> And let me tell you it was painful.</li>
            <li> Another painful experience for me.</li>
            <li> I am so confused to see these horrible reviews.  </li>
            <li> BAD BAD BAD!</li>
            <li> I hate you nutranail, what a joke.</li>
            <li> IT LOOKS LIKE CRAP.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, it was very difficult to remove with nail polish remover, guess I should have just soaked my hands and feet to remove it!  </li>
            <li> I bought it for $5 and was very disappointed at the quality.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  </li>
            <li> This is the WORST.  </li>
            <li> Horrible results.</li>
            <li> Just awful.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!  </li>
            <li> so I have seen it all, and I have never seen a product this horrible!  </li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
            <li> and I need to remove it because it looks horrible.</li>
            <li> nails look horrible</li>
            <li> I tried using 100% Acetone, it was horrible.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>
            <li> The worst part was trying to remove this product from my nails.</li>
            <li> Horrible experience.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly upset that I wasted 6 bucks on this.. I painted my nails last night before bed and I wish I can show you them now.. Horrible I&#x27;m so frustrated I wanna throw them out the window!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s keep this short and sweet. Just doesn&#x27;t work! Looked great upon application and was dry immediately. Other than that, I woke up did light housework and errands all day, looked down at dinner and 8 out of 10 fingernails were BADLY chipped. Fix is easy but who has time to fix nail chips constantly. NOT worth the money:(</li>
            <li> Got this today and did it, easy application looks really nice and for 10 bucks! Beats the $25 price tag this stuff has in the salon.  And if you goof up or it chips just fix it! and go on :)</li>
            <li> Cracks very easily. I am either over or under applying it. Not sure which so I will have to keep trying it to figure it out. Love the color and the shine though.</li>
            <li> This product takes some practice, but done right, it&#x27;s pretty good! I&#x27;ve found a few tricks that really help this product do what it&#x27;s supposed to. As the instructions say, your nails have to be completely clean. Use 100% ACETONE polish remover, with NO moisturizers or strengtheners. Really get into the cuticle area, and make sure you let them dry. DON&#x27;T WASH YOUR HANDS. Soap will leave a film that will keep the product from adhering as well.  Use the activator on only 5 nails (or fewer) at a time, then wait a minute (no more), so it&#x27;s a little more tacky. Think of it as superglue, though- it really is that quick to dry . Use a VERY THIN COAT of COLOR, and don&#x27;t go over and over. This takes practice, but once you learn how the brush covers, you can do it.  Make sure to follow the instructions for cleaning the brush between nails, but instead of relying on the tiny bottle provided, just put a small amount of the 100% acetone in a glass cup or bowl, and swish the brushes around.  DO 3 COATS, unless 2 really looks sufficient to you. I used a darker color, maybe the lighter ones cover better with just the 2 coats.   I&#x27;m a very busy wife and mother of 3 kids, and have housework, dogs, driving, and just life to keep my manicures from lasting more than a day or so. This product has lasted over 5- and it cost just about $12. That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> Meticulously followed application instructions, painted last last night &amp; chipped by 8am this morning and I haven&#x27;t even gone to work yet. NOT worth the money!</li>
            <li> The product chipped the same day I painted my nails. The color is beautiful but I would hardly call this a gel product.</li>
            <li> Ladies...Please dont get this product. Mine began to clip only hours after I applied polish.Plus the smell of the activator was so strong it made my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;I have sent mine in to have a full refund. I would suggest you do the same</li>
            <li> I would not waste your money on this product.  The entire idea of it is that it&#x27;s supposed to last longer than normal nail polish, and it chipped the next morning after I did it, and then kept chipping as 2 days went by -- a total pain in the butt.  It&#x27;s also hard to apply neatly because of the process of painting color over wet gel.  So even if it didn&#x27;t constantly chip - you have messy-looking nails.  So what&#x27;s the benefit?  Also, you have to purchase special remover to get it off of your nails.  I bought 100% acetone to get it off.  REgular nail polish with a regular topcoat works and looks so much better!  Don&#x27;t bother with this product!</li>
            <li> i do agree that the activator is super glue, however, it works just fine for me. the first time i applied it, i didnt like it because i felt rushed following the directions, and they were a mess. so, frustrated i waited until the next day to try. they were perfect. i slowed myself, one hand at a time, for all steps. so, i had one completed hand, and as it dried i started the other hand. i did get a couple that chipped after two days (i have crappy nails, since i just removed acrylic), BUT i read the little pamphlet that came in the box, and it says to apply a thin layer of activator and color, and another layer of activator over the entire nail; you cant even tell the chip was there! i used the lightest color because i like the natural tones, so im not sure if that helps. but im going to try my own polish and see how that works! sorry to those who have a hard time and cant seem to get it to work, hopefully you can try again and take your time!</li>
            <li> I would think that Nutra Nail would have made a product that would only work with what came in the box.  That is not so!  You can use this with any nail polish and it works just as well.  Tip though:  Even though the directions say not to wait until the gel is dry to apply the nail color, you should wait until the gel is between tacky and dry (it is simply a form of liquid glue, think of it as putting on fake lashes) then apply the nail color.  The polish glides on much smoother.  Finish with a top coat and enjoy your nails!  Day five and no chipping.  Plus, by using your own nail polish, your nails will not smell like pickle juice.  Which leads me to believe that it is their own polish that smells bad.  Good idea, bad execution Nutra Nail!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  Not only does chipping begin hours after application, but the application process itself is a pain.  Removing it is even worse!  Regular nail color with a decent top coat outperforms this and is far cheaper.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> HONESTLY, THE PRODUCT SUCKS.... I HAVE HAD IT ON FOR 2 DAYS AND HALF OF MY NAILS ARE CHIPPED ALREADY.  SUCH AN INCONVENIENCE. I AM ON VACATION AND NOW HAVE TO GO PAY FOR A MANICURE TO GET THIS POLISH OFF.&lt;br /&gt;THE POLISH COSTS 12.00 AND TAKES ABOUT 2-3 COATS OF POLISH ON EACH NAIL. I SPENT ALMOST AN HOUR DOING MY NAILS WITH THIS POLISH AND IT CHIPPED IN 2 DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;REGULAR POLISH DOESN&#x27;T EVEN CHIP IN TWO DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!! I&#x27;M RETURNING!!!</li>
            <li> I really thought this product would be the solution to my constant &amp;#34;nail polish chipping problems&amp;#34;, but it turns out it&#x27;s even worse than regular nail polish. I noticed a chip on one of my fingernails less than 24 hours after I finished painting them with Nutra Nail and my nails continued to chip throughout the day. I&#x27;ve used $.99 nail polish in the past that lasted way longer than that. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> All this is is super glue and regular old nail polish. 3 coats of super glue and 2 coats&lt;br /&gt;Of polish all layered on top of eachother. Just imagine mixing nail polish with super glue! BAD BAD BAD! Clumpy, stringy, MESSY....stupid. Good luck getting this crap off, my nails are completely DESTROYED. What was suppose&lt;br /&gt;To be a 5 min manicure turned into hours of hell and now I&#x27;ll have to wait months for my nails to regrow and be normal again. I hate you nutranail, what a joke.</li>
            <li> I expected this to replace real gel manicures. However, it started chipping the very first day.  I followed the directions and touched up the chips on the second day but by the next day over half the polish was gone. Normal polish lasts about a week for me and gel manicures last 10-14 days.  Even when it only takes about 10 minutes like this product - who has time to polish their nails every 2 or 3 days and touch them up almost every day?</li>
            <li> When first applying this product it felt like it was going to last, however, by the end of the day, the tips of my nails were chipping.  Of course, it is made of a special formula, so it was torture trying to remove the rest of the polish in the center of my nails.  But it seems that the polish is very brittle, and if the nail beneath it is weak and bends, then the polish will crack and fall off.  I do not recommend it if you have thin nails that bend easily.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money it chips the day after you apply it don&#x27;t waste your money . I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my clients</li>
            <li> bought it for $1.the bottles are REALLY tiny. the top for the brush cleaner was loose,the bottle was completely empty. i paint my nails right before I go to bed.i wake up &amp; 2 nails are chipped(wtf) &amp; the rest are cracked. 6 hours later, half the paint from all nails have peeled off.it hasn&#x27;t even been a whole 24 hours &amp; my nails look terrible.</li>
            <li> This is the WORST.  As other reviewers have stated, the activator is more or less super glue with a brush and it is very pungent, my eyes were watering the whole time I was using it.  The polish seems to be just regular polish, only in a itty-bitty sized (.17 fl oz) bottle.  It is also somewhat difficult to apply as you have to be quick and careful; the good news is that this chips incredibly fast and needs to be redone almost immediately so you will get lots of practice perfecting your quick and careful technique.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I purchased this product hoping for a long lasting polish.  As a former nail technician I am fond of gel for this purpose. I watched the application video and followed the instructions exactly.  I polished my nails at 10 pm and by the next morning I already had a small chip in the corner of one nail.  Less than 12 hours after application one nail was almost entirely chipped off and the others all had small nicks and cracks throughout.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t dwell on or make a huge deal over a disappointing product I&#x27;ve purchased. But for the last week I have been dwelling, outraged, ticked-off, annoyed and disgusted in this disappointing product!&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever gotten Super-Glue on your fingers and/or cuticles accidentally? You know how it dries all crusty and ugly looking until you peel it off? Well I&#x27;m pretty sure the Activator Coat that comes in this package (and has to be applied 4-5 times) is Super Super Glue!! Inevitably, you will get some Activator Coat in or on your cuticle during at least 1 of the 5 times you&#x27;re instructed to apply it. IT LOOKS LIKE CRAP. The gel polish itself goes on streaky and visibly remains a streaky disaster.&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are going to take the time &amp; money to purchase this product, absolutely invest in their remover. Although I did not use their remover, I am here to tell you, regular acetone has no effect on this disaster! After 2 days of scrubbing and a whole bottle of 100% acetone, not one speck came off. I finally found a ladies Blog whom experienced &amp; lived this same nightmare. What she instructed did indeed work-&lt;br /&gt;Wrap your nail in 2 squares of acetone saturated toilet paper &amp; tightly wrap foil around the toilet papered finger for 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;However, make sure to remove one foiled finger at a time, as you will need to quickly use something to scrape off the residue while still wet. NEVER AGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m investing in the actual Gel Polish with the darn LED/UV light....and probably their specific remover, as well.&lt;br /&gt;I e-mailed Nutra Nail and they are willing to refund my money, given I send them the receipt &amp; UPC from the box. Unfortunately, I threw the receipt away like a dummy. Nutra Nail can keep my money and disregard the obvious fact that their product is HORRIBLE, but I personally believe this goes above and beyond false advertising.</li>
            <li> Horrible results. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Product chips in hours and takes soaking in acetone to get it off. Total waste of money. And yes, I followed all the directions. I tried out two colors. Just awful.</li>
            <li> I bought this in two Colors and tried them both and tried several methods of application. The darker color seemed to work a little better than the pale pink but they both chipped way to soon and the damage to my nails and cuticles just is not worth the effort. It does not work like they say it will and it is damaging. Big.Fat.Fail. If I could give it minus 10 stars I would.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product. I was excited to try it out  but the next day two of the nails are chipped</li>
            <li> If I could give \\&quot;0\\&quot; stars I would....this product is a joke and is not worth a penny of anyone&#x27;s money. I usually do not write bad reviews but I couldn&#x27;t help but post this. As soon as I applied this product, it began chipping \\&quot;worse\\&quot; than regular nail polish. After reading the reviews, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try...\\&quot;some females are rougher on their nails than I am\\&quot;, I thought....and low and behold, the same results. My regular polish holds for at least 3-4 days....this product didn&#x27;t even last 10 hours! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! With all the testing they do on products before selling, this company knew this product would not live up to it&#x27;s description, they absolutely knew it!!! In my opinion, they are selling this product under false pretences! I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND, EVEN IF THEY SELL IT FOR A PENNY!</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!  I have been doing my own nails for over 30 years so I have seen it all, and I have never seen a product this horrible!  The thing it boasts about is how it will last? If they mean one day sure, because it was chipping 1 day later. Tthe worst part is now that I want to take it off, It won&#x27;t come off with regular remover. I remember seeing their own brand of remover at the time, should have bought it then. I&#x27;m guessing they knew it was a crappy product so they made it where you have to not only waste your money on one product, but their remover as well.... Take the money and run..... I will never buy another nutra nail product!!</li>
            <li> Product is amazing. Couldn&#x27;t afford gel polish kit with lamp etc so tried this.&lt;br /&gt;Use a thin but even coat of activator then, going back to first nail, apply a thick but even (instructions say thin but definitely needs to be thick - like just do 2 coats one over the other straight away) coat of the polish. When all 5 nails are done then go back and apply a generous amount of activator over the top. Literally perfect nails, high shine &amp; long wearing results.</li>
            <li> Was super excited about this &amp;#34;all encompassing kit&amp;#34; with no LED lights necessary. Put three coats on last night, alternating between activator and gel color. It looked GREAT! the today I did dishes and every one of my nails was dull and tacky. Product is combustible so returning is not an optiin unlesss you are licensed to ship hazardous materials in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t do ANY manual labor or wear gloves this product may work for you. Me? I feel like I should have thrown my money out the car window. At least I would have seen the enjoyment of someone finding it.</li>
            <li> Paid $12.00 at Walgreens.  Nails did not have that smooth gel look to them.  By the first evening, half the polish was chipped off.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Ok first off- dont expect a professional job if YOU cannot polish well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can so I guess thats why I am loving my nails...&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why they havent placed in the direction to finish with a coat of activator but thats what gives you the nice flawless look-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow all the directions per Nutra Nail but just finish each nail with the activator being your \\&quot;last\\&quot; or \\&quot;top\\&quot; coat, believe me after playing around with this product a few times, this $10 kit makes $20 every two weeks great!</li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly as stated.  Wasn&#x27;t even 24 hours and most of my nails are chipping.  Save your money!</li>
            <li> Besides the reasonable price for what I thought I was going to get, everything after the purchase was very disappointing. I am not one to ever leave reviews, but this was SOOO not as advertised/under performing that I had to weigh in. I have always done my own manicures, including UV gel manicures as of late (Gelish), and can properly read/follow directions. To start off, the noxious smell of this product upon opening was enough to make my eyes immediately burn and water. To the extent I almost had to abandon ship after the first application of activator on the first two nails--and a catch 22 to try and have a \\&quot;well ventilated\\&quot; space, bc you can&#x27;t turn on a fan as it will prematurely dry. The activator was also super runny and was near impossible to control how much you were putting on as you had to do it so quickly (and to try to not get it on the cuticles was also a rough haul). When I moved quickly to the color gel, it seemed that every troubleshooting problem was there - not mixing, wrong proportions, stringy, you name it. I quickly realized this was a waste of time, and I abandoned the whole exercise after the first hand--I quickly grabbed for my acetone. Unfortunately, removing the even partial application was equally as tedious and I spent much time tonight with heavily acetone soaked cotton balls and an orange stick, trying to rub off the gummy application bit by bit. Overall, this whole system is totally not worth it, so highly suggest sticking to regular manicures or my personal favorite, Gelish UV gel nails. Those may take a good 30-45 minutes to complete, but the process it easy, they last a full 10 days AND are ready to wear.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  Did Not go on smooth and don&#x27;t work, very disappointed. Expected more for the price that quoted</li>
            <li> This product works great if you have patience and follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. First, I had chipped nail polish the next day after applying. Then, trying to get it off is a nightmare! 100% acetone didn&#x27;t work for me. I would never recommend this. Good thing I bought cheap!</li>
            <li> I will admit it was fun putting this polish on--feeling like you&#x27;re really getting a formal manicure. And the color is absolutely gorgeous and looks great when first applied.&lt;br /&gt;BUT DO NOT BE FOOLED.&lt;br /&gt;This product is none of the things it claims to be:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is NOT long lasting--my polish chipped the very next day even when I was not doing any \\&quot;labor\\&quot; with my hands--about the most strenuous thing I did before this chipped was read a magazine or make toast. It lasted less time than most $2 nail polish at the drugstore!&lt;br /&gt;2. It is a son-of-a-gun  to get off. You must buy an extra product just to remove the gunk. I tried my normal polish remover--NOTHING HAPPENED. This is a way to tricking you into buying something else and most gel polish removal kits are LABOR INTENSIVE, requiring stupid-looking foil-wrapped fingers that has to stay on for 15 worthless minutes. The removal takes more time than the application time by about 3x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had not wasted my money on this trash. I am sticking to good old \\&quot;normal\\&quot; polish from here on out. If you want REGULAR nail polish--easy to remove but long lasting and gorgeous--try  Sally Hansen&#x27;s Complete Salon Manicure line. That is 1/2 the price of this despicable product and so, so, so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money OR your time on this one!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on sale (2.99) from a local store and thought I would try it.  I opened the activator bottle and the smell was intense, but familiar.  I then realized it was super glue after I had applied it to my nails.  I figured I would try it though, but it chipped the same day.  I removed it the next morning.  Glad I did not pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions for applying nail gel and was very pleased with the results.  I did one hand at a time was best for me. Took my time and did not hurry  so things went along just fine . Someone else does my nails but she is in the hospital now , so I read the how to apply over and over. Lined up the products and went to work working at my own pace ,and they look beautiful . I was so surprised that I COULD DO THEM . IF I CAN , SO CAN YOU.  JH</li>
            <li> I bought this last week at Harmons drug store. Paid a lot more than I normally would but figured if I spend $35 in the nail salon every 2 weeks to get the gel polish, then I would be saving money if this did the same thing as it says. WRONG!!! First, the bottles are so small, that I can&#x27;t imagine you can get more than 3 applications done.  Followed all the steps precisely. Was impressed with how quickly it dried. Did this before I went to sleep. Woke up and see that it is already starting to chip. 4 hours later, chipping more as if I have had it on for a week already. It is now the following day and I need to remove it because it looks horrible. Can&#x27;t wait to attempt to do this with the special nail polish remover I bought at the same time which I\\&quot;m sure will work as well as the polish. My advice, if you want the gel polish that lasts 10 days, stick to the nail salon.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever written a review, but felt I needed to warn people not to waste their money on this product. I have used it now for three applications and this last time was the absolute worst. I followed the directions step by step and my nails still chipped the next day. I would look down and find the fallen chips of polish on the floor, desk, etc. I even saw a chip of polish today in the burner on my stove! I&#x27;m afraid some is going to fall in my food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails look horrible and I was embarrassed all day at work trying to hide my hands. You must purchase their special remover, and as long as you follow those directions, the polish does come off easily and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Sally Hansens&#x27; Quick Dry. I don&#x27;t have the time to do my nails every night. I really don&#x27;t feel it was worth one star, zero is more like it!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would make my nails stronger and last longer. Wrong. First off, the smell is so strong I still have a headache 30 minutes after airing out my house (and I NEVER have a problem with the smell of regular nail polish or remover), second, the \\&quot;activator\\&quot; is technically brush on super glue that you mix with any regular polish (it even tells you to not let it dry before the color is added- because it&#x27;s super glue. Lastly, my nails looked like just any other bad paint job that forgot to put the top coat on it. They were very dull in color and when trying to add a top coat they became sticky and did not dry. They&#x27;re impossible to remove unless you have special nail polish remover. Luckily, I already had one of those press-on nails soaking things (you can find them next to the press on nails in any drugstore) and that worked like a charm! I was even able to clean up the mess it left on my cuticles. Overall, this is NOT worth the time, effort, and money. The product is extremely messy, difficult to use, and I would not recommend this to anyone at all.</li>
            <li> I love the look of polished nails, but dont have the time to do them regularly enough to avoid the chipped look.  This is a great solution.  It was really simple to use, although took me longer than 5 minutes to apply to be sure I didn&#x27;t get it all over my fingers, but thats just my unsteady hand.  I applied the activator to my thumb and pointer, then did the gel color, then went on to my middle, ring, and pinky fingers to be sure the activator didn&#x27;t dry before I was able to put the color gel on.  This worked well.  A few nails were still a little tacky after the 2 applications, but I brushed a thin coat of the activator on top and that solved it.  Be sure to clean the brush between hands and coats or it will get stringy and globby.  Otherwise, a fantastic solution to a mani!  The color is also great. Dark, almost like a purple tint to black.</li>
            <li> the key is you really have to follow the directions with this product or it won&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;The key is to do no more than 5 nails at a time with the activator then paint with the color.&lt;br /&gt;or even try 3 nails at a time if you need to take your time. and repeat the steps activator then color&lt;br /&gt;if you need the color to be darker. thing is to push the color onto the nails. also you have to cap your&lt;br /&gt;nails at the ends run the brush along the ends of your nails to seal the product. when you have completed&lt;br /&gt;all five nails while still wet go over the nails with activator to seal.&lt;br /&gt;this product is better than the uv nail polish at the salon to me had it done before and&lt;br /&gt;wasted money for it to chip the next day or two. and uv lights are not safe.&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying this with my regular nail polish just to get a variety of colors hope this helped someone.</li>
            <li> okay so I read all the reviews and was not surprised...People either loved it or hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it cause I&#x27;m tired of giving my money away when I can do it myself. Anyway, the first time I used it it went on well, but it did chip the next day (only one nail chipped). I went a couple more days and I got another chip so I removed it. It took a little time of me sitting with cotton wrapped around each of my nails...watched the news while I waited...but it came off easily enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being one to give up so easily...I tried it again the next day! I had much better results. I made sure I went slowly, especially with the color, and followed all the directions exactly. This time it looks much better and over 24 hrs later ... No Chips!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to do it again...this time I&#x27;m going to do only 2 nails at a time in order to get a better look. It&#x27;s true that not everything the product promises is true...but then what product really delivers on all its promises? Keep practicing...perfection is not achieved in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  If done properly no chipping and looks shiny and professional.  Instructions tell you to do both hands together- much easier and better results if you do one hand completely first and then do second hand.  I&#x27;m going to bring this to my professional nail artist and ask her to use on my nails so I don&#x27;t hand to u.v. Ray/microwave my fingers.</li>
            <li> Didnt even make it through a trip to the grocery store......not impressed and wont waste my money again</li>
            <li> I purchased Nutra Nail Gel Perfect and had my manicurist apply it according the instructions, one day prior to leaving for vacation. After spending time in the ocean and pool, less than four days later it was coming off in many places.  My regular polish stays on throughout the week on the same kind of vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, it was very difficult to remove with nail polish remover, guess I should have just soaked my hands and feet to remove it!  Having spent $14 w/tax, was not happy! !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I work in the local hospital and regular polish never lasts more than one day.  I saw this at the local Shopko and decided to give it a try.  It lasted less than one night.  Not only did it chip, but it cracked and flaked off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was $11.59 down the drain.  But I guess live and learn.</li>
            <li> I felt really accomplished after I finished the entire process and my nails looked beautiful!  Unfortunately, the first big hunk chipped off the next day, not even 24 hours later!  I thought maybe I messed up on the one nail, but, nope.  They all started chipping.  As the other reviews say, the polish that doesn&#x27;t chip off is nearly impossible to get off.  Hint:  since you need to get it off your nails and are never going to use the product again anyway, use the bottle of cleaner to remove it.  I believe someone said it&#x27;s pure acetone.  Better than ruining your nails trying to scrape it off.  Such a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I bought this at a major retailer starting with W, and I&#x27;m glad I did because they take stuff back even if you&#x27;ve used it. Love amazon and wanted to help the community by posting an honest appraisal of this product which does NOT work. To spare you lots of reading, I watched their instructional videos at nutra nail.com and followed instructions explicitly. At first I was like &amp;#34;Yayyyy this is like real gel nails&amp;#34; because of the appearance. They looked just like nail salon gel nails. But within 3 hours, every finger was chipped like 99 cent nail polish. Totally lame. Don&#x27;t buy it, it doesn&#x27;t work. The end.</li>
            <li> This did not even last 12 hours before it chipped. I have had salon gel nails and they do last two weeks.</li>
            <li> Do not get this product! I went to the local drug store and bought this product because I saw the commercials and wanted to give it a try. First the price is ridiculous ($11.99). Now I know Amazon has it for a little cheaper. What you get is three tiny bottles. The Activator is .25 oz, the Nail Color is .17 oz, and the Brush Cleaner is .17 oz. It comes with directions that tell you to focus on one hand at a time which if fine with me. First you need to put the activator on all five nails. Then quickly put a thin layer of the color. After doing all five nails you need to switch the brush from the Color bottle with the brush from the Cleaner bottle. When I open the Activator I could smell the strong product. The product smells like Krazy Glue. But I ignored the smell. I followed the steps exactly as it said in the directions on one hand. When I was done my finger tips felt odd. When I checked them the activator had caused my nail to glue onto my skin! And let me tell you it was painful. Then I thought it must be Krazy Glue. I have used Krazy Glue in the past and accidentally have gotten some on my fingers. The activator reacted exactly like the Krazy Glue. I am a true believer that if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it is a duck. The activator is Krazy Glue in a different bottle with a brush, with an expensive price tag. At this point I couldn&#x27;t get the product off my nails sooner. I tried using 100% Acetone, it was horrible. No matter how hard a scrubbed nothing came off, and my nail was still glued to my skin. Eventually I got some of the product off and managed to unglue my nails from my skin. By this point my finger tips ached so much. I waited until the next morning to finish taking off the color from my nails. Another painful experience for me. Trust me this is the worse product that I have ever bought. I prefer to use regular nail polish and wait a longer time for it to dry and have to paint them more often than use this produce ever again. I donot even mind if one of the nails gets smudged. It is so much easier to remove the nail polish from one nail and repainting it than any step from this product. This product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am so confused to see these horrible reviews.  I am a novice nail maintenance person and I&#x27;ve never wanted to do regular manis due to time challenges.  I decided to try this product on a whim and it looks amazing!  As a total novice I was able to apply this, following the directions exactly, and ended with nails that truly looked professionally done!  I was very meticulous in the application and super careful and it worked fabulously.  I think I went about 10 days without a chip and then by that time had no problem removing them.  So I&#x27;m not sure why people are having such awful experiences.  Mine was 100% positive!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. I bought it for $5 and was very disappointed at the quality. I found that it was a pain to use and lasted about a day. I have switched to the Sensationail product and love it.</li>
            <li> I seen this on TV and it looked interesting. I thought the shiny look and one that drys quickly so that there are no impressions from sheets while sleeping or whatever sounded great. I was so excited to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now just to give you an understanding, I paint my nails all the time. Nail Polish has never lasted too long on me but I usually can go at least 4 days when they are done before they start to chip no matter if it was a professional job or I did it my self. I can&#x27;t stand chipping polish so I take it off and will redo as soon as it starts. Also I will spend the money on good quality nail polishes. So I am no novice when it comes to polishing my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this out and was very impressed with the quickness it dried and the color. But later that day it started to crack. I figured it was because I did not wear gloves when cleaning the bathroom and would retry the next day, after I had a chance to pick up the special nail polish remover I needed to get it off. By the next morning most all of them were chipping and looked horrible. But I still decided to retry it. I took the time, prepped my nails and repainted and yes I covered the edges. Again happy with the color and how it dried, but by the next morning... CHIPPING AGAIN. So I took it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails have been damaged since trying it because of the harsh nail polish remover and probably the nail polish too. I had nice long nails that many people have thought were fakes because I take good care of them. Now they are damaged and I have to wait for them to completely grow out the damaged nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it got 1 star from me is because 0 stars was not an option. I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Never never never buy this stuff.  It&#x27;s exspensive and it took me an hour to polish. I took a shower the next morning and it took off 8 out of the 10 nails and I had to go to work like that!  How embarrassing.  I did it again last night, and it came off again.  What a waste of time and money .  Would not reccomend!</li>
            <li> I saw this product and thought I&#x27;ll give it a try...I followed the instructions per the YouTube video. I did my nails on a Sunday... by 2pm on Monday one of my nails were chipped. I was like REALLY! I made sure I started with clean nails.. even wiped them with acetone. By mid-day Tuesday the polish was chipped near the cuticles... how does that happen? Now it&#x27;s Wednesday and I find myself with my nail polish constantly touching up my nails just so I don&#x27;t walk around with jacked up looking nails. The removal process sucks but I&#x27;ll be doing it using their \\&quot;pouch\\&quot; tonight since I work from home tomorrow. Do not get this product... Really Don&#x27;t Get This Product.</li>
            <li> A lot of times I do my manicure by myself, so when I saw the product I got excited - wow, I can do gel nails at home, great! But it didn&#x27;t work well for me. The color didn&#x27;t look smooth on the activator. It looked uneven and bumpy. It looked cheap. Definitely not a salon effect. The worst part was trying to remove this product from my nails. It sticked like a super glue. Horrible experience.</li>
