            <li>I bought this for my dad many times..</li>

            <li>and I was happy with the product I knew I had made the correct choice in terms of product, Thanks</li>
            <li>Nice and clean.</li>
            <li>ITS WORTH IT !!</li>
            <li>I live in Brazil and I was happy with the speed that was delivered this product I bought it because I already knew.</li>
            <li>smelled good  fast shipping</li>
            <li>But the original with the woody/musky fragrance :)</li>
            <li>Strong, and it will stick around for 8 hours, even if you can&#x27;t still smell it.</li>
            <li>Affordable and yet pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this without smelling it first, but based on the great reviews and reasonable price...</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE AND GREAT LONG LASTING FRAGRANCE WOMEN LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a light, almost woodsy smell.  </li>
            <li>IT WAS CHEAP...</li>
            <li>This cologne not only smells great</li>
            <li>cheap knock off, doesn&#x27;t smell like the legit stuff,</li>
            <li>I choose it because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Wow this cologne is by far the best that ive ever bought.</li>
            <li>Not too mild.. not too strong.</li>
            <li>The package arrived on time and came in original packaging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i dont like it doesnt even last&lt;br /&gt;doesnt seem to be an original  product</li>
            <li>Very good option if you are looking for something not too expensive, smell fresh but is very sweet, is a good option for the price</li>
            <li>The girls are constantly complimenting me on how good i smell.</li>
            <li>This is my daily fragrance, and I just loved it.</li>
            <li>It is  a  good perfume to be used on a daily basis  before going anywhere in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the smell ,very fresh &amp; good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone wanting a different cologne that has its own unique kick that most people haven&#x27;t really smelled before.</li>
            <li>emptying the stuff quickly.</li>
            <li>It quickly disappear though</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if it smelled like new leather interior, burnt rubber, and just a hint of gasoline.  </li>
            <li>I love this ferrari colone, i&#x27;m thinking about buying a new one.</li>
            <li>Excellent long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance because it has a light scent.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this cologne because it&#x27;s a fairly cheap one.</li>
            <li>IS BY FAR IN MY TOP</li>
            <li>I PERSONALLY THOUGHT THE FRAGRANCE WAS QUITE NICE.</li>
            <li>Worth the price tag</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the bottle is nice and 4.2 ounces is plenty to last you forever</li>
            <li>and I found out after using it for 1 month that it is a very clean and soft fragance.</li>
            <li>right in between&lt;</li>
            <li>I thought I might as well write a  positive review!</li>
            <li>well the smell is overwhelmingly sweet, and not even the good sweet, hard to describe...</li>
            <li>Its got a very nice masculine scent and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The scent is really nice, the only problem is that goes away too fast.</li>
            <li>thank you very much 100% recommended</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I will most likely wear it on occasion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i recommend trying it on first.</li>
            <li>Great perfume yet the scent doesn last long.</li>
            <li>Satisfied overall i would like to re commend this perfume to y all</li>
            <li>however it subsidies pretty soon.    </li>
            <li>its a really distinguished fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t really sweet or really</li>
            <li>My fiance love it is his daily cologne for work</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried this</li>
            <li>BUY ONLY FROM A REPUTABLE STORE</li>
            <li>Long lasting and very nice flavor.</li>
            <li>a pretty strong fragrance so 1-2 sprays is enough</li>
            <li>bought GUCCI perfume for $88, I thought it would be good long lasting.</li>
            <li>This is very good spray, you can use it for both formal and casual times.</li>
            <li>The smell does not have much staying power.</li>
            <li>shipping was also fast.</li>
            <li>would recommend if you get it for a reasonable amount</li>
            <li>I guess it depends on how much you sweat though...</li>
            <li>Real manly.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>did not get 1 complement and its been a month, smell goes away really fast</li>
            <li>AND THEY WERE RIGHT ON WHEN THEY DEVELOPED THIS COLOGNE.</li>
            <li>As a mom I have to say it is a simple, clean smell .</li>
            <li>The colone is full of water and the scent only lasts like one minute.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Ferrari Black and get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a decent product.</li>
            <li>I personally found the prior range of ferrari perfumes better.</li>
            <li>The knockoff (Indy black) which I got for 5$ is literally just as good and lasts just as long</li>
            <li>Smell endures everyday work and is still pretty strong by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s of high class fragrance.</li>
            <li>I OWN ABOUT THIRTY DIFFERENT BRANDS OF COLOGNE AND FERRARI BLACK</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I ordered a new one online</li>
            <li>Just like you stopped using Bod and Axe in high school, and you stopped spraying old spice when you got to college.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It stays for long and always smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I usually us Chanel de Bleu on top.</li>
            <li>scent is quite strong and I could describe it as a little feminine.</li>
            <li>so i was taken back after the first spray of how unexpected the scent is...</li>
            <li>but I do not enjoy strong Perfumes</li>
            <li>I am surprised that it is sold by AMAZON.COM LLC.....</li>
            <li>Classy yet sporting.</li>
            <li>the bottle and colors and the ferrari all gave the impression of a masculine scent ...</li>
            <li>is very volatile, the fragrance last one minute on the skin and disappears ..</li>
            <li>The item does not look anywhere near the description of the picture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 years now and it is by far</li>
            <li>Good perfume for casual wear.</li>
            <li>came the other more common ta worth</li>
            <li>Since my first purchase I have almost ordered 3-4 times the same brand and will continue to do the same.</li>
            <li>At first when I applied some Ferrari Black on I was confused because of the strong and different aroma it gave up, it starts as a musk masculine smell ending with a slight sweet and pleasantly distinct smell.</li>
            <li>Although the design/bottle are cool, I am not a huge fan of the smell of this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The perfume seems to give a little too bold fragrance when you just spray it on...</li>
            <li>I personally find it a little flat - like one-noted - but it&#x27;s good as long as it isn&#x27;t the only tool in your arsenal.</li>
            <li>IT PUTS YOU IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES WITH THE LADIES.</li>

            <li> It was a gift for a friend, its his favorite lotion spray</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay to just try once, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say I love this perfume, but I surely like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is in my top 5 colognes.</li>
            <li> my favorite fragrance!!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad many times..</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t say I love it since I have not tried it.</li>
            <li> and I was happy with the product I knew I had made the correct choice in terms of product, Thanks</li>
            <li> Nice and clean.</li>
            <li> ITS WORTH IT !!</li>
            <li> I live in Brazil and I was happy with the speed that was delivered this product I bought it because I already knew.</li>
            <li> smelled good  fast shipping</li>
            <li> But the original with the woody/musky fragrance :)</li>
            <li> Strong, and it will stick around for 8 hours, even if you can&#x27;t still smell it.</li>
            <li> Affordable and yet pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this without smelling it first, but based on the great reviews and reasonable price...</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE AND GREAT LONG LASTING FRAGRANCE WOMEN LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a light, almost woodsy smell.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS CHEAP...</li>
            <li> This cologne not only smells great</li>
            <li> cheap knock off, doesn&#x27;t smell like the legit stuff,</li>
            <li> I choose it because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Wow this cologne is by far the best that ive ever bought.</li>
            <li> Not too mild.. not too strong.</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time and came in original packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i dont like it doesnt even last&lt;br /&gt;doesnt seem to be an original  product</li>
            <li> Very good option if you are looking for something not too expensive, smell fresh but is very sweet, is a good option for the price</li>
            <li> The girls are constantly complimenting me on how good i smell.</li>
            <li> This is my daily fragrance, and I just loved it.</li>
            <li> It is  a  good perfume to be used on a daily basis  before going anywhere in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the smell ,very fresh &amp; good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone wanting a different cologne that has its own unique kick that most people haven&#x27;t really smelled before.</li>
            <li> emptying the stuff quickly.</li>
            <li> It quickly disappear though</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It would have been better if it smelled like new leather interior, burnt rubber, and just a hint of gasoline.  </li>
            <li> I love this ferrari colone, i&#x27;m thinking about buying a new one.</li>
            <li> Excellent long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance because it has a light scent.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this cologne because it&#x27;s a fairly cheap one.</li>
            <li> IS BY FAR IN MY TOP</li>
            <li> I PERSONALLY THOUGHT THE FRAGRANCE WAS QUITE NICE.</li>
            <li> Worth the price tag</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the bottle is nice and 4.2 ounces is plenty to last you forever</li>
            <li> and I found out after using it for 1 month that it is a very clean and soft fragance.</li>
            <li> right in between&lt;</li>
            <li> I thought I might as well write a  positive review!</li>
            <li> well the smell is overwhelmingly sweet, and not even the good sweet, hard to describe...</li>
            <li> Its got a very nice masculine scent and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The scent is really nice, the only problem is that goes away too fast.</li>
            <li> thank you very much 100% recommended</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and I will most likely wear it on occasion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i recommend trying it on first.</li>
            <li> Great perfume yet the scent doesn last long.</li>
            <li> Satisfied overall i would like to re commend this perfume to y all</li>
            <li> however it subsidies pretty soon.    </li>
            <li> its a really distinguished fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t really sweet or really</li>
            <li> My fiance love it is his daily cologne for work</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried this</li>
            <li> BUY ONLY FROM A REPUTABLE STORE</li>
            <li> Long lasting and very nice flavor.</li>
            <li> a pretty strong fragrance so 1-2 sprays is enough</li>
            <li> bought GUCCI perfume for $88, I thought it would be good long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is very good spray, you can use it for both formal and casual times.</li>
            <li> The smell does not have much staying power.</li>
            <li> shipping was also fast.</li>
            <li> would recommend if you get it for a reasonable amount</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on how much you sweat though...</li>
            <li> Real manly.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> did not get 1 complement and its been a month, smell goes away really fast</li>
            <li> AND THEY WERE RIGHT ON WHEN THEY DEVELOPED THIS COLOGNE.</li>
            <li> As a mom I have to say it is a simple, clean smell .</li>
            <li> The colone is full of water and the scent only lasts like one minute.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Ferrari Black and get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a decent product.</li>
            <li> I personally found the prior range of ferrari perfumes better.</li>
            <li> The knockoff (Indy black) which I got for 5$ is literally just as good and lasts just as long</li>
            <li> Smell endures everyday work and is still pretty strong by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s of high class fragrance.</li>
            <li> I OWN ABOUT THIRTY DIFFERENT BRANDS OF COLOGNE AND FERRARI BLACK</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I ordered a new one online</li>
            <li> Just like you stopped using Bod and Axe in high school, and you stopped spraying old spice when you got to college.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It stays for long and always smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I usually us Chanel de Bleu on top.</li>
            <li> scent is quite strong and I could describe it as a little feminine.</li>
            <li> so i was taken back after the first spray of how unexpected the scent is...</li>
            <li> but I do not enjoy strong Perfumes</li>
            <li> I am surprised that it is sold by AMAZON.COM LLC.....</li>
            <li> Classy yet sporting.</li>
            <li> the bottle and colors and the ferrari all gave the impression of a masculine scent ...</li>
            <li> is very volatile, the fragrance last one minute on the skin and disappears ..</li>
            <li> The item does not look anywhere near the description of the picture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 years now and it is by far</li>
            <li> Good perfume for casual wear.</li>
            <li> came the other more common ta worth</li>
            <li> Since my first purchase I have almost ordered 3-4 times the same brand and will continue to do the same.</li>
            <li> At first when I applied some Ferrari Black on I was confused because of the strong and different aroma it gave up, it starts as a musk masculine smell ending with a slight sweet and pleasantly distinct smell.</li>
            <li> Although the design/bottle are cool, I am not a huge fan of the smell of this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The perfume seems to give a little too bold fragrance when you just spray it on...</li>
            <li> I personally find it a little flat - like one-noted - but it&#x27;s good as long as it isn&#x27;t the only tool in your arsenal.</li>
            <li> IT PUTS YOU IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES WITH THE LADIES.</li>
            <li> all but the fragrance does not last long may be 3 to 4 hrs ..</li>
            <li> since it does not last long you end up spraying yourself</li>
            <li> the smell does not last long at all...</li>
            <li> Practically very little &amp;#34;olfaction&amp;#34; lasting for a very brief time...have serious doubts if this is a genuine product or NOT.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re older than undergrad age, because it&#x27;s not appropriate then.</li>
            <li> As long as I remember..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lasts long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a long time.</li>
            <li> IM SAYING ITS RIGHT UP THERE WITH MY PRADA, BURBERRY, PERRY ELLIS AND MY VICTORIA SECRET FOR MEN.</li>
            <li> I ordered was the limited edition</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a little heavier than the Ferrari Red</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a little heavier than the Ferrari Red</li>
            <li> it was all messy and when i open it my hands smell all day also</li>
            <li> Not quite as expected</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no fragrance even 5 min after spraying.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type who doesn&#x27;t like any kind of loud fragrance, then Ferrari Black is the cologne for you !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The previous perfume I used wouldnt last too long or used to have a little feminine scent to it.....</li>
            <li> I will buy other products.</li>
            <li> recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> the price is hard to beat especially when fragrances in this weight are upwards or 60.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always used Ferrari Black..</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars,only if they improve on the chemical that would require less sprays.</li>
            <li> The Amazon price is less thank half of the going price in Europe.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments wearing this to work everyday and even outside.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> and it had broken nozzle, buy it from a store next time.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Amazon made me to get the product in very less time.    </li>
            <li> It rotted (started to stink) in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> But I was not satisfied with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;i wear usually to work</li>
            <li> I have a lot of different colognes, This one isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> not a good buy</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was expensive.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT AN EXPENSIVE BRAND</li>
            <li> , I WOULD SAY THAT IS FAKE.</li>
            <li> is fake.</li>
            <li> but it was way too expensive.</li>
            <li> but i have to give five starts because the one i purchased was a FAKE.</li>
            <li> THE ITEM I PURCHASED IS A FAKE</li>
            <li> recommended for casual wear, like the office or hanging out with the guys.</li>
            <li> This cheap knock off also sprays in a stream instead of a spray, awful awful product...</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this cologne to my brother as a gift, and received a fake Ferrari cologne!</li>
            <li> saying that, it still isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> Bad smell.</li>
            <li> I really hate it.</li>
            <li> Bad quality!!!!</li>
            <li> and i am disgusted to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED with this product!!!</li>

            <li> Very good option if you are looking for something not too expensive, smell fresh but is very sweet, is a good option for the price</li>
            <li> I have always used Ferrari Black.. As long as I remember.. And Amazon guarantees that the product delivered is not a rip off .. But the original with the woody/musky fragrance :)</li>
            <li> This Cologne is really good. The smell does not have much staying power. The bottle and box it arrived in was awesome. The package arrived on time and came in original packaging. Thanks!</li>
            <li> i always have this perfume with me when i travel. have been using it since 4 years and i love it</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this cologne to my brother as a gift, and received a fake Ferrari cologne! It rotted (started to stink) in a few weeks! I am surprised that it is sold by AMAZON.COM LLC.....I</li>
            <li> Excellent long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> The knockoff (Indy black) which I got for 5$ is literally just as good and lasts just as long</li>
            <li> Nice smell,however you need about 12 to 15 sprays to keep the aroma on you all day. I would have given this 5 stars,only if they improve on the chemical that would require less sprays.</li>
            <li> Got it for Fathers Day 2013.&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t sure what it would smell like for the price but was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I initially saw this parfum in Miami Beach at Ferrari&#x27;s store. Needless to say, it was expensive. I liked the fragance and the durability and decided to buy it on Amazon. It was 60% off the price and I found out after using it for 1 month that it is a very clean and soft fragance. Recommended for working dads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know weather to trust amazon anymore with perfumes and cologne. I bought nautica twice and they were genuine and smelled great. I ordered this thinking it would be good plus it had so many good reviews. But I got ripped off. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever buy cologne from amazon ever...</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD THIS PRODUCT BEFORE. PAID ALMOST FIFTY DOLLARS IN THE MALL. I OWN ABOUT THIRTY DIFFERENT BRANDS OF COLOGNE AND FERRARI BLACK IS BY FAR IN MY TOP FIVE FAVS!! IM SAYING ITS RIGHT UP THERE WITH MY PRADA, BURBERRY, PERRY ELLIS AND MY VICTORIA SECRET FOR MEN. THIS IS NOT AN EXPENSIVE BRAND AND ON AMAZON I GOT FOR EVEN CHEAPER THAN WHEN I BOUGHT IT FROM THE STORE. FERRARI IS THE MAKER OF SOME OF THE BEST SUPERCARS EVER AND THEY WERE RIGHT ON WHEN THEY DEVELOPED THIS COLOGNE. WHEN I WEAR IT, I GET TONS OF COMPLIMENTS AND MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HAVE THE FERRARI 599 GTO TO GO WITH IT !!!! BUY IT ITS WORTH IT !!</li>
            <li> This is very good spray, you can use it for both formal and casual times. Buying it on Amazon saves some money over the shop counter.</li>
            <li> I live in Brazil and I was happy with the speed that was delivered this product I bought it because I already knew. I will buy other products.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd purchase. i love this perfume. it has very nice, smooth fragrance that lasts a ling time</li>
            <li> Hi Guys,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought GUCCI perfume for $88, I thought it would be good long lasting. But I was not satisfied with it and than I bought this product. Long lasting and very nice flavor. I wear it everyday and I liked it. I can sense it even after 5 - 6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it, and rate it better than GUCCI perfumes.</li>
            <li> MUY BUENA LA COMPRA EN BUEN ESTADO LA MERCANCIA Y A TIEMPO LA ENTREGA. RECOMIENDO ESTE VENDEDOR PARA REALIZAR CUALQUIER COMPRA. ES CONFIABLE.</li>
            <li> I have gotten numerous compliments on this eau de toilette.  It has a light, almost woodsy smell.  Reminds me of a laid back saturday at the country club or something.  Classy yet sporting.</li>
            <li> Good product and good shipping time. Amazon made me to get the product in very less time.    The quality of the product is also good.</li>
            <li> dar para portuguêsVery good perfume more did not come q I ordered was the limited edition came the other more common ta worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ferrari fan since college days, value of money when it comes to perfume.    very satisfied w/product, packaging &amp; shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> my husband just love this cologne and i think the price its great cmpare to what i have seen in stores, it truly smells great.....shipping was also fast.</li>
            <li> it smells good n all but the fragrance does not last long may be 3 to 4 hrs .. so its better to use it to a party or a dinner but not to work.. since it does not last long you end up spraying yourself more n emptying the stuff quickly.</li>
            <li> Although the design/bottle are cool, I am not a huge fan of the smell of this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is quite strong and I could describe it as a little feminine. To me it smells more like perfume than cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After saying that, it still isn&#x27;t that bad and I will most likely wear it on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent product.</li>
            <li> I bought this without smelling it first, but based on the great reviews and reasonable price... well the smell is overwhelmingly sweet, and not even the good sweet, hard to describe... the bottle and colors and the ferrari all gave the impression of a masculine scent ...so i was taken back after the first spray of how unexpected the scent is... this one is not for me...and as with all perfumes/colognes, what works for one doesn&#x27;t necessarily work for others...so i recommend trying it on first.</li>
            <li> its the second time am buying ferrari black.i just love the fragrance.will buy again.thank you amazon.i am very happy i have it again</li>
            <li> Smells great! Awesome price.</li>
            <li> I GOT IT AS A GIFT FOR MY FRIEND SON HE LOVED IT HAPPY I FOUND IT FOR HIM PLUS IT WAS CHEAP...LOL</li>
            <li> Great perfume yet the scent doesn last long. Satisfied overall i would like to re commend this perfume to y all</li>
            <li> when i open it the cologne was actually all over the packaging it was all messy and when i open it my hands smell all day also the smell is not that great.</li>
            <li> smells good...got it for a good price...would recommend if you get it for a reasonable amount</li>
            <li> Wow this cologne is by far the best that ive ever bought. It smells amazing. The girls are constantly complimenting me on how good i smell. Buy it its amazing!</li>
            <li> thank you very much 100% recommended</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cologne that would smell great. This cologne not only smells great but it lasts for about 6-8 hours. Also it&#x27;s really great for a price of about 20 dollars</li>
            <li> Good perfume for casual wear. I personally found the prior range of ferrari perfumes better. The perfume seems to give a little too bold fragrance when you just spray it on... however it subsidies pretty soon.    Do not buy this perfume if you are looking for something to spray on for a Friday or Saturday night.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS ON MY GRANDSONS CHRISTMAS LIST AND HE WAS THRILLED WITH IT.  I PERSONALLY THOUGHT THE FRAGRANCE WAS QUITE NICE.</li>
            <li> I used a friend&#x27;s and loved the smell, I had no doubt on the purchase,  my girlfriend loved the smell. I recommend.</li>
            <li> cheap knock off, doesn&#x27;t smell like the legit stuff, don&#x27;t buy it trust me.  This cheap knock off also sprays in a stream instead of a spray, awful awful product...</li>
            <li> Have been using it since 3 years now and still love it.&lt;br /&gt;It stays for long and always smells fresh. Sometimes, It stays in my clothes for days. My wardrobe smells of it. haha&lt;br /&gt;Its a no brainer! Go for it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good toilette spray, like it I will buy another one or another product like this in the future</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it, the scent is very sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Was amazing, excellent and extraordinary. Please do go for this product. It&#x27;s of high class fragrance. Very smooth and elegant fragrance.</li>
            <li> As with any cologne, you should probably smell it in person before buying online. Considering the cost of this at the Ferrari store, this is quite the bargain. The cologne holds up for quite a while throughout the day... I guess it depends on how much you sweat though... I don&#x27;t... so there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> i bought this perfume from Brazil. The delivery was in a NY hotel. Wonderful scent, this is a Ferrari product.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I loved it, I would not hesitate to recommend the purchase or store or buy it again in this way. Excellent.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money. The colone is full of water and the scent only lasts like one minute. Definitely would not recommend this to anyone. Bad quality!!!!</li>
            <li> is very volatile, the fragrance last one minute on the skin and disappears .. I DONT RECOMMEND, I WOULD SAY THAT IS FAKE.</li>
            <li> Awesome cologne. Real manly. good to have in your dressing closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts long. Smell endures everyday work and is still pretty strong by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Worth the price tag</li>
            <li> its a really distinguished fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t really sweet or really harsh.&lt;br /&gt;its right in between&lt;br /&gt;i wear usually to work but i would not mind wearing it to a date.&lt;br /&gt;its a pretty strong fragrance so 1-2 sprays is enough&lt;br /&gt;the bottle is nice and 4.2 ounces is plenty to last you forever&lt;br /&gt;also the price is hard to beat especially when fragrances in this weight are upwards or 60.&lt;br /&gt;this is a great brand great fragrance i definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> llegó en perfecto estado y rapidisimo!! se recomienda el producto me encanta! excelente proveedor muy buena compra! mejor imposible. &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Bad smell. I really hate it. Money has been waisted ;(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the smell ,very fresh &amp; good for everyday use.It quickly disappear though but if you put it a bit on your clothes it stay longer than in your skin ,otherwise I enjoyed it as well as for the great price!</li>
            <li> My fiance love it is his daily cologne for work plus he is into formula 1 he loves it !</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume before but I can smell and tell that this bottle send to me is fake. Lot of diluted substance and almost no smell. Avoid this seller.</li>
            <li> At first when I applied some Ferrari Black on I was confused because of the strong and different aroma it gave up, it starts as a musk masculine smell ending with a slight sweet and pleasantly distinct smell. I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone wanting a different cologne that has its own unique kick that most people haven&#x27;t really smelled before.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance because it has a light scent. If you&#x27;re the type who doesn&#x27;t like any kind of loud fragrance, then Ferrari Black is the cologne for you !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of different colognes, This one isn&#x27;t bad but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it by itself. I honestly bought it because of the bottle. I wear this as an under tone and it works well for me. I usually us Chanel de Bleu on top.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love it! And so does everyone around me. lol</li>
            <li> Lookin at ferrari, i bought this.. the smell does not last long at all... ok ok...</li>
            <li> Incredible fragance. You can yoused anytime and anywhere.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a little heavier than the Ferrari Red but it still has a great scent. My husband&lt;br /&gt;loved this product.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son, he likes to stink I do not like it but I do not enjoy strong Perfumes</li>
            <li> I was ambivalent about purchasing cologne online but I took a chance and went with all the existing reviews and it worked out well.</li>
            <li> Being a big Ferrari fan and even having driven a Schuderia Ferrari I&#x27;ve never tried their cologne/perfume before. This was the first time I tried this and I just love it...... Its gonna be the one i&#x27;ll be using forever...The previous perfume I used wouldnt last too long or used to have a little feminine scent to it.....Its got a very nice masculine scent and lasts a long time. .....I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments wearing this to work everyday and even outside.&lt;br /&gt;Try it once and you wont stop using it !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FERRARI Rocks !!!</li>
            <li> Not quite as expected</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a long time. Its one of my favorite fragrances. Nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the purchase. I have received many compliments because of this perfume. Since my first purchase I have almost ordered 3-4 times the same brand and will continue to do the same.</li>
            <li> It would have been better if it smelled like new leather interior, burnt rubber, and just a hint of gasoline.  This smells like someone parked the Ferrari and went into the woods to take a walk to find some flowers, bark, and moss.  This does not exude the sexiness of the car, but makes you think you must have rented a Yugo and crashed in the weeds.  Do not buy this off the street because it will probably be cheaper, and it will be fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CA Luster</li>
            <li> smelled good  fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Ferrari Black and get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> i chose this  product  beacuse of a recommendation&lt;br /&gt;i also like the smell but the product i received doesnt smell the way i expected&lt;br /&gt;i dont like it doesnt even last&lt;br /&gt;doesnt seem to be an original  product</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance recommend everyone</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cologne. I saw it in a Ferrari shop in Italy but it was way too expensive. The Amazon price is less thank half of the going price in Europe.</li>
            <li> L O R E C O M I E N D O E L 1 0 0 % PERFECTA LA CAJA</li>
            <li> i got it as a gift and it had broken nozzle, buy it from a store next time. not a good buy</li>
            <li> excelent 100% bueno. las mejores marcas del mercado lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados desde caracas venezuela&lt;br /&gt; recomiendo a toda la comunidad del mundo</li>
            <li> The scent is really nice, the only problem is that goes away too fast.</li>
            <li> This is my daily fragrance, and I just loved it. As well as my gf!</li>
            <li> The scent goes away after 5 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; service</li>
            <li> Awesome and good price!!</li>
            <li> did not get 1 complement and its been a month, smell goes away really fast</li>
            <li> I am giving the cologne 5 stars but i have to give five starts because the one i purchased was a FAKE. I received the item on time but without the box and with the FERRARI sticker coming off. The item does not look anywhere near the description of the picture. The item was not even in the box. THE ITEM I PURCHASED IS A FAKE and i am disgusted to use it. BUY ONLY FROM A REPUTABLE STORE</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a little heavier than the Ferrari Red but it still has a great scent. My husband&lt;br /&gt;loved this product.</li>
            <li> I wanna give zero star. It has absolutely no fragrance even 5 min after spraying. I&#x27;m COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED with this product!!! How can Amazon ship duplicate products?????</li>
            <li> hello, my friend! the product is of excellent quality and complies with all the features exposed by you. I have no complaints whatsoever! Thank you very much and happy day!</li>
            <li> Ferrari black is one of the bests fragrances, I always loved it, and with that stunning price, everything worked perfectly for me!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed and highly recommend. Works perfectly well within the expectations that I had to make the choice to purchase. Whenever you need to buy the product back.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for a friend, its his favorite lotion spray and he likes it. Thank You!&lt;br /&gt;Omar Salinas</li>
            <li> Although it has the name Ferrari, the fragrance is no close to the quality of the car. It&#x27;s okay to just try once, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say I love this perfume, but I surely like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended for casual wear, like the office or hanging out with the guys.</li>
            <li> Muy buen perfume, el tiempo de entrega fue el indicado, llego en lo esperado, buen empaque y llego todo bien empacado</li>
            <li> excellent product not too strong but mild I put on and it lasts all day.I wear it to work and its very pleasant</li>
            <li> Good Choise to this kind of product. I recommended it 100% . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> 100% responsable el perfumes me llego en buen estado volvería con este vendedor aaaaaaaa bb c d n d r</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this cologne because it&#x27;s a fairly cheap one. I have to tell you that it smells AWESOME! I get complemented on it all the time. This is in my top 5 colognes. You won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 years now and it is by far my favorite fragrance!!&lt;br /&gt;A really good deal for the price!!&lt;br /&gt;Since I ordered a new one online I thought I might as well write a  positive review!</li>
            <li> Affordable and yet pretty nice. Strong, and it will stick around for 8 hours, even if you can&#x27;t still smell it. I have a few female friends who really like it. I personally find it a little flat - like one-noted - but it&#x27;s good as long as it isn&#x27;t the only tool in your arsenal. Switch it up and use the Nautica sometimes and you&#x27;ll be happy with it. Don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re older than undergrad age, because it&#x27;s not appropriate then. Just like you stopped using Bod and Axe in high school, and you stopped spraying old spice when you got to college.</li>
            <li> ótimo perfume, cheiro forte mas agradou muito. Dei de presente e a pessoa adorou. Rápida entregta também. Satisfeita, parabéns. Abraço</li>
            <li> It is  a  good perfume to be used on a daily basis  before going anywhere in the morning. That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Gostei da fragancia as mulheres brasileiras adoram esse perfume , chegou a tempo otimo vendedor recomendo vocês vão adorar esse perfume</li>
            <li> I choose it because it was cheap. Anyway I like Ferrari&#x27;s smell. I liked it and I have used it constantly.</li>
            <li> Excellent... smell good... terrific item</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad many times.. he loved this scent! Amazon had great prices on it too. I guess if you&#x27;re a Ferrari fan the car or cologne it&#x27;s a great gift.</li>
            <li> I love this ferrari colone, i&#x27;m thinking about buying a new one.</li>
            <li> all excellent, recommended 100%</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> buena calidad buen regalo de navidad para mi padre. un perfume como para personas mayores es algo fuerte, muy recomendado.</li>
            <li> very good product, i didnt have problem, is importar producto for de people. is complement for me in my life</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of time and money. Practically very little &amp;#34;olfaction&amp;#34; lasting for a very brief time...have serious doubts if this is a genuine product or NOT. Being flammable, it&#x27;s not eligible for return.</li>
            <li> It is for men and am a lady so I couldn&#x27;t say I love it since I have not tried it. But it was shipped in a timely manner</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE SENT FOR YOU IF YOU WANNA FEEL LIKE A CELEBRITY. GREAT PRICE AND GREAT LONG LASTING FRAGRANCE WOMEN LOVE IT. IT PUTS YOU IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES WITH THE LADIES.</li>
            <li> buy this fragrance as a birthday gift to my boyfriend, to the enchantment him and I was happy with the product I knew I had made the correct choice in terms of product, Thanks</li>
            <li> Not too mild.. not too strong. And lasts day long.&lt;br /&gt;Well packed and got the shipment on time. . .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it. As a mom I have to say it is a simple, clean smell .</li>
