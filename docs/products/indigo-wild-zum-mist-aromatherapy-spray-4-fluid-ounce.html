            <li>Smells great, exactly the way I was hoping.</li>
            <li>But just fine and nice as a rooms spray, have not tried it as a body mist yet.  </li>
            <li>I have one bottle at home and one at work which I spray to help set a more calming atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more authentic smell than an overly perfumed \\&quot;fake\\&quot; scent and this delivered.  </li>
            <li>I wish hotels would circulate this instead of the more perfumy &amp;#34;hide a smell&amp;#34; stuff.</li>
            <li>It takes one of two sprays,smells wonderful and last ...</li>
            <li>love love this .... ...</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this mist....</li>
            <li>This is a more &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; scent than most Zum mists.  </li>
            <li>I  DON&#x27;T DETECT ROSEMARY- more eucalyptus smelling...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of both rosemary and mint.</li>
            <li>Smell is okay.</li>
            <li>Bought this to keep at my computer since that&#x27;s where I study the most.</li>
            <li>I was looking for more of a peppermint/spearamint smell rather then a menthol smell, so I was dissapointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the mixture of rosemary and mint.</li>
            <li>I felt it could have used more Rosemary scent as it seemed a bit stronger in the mint smell.  </li>
            <li>I get some more...</li>
            <li>ok?</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice, but it fades fast.  </li>
            <li>Great scent to knock out per odor etc and make a space feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>It is very clean and relaxing smelling.  </li>
            <li>The folks at Indigo Wild really make a great effort to come out with a quality product that smells great without chemicals.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to add to guest linens just to make sure their bedding smells fresh.</li>
            <li>Yes this has a strong refreshing scent of rosemary and mint.</li>
            <li>This is a strong scent that has staying power and it does NOT smell like lysol as one user stated.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something about rosemary coupled with most other herbs that is just beautiful.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the spray as room freshener and will even wear a light spray.</li>
            <li>Product indicated can be worn as a body spray - scent was too light for that.</li>
            <li>I enjoy zum sprays quite a lot...</li>
            <li>Smells so good and masks smells quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>For this reason I have ordered 5-8 bottles since the original review was written.</li>
            <li>the scent is fresh, without being too heavy....use it primarily as an air freshener, rather than a body scent.....</li>
            <li>the lotion has an ok scent, doesn&#x27;t smell much like it says it should.  </li>
            <li>keeps bathroom smelling clean and fresh</li>
            <li>Picked up a little bottle of the Rosemary Mint spray, and wow I was impressed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice mint spray, but with only the tiniest hint of rosemary.</li>
            <li>The nice herbal scent lasted for hours as a room spray, and doubles as a longer lasting body spray.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use for the body at all but is a really fresh smelling energizing room spray.  </li>
            <li>Fresh and natural but strong enough to be effective for pet odors.</li>
            <li>Covers up pet oder very well!  </li>
            <li>bought 3 of them, will definitely buy more when these are gone....</li>
            <li>I dont know if I would use it as a body spray, as it has a weirdly masculine/feminine scent, but it it perfect for yoga.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just enough to &#x27;darken&#x27; the scent a bit, but it is overwhelmingly a mint scent.</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed it, I wasn&#x27;t too fond of it--thought the scent was overpowering and it gave me a headache...</li>
            <li>this one is my definite favorite..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong at first, so make sure you have a little time before guests arrive.  </li>
            <li>The Rosemary Mint Mist is very nice but does not last very long.</li>
            <li>A nice line of natural products overall.</li>
            <li>It certainly smells clean, natural.  </li>
            <li>This smells good, but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>Takes a whole bottle to make a difference.</li>
            <li>VERY GREASY FEELING.</li>
            <li>could anything like this be legal..</li>
            <li>Tends to last a littler more longer when you spray it directly onto something.</li>
            <li>But, as some other reviewers have said, it smells more like Pinesol.</li>
            <li>The spray has a sweet eucalyptus smell very similar to mentholated cough drops or vick&#x27;s vapor rub.</li>
            <li>Some with more or less of the mint/eucalyptus aroma.</li>
            <li>I give it a quick shake and spray generally above my head whenever I need a pick me up.</li>
            <li>The odor is light and delicate but true.  </li>
            <li>I do not think I can live without it.  </li>
            <li>I have been happy using an essential oil spray for men called &amp;#34;invigorate&amp;#34; by blue river and was looking some other essential oil sprays.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicely concentrated and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Where I live the smell of pine and mint comes naturally in the summer.  </li>
            <li>I could just be too spoiled with nature for this to complete.</li>
            <li>their ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>the above was my real review..</li>
            <li>Making a long story short, I use it to repel wasps and it really works for me!  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a half &amp; half rosemary to mint ratio, so for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sprayed it maybe 100 times and it barely looks used.</li>

            <li> One little squirt goes a long way so use very sparingly.</li>
            <li> Only down side is that as soon as you spray it, it evaporates and the scent is completely gone within seconds.</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the smell is a bit light and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a LONG time and the scent lingers a long time as well.  </li>
            <li> Does not linger long at all.</li>
            <li> I am spraying it every two days, but as long as it is working, I&#x27;m a fan because it&#x27;s non-toxic</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as well, I&#x27;ve had some other room sprays that don&#x27;t last nearly so long.  </li>
            <li> and I have this and several other ZUM products.</li>
            <li> Each bottle smells a little bit different.  </li>
            <li> In fact it smells bad and I have not been able to use</li>
            <li> I spray a few times around the room and take a deep breath....</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but since there is an inconsistency with smell of the product and you occasionally waste 10 bucks on a bottle that doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it is supposed too (and can&#x27;t use), I dropped the rating down 2 stars for a total of 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Unlike previous purchase of the Zum Rosemary-Mint.</li>
            <li> lid WASNT tight, leaked out, had to send it back to them in order to recieve another one, it cost extra to send they did not supply postage, like the actual product, disappointed in the company.for no reimbursement..</li>
            <li> A little research</li>
            <li> and it does the trick for a few minutes but then fades away.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the bottle must have been old.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not going to waste.  </li>
            <li> Very little scent.  </li>
            <li> but something has changed about these products and im not sure what it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to repel nasty bugs-ys with these scents come summer time, precious.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at the store, but ordered it online cause</li>
            <li> Rosemary smell stimulated my brain enought to bring back painful childhood memories I had spent years trying to supress!!</li>
            <li> Although expensive, this stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was unable to smell rosemary or mint in the spray.</li>
            <li> I hate to be so negative</li>
            <li> Obsessed with the smell!</li>
            <li> a joke, here is what my bad review would say...</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great, exactly the way I was hoping. I have one bottle at home and one at work which I spray to help set a more calming atmosphere. Only down side is that as soon as you spray it, it evaporates and the scent is completely gone within seconds. I just wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> This smells good, but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long. I bought it to spray on a neck pillow that heats in the microwave and it does the trick for a few minutes but then fades away. I&#x27;ve tried it as a room spray and detect no scent at all and as a pillow mist it works for about an hour. It would be nice to add to guest linens just to make sure their bedding smells fresh.</li>
            <li> Way over priced for the amount of essential oil vs water</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Smells so good and masks smells quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> This scent will cover anything. Dogs, Men and everything that goes with having one of these odor generators.</li>
            <li> This mist is WONDERFUL---been using it for years now.  I sure hope ZUM never stops making it!  Lasts a LONG time and the scent lingers a long time as well.  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Covers up pet oder very well!  We have two dogs and since we started using this stuff you can&#x27;t immediate smell them when you walk in!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more authentic smell than an overly perfumed \\&quot;fake\\&quot; scent and this delivered.  The odor is light and delicate but true.  There&#x27;s something about rosemary coupled with most other herbs that is just beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love them all but this is my favorite Zum Spray!</li>
            <li> Well I keep buying it and I just bought 6 more!!  The freshest way to breathe life into an air conditioned room.  I do not think I can live without it.  I have to stop giving it away though!</li>
            <li> Lovely...not chemical!  For people who don&#x27;t want to be strangled by a chemical smell in order to freshen the air but still want a definitive smell.  Really nice.  I wish hotels would circulate this instead of the more perfumy &amp;#34;hide a smell&amp;#34; stuff.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this wonderful spray at a restaurant restroom and had to have it! A little research and I have this and several other ZUM products. Great company too!</li>
            <li> It takes one of two sprays,smells wonderful and last ... love love this .... ...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the bottle must have been old. The scent is chemical! Unlike previous purchase of the Zum Rosemary-Mint. The sku number was &#x27;blacked&#x27; out. Will not purchase from vendor again.</li>
            <li> Fresh and natural but strong enough to be effective for pet odors.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this mist....the scent is fresh, without being too heavy....use it primarily as an air freshener, rather than a body scent.....bought 3 of them, will definitely buy more when these are gone....Gemma</li>
            <li> Although expensive, this stuff WORKS. Throw out all of your artificial bathroom sprays -- only a few squirts of this will have the room smelling great for hours.</li>
            <li> Very little scent.  Takes a whole bottle to make a difference.</li>
            <li> the lotion has an ok scent, doesn&#x27;t smell much like it says it should.  VERY GREASY FEELING. would not buy or recommend.</li>
            <li> Where I live the smell of pine and mint comes naturally in the summer.  I had hoped to use this product off season and in my car to keep things nice.  Unfortunately, the smell is a bit light and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  It&#x27;s still pleasant.  I could just be too spoiled with nature for this to complete.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice, but it fades fast.  I use it as a pillow spray.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and delightful are the two words that describe this the best. What a wonderful smell to invade your nostrils.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT SMELL LIKE ROSEMARY. and leaked everywhere</li>
            <li> This is a more &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; scent than most Zum mists.  I  DON&#x27;T DETECT ROSEMARY- more eucalyptus smelling...kind of like VICKS.  Not so good as a body spray, but fine for a room spray. A nice line of natural products overall.</li>
            <li> We spritz this on a folded towel and do our evening yoga.  It is very clean and relaxing smelling.  It lasts a long time as well, I&#x27;ve had some other room sprays that don&#x27;t last nearly so long.  I dont know if I would use it as a body spray, as it has a weirdly masculine/feminine scent, but it it perfect for yoga.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice mint spray, but with only the tiniest hint of rosemary. It&#x27;s just enough to &#x27;darken&#x27; the scent a bit, but it is overwhelmingly a mint scent. I was hoping for more of a half &amp; half rosemary to mint ratio, so for me it&#x27;s just okay.  I&#x27;ll probably try adding a couple of drops of essential oils to the bottle to customize it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Spray on pillows before bed and it&#x27;s so relaxing. Love this brand - everything they make is great quality and their ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed. I love the smell of both rosemary and mint. But, as some other reviewers have said, it smells more like Pinesol. Maybe it&#x27;s a good thing that the smell fades very quickly after it dries. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Delivered one day later. Smell is okay.</li>
            <li> The folks at Indigo Wild really make a great effort to come out with a quality product that smells great without chemicals.</li>
            <li> Bought this to keep at my computer since that&#x27;s where I study the most. I needed something to wake me up and keep me focused. Smells great. I give it a quick shake and spray generally above my head whenever I need a pick me up. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> keeps bathroom smelling clean and fresh</li>
            <li> Was opened!! lid WASNT tight, leaked out, had to send it back to them in order to recieve another one, it cost extra to send they did not supply postage, like the actual product, disappointed in the company.for no reimbursement..</li>
            <li> Picked up a little bottle of the Rosemary Mint spray, and wow I was impressed.  It&#x27;s nicely concentrated and a little bit goes a long way.  The nice herbal scent lasted for hours as a room spray, and doubles as a longer lasting body spray.</li>
            <li> Not a pleasurable scent at all.  Very strong &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; aroma.  Hoping Zum comes out with Fir and Peppermint again for the holidays. This was the scent I wanted to order.</li>
            <li> The Rosemary Mint Mist is very nice but does not last very long. In fact, it may last every bit of 30 seconds. Tends to last a littler more longer when you spray it directly onto something.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an alternative to the axe type body sprays. I have been happy using an essential oil spray for men called &amp;#34;invigorate&amp;#34; by blue river and was looking some other essential oil sprays.  I ordered the zum mist rosemary/mint since I like the smell of mint.  Unfortunately I was unable to smell rosemary or mint in the spray. The spray has a sweet eucalyptus smell very similar to mentholated cough drops or vick&#x27;s vapor rub. I was looking for more of a peppermint/spearamint smell rather then a menthol smell, so I was dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray arrived very quickly and the bottle/label seemed like good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/27/16 - The smell has grown on me over time. I enjoy the spray as room freshener and will even wear a light spray. People have complimented on the smell. For this reason I have ordered 5-8 bottles since the original review was written. My only problem is the consistency of the smell. Each bottle smells a little bit different.  Some with more or less of the mint/eucalyptus aroma. The last bottle I just received about a week ago has no mint/eucalyptus aroma at all. In fact it smells bad and I have not been able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the aroma has grown on me and I have been using the product, I changed my star rating as well as title description. I would have given it 5 stars, but since there is an inconsistency with smell of the product and you occasionally waste 10 bucks on a bottle that doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it is supposed too (and can&#x27;t use), I dropped the rating down 2 stars for a total of 3 stars. If quality control improves I will increase the rating to 5 stars. As of now, I am out money from my last bottle.</li>
            <li> This is one of our favorites from the Zuma Mist line. Our family loves the hearty rosemary scent that is tapered by the fresh-smelling mint. One little squirt goes a long way so use very sparingly. This is a strong scent that has staying power and it does NOT smell like lysol as one user stated. Lysol is PINE scented not mint or rosemary.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with the smell!</li>
            <li> I hate to be so negative but something has changed about these products and im not sure what it is. I wanted the lavender spray in the silver bottle but I didn&#x27;t see it advertised so i tried this. It doesn&#x27;t smell like rosemary and mint to me but it does last quite a while,</li>
            <li> Yes this has a strong refreshing scent of rosemary and mint. I like it. I wish the scent would last longer than several seconds though.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and helps me stay awake at work. Seems like it&#x27;s going to last a long time. I&#x27;ve sprayed it maybe 100 times and it barely looks used.</li>
            <li> Great scent to knock out per odor etc and make a space feel fresh and clean.  It&#x27;s a bit strong at first, so make sure you have a little time before guests arrive.  It does dissipate nicely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use for the body at all but is a really fresh smelling energizing room spray.  I spray a few times around the room and take a deep breath....ahhhh.  I love the mixture of rosemary and mint.</li>
            <li> It certainly smells clean, natural.  I felt it could have used more Rosemary scent as it seemed a bit stronger in the mint smell.  But just fine and nice as a rooms spray, have not tried it as a body mist yet.  Does not linger long at all.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell for a room freshener.  Product indicated can be worn as a body spray - scent was too light for that.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking I&#x27;d use it as a room freshener.  When I first sprayed it, I wasn&#x27;t too fond of it--thought the scent was overpowering and it gave me a headache...Making a long story short, I use it to repel wasps and it really works for me!  I also spray it around the baseboards of my home to ward off insects.  I saw a couple of insects in my bathroom and I sprayed this around the baseboards and I haven&#x27;t seen any since.  I am spraying it every two days, but as long as it is working, I&#x27;m a fan because it&#x27;s non-toxic and I feel good about spraying this in my home.  And it&#x27;s not going to waste.  As for the scent, needless to say, I&#x27;ve gotten mostly used to it now.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Packs a punch so use sparingly. I&#x27;m hoping to repel nasty bugs-ys with these scents come summer time, precious.</li>
            <li> I use the spray and the body oil...constantly...I run out of the spray..I get some more...I have always loved rosemary smell...i have always loved mint smell,,together they are dynamic duo of refreshment...wish it was stronder and would linger longer...I enjoy zum sprays quite a lot...this one is my definite favorite..I usually buy it at the store, but ordered it online cause the store I go to would never seem to have it in stock..i wonder why?...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a joke, here is what my bad review would say...IT BURNS...my girlfriend sprayed some at me and I felt as tho I had been maced...Rosemary smell stimulated my brain enought to bring back painful childhood memories I had spent years trying to supress!! Mint must be in the poison ivy family or something!!How could anything like this be legal..that is my \\&quot;joke review\\&quot;...the above was my real review..ok? ok!</li>
