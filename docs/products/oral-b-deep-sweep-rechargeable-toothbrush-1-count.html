            <li>I LOVE MY SONIC BRUSH</li>
            <li>but I always knew if someone would come up with a brush with this motion would be better</li>
            <li>This tooth brush is okay.  </li>
            <li>Really!!!!</li>
            <li>I feel very clean of my teeth, and so does my friends.</li>
            <li>Quality rechargeable toothbrush at a great price  much better than the 10 yr old one it replaced.  </li>
            <li>very good price and quality, but package is much larger than I thought</li>
            <li>I like the two-part bristle-head with a tip that makes it easy to get into the space between the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>This comes with easy charging mount .</li>
            <li>A little noisy but does a wonderful job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel just as clean as when my dentist cleans them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on day 4 with a full charge</li>
            <li>Packing strong and fit, the high cost of suit!</li>
            <li>just because something is great doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t something better out there.</li>
            <li>IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ALL THESE YEARS!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right off the bat, after the first brush, I was amazed at how thoroughly clean my teeth</li>
            <li>Brushing my teeth with the Deep Sweep feels AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I RARELY write reviews on anything I buy on amazon</li>
            <li>I have gotten pretty much every toothbrush from the oral b replacable battery operated toothbrushes from $13 to the sonic replaceable battery ones that are $50 and the sonic toothbrushes over $100 (which were by far my favorite).</li>
            <li>This is my first automatic tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up the entire counter top even when it&#x27;s on the charging pad.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the brush heads on this product not being as soft as I would like; however using the toothbrush on the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; setting works just fine, and the extra long bristles at the tip do a wonderful job of getting deeply between teeth.  </li>
            <li>This package is very attractive, but the charger is 110V, and is not suitable for Chinese use.</li>
            <li>My results have been nothing short of amazing, IMHO, compared to a manual brush and even my old Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited for their next check up to see how their teeth are looking.the brush doesn&#x27;t sound any different</li>
            <li>then any other electric toothbrush.the only thing I will say is make sure you put the tooth brush in your mouth before turning it on and make sure you turn it off each time you need to spit in the sink it does splatter the toothpaste if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Since I really don&#x27;t need all of the extras that the 5000 model provides, I went for this.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>This seems to meet my needs very well.</li>
            <li>Very compact.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sonic was finally ready to be put to rest.</li>
            <li>It beeps every 30 seconds to let you know to switch quadrants (45 seconds on deep clean mode)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Pretty aggressive action.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I bought this for my children who of course don&#x27;t do that Great of a job brushing their teeth (my 5yr old also had a medical condition that his destroying his teeth)</li>
            <li>cause it was rechargeable and reviews said that it could last 10 days with a full charge ( I have yet to test that).</li>
            <li>I have peridontal disease, particularly with a couple of areas that have &amp;#34;6&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>You can use your older type Oral B toothbrush heads with this.</li>
            <li>Not happy with deep brush, it doesnt clean as good as sonicare.</li>
            <li>I would highly highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Let me get this straight, I pay over a $100.00 buck for you inferior product and then can pay to ship the broke product back to you while you fix what should have worked in the first place.  </li>
            <li>The motion of the deep sweep is actually too strong for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is also a very loud toothbrush.</li>
            <li>teeth have never felt this clean and this model is cheaper than some of the other brands but works like a dream.</li>
            <li>I like different brushing modes and a sensor that warns me if I put too much pressure on my teeth while brushing.</li>
            <li>After five days with the Deep Sweep 4000 though, I flossed and had absolutely ZERO blood.  </li>
            <li>I preferred the Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li>There is a flashing red indicator that lets you know if you are using too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still early trust me</li>
            <li>Only downside is they don&#x27;t past beyond 2-3 years as the battery does too many cycles.</li>
            <li>On this fifth day, I flossed for the first time in month, an event that usually met with bleeding gums left and right.  </li>
            <li>It has 4 brush settings all you need though are 2, the regular setting that is the default and the sensitive one if you have sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>The brush movement is EXACTLY what they teach you to do at the dentist with a regular brush...up and down..up and down and repeat or circle circle circle..</li>
            <li>The other style brushes still work if you don&#x27;t like the new brush head.</li>

            <li> your brush is going up and down but at the same time when you move back and forth it naturally makes circles too.</li>
            <li> I have had very little in the way of bleeding, and my mouth feels much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> When we went to use them for the very first time one of the tooth brushes were broken.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time also.</li>
            <li> I do wish it displayed the total brushing time and battery charge levels like my previous model did, but even without those features</li>
            <li> ; which is not to say that when I do it, I&#x27;m bad at it, but more so that I don&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li> The batteries last a long time (about 10 days when used twice a day), I can use the toothbrush heads I already had, and it lets me know when I&#x27;m brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Those other settings I&#x27;m not even going to mention</li>
            <li> I have been using this tooth brush for about a week and can already tell the difference compared to my previous, manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> they are 5 and 7.with in a day and a half of using (3 brushes)</li>
            <li> Travels well, comes with a little</li>
            <li> They informed me that I had to pay to ship the brushes back to them and they would replace the broken part.</li>
            <li> Have used everyday since receiving and cleans and polishes teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I usually buy a couple things a month, but this warranted a review.</li>
            <li> I found this extremely customer unfriendly and inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> And lastly if you don&#x27;t like this brush head for some CRAZY reason you can replace it with just about any oral b replacable head( OPTIONS! ).</li>
            <li> Now addicted to teeth that feel like I just came from the a Dentist Cleaning!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> and then I ran into this bad boy.</li>
            <li> cause they are just gimmicks to raise the price of the brush :(.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This 2 pack represents one of the best deals on the internet.  Even Walmart doesn&#x27;t sell this item as cheaply (one costs $85, and this two-pack is about $110)!  Since I really don&#x27;t need all of the extras that the 5000 model provides, I went for this.  I have peridontal disease, particularly with a couple of areas that have &amp;#34;6&amp;#34; size gaps.  Since changing to a power toothbrush, Closys toothpaste and mouthrinse I have had very little in the way of bleeding, and my mouth feels much cleaner.  I was worried about the brush heads on this product not being as soft as I would like; however using the toothbrush on the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; setting works just fine, and the extra long bristles at the tip do a wonderful job of getting deeply between teeth.  I am hoping that my upcoming 3 mo checkup will have my dentist agreeing with me--I don&#x27;t want to do teeth planing/scaling!  Will update then.</li>
            <li> A gift for our daughter and her husband, they love it.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order this product because their customer service it horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tooth brushes were delivered.  Following the package directed I charged them for 24 hours.  When we went to use them for the very first time one of the tooth brushes were broken.  I contacted oral B customer service at 800-566-7252 and spoke to their customer service department.  They informed me that I had to pay to ship the brushes back to them and they would replace the broken part. I found this extremely customer unfriendly and inconvenient.  Let me get this straight, I pay over a $100.00 buck for you inferior product and then can pay to ship the broke product back to you while you fix what should have worked in the first place.  Really!!!!</li>
            <li> Now addicted to teeth that feel like I just came from the a Dentist Cleaning!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order it from Amazon but it is the best damn Toothbrush that I have come across in years. It feels like I came back from a dentist every time! I love it! I would highly highly recommend it to anyone. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Quality rechargeable toothbrush at a great price  much better than the 10 yr old one it replaced.  Have used everyday since receiving and cleans and polishes teeth.  Received in short time with packaging  undamaged.</li>
            <li> Very good toothbrush, i love to brush my teeth every day now! I feel very clean of my teeth, and so does my friends.</li>
            <li> This is my first automatic tooth brush. I bought it upon recommendation from my dentist and I love it. I have been using this tooth brush for about a week and can already tell the difference compared to my previous, manual tooth brush. My teeth feel just as clean as when my dentist cleans them. I like different brushing modes and a sensor that warns me if I put too much pressure on my teeth while brushing. I did a lot of research online prior to buying this product and Braun looks like a reliable brand with lower cost for brush heads.</li>
            <li> Great price!! We love them!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush.  Just wish the charge lasted longer</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for my Oral B Triumph and I really like it. The batteries last a long time (about 10 days when used twice a day), I can use the toothbrush heads I already had, and it lets me know when I&#x27;m brushing too hard. I do wish it displayed the total brushing time and battery charge levels like my previous model did, but even without those features I&#x27;d still recommend it.</li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth with the Deep Sweep feels AMAZING. Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> After doing an extensive amount of research, I went ahead and purchased a Groupon for this product.  My results have been nothing short of amazing, IMHO, compared to a manual brush and even my old Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right off the bat, after the first brush, I was amazed at how thoroughly clean my teeth felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the third day, I could tell that my teeth were noticeably whiter, using just the default brushing setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the fifth day, the most amazing thing happened.  I am what you would call a &amp;#34;terrible flosser,&amp;#34; which is not to say that when I do it, I&#x27;m bad at it, but more so that I don&#x27;t do it.  I go months between flossing stints and they last a couple days to a week before I then stop and go months again without.  On this fifth day, I flossed for the first time in month, an event that usually met with bleeding gums left and right.  After five days with the Deep Sweep 4000 though, I flossed and had absolutely ZERO blood.  None.  Second day, same thing.  Freakin&#x27; blew my mind!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in short.  The noticeable effects of using this toothbrush have well exceeded my expectations and done so in an incredibly short period of time.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A very nice electronic toothbrush with a strong motor and nice bristles. I like the two-part bristle-head with a tip that makes it easy to get into the space between the teeth and gums. This seems to meet my needs very well.</li>
            <li> arrived as promised. The brush is noisy though</li>
            <li> Comes with only one brush head.  Pretty aggressive action.  I preferred the Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my children who of course don&#x27;t do that Great of a job brushing their teeth (my 5yr old also had a medical condition that his destroying his teeth) they are 5 and 7.with in a day and a half of using (3 brushes) I have noticed such a big difference in how their teeth look.and my kids love the tooth brushes.I&#x27;m very excited for their next check up to see how their teeth are looking.the brush doesn&#x27;t sound any different then any other electric toothbrush.the only thing I will say is make sure you put the tooth brush in your mouth before turning it on and make sure you turn it off each time you need to spit in the sink it does splatter the toothpaste if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Really great toothbrush! A little noisy but does a wonderful job cleaning my teeth. You can use your older type Oral B toothbrush heads with this. Comes with a travel kit to use when taking a trip. The charge lasts a long time also. All-in-all this is a very good battery toothbrush. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great value pack with 2 power brushes.  This comes with easy charging mount . The other style brushes still work if you don&#x27;t like the new brush head. Only downside is they don&#x27;t past beyond 2-3 years as the battery does too many cycles. My dentist has never found issues with my teeth since I used this!</li>
            <li> Nice and arrived in time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years. It was recommended by my dentist and it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li> Okay, this toothbrush literally changed my life. Went from a regular brush to this at the recommendation of my hygienist (she specifically said to get this model) and I LOVE ITTTT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This has several modes that you can change at the push of a button, even mid-brush.&lt;br /&gt;2) It beeps every 30 seconds to let you know to switch quadrants (45 seconds on deep clean mode)&lt;br /&gt;3) There is a flashing red indicator that lets you know if you are using too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;4) It doesn&#x27;t take up the entire counter top even when it&#x27;s on the charging pad. Very compact.&lt;br /&gt;5) Keeps a charge for days. I&#x27;m on day 4 with a full charge and I brush 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;6) Travels well, comes with a little case.&lt;br /&gt;7) It&#x27;s kind of noisy but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have never felt this clean and this model is cheaper than some of the other brands but works like a dream. Do yourself the favor.</li>
            <li> I RARELY write reviews on anything I buy on amazon and I usually buy a couple things a month, but this warranted a review. I have gotten pretty much every toothbrush from the oral b replacable battery operated toothbrushes from $13 to the sonic replaceable battery ones that are $50 and the sonic toothbrushes over $100 (which were by far my favorite). I have used my sonic for over 5 years with great dental visit outcomes. My sonic was finally ready to be put to rest. So I started researching and reading and then I ran into this bad boy. I&#x27;d made sense cause it was rechargeable and reviews said that it could last 10 days with a full charge ( I have yet to test that). The brush movement is EXACTLY what they teach you to do at the dentist with a regular brush...up and down..up and down and repeat or circle circle circle..IT DOES BOTH! It has 4 brush settings all you need though are 2, the regular setting that is the default and the sensitive one if you have sensitive teeth and gums. Those other settings I&#x27;m not even going to mention cause they are just gimmicks to raise the price of the brush :(. And it has a sensor that flashes red if you press to Hard(for people like my wife that have tendency to do that). And lastly if you don&#x27;t like this brush head for some CRAZY reason you can replace it with just about any oral b replacable head( OPTIONS! ). THIS TOOTHBRUSH ROCKS!!!!!!  After it charged for about 24 hours I used it and  IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ALL THESE YEARS! don&#x27;t get me wrong I LOVE MY SONIC BRUSH IT HAS BEEN GREAT, but just because something is great doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t something better out there. My teeth were noticeable cleaner after the third time of using it ( which was impressive since I read that it takes about 5 days to break in the brush). I like sonic tech ALOT but I always knew if someone would come up with a brush with this motion would be better your brush is going up and down but at the same time when you move back and forth it naturally makes circles too. IT IS THE PERFECT TOOTH BRUSH! Ok..now I have only had this for 7 days and it&#x27;s still early trust me if things change...so will this review. Ohh and the only reason I dropped a star was because the description said you receive 2 refill heads. YOU DO NOT GET 2 REFILL HEADS. You get the 1 head that comes with each toothbrush. The word &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; was a sneaky way to mislead us and I don&#x27;t appreciate that. I hope this helped you.</li>
            <li> Thank Amazon. This package is very attractive, but the charger is 110V, and is not suitable for Chinese use. Packing strong and fit, the high cost of suit!</li>
            <li> Love them! thank you!</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is okay.  A lot of hype.  The motion of the deep sweep is actually too strong for my teeth.  It is also a very loud toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not happy with deep brush, it doesnt clean as good as sonicare. I was looking for sonicare which dies every year in my case and now understand why sonicare has managed to stay more expensive.</li>
            <li> very good price and quality, but package is much larger than I thought</li>
