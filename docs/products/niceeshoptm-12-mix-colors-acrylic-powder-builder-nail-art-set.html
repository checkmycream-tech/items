            <li>They are so cheap too!</li>
            <li>I got these for my daughter and she was thrilled at the pretty colors!!</li>
            <li>Pretty good product :)</li>
            <li>It also got lost,so after more than 2 1/2 month it has reach.i didn&#x27;t complain to the company the second time because they were very good and understanding.having</li>
            <li>Love the colors and how easy they are to use.</li>
            <li>Very cheap powder that is why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>Yes I did receive all 12 and they were very full..</li>
            <li>The colors are brilliant and you can mix them easily,I&#x27;ve made brown color out of the green,yellow and blue colors!</li>
            <li>:) I am pretty sure I&#x27;ll be getting more soon :)</li>
            <li>This was old at a great price.</li>
            <li>Obviously these aren&#x27;t going to be top quality for the price you pay, but the colors are great.</li>
            <li>went on easily.</li>
            <li>Strong colors.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colours, smaller than I expect (as I did not check the dimensions)</li>
            <li>It have a pretty great colour and shipped fast</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun and easy to use I love doing all types of designs I enjoy using this</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a huge amount of each powder, however for the price it is what i would expect.</li>
            <li>i only use it in molds and it works great.</li>
            <li>The price was really cheap</li>
            <li>For the amount of acrylic you received it was a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>but I think these acrylics are worth the time and money :) I&#x27;ve been using them to create premade flowers, leaves, and bows.</li>
            <li>OMG the colors are so cute and colorful</li>
            <li>i mix these with acrylic powder and use a very small amount if these color acrylics and make some awesome colors and have enought to do more than one set...........</li>
            <li>The colors are extremely vibrant and adorable :)</li>
            <li>But not too much, I can clean it very easy.</li>
            <li>so rich they are going to make some</li>
            <li>but honestly you can get maybe one set out if each container even mixing it with clear because there Just isn&#x27;t enough product in the containers to give you a great color payoff.</li>
            <li>some of the colors were pretty cute.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I wanted &amp; I love the colors...</li>
            <li>I mixed them with Ezflow clear acrylic powder and they are just wonderful!</li>
            <li>I said worth the price because of the small containers,but these is a real good quality acrylic powder!</li>
            <li>Pleased and ready to use on my nails.  </li>
            <li>it is just makes my nail look cool</li>
            <li>you would think that you would get a full container..</li>
            <li>I will be buying more here very soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest that next time this is sent to package it good.</li>
            <li>and it was a good solid color not see through it</li>
            <li>Did you expect it to be full size tubs of powder?</li>
            <li>(I couldn&#x27;t get a good smile line with these like I do with my white powder)</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick, packaged well, will buy from again.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward  to using them more soon, and getting a little more creative.  </li>
            <li>I love these colors, they work amazing, some are dark</li>
            <li>love the product and the price is great but delivery was not good</li>
            <li>I love all the different colors and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They come out great with my regular clear acrylic powder.</li>
            <li>Such nice colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tested these yet, but I am looking forward to the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You mix these with clear acrylic to make more.</li>
            <li>Glad that it arrived early though.</li>
            <li>Overall happy, and it was delivered early.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting my own nail business.</li>
            <li>and I bought this same set, already knowing that I was going to use these to mix my own acrylic colors</li>
            <li>This powder does not go on right.  </li>
            <li>I gave them two stars instead of one because I don&#x27;t know if I was using them right.  </li>
            <li>this not to mention the containers arent filled with a good amount i realize the containers are small</li>
            <li>It comes a little bit but it works for the price and they are nice for make flowers or bows!</li>
            <li>When I got it I was very happy to se that there are a wide selection of colors, and yes, there are a few that are light</li>
            <li>I purchased these because i like the colors, like everybody says the amount is not that great, enough for me though because is just for personal use, and  </li>
            <li>Took a little longer than I had hoped for but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>am a beginner at nail art, and this is one of my first tools to build my kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the colors are super vibrant and ppretty.</li>
            <li>But I did only get one use out of it, I don&#x27;t know if it was my liquid or just me:)</li>
            <li>but for 3 dollars i cant really complain!</li>
            <li>but since they are so pigmented  you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li>First off I buy this product thinking it&#x27;s going to look like the picture I got it</li>
            <li>They need bigger containers to put more powder in.</li>
            <li>The colors where great but containers were very, very, small.</li>
            <li>, shipping was fast and they are exactly as described in the description.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re not bad, you could mix them with clear acrylic or add a 3d design to your nails.</li>
            <li>But when it did completely dried the colors can our bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li>but when you order something with a standard shipping speed like this with no option to pay more for a better one-be careful!</li>
            <li>Easy enough to work with.  </li>
            <li>Better suited for details and short tips instead of a full nail cover, unless you want each nail a different color.</li>
            <li>They are just for my personal use, but the quality is fine with me.</li>
            <li>These are really pretty vibrant colored power .</li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant and pretty..</li>
            <li>What I really like about</li>
            <li>Very diasappointed, would not recommend..</li>
            <li>let alone my whole hand or even two hands</li>
            <li>doesnt work as real acrylic</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the packaging much though but</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying this set is very inexpensive</li>
            <li>just wut my girlfriend wanted , she loves the colors and fast service from Asia..</li>
            <li>Very upset about the packaging.</li>
            <li>The thing I was upset with the most was the fact that some of the containers were practically empty like I couldnt do one tip with some of the colors if I wanted to.</li>
            <li>It may not seem like much</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>I do not know how to work with them, but my friend promised to come to my show, I really like the color.</li>
            <li>Do you know how much quality polymer powder costs?</li>
            <li>when using this product, it can be mixed with clear acrylic powder and you can get more out of it.  </li>
            <li>I will mix them with with clear or white to get more out of them</li>
            <li>they come in a cute little package and they are small but very cute</li>
            <li>They came very quickly which was a big surprised because i was not expecting them for three to four weeks</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you only use very little mixed with clear and the color is still really bright.</li>
            <li>The purple looks very light but is actually super dark almost looked blue.</li>
            <li>I did add clear to stretch the product because it is very concentrated!</li>
            <li>The containers are tiny and they weren&#x27;t even halfway full..</li>
            <li>This has a good variety and though each pot of powder is pretty small, it is enough to experiment with.</li>
            <li>Little light and is very small amounts but give a very nice color.</li>
            <li>the colors were vibrant</li>
            <li>Only a few of the containers had a good amont of product but  </li>
            <li>, i liked how the pink look as a french tip.</li>
            <li>The colors are great and vibrant - it came with two blacks, two pinks, one white, and a variety of blue, green, purple, etc.</li>
            <li>, overall worth it</li>
            <li>sure to get some clear or white acrylic powder to mix these with, or you won&#x27;t have enough to finish your nails!</li>
            <li>Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
            <li>My packaged came intact and the little jars were all very full.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or the product, but it seems to dry very fast and won&#x27;t leave you much time to work on it</li>
            <li>Not enough but pretty colors</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this works well with my Absolute and my CND Retention+ systems for creating fun designs, 3D shapes, or just adding a pop of color to a basic French tip!</li>
            <li>The people wrining reviews saying there&#x27;s not enough powder to do a full set obviously don&#x27;t know how to do nails.</li>
            <li>I started with the pink which is a very pretty color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not acrylic builder, it&#x27;s pigment to add to clear acrylic</li>
            <li>Would not stick and when applied with clear polish, messed up the fuzzy material.</li>
            <li>To many that complained about the amount you get, you are suppose to mix it with clear acrylic.</li>
            <li>(use the colored acrylic for the \\&quot;tip\\&quot; not the entire nail so that you do not use up the whole container).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised this made it to my house.</li>
            <li>then the powder is half way full</li>
            <li>The jars are very small, but it was totally cheap!</li>
            <li>The nails still come out solid and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Such tiny amounts, good for little wet work</li>
            <li>like I said the others were pretty much empty</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to do a set with the hot pink.</li>
            <li>So when I received the product I was quite surprised at how small the containers were, but the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Works well but the only problem is the containers some had more than some  in them and the containers are very small.</li>
            <li>used the Pink and Black colors already, they worked fine.</li>
            <li>Mix the colors with white or clear acrylic and it achieves the desired color.</li>
            <li>The containers are very small and hardly full, but, you have to mix these with clear acrylic in order for it to work.</li>
            <li>but I just add a little white in and it tones them down :)</li>
            <li>the color and dont clip away so fast as other acrylic</li>
            <li>These polymer powders are not meant to be used alone, they are \\&quot;additives\\&quot; that are to be mixed with clear or white polymer powders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 3 colors so far: baby blue, purple and red.</li>
            <li>I have now used the cover pink, black, and yellow, and they were all very colorful.</li>
            <li>Also,the main reason I ordered these was because I wanted the black and the red that it clearly shows in the photo...</li>
            <li>but i didnt liked that it was small and that it was half empty.</li>
            <li>Although the price was very cheap, half of the containers hardly had any product in them.</li>
            <li>but there rather small cases but fun for personal use</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They are so cheap too!</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter and she was thrilled at the pretty colors!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good product :)</li>
            <li> It also got lost,so after more than 2 1/2 month it has reach.i didn&#x27;t complain to the company the second time because they were very good and understanding.having</li>
            <li> Love the colors and how easy they are to use.</li>
            <li> Very cheap powder that is why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> Yes I did receive all 12 and they were very full..</li>
            <li> The colors are brilliant and you can mix them easily,I&#x27;ve made brown color out of the green,yellow and blue colors!</li>
            <li> :) I am pretty sure I&#x27;ll be getting more soon :)</li>
            <li> This was old at a great price.</li>
            <li> Obviously these aren&#x27;t going to be top quality for the price you pay, but the colors are great.</li>
            <li> went on easily.</li>
            <li> Strong colors.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colours, smaller than I expect (as I did not check the dimensions)</li>
            <li> It have a pretty great colour and shipped fast</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fun and easy to use I love doing all types of designs I enjoy using this</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a huge amount of each powder, however for the price it is what i would expect.</li>
            <li> i only use it in molds and it works great.</li>
            <li> The price was really cheap</li>
            <li> For the amount of acrylic you received it was a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> but I think these acrylics are worth the time and money :) I&#x27;ve been using them to create premade flowers, leaves, and bows.</li>
            <li> OMG the colors are so cute and colorful</li>
            <li> i mix these with acrylic powder and use a very small amount if these color acrylics and make some awesome colors and have enought to do more than one set...........</li>
            <li> The colors are extremely vibrant and adorable :)</li>
            <li> But not too much, I can clean it very easy.</li>
            <li> so rich they are going to make some</li>
            <li> but honestly you can get maybe one set out if each container even mixing it with clear because there Just isn&#x27;t enough product in the containers to give you a great color payoff.</li>
            <li> some of the colors were pretty cute.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted &amp; I love the colors...</li>
            <li> I mixed them with Ezflow clear acrylic powder and they are just wonderful!</li>
            <li> I said worth the price because of the small containers,but these is a real good quality acrylic powder!</li>
            <li> Pleased and ready to use on my nails.  </li>
            <li> it is just makes my nail look cool</li>
            <li> you would think that you would get a full container..</li>
            <li> I will be buying more here very soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest that next time this is sent to package it good.</li>
            <li> and it was a good solid color not see through it</li>
            <li> Did you expect it to be full size tubs of powder?</li>
            <li> (I couldn&#x27;t get a good smile line with these like I do with my white powder)</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick, packaged well, will buy from again.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward  to using them more soon, and getting a little more creative.  </li>
            <li> I love these colors, they work amazing, some are dark</li>
            <li> love the product and the price is great but delivery was not good</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> They come out great with my regular clear acrylic powder.</li>
            <li> Such nice colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tested these yet, but I am looking forward to the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You mix these with clear acrylic to make more.</li>
            <li> Glad that it arrived early though.</li>
            <li> Overall happy, and it was delivered early.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting my own nail business.</li>
            <li> and I bought this same set, already knowing that I was going to use these to mix my own acrylic colors</li>
            <li> This powder does not go on right.  </li>
            <li> I gave them two stars instead of one because I don&#x27;t know if I was using them right.  </li>
            <li> this not to mention the containers arent filled with a good amount i realize the containers are small</li>
            <li> It comes a little bit but it works for the price and they are nice for make flowers or bows!</li>
            <li> When I got it I was very happy to se that there are a wide selection of colors, and yes, there are a few that are light</li>
            <li> I purchased these because i like the colors, like everybody says the amount is not that great, enough for me though because is just for personal use, and  </li>
            <li> Took a little longer than I had hoped for but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> am a beginner at nail art, and this is one of my first tools to build my kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the colors are super vibrant and ppretty.</li>
            <li> But I did only get one use out of it, I don&#x27;t know if it was my liquid or just me:)</li>
            <li> but for 3 dollars i cant really complain!</li>
            <li> but since they are so pigmented  you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li> First off I buy this product thinking it&#x27;s going to look like the picture I got it</li>
            <li> They need bigger containers to put more powder in.</li>
            <li> The colors where great but containers were very, very, small.</li>
            <li> , shipping was fast and they are exactly as described in the description.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re not bad, you could mix them with clear acrylic or add a 3d design to your nails.</li>
            <li> But when it did completely dried the colors can our bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li> but when you order something with a standard shipping speed like this with no option to pay more for a better one-be careful!</li>
            <li> Easy enough to work with.  </li>
            <li> Better suited for details and short tips instead of a full nail cover, unless you want each nail a different color.</li>
            <li> They are just for my personal use, but the quality is fine with me.</li>
            <li> These are really pretty vibrant colored power .</li>
            <li> The colors are so vibrant and pretty..</li>
            <li> What I really like about</li>
            <li> Very diasappointed, would not recommend..</li>
            <li> let alone my whole hand or even two hands</li>
            <li> doesnt work as real acrylic</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the packaging much though but</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this set is very inexpensive</li>
            <li> just wut my girlfriend wanted , she loves the colors and fast service from Asia..</li>
            <li> Very upset about the packaging.</li>
            <li> The thing I was upset with the most was the fact that some of the containers were practically empty like I couldnt do one tip with some of the colors if I wanted to.</li>
            <li> It may not seem like much</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> I do not know how to work with them, but my friend promised to come to my show, I really like the color.</li>
            <li> Do you know how much quality polymer powder costs?</li>
            <li> when using this product, it can be mixed with clear acrylic powder and you can get more out of it.  </li>
            <li> I will mix them with with clear or white to get more out of them</li>
            <li> they come in a cute little package and they are small but very cute</li>
            <li> They came very quickly which was a big surprised because i was not expecting them for three to four weeks</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you only use very little mixed with clear and the color is still really bright.</li>
            <li> The purple looks very light but is actually super dark almost looked blue.</li>
            <li> I did add clear to stretch the product because it is very concentrated!</li>
            <li> The containers are tiny and they weren&#x27;t even halfway full..</li>
            <li> This has a good variety and though each pot of powder is pretty small, it is enough to experiment with.</li>
            <li> Little light and is very small amounts but give a very nice color.</li>
            <li> the colors were vibrant</li>
            <li> Only a few of the containers had a good amont of product but  </li>
            <li> , i liked how the pink look as a french tip.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and vibrant - it came with two blacks, two pinks, one white, and a variety of blue, green, purple, etc.</li>
            <li> , overall worth it</li>
            <li> sure to get some clear or white acrylic powder to mix these with, or you won&#x27;t have enough to finish your nails!</li>
            <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
            <li> My packaged came intact and the little jars were all very full.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or the product, but it seems to dry very fast and won&#x27;t leave you much time to work on it</li>
            <li> Not enough but pretty colors</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this works well with my Absolute and my CND Retention+ systems for creating fun designs, 3D shapes, or just adding a pop of color to a basic French tip!</li>
            <li> The people wrining reviews saying there&#x27;s not enough powder to do a full set obviously don&#x27;t know how to do nails.</li>
            <li> I started with the pink which is a very pretty color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not acrylic builder, it&#x27;s pigment to add to clear acrylic</li>
            <li> Would not stick and when applied with clear polish, messed up the fuzzy material.</li>
            <li> To many that complained about the amount you get, you are suppose to mix it with clear acrylic.</li>
            <li> (use the colored acrylic for the \\&quot;tip\\&quot; not the entire nail so that you do not use up the whole container).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised this made it to my house.</li>
            <li> then the powder is half way full</li>
            <li> The jars are very small, but it was totally cheap!</li>
            <li> The nails still come out solid and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Such tiny amounts, good for little wet work</li>
            <li> like I said the others were pretty much empty</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to do a set with the hot pink.</li>
            <li> So when I received the product I was quite surprised at how small the containers were, but the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Works well but the only problem is the containers some had more than some  in them and the containers are very small.</li>
            <li> used the Pink and Black colors already, they worked fine.</li>
            <li> Mix the colors with white or clear acrylic and it achieves the desired color.</li>
            <li> The containers are very small and hardly full, but, you have to mix these with clear acrylic in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> but I just add a little white in and it tones them down :)</li>
            <li> the color and dont clip away so fast as other acrylic</li>
            <li> These polymer powders are not meant to be used alone, they are \\&quot;additives\\&quot; that are to be mixed with clear or white polymer powders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 colors so far: baby blue, purple and red.</li>
            <li> I have now used the cover pink, black, and yellow, and they were all very colorful.</li>
            <li> Also,the main reason I ordered these was because I wanted the black and the red that it clearly shows in the photo...</li>
            <li> but i didnt liked that it was small and that it was half empty.</li>
            <li> Although the price was very cheap, half of the containers hardly had any product in them.</li>
            <li> but there rather small cases but fun for personal use</li>
            <li> I guess the saying is true, you get what you pay for, but at the same time, this is also false advertisement.</li>
            <li> Really they are just too small should be labeled as a sample pack...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The package wasn&#x27;t broken or open, there was alot of excess powder in the plastic outter box, a light cover pink color.</li>
            <li> , says powder, this is more like broken rocks, one even cut my finger a little.</li>
            <li> Just received my package today was not expecting there to be such small containers and most of them were not filled they were half empty .</li>
            <li> the lids are loose or something because the entire thing is powdered up inside and out.</li>
            <li> The clear container was cracked and the green had opened and was everywhere.</li>
            <li> The things are tiny and its not really what I thought.</li>
            <li> I needed to know how long things take in the mail.</li>
            <li> no professional</li>
            <li> I am not a professional.</li>
            <li> These are much smaller then I expected.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get but it is over seas.</li>
            <li> The package had spilled a little so the outside was powdery, I still give it a 5 overall because I got what expected and paid for.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this product, because all the colors appear to be the same, but I bought it anyways.</li>
            <li> I was worried my container was open, but after close inspection, the powder didn&#x27;t come from my little jar.</li>
            <li> The product was a little smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I could do only 1-2 nails with the pink, so little powder.</li>
            <li> When I first received the package I was a bit shocked at how small the containers were, HOWEVER I see that the colors are very pigmented; they definitely do not appear as pale/chalky as you may notice when they are without monomer.</li>
            <li> so I had to throw one of them away because it was empty</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and expected.</li>
            <li> the colors are really not of any use to me.</li>
            <li> One of the dishes was poorly closed, it didn&#x27;t all spill</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re mad that these \\&quot;only did 2 nails,\\&quot; you didn&#x27;t use it right.</li>
            <li> this sucks there was barely any powder in here to do one finger</li>
            <li> The only problem was that wen I got it there was a small spill.</li>
            <li> But other than that the product works well.</li>
            <li> So not worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s just not worth it, don&#x27;t do it</li>
            <li> empty tub 4-5 scoops of a 1/8 teaspoon to measure and 1/2-1 scoop of any or a few colors.</li>
            <li> The product itself is in somewhat flimsy packaging - little round twist-top cases that are put into a cardboard box; because of this, the magenta powder came loose and spilled inside the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t a bad clean up.</li>
            <li> Half of the powder was all over the package</li>
            <li> A half and half ratio seems to work alright.</li>
            <li> Half of the product is in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is just a little.</li>
            <li> This product labeling/title is a little misleading to those not familiar with acrylic systems.</li>
            <li> If you want to buy it, I recommend for just practice.&lt;br /&gt;The box is a little bit messy, when it arrived.</li>
            <li> what a let down!</li>
            <li> and I will be placing another order once I begin my Nail Business in a few weeks at my college.</li>
            <li> if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> and it was so messy.</li>
            <li> NOT TOO MESSY</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little bit small.</li>
            <li> green case was cracked but not spilled and containers are small</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s all, maybe a few small flowers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small the containers were, they about the size of a quarter and about half an inch thick or so.  </li>
            <li> i recieved mine a few days ago and was disappointed to find the plastic case cracked, the acrylic jars were very tiny and some of the jars were even half empty.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this seller right now</li>
            <li> not like my other order the other ones was biger what happened to this order all wrong not what i wanted</li>
            <li> Small containers n product for the price i paid.</li>
            <li> Being that the containers are already really small</li>
            <li> will not buy this product again because of how small amount of powder they put in the jars</li>
            <li> I hope this helps you think otherwise that you just wasted your money!</li>
            <li> well they are a small amount</li>
            <li> it is the variety of colors and the presentation, it comes in a hard plastic box with 12 small containers.</li>
            <li> but I ended up throwing them all out because they where not suitable for the use.</li>
            <li> Hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I bought these, they were really hard to use</li>
            <li> Sucks,  I do nails</li>
            <li> how because i did hesitate to order when i saw lots of negative reviews</li>
            <li> Does this mean they just shipped my package a week ago?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this go buy it from a beauty store!!</li>
            <li> If i could give a zero stars I would the colors repeated, the powders were not closed properly and the packaging was horrible.</li>
            <li> These powders were very small upon opening, but for the price, you can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got 3 different greens, one nasty yellow color, 3 pinks ect... not even close to colors pictured!</li>
            <li> and this is just no good</li>
            <li> Do not like the weak texture of this product to me</li>
            <li> 3 of the containers were broken while still in their pack.</li>
            <li> said it was acrylic came in and it is glitter...really not happy with this place  </li>
            <li> Even the expensive, well known brands that make color additives (like CND or Entity) package and sell them in very, very small quantities for this fact alone.</li>
            <li> I just received my order, and I must say I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s advertised wrong.</li>
            <li> so I dont think ill be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t even give this product a review after I ordered it because I&#x27;ve waited over a month for it in the mail and never got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad because I ordered two of them..</li>
            <li> the protection was so bad.</li>
            <li> Instead I received a horrible brown color and an awful green in their place.</li>
            <li> I was soo disappointed I did my nails yesterday with the powders</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the colors I received.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the colors that are in these. There isn&#x27;t a huge amount of each powder, however for the price it is what i would expect. I am looking forward  to using them more soon, and getting a little more creative.  They were delivered very quickly and was very happy and surprised. :-)</li>
            <li> Nice colors. I haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not acrylic builder, it&#x27;s pigment to add to clear acrylic so it&#x27;s advertised wrong. I didn&#x27;t get what I was expecting. But it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I said worth the price because of the small containers,but these is a real good quality acrylic powder! The colors are brilliant and you can mix them easily,I&#x27;ve made brown color out of the green,yellow and blue colors!</li>
            <li> the colors were vibrant I love the fact that you only use very little mixed with clear and the color is still really bright.</li>
            <li> beautiful bright colors. Easy enough to work with.  Pleased and ready to use on my nails.  Only wish they came in larger sizes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or the product, but it seems to dry very fast and won&#x27;t leave you much time to work on it (I couldn&#x27;t get a good smile line with these like I do with my white powder) I&#x27;ve used 3 colors so far: baby blue, purple and red. The purple looks very light but is actually super dark almost looked blue. What I really like about it is the variety of colors and the presentation, it comes in a hard plastic box with 12 small containers. It&#x27;s a fair deal for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> great for my use wish it could have been more in the containers&lt;br /&gt;love the color and dont clip away so fast as other acrylic</li>
            <li> Half of the powder was all over the package so I had to throw one of them away because it was empty and they were not in a case like the picture showed</li>
            <li> i love the colors so bright and fun but there rather small cases but fun for personal use, overall worth it</li>
            <li> I love all the colors they are soo cute</li>
            <li> Received these way earlier than delivery date. These are pretty small containers but they seem like they will last me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I used the Pink and Black colors already, they worked fine. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> not like my other order the other ones was biger what happened to this order all wrong not what i wanted</li>
            <li> oh, these are beautiful colors.  so rich they are going to make some&lt;br /&gt;most gorgeous of rich colored gel nails</li>
            <li> These are really pretty vibrant colored power . They come out great with my regular clear acrylic powder. Strong colors.</li>
            <li> What I received is like a fuzzy material, not a powder. Would not stick and when applied with clear polish, messed up the fuzzy material.Very diasappointed, would not recommend..</li>
            <li> I love these colors, they work amazing, some are dark but I just add a little white in and it tones them down :)&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy!! I will be buying more soon!</li>
            <li> this sucks there was barely any powder in here to do one finger let alone my whole hand or even two hands</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected, says powder, this is more like broken rocks, one even cut my finger a little. Good price but I ended up throwing them all out because they where not suitable for the use.</li>
            <li> I do NOT reccommend this. The things are tiny and its not really what I thought. The box says glitter on it. Smallest thing ever. So not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors and so easy to apply. Such a great product to make the perfect full set</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t even give this product a review after I ordered it because I&#x27;ve waited over a month for it in the mail and never got it. Then I got an email that made no sense saying it they had shipped my package out \\&quot;one week before\\&quot; but it was mailed back to them? Does this mean they just shipped my package a week ago? Very unhappy with this seller right now but when you order something with a standard shipping speed like this with no option to pay more for a better one-be careful! I will be contacting to get a refund as well.</li>
            <li> Not enough but pretty colors</li>
            <li> they are a great size if u plan on doing your own nails or even for practice i am happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> love the product and the price is great but delivery was not good i order it 2 1/2 month a go it got lost.the company was great a re sent it.It also got lost,so after more than 2 1/2 month it has reach.i didn&#x27;t complain to the company the second time because they were very good and understanding.having said that if you are not in a rush you should order because it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Sucks,  I do nails and this is just no good what so ever. Did not like it at all, I will not ever buy this again</li>
            <li> I love these colors... the pigmentation is excellent!  I just wish they where bigger but for the price, I can&#x27;t complain. If someone knows where to get bigger sizes please let me know!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and expected. Took a little longer than I had hoped for but it&#x27;s good. The package had spilled a little so the outside was powdery, I still give it a 5 overall because I got what expected and paid for.</li>
            <li> I like the colors! It comes a little bit but it works for the price and they are nice for make flowers or bows!</li>
            <li> Small containers n product for the price i paid.</li>
            <li> i bought this set to use specifically for the molds for 3-d nail art.  this powder is perfect for that.  i wouldn&#x27;t use it on my actual nail because when it dries it dries sticky, almost gummy like...but it&#x27;s perfect for molds...maybe for doing 3-d nail art on the nail but i haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  i only use it in molds and it works great.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my powders today. They came very quickly which was a big surprised because i was not expecting them for three to four weeks and it came in a week. The colors are very beautiful and came with a card to fill out if i had any problems with the product that they will replace it with no problems. I will buy more of these from this seller.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the colors I received. I got 3 different greens, one nasty yellow color, 3 pinks ect... not even close to colors pictured!</li>
            <li> it is just makes my nail look cool thank you I hope to see more like this in your site</li>
            <li> Great, just how they described, thats what i got!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and in great shape. Such nice colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tested these yet, but I am looking forward to the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a beginner at nail art, and this is one of my first tools to build my kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will see posts like these from me many times.  I will put items to use as I gather them all together, from sellers I trust!</li>
            <li> Do not like the weak texture of this product to me its runny glad i didnt buy alot! this not to mention the containers arent filled with a good amount i realize the containers are small but can they atleast fill those close to max?</li>
            <li> This product is just okay.. The containers are tiny and they weren&#x27;t even halfway full.. Being that the containers are already really small you would think that you would get a full container.. Not so.. The price was really cheap but honestly you can get maybe one set out if each container even mixing it with clear because there Just isn&#x27;t enough product in the containers to give you a great color payoff.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and how easy they are to use. I will be buying more here very soon. Cant wait.</li>
            <li> These powders are awesome! I got these for my daughter and she was thrilled at the pretty colors!! :) I am pretty sure I&#x27;ll be getting more soon :)</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this product, because all the colors appear to be the same, but I bought it anyways. When I got it I was very happy to se that there are a wide selection of colors, and yes, there are a few that are light but it&#x27;s sill perfect.</li>
            <li> doesnt work as real acrylic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with my color acrylics. I&#x27;ll be using them for 3D designs. I used one of the color acrylics for a 3D rose and I loved it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the packaging much though but lovely colours</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this set is very inexpensive and I will be placing another order once I begin my Nail Business in a few weeks at my college. When I first received the package I was a bit shocked at how small the containers were, HOWEVER I see that the colors are very pigmented; they definitely do not appear as pale/chalky as you may notice when they are without monomer. Once you bind them with monomer they are absolutely stunning. For the amount of acrylic you received it was a fantastic price. Great for #D nail art as well as sculpting acrylic nails (use the colored acrylic for the \\&quot;tip\\&quot; not the entire nail so that you do not use up the whole container).</li>
            <li> The people wrining reviews saying there&#x27;s not enough powder to do a full set obviously don&#x27;t know how to do nails. You mix these with clear acrylic to make more. And the colors are super vibrant and ppretty. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> just wut my girlfriend wanted , she loves the colors and fast service from Asia.. good price.... its worth it !!! i buy more !!!</li>
            <li> Little light and is very small amounts but give a very nice color.</li>
            <li> the colors are really not of any use to me.</li>
            <li> I finally got my Acrylic Builder nail art set today,so I used it already it&#x27;s beautiful Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Just got my case of acrylic color powders and i love the colors. Very bright and well filled. The only problem was that wen I got it there was a small spill. One of the dishes was poorly closed, it didn&#x27;t all spill so it wasn&#x27;t a bad clean up. I&#x27;d suggest that next time this is sent to package it good. Like wrapping it with bubble wrap. Pretty good product :)</li>
            <li> I purchased these because i like the colors, like everybody says the amount is not that great, enough for me though because is just for personal use, and  i paid like 3 bucks for them so, they&#x27;re not bad, you could mix them with clear acrylic or add a 3d design to your nails.</li>
            <li> 3 of the containers were broken while still in their pack. Very upset about the packaging. Glad that it arrived early though.</li>
            <li> These powders were very small upon opening, but for the price, you can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;The package wasn&#x27;t broken or open, there was alot of excess powder in the plastic outter box, a light cover pink color. I was worried my container was open, but after close inspection, the powder didn&#x27;t come from my little jar. I have now used the cover pink, black, and yellow, and they were all very colorful.They are just for my personal use, but the quality is fine with me. Overall happy, and it was delivered early.</li>
            <li> when using this product, it can be mixed with clear acrylic powder and you can get more out of it.  it still has great color.</li>
            <li> So when I received the product I was quite surprised at how small the containers were, but the colors are very pretty. The thing I was upset with the most was the fact that some of the containers were practically empty like I couldnt do one tip with some of the colors if I wanted to. Only a few of the containers had a good amont of product but  like I said the others were pretty much empty so I dont think ill be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li> If i could give a zero stars I would the colors repeated, the powders were not closed properly and the packaging was horrible. I&#x27;m actually surprised this made it to my house.</li>
            <li> Obviously these aren&#x27;t going to be top quality for the price you pay, but the colors are great. This has a good variety and though each pot of powder is pretty small, it is enough to experiment with.</li>
            <li> Just received mine.. OMG I love the colors. Its perfect for customizing acrylic mixes. Yes I did receive all 12 and they were very full.. Remember folks its an Acrylic Powder Builder Nail Art Set..So be prepared to build...lol</li>
            <li> this product is okay for the price but i didnt liked that it was small and that it was half empty. When i got my package the powder was kinda spilled.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this product again because of how small amount of powder they put in the jars</li>
            <li> The containers are very small and hardly full, but, you have to mix these with clear acrylic in order for it to work. That is why people are having issues. A half and half ratio seems to work alright.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting my own nail business. I needed to know how long things take in the mail. I got my package on time Ur awesome! .</li>
            <li> I got this before the date that it was supposed to be in which is a plus! And I did use this colored powder. I started with the pink which is a very pretty color and it was a good solid color not see through it went on easily. I just started doing my own nails so im no professional but this was very easy to work with. But I did only get one use out of it, I don&#x27;t know if it was my liquid or just me:)</li>
            <li> This powder does not go on right.  Hard to work with. Very cheap powder that is why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with this, and when I had to talk to customer service about a shipment confusion, they were great and assisted me quickly &amp; courteously.</li>
            <li> colors are nice and bright</li>
            <li> i recieved mine a few days ago and was disappointed to find the plastic case cracked, the acrylic jars were very tiny and some of the jars were even half empty. some of the colors were pretty cute. but for 3 dollars i cant really complain!</li>
            <li> great colors, very pigmented! green case was cracked but not spilled and containers are small but since they are so pigmented  you don&#x27;t need much! Would recommend and would buy again!</li>
            <li> The colors are so vibrant and pretty.. I did add clear to stretch the product because it is very concentrated! It may not seem like much but I think these acrylics are worth the time and money :) I&#x27;ve been using them to create premade flowers, leaves, and bows. I will be buying more when I runout.. Love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> When finallyyyyyy got it in the mail and I starting using it the colors are good but for me are perfect to use them as pigments and do my own mixed colors .</li>
            <li> I bought these, they were really hard to use I gave them two stars instead of one because I don&#x27;t know if I was using them right.  I am not a professional.</li>
            <li> I do nails and I bought this same set, already knowing that I was going to use these to mix my own acrylic colors, I take a 1 oz. empty tub 4-5 scoops of a 1/8 teaspoon to measure and 1/2-1 scoop of any or a few colors. The nails still come out solid and vibrant. I hope this helps you think otherwise that you just wasted your money!</li>
            <li> well they are a small amount but thats all u need is just a little. I love it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> i received this and it was so messy. the lids are loose or something because the entire thing is powdered up inside and out.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product for the price. Mix the colors with white or clear acrylic and it achieves the desired color. Works very well and I&#x27;m happy with it. Good value for the price</li>
            <li> So I purchase this item aug 17 and got it by the 23. The product was a little smaller than expected. Another thing when in use, it took a while to harden. But when it did completely dried the colors can our bright and vibrant. Can&#x27;t complain about that!, i liked how the pink look as a french tip.</li>
            <li> Talk must not know how to do nails, these variety of colored powders are to mix with actual Acrylic Powder. Not to just use that colored powder as acrylic powder. -.-</li>
            <li> First off I buy this product thinking it&#x27;s going to look like the picture I got it and it DID NOT LOOK ANYTHING like it I was soo disappointed I did my nails yesterday with the powders and it destroyed my brushes!!!! And my shot glass that I used to rince off my brush! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this go buy it from a beauty store!!</li>
            <li> Such tiny amounts, good for little wet work that&#x27;s all, maybe a few small flowers. I will reuse the jars.</li>
            <li> although there was some powder spilled inside the packaging, it didnt seem to be the powders in my case though thank goodness!</li>
            <li> WAY WAY SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING WAS OK, AFTER I CLEANED THE ACRYLIC THAT WAS ON THEM. NOT TOO MESSY&lt;br /&gt;HAVENT USED THEM BUT THERE IS LIKE A SAMPLE SIZE OF PRODUCT. DEF COULD OF SENT MORE.</li>
            <li> OMG the colors are so cute and colorful they come in a cute little package and they are small but very cute</li>
            <li> Great colors and quality. Shipped fast but when I opened my package it wasn&#x27;t in any sort of bag or anything. The clear container was cracked and the green had opened and was everywhere.</li>
            <li> It have a pretty great colour and shipped fast but it&#x27;s a little bit small. If you want to buy it, I recommend for just practice.&lt;br /&gt;The box is a little bit messy, when it arrived. But not too much, I can clean it very easy.</li>
            <li> I just received these powders today, way before the estimated delivery! I mixed them with Ezflow clear acrylic powder and they are just wonderful! The colors are so bright and pretty! My packaged came intact and the little jars were all very full. I can&#x27;t wait to do a set with the hot pink.</li>
            <li> Just received my package today was not expecting there to be such small containers and most of them were not filled they were half empty . I will mix them with with clear or white to get more out of them but I will not reorder this. Really they are just too small should be labeled as a sample pack... I&#x27;m mad because I ordered two of them..oh well</li>
            <li> I do not know how to work with them, but my friend promised to come to my show, I really like the color. I will try tomorrow to do with them.</li>
            <li> great awesome product at great price...... i dont know what people use this or how because i did hesitate to order when i saw lots of negative reviews but i decided to order and ive done my nails an my daighters and ive loved the colors. i mix these with acrylic powder and use a very small amount if these color acrylics and make some awesome colors and have enought to do more than one set...........</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a deal when I purchased but turns out I didn&#x27;t.  The colors where great but containers were very, very, small. The project i was trying to acheive didn&#x27;t come out as planned because i didn&#x27;t have enought powder. They need bigger containers to put more powder in.</li>
            <li> For the price it is good. The jars are very small, but it was totally cheap! I do my own nails, and this is perfect for that!</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s fun and easy to use I love doing all types of designs I enjoy using this</li>
            <li> The colors are great and vibrant - it came with two blacks, two pinks, one white, and a variety of blue, green, purple, etc. The product itself is in somewhat flimsy packaging - little round twist-top cases that are put into a cardboard box; because of this, the magenta powder came loose and spilled inside the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to get some clear or white acrylic powder to mix these with, or you won&#x27;t have enough to finish your nails!</li>
            <li> product ok  the white one opened during transit and got over everything and now we have no white to use.</li>
            <li> said it was acrylic came in and it is glitter...really not happy with this place  buyer beware!!!!</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted &amp; I love the colors...</li>
            <li> These are much smaller then I expected. But ok for sample size. Took a long time to get but it is over seas.</li>
            <li> They dont bring enough product the container are about a quarter size then the powder is half way full these are more for designs in the nail</li>
            <li> My Mother had said she ordered this product for me well before Christmas, i even saw the date on her amazon..... said it shipped a day after she bought it????</li>
            <li> I love the colors! To many that complained about the amount you get, you are suppose to mix it with clear acrylic. Delivery was quick, packaged well, will buy from again.</li>
            <li> It did not come with a lot of acrylic powder. You could MAYBE use it all on one hand. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> Works well but the only problem is the containers some had more than some  in them and the containers are very small. But other than that the product works well.</li>
            <li> This product labeling/title is a little misleading to those not familiar with acrylic systems. These polymer powders are not meant to be used alone, they are \\&quot;additives\\&quot; that are to be mixed with clear or white polymer powders. Even the expensive, well known brands that make color additives (like CND or Entity) package and sell them in very, very small quantities for this fact alone. So, if you&#x27;re mad that these \\&quot;only did 2 nails,\\&quot; you didn&#x27;t use it right. Also, it&#x27;s $3. Did you expect it to be full size tubs of powder? Do you know how much quality polymer powder costs? 0.8 oz of powder runs $12-25 depending on the brand, and the liquid is $25+ for a tiny 4 oz bottle! Learn the proper way to work with acrylic systems, and go price the stuff yourself, then come complain about the THREE DOLLAR powder you got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this works well with my Absolute and my CND Retention+ systems for creating fun designs, 3D shapes, or just adding a pop of color to a basic French tip! No, there&#x27;s not a lot of product in the containers.. but it was $3, buy two.</li>
            <li> Half of the product is in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s just not worth it, don&#x27;t do it, you&#x27;re better off buying the jumpo product!</li>
            <li> I just received my order, and I must say I&#x27;m a little disappointed. Although the price was very cheap, half of the containers hardly had any product in them. Also,the main reason I ordered these was because I wanted the black and the red that it clearly shows in the photo... I didn&#x27;t receive either one. Instead I received a horrible brown color and an awful green in their place. I guess the saying is true, you get what you pay for, but at the same time, this is also false advertisement. I WILL NOT be ordering from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It had all the colors but they didn&#x27;t mention that some of the powders were almost gone. I could do only 1-2 nails with the pink, so little powder. :( what a let down!</li>
            <li> the blue color in the box already open, and the powder came out! the protection was so bad. And the product does not look like the picture showing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this type of color powder before! This should make great nail design. This was old at a great price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small the containers were, they about the size of a quarter and about half an inch thick or so.  The colors are great and they work well.  Great for the price.  Better suited for details and short tips instead of a full nail cover, unless you want each nail a different color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colours, smaller than I expect (as I did not check the dimensions), shipping was fast and they are exactly as described in the description. Will definately buy the product again.</li>
            <li> i could not get it to form to put on my nails it seemed like it didnt want to lay on my nails like the regular acrilic power</li>
            <li> The colors are so adorsble! They are so cheap too! They come in a really cute container too! The colors are extremely vibrant and adorable :)</li>
