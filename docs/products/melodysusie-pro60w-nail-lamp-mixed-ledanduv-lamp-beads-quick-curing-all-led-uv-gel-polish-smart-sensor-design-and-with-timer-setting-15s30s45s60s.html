            <li>they work great and are light weight.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the kind you would find in a nail shop.  </li>
            <li>I used gelish and gel builder and it cured really nice.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li>I do them in the comfort of my own home</li>
            <li>I am saving tons of money by doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, works great</li>
            <li>this by far is one of the best one I got!</li>
            <li>I liked that you were able to set a timer for your nails, if needed.</li>
            <li>Garbage....do not order this item price was to good to be true.</li>
            <li>LOVE this lamp</li>
            <li>I love my uv ligh.</li>
            <li>Okay I had purchase this product on March 27,2015</li>
            <li>send me a uv lamp that works :)</li>
            <li>It has scratches on the top and inside of the machine.  </li>
            <li>My mama said this is a kind of obsessive, and too much nail painting will not so good to health.</li>
            <li>Offered free shipping, but then charged me!</li>
            <li>Also it said it came with a spare light, it didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>The dual functions make it a perfect choice for someone who at times needs the UV lamp for the gel/shellac nails and then just the air drying for regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>The machine was safely well packed, and had no damage during the shipment.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many uv and led lights and</li>
            <li>Top notch customer service.  </li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cures UV gel polish better than a nail salon.</li>
            <li>but  I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love that I can keep it running continuesly and freeze my gels when I&#x27;m doing a gel design .</li>
            <li>I saw people were saying their nails were still tacky after they applied the top coat for gels.</li>
            <li>However, when you&#x27;re done drying your top coat, wiping your nails with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol removes the tacky stuff without stripping the top coat off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok ,</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>But at home :)</li>
            <li>They both really love it.</li>
            <li>I love this light .</li>
            <li>The lamp should have more personalized settings, but all in all, worth the money!</li>
            <li>Best money i ever spent!</li>
            <li>She said that the dryer is easy to operate and cures the polish very quickly.</li>
            <li>The bulbs are easy to install.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Positive things about this unit: It seemed like it would be easy to store.</li>
            <li>and it was fairly easy to read the directions and put the bulbs in the unit.</li>
            <li>It saves her a lot of time, specially with it beeing able to fit boths hands in it.</li>
            <li>It cured gel nail polish just fine.  </li>
            <li>I had a LED light from Sensationail.  </li>
            <li>You can fit both hands into this lamp.  </li>
            <li>I have no complaints about the uv light.</li>
            <li>She immediately sent me a coupon for a free bulb.  </li>
            <li>Got it ship and the light doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>so the light cures them.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even had this light for 5 months</li>
            <li>Super easy to install.</li>
            <li>No issues here well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I wanted a two-hand lamp, and the price was right!</li>
            <li>The package did not come with the extra lamp but still a good deal.</li>
            <li>Our grand daughter really loves it.</li>
            <li>Love it so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with the lamp, packaging was on point and delivery was fast  </li>
            <li>My friend said this lamp worked well and the timer setting was clever, her customers can set up by themselves and it save her time to service the customers, so she can service more customers.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you are looking for quick speed and  for this to do the job of drying your nail polish</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, product received as described.</li>
            <li>Shipment was quick &amp; painless.</li>
            <li>Ok, finally I had a chance to use my new UV lamp ( 3 times to be exact, making sure I will give an honest review).&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loves it very much!  </li>
            <li>and makes my cheaper nail polish last a bit longer!:) well packaged too!</li>
            <li>The best part I like though is 5that you can dry both hands at the same time.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased with how the lamp works.</li>
            <li>The fan itself wasn&#x27;t too powerful, though.</li>
            <li>While this one release me free, I have begun to treat my nails at home, as I have saw so many times, I know each step and this nail dryer dry so quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It pays for itself pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The fact that it comes with an exhaust chip to keep 5he motor cool is really smart.</li>
            <li>The design is pretty slick, and I thought that the buttons for operation were great.</li>
            <li>Love the timer settings, light and other features.</li>
            <li>Gets pretty hot in there when I&#x27;m doing my nails.</li>
            <li>This is a professional light just like is used at nail salons.</li>
            <li>First off, I did not get the ex bulb that was promised and</li>
            <li>I did not receive the extra bulb, but other than that the product so far has been great!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you or your clients have your thumbs flat</li>
            <li>Other than that the light works fine</li>
            <li>This light did not heat up and it did not dry the nails.  </li>
            <li>I really like it&#x27;s ,</li>
            <li>reasonable price</li>
            <li>Worked really well until two weeks ago went to turn on and wouldn&#x27;t turn on..</li>
            <li>Very well made.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a very picky customer  </li>
            <li>It works very well .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to pay so much to get my nails done</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking to buy a gel polish manicure light, look no further.  </li>
            <li>This one lets you paint both hands or feet at same time and both fit in dryer with room to spare.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped with bulbs in separate box.</li>
            <li>Cures fast</li>
            <li>The buzzer on the timer is a little loud, but other than that it works perfect!!</li>
            <li>Other than that it seems ok.</li>
            <li>Something about it does make me wonder if it will have trouble down the line, but five manicures in, it&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li>Powerful enough to cure builder nail gel.</li>
            <li>Also it arrived earlier than expected.:)</li>
            <li>First of all, this unit did not come with the extra bulb as promised.</li>
            <li>I followed the positive comments on this item before I purchased and believe me I was fooled big time.</li>
            <li>pick constant on , or your choice of certain minute settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I am just sucked in it and go to salon quite frequently.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t found any problems with it so far</li>
            <li>I am  using  CND brand for nail polish , so far my manicure and pedicure which is DYI</li>
            <li>worth the money in my opinion when you consider how much you can spend going to the salon a few time a month.</li>
            <li>One hour later, they still had not dried.  </li>
            <li>I have spent much money each year in salon, as I feel naked without nail art.</li>
            <li>I had a single hand unit and this is definitely worth the money because it cuts cure time in half.</li>
            <li>That increases how long it las5s and itcuts down on your hqnds being too hot.</li>
            <li>I am SO pleased with this Gel polish light that I had to share my experience with everyone wanting to make this investment.&lt;br /&gt;After buying two other brands and finding them either totally useless, one dryer took 45 minutes to dry one hand, and the other had a compartment that even my tiny hand wouldn&#x27;t go inside, I saw this offer.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with the lamp, packaging was on point and delivery was fast  </li>
            <li> My friend said this lamp worked well and the timer setting was clever, her customers can set up by themselves and it save her time to service the customers, so she can service more customers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you are looking for quick speed and  for this to do the job of drying your nail polish</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, product received as described.</li>
            <li> Shipment was quick &amp; painless.</li>
            <li> Ok, finally I had a chance to use my new UV lamp ( 3 times to be exact, making sure I will give an honest review).&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loves it very much!  </li>
            <li> and makes my cheaper nail polish last a bit longer!:) well packaged too!</li>
            <li> The best part I like though is 5that you can dry both hands at the same time.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased with how the lamp works.</li>
            <li> The fan itself wasn&#x27;t too powerful, though.</li>
            <li> While this one release me free, I have begun to treat my nails at home, as I have saw so many times, I know each step and this nail dryer dry so quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It pays for itself pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The fact that it comes with an exhaust chip to keep 5he motor cool is really smart.</li>
            <li> The design is pretty slick, and I thought that the buttons for operation were great.</li>
            <li> Love the timer settings, light and other features.</li>
            <li> Gets pretty hot in there when I&#x27;m doing my nails.</li>
            <li> This is a professional light just like is used at nail salons.</li>
            <li> First off, I did not get the ex bulb that was promised and</li>
            <li> I did not receive the extra bulb, but other than that the product so far has been great!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you or your clients have your thumbs flat</li>
            <li> Other than that the light works fine</li>
            <li> This light did not heat up and it did not dry the nails.  </li>
            <li> I really like it&#x27;s ,</li>
            <li> reasonable price</li>
            <li> Worked really well until two weeks ago went to turn on and wouldn&#x27;t turn on..</li>
            <li> Very well made.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a very picky customer  </li>
            <li> It works very well .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to pay so much to get my nails done</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking to buy a gel polish manicure light, look no further.  </li>
            <li> This one lets you paint both hands or feet at same time and both fit in dryer with room to spare.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped with bulbs in separate box.</li>
            <li> Cures fast</li>
            <li> The buzzer on the timer is a little loud, but other than that it works perfect!!</li>
            <li> Other than that it seems ok.</li>
            <li> Something about it does make me wonder if it will have trouble down the line, but five manicures in, it&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li> Powerful enough to cure builder nail gel.</li>
            <li> Also it arrived earlier than expected.:)</li>
            <li> First of all, this unit did not come with the extra bulb as promised.</li>
            <li> I followed the positive comments on this item before I purchased and believe me I was fooled big time.</li>
            <li> pick constant on , or your choice of certain minute settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I am just sucked in it and go to salon quite frequently.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t found any problems with it so far</li>
            <li> I am  using  CND brand for nail polish , so far my manicure and pedicure which is DYI</li>
            <li> worth the money in my opinion when you consider how much you can spend going to the salon a few time a month.</li>
            <li> One hour later, they still had not dried.  </li>
            <li> I have spent much money each year in salon, as I feel naked without nail art.</li>
            <li> I had a single hand unit and this is definitely worth the money because it cuts cure time in half.</li>
            <li> That increases how long it las5s and itcuts down on your hqnds being too hot.</li>
            <li> I am SO pleased with this Gel polish light that I had to share my experience with everyone wanting to make this investment.&lt;br /&gt;After buying two other brands and finding them either totally useless, one dryer took 45 minutes to dry one hand, and the other had a compartment that even my tiny hand wouldn&#x27;t go inside, I saw this offer.</li>
            <li> It does not dry nail polish in 5 minutes it takes 4 to 5 times that to dry than a regular fan.</li>
            <li> It has a fan to dry regular nail polish also.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, bottom doesnt remove for easy pedi access</li>
            <li> It was not enough air to dry my nails.</li>
            <li> This comes with a fan inside it that hardly blows any air out and it gets hot waiting for your nails to dry.</li>
            <li> She could not sit still long enough to dry was the problem.</li>
            <li> Both hands or feet can be done at the same time and it only takes a few minutes for your nails to be TOTALLY dry and ready for everyday use.</li>
            <li> That way you cqn customize how long you want to take.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this a 3 star due to a bulb being broken.  </li>
            <li> I even tried it drying between coats so that it wouldn&#x27;t take so long to dry.</li>
            <li> I  thought that it would dry the nails faster  </li>
            <li> All I can say is I bought this for my girlfriend because she always hit a nail before ether were completely dry and the process started over.</li>
            <li> That is waiting on the dry time and repairing one that always got hit.</li>
            <li> And now the nails dry in minutes</li>
            <li> The item does not live up to its description.</li>
            <li> my nails dry and cure themselves like i had them done at the salon!</li>
            <li> My lamp came minus the &amp;#34;extra bulb&amp;#34; &amp; with two of the six bulbs shattered.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the expected time frame is</li>
            <li> but I did two five minutes and the nails were as wet as can be.  </li>
            <li> Before she spent hours paint just hers nails.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> it is wide to cure both hands at a time!</li>
            <li> There is very big space for two hands, so I never worry that my thumbs and little fingers won&#x27;t be well dried.</li>
            <li> I could not dry my nails because a very small amount of air came from the fan.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is I wish the fan was a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> I thought it would at least last longer then this...</li>
            <li> I use it once every other week and no issues!</li>
            <li> Not excited about having to wait to use it.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about this lamp after reading some reviews, but I pulled the trigger anyway.</li>
            <li> Exspensive dont waste your time they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The only issue we had was broken bulbs upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Both of my hand would not fit into the device.</li>
            <li> My thumbs could not fit.</li>
            <li> After having trouble with gel polishes not drying or looking right,I just put it aside and forgot about it.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the unit wasn&#x27;t that heavy</li>
            <li> Too small for both hand</li>
            <li> Money wasted!</li>
            <li> How I could order it late on a Friday night, and have it in my home Sunday still blows me</li>
            <li> So I had to return the product back :(</li>
            <li> The plastic seems a bit thin but it doesnt affect its performance.</li>
            <li> the very expensive extra bulb advertised was not included with prouct as advertised..very disappointed</li>
            <li> this is USELESS.</li>
            <li> I figured that maybe it would fix whatever I did wrong.</li>
            <li> Since I was unable to get the unit&#x27;s lights to work, I returned to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just seems as though I received a dud.</li>
            <li> She got so angry</li>
            <li> and I felt sorry for her.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s make me feel disappointed</li>
            <li> When we got it, 1 of the lights was already burned out. :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

            <li> The package did not come with the extra lamp but still a good deal. I had a single hand unit and this is definitely worth the money because it cuts cure time in half.</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t work wait for the seller sent me the replace</li>
            <li> Arrived in two days! LOVE this lamp</li>
            <li> I love my uv ligh. It works  great even when using polish.</li>
            <li> I bought this lamp for my friend as her birthday gift. Her job is a Nail Artist, so it is really a good gift to her. My friend said this lamp worked well and the timer setting was clever, her customers can set up by themselves and it save her time to service the customers, so she can service more customers. Cause it can work with various kinds of UV Gel nail products, it gave her a big help</li>
            <li> Okay I had purchase this product on March 27,2015 &amp; it didn&#x27;t not turn ON at all. So I had to return the product back :( hopefully this time that I order the second time ( 4/26/2015 )the product will work .Please send me a uv lamp that works :)</li>
            <li> It does not dry nail polish in 5 minutes it takes 4 to 5 times that to dry than a regular fan. This comes with a fan inside it that hardly blows any air out and it gets hot waiting for your nails to dry. Don&#x27;t buy this if you are looking for quick speed and  for this to do the job of drying your nail polish this is USELESS. I even tried it drying between coats so that it wouldn&#x27;t take so long to dry. It doesn&#x27;t work regardless what you do. I followed the positive comments on this item before I purchased and believe me I was fooled big time.</li>
            <li> Our grand daughter really loves it.</li>
            <li> It works well.  The unit arrived yesterday night and it seemed used.  It has scratches on the top and inside of the machine.  Dont know if they meant to send me a used item or not.  Other than that, it works well.</li>
            <li> I had a LED light from Sensationail.  It cured gel nail polish just fine.  I think it was 9 watts. I got a gel kit for nail tips, it wouldn&#x27;t cure the gel properly.  I ordered this UV lamp just for that purpose. it has three timers, a 2,3 and 5 minute timer.  The 3 minute timer is perfect for curing the gel builder.  You can fit both hands into this lamp.  it&#x27;s the kind you would find in a nail shop.  It has a fan to dry regular nail polish also.  Powerful enough to cure builder nail gel.</li>
            <li> I have spent much money each year in salon, as I feel naked without nail art. My mama said this is a kind of obsessive, and too much nail painting will not so good to health. While I am just sucked in it and go to salon quite frequently. While this one release me free, I have begun to treat my nails at home, as I have saw so many times, I know each step and this nail dryer dry so quickly. Love it so much.</li>
            <li> Offered free shipping, but then charged me! Also it said it came with a spare light, it didn&#x27;t! Other than that the light works fine</li>
            <li> I really like it&#x27;s , I used for salon</li>
            <li> I did not receive the extra bulb, but other than that the product so far has been great!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, product received as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a great product. The dual functions make it a perfect choice for someone who at times needs the UV lamp for the gel/shellac nails and then just the air drying for regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> Too small for both hand</li>
            <li> Did not come with the &amp;#34;extra bulb&amp;#34; as described in product description</li>
            <li> My lamp came minus the &amp;#34;extra bulb&amp;#34; &amp; with two of the six bulbs shattered.  Not excited about having to wait to use it. Other than that it seems ok.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail dryer for my sister as a birthday gift. She loves it very much!  The machine was safely well packed, and had no damage during the shipment. She said that the dryer is easy to operate and cures the polish very quickly. She is very happy with this lamp.! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the uv light. Over all great deal. I used gelish and gel builder and it cured really nice. Don&#x27;t hesitate  buy the uv lamp. Also it arrived earlier than expected.:)</li>
            <li> Exspensive dont waste your time they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I had brought uv lamp when i had got the package the light bulb inside broken I want to return it but I didn&#x27;t have information to contact that&#x27;s make me feel disappointed</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Works just as well as the salon!</li>
            <li> Work perfect. Like it a lot and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this!!!! works amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love! I have purchased many uv and led lights and this by far is one of the best one I got! And it was the cheapest!!</li>
            <li> Works great! The bulbs are easy to install. The buzzer on the timer is a little loud, but other than that it works perfect!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the extra bulb, but I like it. It does its job</li>
            <li> Garbage....do not order this item price was to good to be true. I&#x27;ll try my  luck somewhere else</li>
            <li> they work great and are light weight. unfortunately, bottom doesnt remove for easy pedi access</li>
            <li> Great amazing lamp it didn&#x27;t come with the extra bulb but I ain&#x27;t trippin.....I&#x27;m so in love with the lamp, packaging was on point and delivery was fast  it&#x27;s a great lamp if you don&#x27;t wanna spend a lot 😁😁😁</li>
            <li> We get tons of use out of this lamp.  Works great.  reasonable price</li>
            <li> It works perfect...haven&#x27;t found any problems with it so far</li>
            <li> I originally gave this a 3 star due to a bulb being broken.  I was contacted by Laurie a customer service rep.  She immediately sent me a coupon for a free bulb.  Top notch customer service.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Got it ship and the light doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Shipment was quick &amp; painless. The only issue we had was broken bulbs upon arrival. The lamp should have more personalized settings, but all in all, worth the money!</li>
            <li> I paid $60 for this uv lamp in February, didn&#x27;t get to use it until April just to set it up and find out that it doesn&#x27;t work and can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s been over 30 days! Money wasted!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Works well. Just make sure you or your clients have your thumbs flat so the light cures them.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about this lamp after reading some reviews, but I pulled the trigger anyway. I wanted a two-hand lamp, and the price was right! So far, I&#x27;m pleased with how the lamp works. Something about it does make me wonder if it will have trouble down the line, but five manicures in, it&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this purchase. Love the timer settings, light and other features. The nail dryer has three timer functions up to 5 mins. For me the shortest time 2 mins is enough. There is very big space for two hands, so I never worry that my thumbs and little fingers won&#x27;t be well dried. I have not used the fan function yet. It seems to be very interesting.</li>
            <li> Worked really well until two weeks ago went to turn on and wouldn&#x27;t turn on.. I didn&#x27;t even have it for two weeks before it quit.</li>
            <li> Best money i ever spent! my nails dry and cure themselves like i had them done at the salon! and makes my cheaper nail polish last a bit longer!:) well packaged too!</li>
            <li> The fan does not work properly on the Melody Susie.  I could not dry my nails because a very small amount of air came from the fan. It was not enough air to dry my nails. Both of my hand would not fit into the device. My thumbs could not fit. The item does not live up to its description.</li>
            <li> After having trouble with gel polishes not drying or looking right,I just put it aside and forgot about it.So when I had the chance to get this 8item I figured that maybe it would fix whatever I did wrong.And it did.This is so neat.I like the fact that it has 3 speeds.That way you cqn customize how long you want to take.The fact that it comes with an exhaust chip to keep 5he motor cool is really smart.That increases how long it las5s and itcuts down on your hqnds being too hot.The best part I like though is 5that you can dry both hands at the same time.That&#x27;s just awesome.As a bonus it also drys your feet.I am totally satisfied with this product.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> Very well made.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a gift. The unit comes with 6 UV bulbs you pop in,&lt;br /&gt;it plugs in and starts up without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;The opening is so big it fits both of my man hands inside.&lt;br /&gt;The fan does a good job to blow the heat from the bulbs away from you.&lt;br /&gt;You peel the blue plastic off the bottom panel when you install the bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;You pick constant on , or your choice of certain minute settings.&lt;br /&gt;Cures UV gel polish better than a nail salon.</li>
            <li> Item was packaged well and just like the picture. The only complaint is I wish the fan was a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> Ok, finally I had a chance to use my new UV lamp ( 3 times to be exact, making sure I will give an honest review).&lt;br /&gt; I am a very picky customer  but  I am satisfied. The lamp is awesome for the money I have spend and  does an excellent job. I am  using  CND brand for nail polish , so far my manicure and pedicure which is DYI got lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this light . Everything about it . It works very well . I love that I can keep it running continuesly and freeze my gels when I&#x27;m doing a gel design . I did a review and it is on video on YouTube here at this link ......https://youtu.be/5dyh9ZOSeiU</li>
            <li> Works great! Gets pretty hot in there when I&#x27;m doing my nails. I&#x27;ve only used it for gels and the three minute setting for each coat has worked flawlessly. I saw people were saying their nails were still tacky after they applied the top coat for gels. However, when you&#x27;re done drying your top coat, wiping your nails with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol removes the tacky stuff without stripping the top coat off. Doing this, I haven&#x27;t had any issues setting my gels. Very happy with this product. I use it once every other week and no issues!</li>
            <li> Got here when they said it would. I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this now I don&#x27;t have to pay so much to get my nails done I do them in the comfort of my own home</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had this light for 5 months and it isn&#x27;t working... I thought it worked great until the thing stopped working on me and now I am out the money... I thought it would at least last longer then this... What a joke!</li>
            <li> product did not come as advertised...the very expensive extra bulb advertised was not included with prouct as advertised..very disappointed</li>
            <li> Love it my nails look great and I am not paying $40 every 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Works great. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am SO pleased with this Gel polish light that I had to share my experience with everyone wanting to make this investment.&lt;br /&gt;After buying two other brands and finding them either totally useless, one dryer took 45 minutes to dry one hand, and the other had a compartment that even my tiny hand wouldn&#x27;t go inside, I saw this offer. The price is UNBEATABLE! This is a professional light just like is used at nail salons. Both hands or feet can be done at the same time and it only takes a few minutes for your nails to be TOTALLY dry and ready for everyday use. How I could order it late on a Friday night, and have it in my home Sunday still blows me away!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to buy a gel polish manicure light, look no further.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It stop working in a matter of 2 weeks.need to return</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok , I  thought that it would dry the nails faster  but it didn&#x27;t , not to impressed with it ,but i will keep on using it for the time that i have it .</li>
            <li> Bought for wife.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> Great lamp and great price. I love it is wide to cure both hands at a time!</li>
            <li> This thing did not work.  First off, I did not get the ex bulb that was promised and it wouldn&#x27;t of made any difference.  This light did not heat up and it did not dry the nails.  I don&#x27;t know what the expected time frame is but I did two five minutes and the nails were as wet as can be.  One hour later, they still had not dried.  I will be returning the item this week.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, works great</li>
            <li> First of all, this unit did not come with the extra bulb as promised. Turned it on (even after rearranging bulbs) and couldn&#x27;t get the lights to work. The unit itself was definitely on and operating; the fan was working. The fan itself wasn&#x27;t too powerful, though. Since I was unable to get the unit&#x27;s lights to work, I returned to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive things about this unit: It seemed like it would be easy to store. The design is pretty slick, and I thought that the buttons for operation were great. I liked that you were able to set a timer for your nails, if needed. Additionally, the unit wasn&#x27;t that heavy and it was fairly easy to read the directions and put the bulbs in the unit. Unfortunately, it just seems as though I received a dud.</li>
            <li> When we got it, 1 of the lights was already burned out. :(</li>
            <li> I love this!!! Just like being in a nail salon! But at home :)</li>
            <li> All I can say is I bought this for my girlfriend because she always hit a nail before ether were completely dry and the process started over. She got so angry and I felt sorry for her. So I went on the look out for a nail dryer for her. This one lets you paint both hands or feet at same time and both fit in dryer with room to spare.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped with bulbs in separate box. Super easy to install. And has 6 bulbs that are u-shaped.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. 1 button for power. 1 button to turn fan on/off. and one button to set time.&lt;br /&gt;It pays for itself pretty quickly. Before she spent hours paint just hers nails. That is waiting on the dry time and repairing one that always got hit. She could not sit still long enough to dry was the problem. And now the nails dry in minutes and she is up and going in just one time.&lt;br /&gt;The machine plugs in a regular home outlet and I wanted that to stay away from buying batteries all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money in my opinion when you consider how much you can spend going to the salon a few time a month.</li>
            <li> Great product and I am saving tons of money by doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> It works great for my girl. She works at a nail place and it helps her out great with all her clients. She has had it for almost 2 months and it still works one hundred percent. It saves her a lot of time, specially with it beeing able to fit boths hands in it. The plastic seems a bit thin but it doesnt affect its performance. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter use it all the time. They both really love it. No issues here well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Only received 6 bulbs not the 7 extra like was stated.</li>
            <li> Love!! Cures fast &amp; I can fit both hands in at a time!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! I have purchased two of these now and both work great. Very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Awesome nail dryer.  Drying 2 hands at once is great time saver!</li>
            <li> can i use this with regular nail polish ??</li>

When she got this, she is so happy ,  and said will buy lots of nail polish and do it at home. By the way, her  technique is very good. Anyway, she is happy, so I am happy, thanks!</li>
