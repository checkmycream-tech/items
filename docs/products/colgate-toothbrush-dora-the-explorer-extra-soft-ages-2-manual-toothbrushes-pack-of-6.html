            <li>Good brush at good price for 2 yr old.</li>
            <li>I love subscribe and save</li>
            <li>but I bought the 6-pack expecting more variety in color.</li>
            <li>They have attractive colors and bristle are soft.</li>
            <li>I think if she were older we would be more pleased!</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes are fine</li>
            <li>It helps make brushing fun when they have their favorite characters \\&quot;helping\\&quot; them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also I have a smaller than normal size mouth, so a child&#x27;s size toothbrush is perfect!</li>
            <li>My kids love these toothbrushes and it is nice to get a couple of different designs.</li>
            <li>Yes I have to order many of this because my boy chew these up so fast.</li>

            <li>My little one loved these and loves to brush now.</li>
            <li>Great price at the time since we are replacing toothbrushes at least every 3 months.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush, small bristles.</li>
            <li>The package came with 3 yellow and 3 purple ones, so easy for the two kids to identify which is theirs.</li>
            <li>While there are 2 colors involved pink is prominently featured on all 6 brushes.</li>
            <li>so what can I do other than buying more.  </li>
            <li>you have a Dora fan in your household who is 5 or older, I suggest trying [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Very soft &amp; gentle brush.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>My daughter either likes the aquafresh baby toothbrush or the oral-b baby toothbrushes and the bristles are SUPER soft and the head of the toothbrushes are smaller than these Colgate toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>She changed new Toothbrush every three months.</li>
            <li>I have a mouth condition which causes my mouth and gums to be very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Your little Dora fan will love these toothbrushes, especially if you pair them with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>But, it is a soft brush</li>
            <li>Nice thick handle but bristles seem to wear out faster than other kids toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>These Colgate toothbrushes are for ages 2 - 5 and feature extra soft bristles.</li>

            <li> These toothbrushes will make your little Dora fan eager to brush her teeth. And the price is right too.</li>
            <li> Very soft &amp; gentle brush.  Children tend to brush too hard when they are trying to learn and this brush does not damage their gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dora on the brush is a bonus if your child is a Dora fan.</li>
            <li> Nice thick handle but bristles seem to wear out faster than other kids toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This pack of toothbrushes is great and they are an amazing price but my daughter who is 2 complains of the toothbrush hurting her and I would have to agree that the bristles are a little tough in my opinion for a 2 year old. Also I think the size of the brush head is a little too big for her mouth. My daughter either likes the aquafresh baby toothbrush or the oral-b baby toothbrushes and the bristles are SUPER soft and the head of the toothbrushes are smaller than these Colgate toothbrushes! If you have a 3 year old who loves Dora I would say these would be GREAT, but not for any younger in my opinion. :) So we are going to save the rest of the toothbrushes till she is older and see how they work. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because the quality of the toothbrush is great but not for us right now! I think if she were older we would be more pleased!</li>
            <li> my boy likes it ! And he likes brushing his teeth now!</li>
            <li> Very soft and gentle.Its colorful so your kid will like this&lt;br /&gt; Its come in three colors two of each.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it.She use everyday. She changed new Toothbrush every three months. You should get those for your girl too.</li>
            <li> Size is good for child at age 4 to 5. My daughter likes it.</li>
            <li> Good brush at good price for 2 yr old. Does not last long.</li>
            <li> Good product. Not junk.</li>
            <li> Buying these things in bulk helps me to keep up with changing them on a regular basis. You can&#x27;t find this price in stores. I love subscribe and save</li>
            <li> These Colgate toothbrushes are for ages 2 - 5 and feature extra soft bristles. These are best for children who still have their front baby teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received 3 different designs in the box of individually packaged toothbrushes.  Your little Dora fan will love these toothbrushes, especially if you pair them with [[ASIN:B000MANVN6 Colgate Dora The Explorer Fluoride Toothpaste, Mild Bubble Fruit Flavor, 4.6 oz, (Case of 12)]].  The Dora toothbrushes and toothpaste are a big hit in my household.  It helps make brushing fun when they have their favorite characters \\&quot;helping\\&quot; them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a Dora fan in your household who is 5 or older, I suggest trying [[ASIN:B001G7Q1N6 Colgate Powered Toothbrush, Dora The Explorer, Extra Soft, 1 Toothbrush (Pack of 3)]].</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes are fine but I bought the 6-pack expecting more variety in color. While there are 2 colors involved pink is prominently featured on all 6 brushes. I have a son and daughter and there isn&#x27;t enough to distinguish &amp;#34;hers&amp;#34; from &amp;#34;his&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I got 6 toothbrushes with 3 options.  My girls were really happy with the Dora toothbrushes and they have been working great with no falling apart.  I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> My little one loved these and loves to brush now. They have attractive colors and bristle are soft. Good buy</li>
            <li> Great price at the time since we are replacing toothbrushes at least every 3 months.</li>
            <li> The pack I received came in two pairs of three different toothbrushes.  Came individually packaged.  Should be enough to get my daughter through her Dora stage and possibly give any extras away to another Dora fan.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, small bristles. Wish it was a little softer for extra soft.</li>
            <li> Good product, and I have try out many brand name this seem to be the best shape and use.  Yes I have to order many of this because my boy chew these up so fast. But, it is a soft brush so what can I do other than buying more.  I wish amazon also carry the next stage toothbrush.</li>
            <li> No complaints. It&#x27;s subscribe and save, inexpensive and the two toddlers use them. The package came with 3 yellow and 3 purple ones, so easy for the two kids to identify which is theirs. Yay for subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> My kids love these toothbrushes and it is nice to get a couple of different designs. Bristles are durable enough to get a nice clean smile.</li>
            <li> I am an adult female. I have a mouth condition which causes my mouth and gums to be very sensitive. Also I have a smaller than normal size mouth, so a child&#x27;s size toothbrush is perfect!</li>
