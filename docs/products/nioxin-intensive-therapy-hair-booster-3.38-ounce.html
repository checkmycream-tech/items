    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My best friend is a beautician, and they recommend that you change shampoos, etc.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful service.  </li>
            <li>Eight days from order date, I suppose that&#x27;s as good as it gets from Amazon and UPS&#x27;s efforts these days.</li>
            <li>Will let you know results in about 2-3 weeks, product does smell good, minty like the system 4 shampoo.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in perfect condition!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for some time and find it very effective and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>i put it on at night,hoping the extended time will work better.</li>
            <li>My hair as be able to maintain its growth and have not seen any more hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>once you see good results (new hair growth).</li>
            <li>Once I changed it up, my hair was fine.  </li>
            <li>If the tape was placed to prevent leakage, fine, but tacky.</li>
            <li>I used the System 8 Nioxin Hair Care products, in conjunction with the Intensive Hair Follicle Booster at the hairline for a few months for thinning hair after my pregnancy, and it seemed to work great!  </li>
            <li>Nice, but does it really work?</li>
            <li>I have a large bald spot on my head and sure hope this will help.thanks.glad amazon had it AVAILABLE.THANKS.</li>
            <li>The bottle was full however.</li>
            <li>So far, it has helped my hair be more shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>This has been a product that was recommended to me by my hair stylist and she was right...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t specify how it should best be applied, to wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>It is really not expensive if you consider what it does for you.</li>
            <li>With service this slow, consumers should have more options, surely, the United States Postal service could match the delivery time and cost.</li>
            <li>Used the whole bottle over a months time and there is no evidence whatsoever</li>
            <li>and I feel like it has a very soothing effect for me.  </li>
            <li>BECAUSE, I NEVER SAW ANY REAL HAIR GROWTH.  </li>
            <li>I think the main thing in these products are oils that irritate your scalp to stimulate blood flow.</li>
            <li>I have experimented with both, and think it&#x27;s better to apply the scalp treatment to wet hair and then blow dry, but you are supposed to apply the follicle booster first...</li>
            <li>I have been using the follicle booster since Dec. &#x27;09, I myself haven&#x27;t noticed my hair getting thicker or notice new growth</li>
            <li>stimulating circulation is a known technique for fighting hair loss, but it&#x27;s nothing unique and not worth the ick factor, to me.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is filling in naturally.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and not greasy</li>
            <li>Cannot rate the product as it has not been used, however, upon taking the bottle out of the box, the first unusual thing I noticed is that the bottle had black electrical tape across the lid.</li>
            <li>and my stylist said she can see small short hairs on the top.</li>
            <li>hope to see some hair growth later on, or maybe some thicker hair.it is easy to use and has no strong odor.</li>
            <li>If it grows hair (tho I suspect it won&#x27;t do more for me than my Hair Max has already done), I will figure out a way to live with it, but as of right now, I&#x27;m really doubtful.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if this product works at all, and I&#x27;m committed to finishing out my bottle, but if you are not extremely careful in applying it, it will stick your hair together to the point where you are likely to lose some of it when you brush.</li>
            <li>The scalp treatment, especially, is hard to apply and keep your hair looking and feeling nice.</li>

            <li> I wish I had known how very nasty and gunky this would make my hair feel after application, and especially after applying the scalp treatment afterwards, as you are supposed to.</li>

            <li> I have been using the follicle booster since Dec. &#x27;09, I myself haven&#x27;t noticed my hair getting thicker or notice new growth (whatever that looks like) Went to get my hair cut and my stylist said she can see small short hairs on the top. (crown) Maybe, maybe not.  Time will tell.  At least my hair isn&#x27;t falling out any longer.</li>
            <li> I used the System 8 Nioxin Hair Care products, in conjunction with the Intensive Hair Follicle Booster at the hairline for a few months for thinning hair after my pregnancy, and it seemed to work great!  I did notice some ADDITIONAL thinning for a while that was a little disturbing, and resumed using my regular shampoo/conditioner.  Once I changed it up, my hair was fine.  After about a month and a half of using the Nioxin, I would switch back for a while to give your scalp a break.  My best friend is a beautician, and they recommend that you change shampoos, etc. ocassionally anyways.  Now my hair is filling in naturally.  I would suggest using the Nioxin products every two weeks once you see good results (new hair growth).</li>
            <li> I like this product. I started to see hair growth within a week after using this Nioxin booster.My hair feels soft and not greasy and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time and find it very effective and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I received this order in a bottle that was dirty and only half full. The item looked as if it had been used and/or returned . I also ordered Lipogen and received a bottle thaa is due to expire in 2 m onths. I am returning it. I could not return the Nioxin because there was no return address or phone number included. From now on I will stick to ordering CD&#x27;S and Books, &amp; DVD&#x27;s .&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Zulma C. Stevenson</li>
            <li> have been using for about 3 weeks. hope to see some hair growth later on, or maybe some thicker hair.it is easy to use and has no strong odor. i put it on at night,hoping the extended time will work better.Only time will tell.I have a large bald spot on my head and sure hope this will help.thanks.glad amazon had it AVAILABLE.THANKS.</li>
            <li> I have been taking the Nioxin Vitamines for about 6 months now and I do believe that my hair has gotten thicker.  I use all of the Nioxin products on my hair which as I understand it is the key to having thicker hair.  If someone has hair that has become thinner over the years and the hair folicle isn&#x27;t dead I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known how very nasty and gunky this would make my hair feel after application, and especially after applying the scalp treatment afterwards, as you are supposed to. I have no idea if this product works at all, and I&#x27;m committed to finishing out my bottle, but if you are not extremely careful in applying it, it will stick your hair together to the point where you are likely to lose some of it when you brush. The scalp treatment, especially, is hard to apply and keep your hair looking and feeling nice. It&#x27;s just so sticky! Takes a long time to dry, too, so don&#x27;t apply it with the idea of running out the door. It doesn&#x27;t specify how it should best be applied, to wet or dry hair. I have experimented with both, and think it&#x27;s better to apply the scalp treatment to wet hair and then blow dry, but you are supposed to apply the follicle booster first... I think the main thing in these products are oils that irritate your scalp to stimulate blood flow. It says that&#x27;s a result of the \\&quot;vitamins\\&quot;, but I know peppermint oil when I smell it, and that&#x27;s a skin irritant. Other skin irritants are listed in the ingredients. As I said, I don&#x27;t know if it works or not...stimulating circulation is a known technique for fighting hair loss, but it&#x27;s nothing unique and not worth the ick factor, to me. If it grows hair (tho I suspect it won&#x27;t do more for me than my Hair Max has already done), I will figure out a way to live with it, but as of right now, I&#x27;m really doubtful.</li>
            <li> recommended by my hair dresser , I began using this product. My hair as be able to maintain its growth and have not seen any more hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination with other Nioxin products- it simple works</li>
            <li> So far, it has helped my hair be more shiny and manageable.  It will take time to see if it works with the scalp treatment for support hair renewal.</li>
            <li> This product works! I have used it off and on for ten years and it grows hair everytime if you do what the instructions say to do.  The only thing that I worry about with this product is discontinuing it.  Your hair grows back at a pace that you will notice week to week.  It is really not expensive if you consider what it does for you.</li>
            <li> Just received this product today. Eight days from order date, I suppose that&#x27;s as good as it gets from Amazon and UPS&#x27;s efforts these days. With service this slow, consumers should have more options, surely, the United States Postal service could match the delivery time and cost. Cannot rate the product as it has not been used, however, upon taking the bottle out of the box, the first unusual thing I noticed is that the bottle had black electrical tape across the lid. The tape also looked like it had been removed and replaced, for there were traces of residue from former tape. The bottle was full however. If the tape was placed to prevent leakage, fine, but tacky. No pun intended. Will let you know results in about 2-3 weeks, product does smell good, minty like the system 4 shampoo.</li>
            <li> to work well with the System 2 Step 3. But as most hair products this stuff is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I AM HOPING THIS STILL WORKS AS IT DID FOR ME JUST A FEW YRS. AGO.....SOMETIMES THE PRODUCT INGREDIENTS HAVE CHANGED.....I AM STILL WAITING TO SEE THE GROWTH FACTOR.</li>
            <li> A big waste of money.  Used the whole bottle over a months time and there is no evidence whatsoever that any folicles have been boosted!&lt;br /&gt;Another bottle of promises broken.  Hair still falling out.</li>
            <li> I think I would have been bald by now... but i reallly like the way this makes my hair look</li>
            <li> This has been a product that was recommended to me by my hair stylist and she was right... it totally helps thinning hair and I feel like it has a very soothing effect for me.  I recommend it to anyone needing this sort of product!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Wonderful service.  Arrived quickly and in perfect condition!  Thank you.  Will definitely buy again soon.</li>
            <li> Nice, but does it really work?</li>
            <li> Nioxin is helping me a lot.I have been using it daily and my hair is growing back  again.My hair looks healthier and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002O0D8P8 Nioxin System 4 Cleanser and Scalp Therapy Liter Set (33 oz)]]</li>
            <li> I CANNOT TELL YOU IF THIS PRODUCT WORKED BECAUSE, I NEVER SAW ANY REAL HAIR GROWTH.  PURCHASED IT ON THE SUGGESTION OF MY HAIRDRESSER.  PURCHASED SEVERAL BOTTLES.  WOULD NOT BUT AGAIN.  SUGGEST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN GO TO MS. JESSIE&#x27;S HAIR PRODUCTS FOR HAIR GROWTH.</li>
            <li> It stops the itching of my scalp (from years of colouring) and stopped my hair loss, not the thinning though.</li>
