            <li>This is an excellent product and the company gives excellent service if there is a problem.  </li>
            <li>Arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>best one I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;holds</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best!!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li>Best length for me.  </li>
            <li>It is very handy for picking up fallen things, and especially handy for picking up needles because of the magnet on the end.</li>
            <li>excellent item good price</li>
            <li>Now that she has one of the Sammons upstairs and one downstairs, she is a happy camper.</li>
            <li>Great replacement for my mother&#x27;s broker reacher.  </li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>They are great for grabbing things off the floor without bending over, i.e., tissues, paper, lighter weight objects, etc.</li>
            <li>Great tool....</li>
            <li>I bought two since the price was so great.  </li>
            <li>The adjustables are just OK at best.</li>
            <li>Sammons Preston Rolyan Reacher - 26&amp;#34; is a great tool , my wife liked it so well, she had me look for a 32.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>so I think  i am in good shape...</li>
            <li>This was a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good item nice magnet at end to pick up metals.</li>
            <li>, the magent in the end comes in handy too.</li>
            <li>Good quality and shipped to me very quickly.</li>
            <li>it picks up mostly everything ...and is nice and strong...</li>
            <li>My husband was able to straighten it out.</li>
            <li>The 32&amp;#34; model, I like better.  </li>
            <li>Being committed to a wheelchair, it ix always on hand and the longer fold up model gives me greater distance</li>
            <li>Just be sure you understand that they are talking about &amp;#34;Over All&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great product fast shipping A++++++</li>
            <li>if I need more I know where to find them</li>
            <li>Seems rather flimsy and doesn&#x27;t work on many items on shelves.</li>
            <li>glad I bought THIS one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparently I need to type more words.  </li>
            <li>and, it is WAY better than the Pick-Stiks I have.</li>
            <li>Besides having a magnet on it, it is just easier to user and gets most things I wanted to pick up.</li>
            <li>be sure to get one for all the rooms or floors you need it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and easy to handle</li>
            <li>It works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The reacher works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Works easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>I am going to compare the Sammons Reacher (this one) with the Duro-Med Reacher, also available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Inevitably things fall on the floor, and these are a great help.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very handy for him with is back problems.  </li>
            <li>It works well most of the time but the grabber ends often stick together if you don&#x27;t grab the item on your first try.</li>
            <li>But, if yours doesn&#x27;t meet perfectly at the end, it won&#x27;t pick up small items off the floor.  </li>
            <li>JUST THE RIGHT LENGTH!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking from someone who has used reachers since I saw my first one maybe 20 years ago,  this style has been the most useful and dependable.  </li>
            <li>She had another one that she liked and bought another brand which did not work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>If you need the can from the top of the stack, you can get it without toppling the whole pile.  </li>
            <li>I have had several different kinds and this one seems to be the best...</li>
            <li>Wonderful aide following my back surgeries.</li>
            <li>mostly backing into something and catching the reacher end on something and snapping one of the sides; or back up too fast and ram the reacher into a wall.  </li>
            <li>The fixed Pik-Stiks are much better but still, do not always have the grab power or finesse needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More precise than other grabbers, easier to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>A lot better quality than the standard reacher you see at Wal-Mart (my mother-in-law torched two of those).  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the grabbar I had in the rehab</li>
            <li>These were reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li>I live in a power chair, and some kind of reacher is an essential for my quality of life.  </li>
            <li>It was great, picked up very small items, including a hearing aid battery, and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>Use it for pretty much everything besides kitchen duties.</li>
            <li>My husband has created a way for me to carry one on my previous scooters and now on my super-dooper deluxe wheelchair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The magnets on the two devices are equal; the gripping jaws of the two devices are about equal in effectiveness, but the Sammons will provide a longer useful life.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, can retrieve the smallest objects, yet is capable of holding heavier objects.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>My mother-in-law really likes this type of reacher.  </li>
            <li>I paid too much for them.</li>
            <li>It takes real skill to do these tricks.  </li>
            <li>This product is a lifesaver and helps me be very independent (and not a burden to my wife).&lt;br /&gt;Great design, easy to use, durable and built well.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super fast and arrived much quicker than the &#x27;standard shipping&#x27; estimated date.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I still highly recommend this product and the company.</li>
            <li>how a &#x27;low tech&#x27; device like this is so useful and important.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are average height, the 26 inch is fine.</li>
            <li>a black plastic covered screw on the top end, used as a hook to open drawers and cabinet doors, (3)</li>
            <li>In his early days home from the hospital, he found the reacher invaluable.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same &amp;#34;picky stick&amp;#34; that the our local hospital presents to their hip replacement patients, as a consolation prize.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this especially if you&#x27;ve been advised not to bend over.</li>
            <li>an all purpose gripper jaw to pick up trash, clothing, shoes, and just about any other light weight items, does no work very well on heavy items.  </li>
            <li>So I bought two Pik-Stiks from Amazon at fixed solid lengths.</li>
            <li>I have broken so many reachers over the years.</li>
            <li>The little black hook on the top of the reacher end tipped the scales.  </li>
            <li>First of all it came bent almost in half,</li>
            <li>the hook or grabby part is weak, cheap, and flimsy.</li>
            <li>This was the name brand of the reacher I received in the hospital, which still works, other than normal wear and tear.</li>

            <li> The Duro-Med has recently introduced a new feature, allowing the reacher to be folded in half.  </li>
            <li> Some of the magnets are on the flat end and some have magnets on</li>
            <li> But eventually, you’ll want one in your bedroom, kitchen, and other major rooms you are in like family room, craft room, workshop, or office.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my sister-in-law who is a professional seamstress in Green Cove Springs, Florida.  </li>
            <li> and it was a bit too long.  </li>
            <li> I tried other brands of reachers but they didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> To long!  </li>
            <li> This model is now the only one she has used for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> I bought this grabber because for some reason the stores seems to put the stuff that sells on the very top shelves, with the crap that don&#x27;t sell is on the eye level shelves.</li>
            <li> You can use it to pick up very small and mid size objects, but it doesn&#x27;t work well for things such as larger glass jars.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to send it back.</li>
            <li> This feature is terrible - it causes the reacher to break in half when you attempt to use the screw-hook, or the lift something heavy, and makes to Sammons the far superior device.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to bend down to pick things up.  </li>
            <li> Came apart in less than 3 days.</li>
            <li> A big help to those who have painful arthritis, back pain, etc.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t stick or catch and picks up small objects.  </li>
            <li> She could pick up as small an object as a pill without damaging it.</li>
            <li> In a small home, one for each floor.</li>
            <li> Needless to say this product stinks, it is not even worth the time or money to return it, it can be used for PICKING UP DOG S</li>
            <li> The working ends of the two reachers have three devices or tools to help users: (1) on the very tip, a magnet, used to pick up pins and small metal hardware, (2)</li>
            <li> The usual hard stuff, paper, cards, pictures are still a pain to pick up though.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> Anyway sometimes things are hard to reach</li>
            <li> I never like to write a negative review, but this product needs one.</li>
            <li> When you drop the sock behind the washing machine, (yes, I have done that</li>
            <li> And of course how does that sock (the mate of the one behind the washer) get WAY under the bed?  </li>
            <li> dropped behind my washer and dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re doing anything wrong.</li>
            <li> Aldi for an insane price of $6 a piece.</li>

            <li> The reacher works fine for me. I tried other brands of reachers but they didn&#x27;t last as long. This was the name brand of the reacher I received in the hospital, which still works, other than normal wear and tear. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that the reacher was bent at the tip when it arrived. It was shipped in a bag. My husband was able to straighten it out. Too much trouble to send it back.</li>
            <li> This grabber/reacher exceeds all expectations.  It was delivered in a timely manner too!</li>
            <li> I never like to write a negative review, but this product needs one. First of all it came bent almost in half, the hook or grabby part is weak, cheap, and flimsy.

            <li> JUST THE RIGHT LENGTH!</li>
            <li> Sammons Preston Rolyan Reacher - 26&amp;#34; is a great tool , my wife liked it so well, she had me look for a 32.&amp;#34;  Both 26&amp;#34; and 32&amp;#34; are sturdily made and we put them to task every day.  I find the 26&amp;#34; model a bit too short, so I have to bend somewhat.  The 32&amp;#34; model, I like better.  I would recommend the 32&amp;#34; model to everyone, but the 26&amp;#34; model works just as well.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my father ... It&#x27;s very handy for him with is back problems.  He uses it all the time . It&#x27;s very light and easy to handle</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my mother.  She had another one that she liked and bought another brand which did not work nearly as well.  Now that she has one of the Sammons upstairs and one downstairs, she is a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I live in a power chair, and some kind of reacher is an essential for my quality of life.  I am going to compare the Sammons Reacher (this one) with the Duro-Med Reacher, also available on Amazon. The working ends of the two reachers have three devices or tools to help users: (1) on the very tip, a magnet, used to pick up pins and small metal hardware, (2) a black plastic covered screw on the top end, used as a hook to open drawers and cabinet doors, (3) an all purpose gripper jaw to pick up trash, clothing, shoes, and just about any other light weight items, does no work very well on heavy items.  The Duro-Med has recently introduced a new feature, allowing the reacher to be folded in half.  This feature is terrible - it causes the reacher to break in half when you attempt to use the screw-hook, or the lift something heavy, and makes to Sammons the far superior device.  The magnets on the two devices are equal; the gripping jaws of the two devices are about equal in effectiveness, but the Sammons will provide a longer useful life.</li>
            <li> I got this after surgery so I wouldn&#x27;t have to bend down to pick things up.  It was great, picked up very small items, including a hearing aid battery, and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> It helps me pick up what I need</li>
            <li> This is the exact same &amp;#34;picky stick&amp;#34; that the our local hospital presents to their hip replacement patients, as a consolation prize.  But everyone needs one.  When you drop the sock behind the washing machine, (yes, I have done that...sigh), you can pick it up without totally moving the machine.  If you need the can from the top of the stack, you can get it without toppling the whole pile.  If the dog looses his tennis ball underneath the china cabinet, you can fish it out.  And of course how does that sock (the mate of the one behind the washer) get WAY under the bed?  Everybody needs one.</li>
            <li> It works.  I&#x27;m currently paraplegic.  Use it for pretty much everything besides kitchen duties.</li>
            <li> strongest reacher I&#x27;ve found yet, the magent in the end comes in handy too.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my mother&#x27;s broker reacher.  Works easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> This item has been a virtual life saver. It is lightweight, can retrieve the smallest objects, yet is capable of holding heavier objects. Being committed to a wheelchair, it ix always on hand and the longer fold up model gives me greater distance</li>
            <li> More precise than other grabbers, easier to use.  This one doesn&#x27;t stick or catch and picks up small objects.  Great.</li>
            <li> We sent this to our mom after her hip replacement. It works well most of the time but the grabber ends often stick together if you don&#x27;t grab the item on your first try. Then mom has to separate them with her hands. It happened to me to and I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re doing anything wrong.</li>
            <li> Just like the one a physical therapist used with my mom. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my father and several others I know who have difficulty reaching things. They are great for grabbing things off the floor without bending over, i.e., tissues, paper, lighter weight objects, etc. A big help to those who have painful arthritis, back pain, etc.</li>
            <li> Came apart in less than 3 days.</li>
            <li> Great tool.... To long!  Doesn&#x27;t pickup and hold items !  Had to order another shorter one !</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and the company gives excellent service if there is a problem.  Just be sure you understand that they are talking about &amp;#34;Over All&amp;#34; length and NOT usable length when they state a size.  Usuable length is from the finger operator to the end of the device.  The handle gripper area ( which does not add to usable length) is included in their definition of length.  Otherwise, I still highly recommend this product and the company. AAA+++</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  Bought as a gift for my sister-in-law who is a professional seamstress in Green Cove Springs, Florida.  It is very handy for picking up fallen things, and especially handy for picking up needles because of the magnet on the end.</li>
            <li> After a vehicle accident, I am on a weight bearing restriction and confined to a wheel chair for three months.  This product is a lifesaver and helps me be very independent (and not a burden to my wife).&lt;br /&gt;Great design, easy to use, durable and built well.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super fast and arrived much quicker than the &#x27;standard shipping&#x27; estimated date.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny how a &#x27;low tech&#x27; device like this is so useful and important.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> received one in hospital this brand, wanted a back up. best one I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;holds some weight. be my choice if I ever need another extra</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping A++++++</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law really likes this type of reacher.  I bought two since the price was so great.  A lot better quality than the standard reacher you see at Wal-Mart (my mother-in-law torched two of those).  Good quality and shipped to me very quickly.</li>
            <li> It helps my handicapped husband to get his shoes with Velcro on and pick up anything he dropped.</li>
            <li> My husband had a full-knee replacement.  In his early days home from the hospital, he found the reacher invaluable.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife when she had hip replacement surgery and it is a lifesaver. She could pick up as small an object as a pill without damaging it.</li>
            <li> They are as advirtized. They pick up well don,t drop things</li>
            <li> These are a godsend.  I recently had back surgery and am not supposed to bend or twist. Inevitably things fall on the floor, and these are a great help.</li>
            <li> I have medical issues which causes me to use a reacher...I have had several different kinds and this one seems to be the best...it picks up mostly everything ...and is nice and strong...I now have three so I think  i am in good shape...if I need more I know where to find them</li>
            <li> yes ;meet expectations</li>
            <li> What would I do without my reachers!  I have one in each room.  But, if yours doesn&#x27;t meet perfectly at the end, it won&#x27;t pick up small items off the floor.  In that case, it needs to be returned.</li>
            <li> Seems rather flimsy and doesn&#x27;t work on many items on shelves.</li>
            <li> Item was purchased based on a recommendation by my neighbor.  She is elderly and had tried different brands of grabbers/reachers before finding the Sammons Preston Rolyan Reacher Model 4109.  This model is now the only one she has used for the last few years.  I borrowed hers numerous times to fetch items dropped behind my washer and dryer.  It works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> good item nice magnet at end to pick up metals. clamps well and holds the items securely&lt;br /&gt;good enough for the job needed&lt;br /&gt;would buy again</li>
            <li> This is exactly the grabbar I had in the rehab center.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s perfect and I used it to help clothe me and pick up stuff.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I bought THIS one. It&#x27;s the best!!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> excellent item good price</li>
            <li> Helps my mom a lot to have this reacher.  We tried another longer one as well but that one didn&#x27;t close all the way and it was a bit too long.  Bought a 2nd one of these to keep in the bathroom.  She also has one in her bedroom.</li>
            <li> Had knee replacement.  Needed something.  This was a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently I need to type more words.  See the review titled Reacher #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lss/lds</li>
            <li> Wonderful aide following my back surgeries.😊</li>
            <li> Best length for me.  Ordered it after I got the 30&amp;#34; and 32&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have a number of grippers (what I call a reacher) and my elderly mom has just one.&lt;br /&gt;I only recently needed to use one. So I bought two Pik-Stiks from Amazon at fixed solid lengths. I paid too much for them. Then I found some adjustable Pik-Stiks at the discount store (one time only) Aldi for an insane price of $6 a piece. The adjustables are just OK at best. Often, they do not seem to have the internal power needed to pick up. The fixed Pik-Stiks are much better but still, do not always have the grab power or finesse needed.&lt;br /&gt;Human hands are indeed amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I was visiting my mom and had to use her Sammons Preston Rolyan Reacher (SPR) and, it is WAY better than the Pick-Stiks I have. Besides having a magnet on it, it is just easier to user and gets most things I wanted to pick up. The usual hard stuff, paper, cards, pictures are still a pain to pick up though.&lt;br /&gt;So do not hesitate. This is The “grabber” to get for sure.&lt;br /&gt;And be sure to get one for all the rooms or floors you need it on. In a small home, one for each floor. But eventually, you’ll want one in your bedroom, kitchen, and other major rooms you are in like family room, craft room, workshop, or office.&lt;br /&gt;If you are average height, the 26 inch is fine. If you are a tall man, maybe over 6’2” you might want the longer one.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the handle, falls off doorknobs etc</li>
            <li> I have broken so many reachers over the years. mostly backing into something and catching the reacher end on something and snapping one of the sides; or back up too fast and ram the reacher into a wall.  It takes real skill to do these tricks.  I have to keep spares, one in the vehicle and several at home.  I seem to break them in twos and threes.  I am so dependent on them now that I would not want to go even part of a day without one in my reach.  My husband has created a way for me to carry one on my previous scooters and now on my super-dooper deluxe wheelchair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking from someone who has used reachers since I saw my first one maybe 20 years ago,  this style has been the most useful and dependable.  The little black hook on the top of the reacher end tipped the scales.  And if that is magnetized it&#x27;s gravy.  Some of the magnets are on the flat end and some have magnets on both-Yeah!  These were reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this especially if you&#x27;ve been advised not to bend over. You can use it to pick up very small and mid size objects, but it doesn&#x27;t work well for things such as larger glass jars.</li>
            <li> Shorter then it seemed</li>
