            <li>have not noticed a significant difference between this product and dove soap.  </li>
            <li>I thought this product would be a good choice since it did not contain all the lab created allergens (such as sodium laurel sulfate, etc).  </li>

            <li> Finally a product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the baby product line form the company&#x27;s website and could not be more pleased. This is the first product after trying 7 other products that did not cause my baby&#x27;s eczema to worsen or cause an allergic reaction such as swelling of the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three days of use his skin on his face actually appears to be healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I purchased the body wash, lotion, shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; I am so pleased with all of them. I am rather shocked at the negative review posted here saying that the product burned someone. There is absolutely nothing in ANY of these products that I could fathom would cause burning. They are completely gentle &amp; free of any chemicals. Living in CO I get very dry skin in the winter. I have tried just about everything including many more expensive products and these are the best I have found. I am VERY pleased with the shampoo &amp; conditioner. I have very long hair and in the winter my scalp get dry &amp; flaky and the wieght of my hair actually causes my scalp to hurt! I have been using the line for a week now &amp; my hair &amp; scalp &amp; skin feel marvelous. I am a lifetime user. I only wish they had a larger size option.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and found this to be effective if used in conjunction with the other products offered by this same company.</li>
            <li> Eliminates excema caused by added chemicals in other products.</li>
            <li> U Works exactly as described. Cleared up my eczema better than I thought. And actually out performed the medical cream that was prescribed by my dermatologist. Keep in mind, everyone&#x27;s experience with this may be different due to the exact reason that may be causing your skin irritation. But from my experience, this is what helped me the most out all the products I have used.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and I will never go back to bar soap or any other liquid soaps. It suds well enough and without the clogging of drains as many soaps eventually do. I have had to have a plumber break through a drain that had been almost totally blocked be hardened soap. It was a commercial establishment where individuals used the shower daily. But aside from the cleanliness I feel using Exederm Body Wash it&#x27;s nice to know that it will never block the drains.</li>
            <li> Very clean scent, and no after shower dryness.  This body wash lathers very well, and it has a nice consistency.  It definitely is not a cure for eczema, but this is the only body wash I have found that works better than other products meant for the same skin condition.  I actually was skeptical about the effectiveness of this product, as I had never heard of it before.  Out of desperation, I ordered it, and have been pleasantly surprised.  I do wish it was more readily available in other markets.</li>
            <li> have not noticed a significant difference between this product and dove soap.  Smell is less than wonderful &#x3D;verdict is still out on whether it works</li>
            <li> I just could not get used to the lack of suds when using this product so while it&#x27;s a product reccomended by Dermatologist it just didn&#x27;t satisfy my need.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING THIS FOR SOMETIME, AS IT BABIES MY OLD BODY IN THE SHOWER....IT IS NON-ALLERGENIC, SO IT IS JUST WHAT I WANT...COMES QUICKLY FROM AMAZON, AND PRICE IS RIGHT....RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I love Exederm Body Wash!!  It&#x27;s the first body-wash I have used in a long time that hasn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;irritated my skin or sent me to ER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived with eczema since childhood.  I thought this product would be a good choice since it did not contain all the lab created allergens (such as sodium laurel sulfate, etc).  After the second use of the body wash, I broke out all over.  Same with the shampoo.  Don&#x27;t use this product because it says \\&quot;good for people with eczema.\\&quot;  Consult your dermatologist before trying such products as this.  Look for glycerine, olive oil in products and with as few additives as possible.  I use pure olive oil soap both on my skin and hair and have had no issues.  I will continue to stick to this cleansing method.</li>
            <li> I have seborrhea and the first time I used the body wash, I noticed a big difference.  It is non-irritating and does not cause my skin to dry out more.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face also and have noticed less redness.</li>
            <li> It works really well with Exederm&#x27;s other products. My son&#x27;s ezcema has been well under control since using Exederm products.</li>
            <li> I bought it once, it was OK. I haven&#x27;t bought anymore. However, I did like the moisturizer and have bought it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It was better than nothing. It was easy on my skin, During a time when I had a severe rash the body wash did not cause any pain, itching or flare ups which was awesome. Now that the rash is gone I&#x27;ve switched back to Johnson&#x27;s Baby Head to Toe Wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helps with my skin issues but I was hoping it would do more. Maybe I need to give it more time to work!</li>
            <li> Does the trick! I can only use this after recommendation by my dermatologist.  No more fancy soaps for me :(....  I feel lucky to have found pure, easy Exederm &#x3D; RELIEF from my eyelid allergic dermatitis. Thank You Exederm! !!!!!😃</li>
            <li> I have Seborrheic Dermatitis and have tried numerous products on my skin.  This body wash is great for cleansing and really does a good job taking off eye makeup too! I have very sensitive skin and this product does a great job at cleansing and not irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy not only with the product, but the price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for formulating a product for sensitive skin that works!!  I love it!!</li>
            <li> I love love love the Exederm line! It clears my chronic exzema better than prescription creams. And I&#x27;ve had exzema my entire life. I highly recommend this line for people worth skin conditions. It just works miraculously!</li>
