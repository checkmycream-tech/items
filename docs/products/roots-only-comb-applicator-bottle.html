            <li>It is a great product that is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Great simple invention for those of us that like to save money doing our own roots!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I was able to cover all my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this, it works while on my roots.</li>
            <li>Love this I bought three as gifts.</li>
            <li>Love this applicator.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use this for scalp psoriasis shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Very happy about my roots only comb applicator.</li>
            <li>This time I ordered two, just to be safe.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this applicator.</li>
            <li>But I wish that I could shut off the top so that the product can&#x27;t spill.</li>
            <li>and I can be sure it is evenly</li>
            <li>Had to keep going over and over to make sure all areas got saturated.</li>
            <li>love this product, have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair dying tool when I just want to do my roots.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product and shipping</li>
            <li>On top of that beware that the sellers advertised photos are deceptive as the package they sent to me did not look at all like the one they advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so in order to do this you have to put your hand over top of the bottle or comb teeth</li>
            <li>so it doesn’t spill, resulting in more of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but even then it would require many passes to get the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just put all my special oils in it and my hair and scalp are so appreciative.</li>
            <li>The roots only applicator is perfect and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I had even gotten pretty good at applying it with the squeeze bottles that come with boxed hair color.</li>
            <li>Love the idea, but the bottle is really cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>I loved this bottle and applicator so much..</li>
            <li>, it was so easy and within like 5 minutes</li>
            <li>It is so easy and foolproof.  </li>
            <li>Applies hair product and color evenly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Makes oiling very quickly.</li>
            <li>The first squirt was kind of tricky.</li>
            <li>A must have for anyone who uses hair color easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I used the tip on another hair color bottle, it fit..</li>
            <li>I now order two at a time so that I always have one available.</li>
            <li>The roots only bottle is a great item to have when you just want to apply oils to your scalp for a massage.  </li>
            <li>great Idea just not sturdy enough</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says, gets to the root of your hair!!</li>
            <li>Like others, I had purchased my original at Walmart</li>
            <li>Then I would have to rub it in to be sure I got everywhere, which negates the value of applying it at the roots in the first place.</li>
            <li>and it was clean..</li>
            <li>It makes the application process a WHOLE lot easier, more accurate in coverage, and a lot faster.</li>
            <li>Clean with a drop of detergent and it will not clog.</li>
            <li>I use it for oil and it allows my to oil my scalp while keeping my hands clean.</li>
            <li>I love that the bottle is large enough to hold a lot of oil and the applicator dispenses a good amount of oil.</li>
            <li>It used to took me full hour to do my hair and than I found this comb in Walmart.</li>
            <li>Handy tool for women who frequently color the grays and helps me not miss spots.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these little applicators at Walmart about a year ago and just loved it!</li>
            <li>so it melts which is at body temp and one quick squirt at her shoulder blades</li>
            <li>Like it very much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those kind of girls that doesn&#x27;t remember what their normal hair color looks like, and this item makes it much easier to stay that way.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my purpose!</li>
            <li>and I am going to pick up a few more! :-)</li>
            <li>For how cheap it is and how much it has changed my routine, it&#x27;s well worth replacing even once a year or as needed.</li>
            <li>I always had to get my hair professionally done because when my mom dyes my hair, she misses so many spots</li>
            <li>I would totally do a TV testimony for free, that&#x27;s how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I found going from hairline to the back effective for me.</li>
            <li>It gets right in between the hairs and doesn&#x27;t snag or anything.  </li>
            <li>Coloring my hair down to the roots is now accomplished quickly and more importantly, evenly!  </li>
            <li>initial impression of the product was that it came in an an attractive pink color, but it felt cheaply designed and looked like a part my husband would buy in the plumbing department at a hardware store, not something I would want to use on use on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved this for how easy it was for me to use, however on the third use the hard plastic applicator top cracked.  </li>
            <li>It takes a good half hour.</li>
            <li>was very fast</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have used this product ever since it first came out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for the DIY colorist!!</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I swear to God the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I have to treat my scalp for a skin condition and this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve replaced the first one I purchased.</li>
            <li>Bought more for back up because I couldn&#x27;t do without it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>considering I have to heat it up in hot water with my oils in it.</li>
            <li>and I think the extra time gives more control over</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>i came back and brought 2 more.</li>
            <li>I actually need a couple more of them.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>In my situation, the cap fit directly onto the bottle that came with the brand of color I use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, quality is really no different from the other applicators in the market except that this has multiple prongs so it is more effective.</li>
            <li>This is not harder or easier to clean than any other applicator bottle I&#x27;ve used, but it is easier to use than most of them!</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews of this product, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I will always use this as long as it remains available!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this would also be useful for highlights and other dye jobs aside from just roots.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely genius.</li>
            <li>This applicator saves so much time, the roots done in minutes with ease.</li>
            <li>Delivery was so fast.</li>
            <li>I really bought it for the comb because I wanted to use it with a bottle of product.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Still highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Makes applying oils to your scalp so much easier.</li>
            <li>SOME of the hair coloring will actually fit with the end of the R.O. applicator and in that case you can just use IT and toss it with only having to rinse the pink top.  </li>
            <li>the leaking was too much.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fits my need.  </li>
            <li>so be careful when screwing on the application top.</li>
            <li>PS - Thanks everyone for the helpful reviews.</li>
            <li>I sure didn’t experience it, and I found the color dye flows out more quickly than it should with my color dripping all over the place, especially when using the product on the side of your head as the farthest outside comb teeth miss your head, as the applicator is too wide, and drips all over your shoulder and the floor making the process even more messy than normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought mine MANY years ago and have used it every other month since I bought it</li>
            <li>Not useful for cream type of hair color, only good for liquid hair color.</li>
            <li>so I would not say I over tightened, but if I buy another I will be more careful not to screw top on too tightly.</li>
            <li>I am a man with short, fast growing hair, which makes white roots more of a problem.</li>
            <li>It cuts down the time that it takes and is more uniform</li>
            <li>I bought more to keep individual &amp;#34;treatments&amp;#34; from a big batch of henna in the freezer for root touch ups.</li>
            <li>Most men&#x27;s products take only 5 minutes total.</li>
            <li>I saved $70.00 and still have beautifully gorgeous long jet black hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure not to tighten it too tightly (saw someone said that theirs had cracked but mine hasn&#x27;t) and rinse it thoroughly after each use.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I get great coverage without affecting the rest of my hair and with less mess.  </li>
            <li>The applicator part itself, that&#x27;s easy to clean, just use common sense with how you put the soap on it to make it really go in there, and wash it the same way.</li>
            <li>I color my hair pretty often due to red dye is coming off so easily.</li>
            <li>and I found it so easy to use with my Jamaican Black Castor OIl which I diluted with water.</li>
            <li>The teeth make product so easy to distribute without all the mess.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty noticeable when the overall length is 1 1/4\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>first issue with the product was that to use the product (as per instructions) one has to pour their hair color from the original color manufacturer bottles and tubes into the Roots only bottle, but no funnel is provided and if you don’t have a steady hand its can get messy.  </li>
            <li>Roots Only certainly lives up to its&#x27; name.  </li>
            <li>The applicator spacing is similar to a large hair pick and maybe the product is better suited with people with really thick hair</li>
            <li>Then, after applying the dye (while you are waiting for it to set), rinse the bottle in the sink, then put the applicator on the bottle and squirt soapy water till it comes clear.</li>
            <li>In fact one of the comb teeth became clogged and required that I use a needle to attempt to clear it.  </li>
            <li>however the bottle is too soft</li>
            <li>Especially if you have very coily hair like me</li>
            <li>Once you use these you&#x27;ll be like me and look high and low to find them again!</li>
            <li>yet I found that the comb teeth are too far apart requiring that I pass the comb through my hair repeatedly over the same area quite a few times to get full coverage.</li>
            <li>This tool puts the dye on my scalp, which apparently lets it literally soak into the hair below the scalp line.</li>
            <li>I was a chore to clean, after 2 applications it  started bursting from the reservoir side.. was a mess, bulky.. more expensive.</li>
            <li>The total application time and cleanup was nearly half an hour nowhere near the “less than 5 minutes” nor “as easy a 1,2,3” as they claim on the package and ads.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting and coloring my own hair for about 10 years now (and I frequently get asked for recommendations to &amp;#34;my stylist&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, I have been using it that way for a long time but finally decided to purchase a new one d/t</li>
            <li>I hot oiled my entire head in less that 3 minutes!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Clean with a drop of detergent and it will not clog.</li>
            <li> I use it for oil and it allows my to oil my scalp while keeping my hands clean.</li>
            <li> I love that the bottle is large enough to hold a lot of oil and the applicator dispenses a good amount of oil.</li>
            <li> It used to took me full hour to do my hair and than I found this comb in Walmart.</li>
            <li> Handy tool for women who frequently color the grays and helps me not miss spots.  </li>
            <li> I bought one of these little applicators at Walmart about a year ago and just loved it!</li>
            <li> so it melts which is at body temp and one quick squirt at her shoulder blades</li>
            <li> Like it very much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those kind of girls that doesn&#x27;t remember what their normal hair color looks like, and this item makes it much easier to stay that way.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my purpose!</li>
            <li> and I am going to pick up a few more! :-)</li>
            <li> For how cheap it is and how much it has changed my routine, it&#x27;s well worth replacing even once a year or as needed.</li>
            <li> I always had to get my hair professionally done because when my mom dyes my hair, she misses so many spots</li>
            <li> I would totally do a TV testimony for free, that&#x27;s how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I found going from hairline to the back effective for me.</li>
            <li> It gets right in between the hairs and doesn&#x27;t snag or anything.  </li>
            <li> Coloring my hair down to the roots is now accomplished quickly and more importantly, evenly!  </li>
            <li> initial impression of the product was that it came in an an attractive pink color, but it felt cheaply designed and looked like a part my husband would buy in the plumbing department at a hardware store, not something I would want to use on use on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved this for how easy it was for me to use, however on the third use the hard plastic applicator top cracked.  </li>
            <li> It takes a good half hour.</li>
            <li> was very fast</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have used this product ever since it first came out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for the DIY colorist!!</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I swear to God the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I have to treat my scalp for a skin condition and this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve replaced the first one I purchased.</li>
            <li> Bought more for back up because I couldn&#x27;t do without it.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> considering I have to heat it up in hot water with my oils in it.</li>
            <li> and I think the extra time gives more control over</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> i came back and brought 2 more.</li>
            <li> I actually need a couple more of them.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> In my situation, the cap fit directly onto the bottle that came with the brand of color I use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, quality is really no different from the other applicators in the market except that this has multiple prongs so it is more effective.</li>
            <li> This is not harder or easier to clean than any other applicator bottle I&#x27;ve used, but it is easier to use than most of them!</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews of this product, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I will always use this as long as it remains available!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this would also be useful for highlights and other dye jobs aside from just roots.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely genius.</li>
            <li> This applicator saves so much time, the roots done in minutes with ease.</li>
            <li> Delivery was so fast.</li>
            <li> I really bought it for the comb because I wanted to use it with a bottle of product.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Still highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Makes applying oils to your scalp so much easier.</li>
            <li> SOME of the hair coloring will actually fit with the end of the R.O. applicator and in that case you can just use IT and toss it with only having to rinse the pink top.  </li>
            <li> the leaking was too much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fits my need.  </li>
            <li> so be careful when screwing on the application top.</li>
            <li> PS - Thanks everyone for the helpful reviews.</li>
            <li> I sure didn’t experience it, and I found the color dye flows out more quickly than it should with my color dripping all over the place, especially when using the product on the side of your head as the farthest outside comb teeth miss your head, as the applicator is too wide, and drips all over your shoulder and the floor making the process even more messy than normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought mine MANY years ago and have used it every other month since I bought it</li>
            <li> Not useful for cream type of hair color, only good for liquid hair color.</li>
            <li> so I would not say I over tightened, but if I buy another I will be more careful not to screw top on too tightly.</li>
            <li> I am a man with short, fast growing hair, which makes white roots more of a problem.</li>
            <li> It cuts down the time that it takes and is more uniform</li>
            <li> I bought more to keep individual &amp;#34;treatments&amp;#34; from a big batch of henna in the freezer for root touch ups.</li>
            <li> Most men&#x27;s products take only 5 minutes total.</li>
            <li> I saved $70.00 and still have beautifully gorgeous long jet black hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure not to tighten it too tightly (saw someone said that theirs had cracked but mine hasn&#x27;t) and rinse it thoroughly after each use.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I get great coverage without affecting the rest of my hair and with less mess.  </li>
            <li> The applicator part itself, that&#x27;s easy to clean, just use common sense with how you put the soap on it to make it really go in there, and wash it the same way.</li>
            <li> I color my hair pretty often due to red dye is coming off so easily.</li>
            <li> and I found it so easy to use with my Jamaican Black Castor OIl which I diluted with water.</li>
            <li> The teeth make product so easy to distribute without all the mess.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty noticeable when the overall length is 1 1/4\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> first issue with the product was that to use the product (as per instructions) one has to pour their hair color from the original color manufacturer bottles and tubes into the Roots only bottle, but no funnel is provided and if you don’t have a steady hand its can get messy.  </li>
            <li> Roots Only certainly lives up to its&#x27; name.  </li>
            <li> The applicator spacing is similar to a large hair pick and maybe the product is better suited with people with really thick hair</li>
            <li> Then, after applying the dye (while you are waiting for it to set), rinse the bottle in the sink, then put the applicator on the bottle and squirt soapy water till it comes clear.</li>
            <li> In fact one of the comb teeth became clogged and required that I use a needle to attempt to clear it.  </li>
            <li> however the bottle is too soft</li>
            <li> Especially if you have very coily hair like me</li>
            <li> Once you use these you&#x27;ll be like me and look high and low to find them again!</li>
            <li> yet I found that the comb teeth are too far apart requiring that I pass the comb through my hair repeatedly over the same area quite a few times to get full coverage.</li>
            <li> This tool puts the dye on my scalp, which apparently lets it literally soak into the hair below the scalp line.</li>
            <li> I was a chore to clean, after 2 applications it  started bursting from the reservoir side.. was a mess, bulky.. more expensive.</li>
            <li> The total application time and cleanup was nearly half an hour nowhere near the “less than 5 minutes” nor “as easy a 1,2,3” as they claim on the package and ads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting and coloring my own hair for about 10 years now (and I frequently get asked for recommendations to &amp;#34;my stylist&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , I have been using it that way for a long time but finally decided to purchase a new one d/t</li>
            <li> I hot oiled my entire head in less that 3 minutes!</li>
            <li> I mean, sure, cleaning is kind of annoying, but I just do it immediately with a bottle brush.</li>
            <li> Have had one of these for 10 years, and still do not need another - but was looking for one since it is so essential to my home hair dying; use half the solution as normal.</li>
            <li> I am a busy working mom, and purchased this product hoping it would help me get the job of coloring my hair faster and more evenly as they claimed, but I was sorely disappointed as this product was messy, slow and wound up being aggravating and more trouble than it was worth as it doesn’t work the way it should.  </li>
            <li> It took 5 minutes with minimal mess - first time user here.</li>
            <li> Makes a very messy job much easier.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this after seeing it on a few Natural Hair Blogs.</li>
            <li> Simple product; it has a bottle to hold the color and a wide toothcomb/cap (with holes at the tips) to apply it with.</li>
            <li> Tried this twice and both times found a lot of dry spots that did not get the dye.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked professionally done AND there was a very minimal mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Something else this helps with - I leave some gray at the temples, but getting the line correct between the gray and the colored hair was always hit or miss with the single point applicators.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was slightly larger (my entire combined solution does not fit) and the mouth of the bottle a little larger, but I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use less of it in the long run and it can still be used for other scalp treatments such as coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> Since than it takes me less than 15 min to fully color my long hair (pass shoulder blades).</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Use it evry other day to apply oil to my roots when wearing braids.  </li>
            <li> I could have applied my hair color all in less time and with less mess with a standard comb brush and massage the color into my hair like I did before without this</li>
            <li> I have average thickness of hair and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way down her skin just like that flea and tick medicine.</li>
            <li> I believe I payed less than $3.</li>
            <li> Women&#x27;s hair colors take 20-30 minutes, but they often cost less</li>
            <li> Its a little plastic bottle with a comb and holes.</li>
            <li> If the bottle were a little sturdier (the cap will eventually crack)</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make life a little easier, fill your sink with soapy water before you start.</li>
            <li> I used to use the little buckets and brushes from beauty stores to touch up my roots.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s really messy</li>
            <li> The dye wouldn&#x27;t go through the narrow holes.  </li>
            <li> that wasn&#x27;t aggravating enough,  the product was difficult to clean and as the base tube of the comb teeth are not visible to the eye it is impossible to know if the product is truly clean.</li>
            <li> I have purchased one in the past and the applicator/cap cracked within a few months</li>
            <li> - so I&#x27;m not too bad at it, haha).</li>
            <li> the past I bought this  2 rows advertized on TV brush looking gadget..</li>
            <li> I still had a little over half a bottle left which I felt bad about throwing out</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something that would &amp;#34;inject&amp;#34; oil for dry skin down to my cat&#x27;s skin and bypass her hair.</li>
            <li> I initially bought it at a store, lost it during a move, and was so desperate to replace it that I had to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken like was mentioned in another comment.</li>
            <li> Considering my experience with the product, I don&#x27;t think it should be that expensive.</li>
            <li> But no matter what I did, I would always get random stains on my face..</li>
            <li> She has a very thick coat and horrible dandruff.</li>
            <li> 75 percent of the time, I would get frustrated and just end up putting the color all over.</li>
            <li> the cap cracked!!  :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it for oiling my scalp which is something that I normally hate doing because it&#x27;s time consuming.</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>
            <li> I hate it!!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people are complaining. This is absolutely genius. I mean, sure, cleaning is kind of annoying, but I just do it immediately with a bottle brush. The applicator part itself, that&#x27;s easy to clean, just use common sense with how you put the soap on it to make it really go in there, and wash it the same way. This is not harder or easier to clean than any other applicator bottle I&#x27;ve used, but it is easier to use than most of them! Love it.</li>

            <li> Just as described.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have used this product ever since it first came out. This is the only thing that I use to re-color my hair. It is a product that I trust and depend on. So happy to have found it here where I could replace my worn out bottle from many years of use! I will always use this as long as it remains available! Highly recommended for the DIY colorist!!</li>
            <li> This applicator saves so much time, the roots done in minutes with ease.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.  Same as one I picked up at walmart some time ago.  I use this for henna application.  Makes a very messy job much easier.  I bought more to keep individual &amp;#34;treatments&amp;#34; from a big batch of henna in the freezer for root touch ups. I can let one thaw and use it that night.  Afterwards I just fill the bottle with water, put the lid on, and squeeze to flush and rinse out the comb.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful invention.  I just put all my special oils in it and my hair and scalp are so appreciative.</li>
            <li> This product is truly a God-send. I don&#x27;t even remember how I discovered it but I&#x27;m glad I did. At my regular salon I am charged around $70.00 for a colour and cut. I always had to get my hair professionally done because when my mom dyes my hair, she misses so many spots and she&#x27;s really messy so I end up with dye all around my forehead and neck that won&#x27;t wash off. I bought this at Sally&#x27;s in Canada and it was about $8.00. I swear to God the first time I used it, it was so easy and within like 5 minutes I was able to cover all my hair. I still had a little over half a bottle left which I felt bad about throwing out so I just kept glopping it on even though I didn&#x27;t have to. My hair looked professionally done AND there was a very minimal mess. I saved $70.00 and still have beautifully gorgeous long jet black hair. I would totally do a TV testimony for free, that&#x27;s how much I love this product. Go ahead and give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> These applicator bottles works great for applying hair color!  I use them all the time!  They last a long time!</li>
            <li> Came in great condition. Nothing was broken like was mentioned in another comment. Exactly what I needed for my purpose! Will be purchasing again should I ever need another one. Would recommend it as well.</li>
            <li> Even distribution for my mixture of oils!</li>
            <li> yes, great applicator, love it</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something that would &amp;#34;inject&amp;#34; oil for dry skin down to my cat&#x27;s skin and bypass her hair. She has a very thick coat and horrible dandruff. This worked like magic! I warm up some coconut oil so it melts which is at body temp and one quick squirt at her shoulder blades and we are done. The oil works it&#x27;s way down her skin just like that flea and tick medicine. I have had this bottle for years and it has never cracked.</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone who uses hair color easy to use and clean. I used the tip on another hair color bottle, it fit.. put some vert warm tap water in the given bottle and rinsed the inside of the dispensing comb and it was clean.. Delivery was so fast. Very nice service.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I bought this  2 rows advertized on TV brush looking gadget.. It was terrible. I was a chore to clean, after 2 applications it  started bursting from the reservoir side.. was a mess, bulky.. more expensive. Had to dump it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have.</li>
            <li> I love this, it works while on my roots. I don&#x27;t have to worry about doing it on my fingers.</li>
            <li> looks and works like it should!(what  I ordered)</li>
            <li> This Roots onlly hair bottle is perfect!  I know its used for color touch up, but i use it to oil my scalp!  I need to order 2 more! Awesome!</li>
            <li> This dispenser does not work for any type of cream based coloring.</li>
            <li> Love this I bought three as gifts. I know they will be used.</li>
            <li> Definitely works with applying product to my roots. Like it very much!</li>
            <li> Its a little plastic bottle with a comb and holes. I really bought it for the comb because I wanted to use it with a bottle of product.&lt;br /&gt;But the cap cracked!!  :(&lt;br /&gt;I guess it wasn&#x27;t big enough.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length-coarse-wavy hair and this comb was awesome for hair coloring. Brush hair well and use this...much cheaper at Sally!</li>
            <li> Love this applicator.  I&#x27;m a naturalista/curly girl and I found it so easy to use with my Jamaican Black Castor OIl which I diluted with water. I like the fact that you can measure the amount to use with the measure lines on the applicator.  The teeth make product so easy to distribute without all the mess.  Kudos!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to treat my scalp for a skin condition and this is exactly what I needed. I took 30-45 minutes of frustration and turned it into a 5 minute process.  UPDATE: I&#x27;m still using this a year or so later. I mostly use this for scalp psoriasis shampoo. I use less of it in the long run and it can still be used for other scalp treatments such as coconut oil.  UPDATE 2: Almost 2 years later and I&#x27;ve replaced the first one I purchased. The steam from the shower warps the ridges where the cap connects to the body and doesn&#x27;t allow it to seal all the way. For how cheap it is and how much it has changed my routine, it&#x27;s well worth replacing even once a year or as needed. Still highly recommended!</li>
            <li> An amazing product and will recommend it to people, very easy to use</li>
            <li> Not useful for cream type of hair color, only good for liquid hair color.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple of years now.  Bought more for back up because I couldn&#x27;t do without it.  Saving tons of money coloring my own hair and always get compliments.  It is so easy and foolproof.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If the bottle were a little sturdier (the cap will eventually crack) I would rate it five stars. It makes the application process a WHOLE lot easier, more accurate in coverage, and a lot faster. I have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> Yep.  Roots Only certainly lives up to its&#x27; name.  I can get to all my roots in a snap.  Saves time.  Love this.</li>
            <li> Very happy about my roots only comb applicator.</li>
            <li> I color my hair pretty often due to red dye is coming off so easily. It used to took me full hour to do my hair and than I found this comb in Walmart. I believe I payed less than $3. Since than it takes me less than 15 min to fully color my long hair (pass shoulder blades). I have even purchased this product just to share with coworkers. I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Worked great to apply sunblock to my hub&#x27;s scalp and not to his hair!</li>
            <li> Does as advertised.  Very effective for root application of anything.  What a great idea. HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these little applicators at Walmart about a year ago and just loved it! Then my daughter borrowed it and a dog got hold of it and chewed it up. No problem, I thought. I&#x27;ll just go get another one. Nope! Walmart no longer carries this item. Thank goodness for Amazon.com! This time I ordered two, just to be safe. It is a great product that is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Makes applying oils to your scalp so much easier. Also saves time when compared to applying oils the traditional way.</li>
            <li> The dye wouldn&#x27;t go through the narrow holes.  Has anyone else had this problem?</li>
            <li> I bought mine MANY years ago and have used it every other month since I bought it so I have to say that it IS durable, too.  Make sure not to tighten it too tightly (saw someone said that theirs had cracked but mine hasn&#x27;t) and rinse it thoroughly after each use.  SOME of the hair coloring will actually fit with the end of the R.O. applicator and in that case you can just use IT and toss it with only having to rinse the pink top.  It cuts down the time that it takes and is more uniform and I just love it.  I truly would not do my own hair if I didn&#x27;t have this applicator.  It IS cheaper at Walmart, just sayin&#x27;.....LOL</li>
            <li> Like others, I had purchased my original at Walmart but they no longer carry it.  Handy tool for women who frequently color the grays and helps me not miss spots.  I wish the bottle was slightly larger (my entire combined solution does not fit) and the mouth of the bottle a little larger, but I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just outstanding!  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> nice invention however the bottle is too soft considering I have to heat it up in hot water with my oils in it.</li>
            <li> I love this applicator. But I wish that I could shut off the top so that the product can&#x27;t spill. Other than that, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am a man with short, fast growing hair, which makes white roots more of a problem. I was coloring my hair once a week because by the end of the week I had a 1/4\\&quot; white stripe at the part. This is pretty noticeable when the overall length is 1 1/4\\&quot;. This tool puts the dye on my scalp, which apparently lets it literally soak into the hair below the scalp line. After 3 applications, I think I can go to just doing it every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else this helps with - I leave some gray at the temples, but getting the line correct between the gray and the colored hair was always hit or miss with the single point applicators. Then I would have to rub it in to be sure I got everywhere, which negates the value of applying it at the roots in the first place. Now I just comb this tool where I want the color and I can be sure it is evenly applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the hair color directions - It needs to be left at the roots for a period of time, then rubbed into the rest of the hair for a time to blend. Most men&#x27;s products take only 5 minutes total. Women&#x27;s hair colors take 20-30 minutes, but they often cost less and I think the extra time gives more control over blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make life a little easier, fill your sink with soapy water before you start. Then, after applying the dye (while you are waiting for it to set), rinse the bottle in the sink, then put the applicator on the bottle and squirt soapy water till it comes clear. Then leave it soaking in the soapy water till you get done with your shower.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier! Nice! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for applying  oil to my scalp. It&#x27;s okay, quality is really no different from the other applicators in the market except that this has multiple prongs so it is more effective. I have purchased one in the past and the applicator/cap cracked within a few months, I have been using it that way for a long time but finally decided to purchase a new one d/t the leaking was too much. Considering my experience with the product, I don&#x27;t think it should be that expensive.</li>
            <li> I loved this bottle and applicator so much..i came back and brought 2 more. It makes greasing my scalp a snap.</li>
            <li> Tried this twice and both times found a lot of dry spots that did not get the dye.  Had to keep going over and over to make sure all areas got saturated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those kind of girls that doesn&#x27;t remember what their normal hair color looks like, and this item makes it much easier to stay that way.</li>
            <li> Love it! Saves me lots of time to get my oils on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Absolutely fits my need.  I actually need a couple more of them.</li>
            <li> I wish it come with another cap which help to prevent water spills out so I can bring it to places.</li>
            <li> It is very nice itens.  I recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all naturals! Especially if you have very coily hair like me this product can go deep to the scalp to apply whatever oils you want.</li>
            <li> The first squirt was kind of tricky. Awesome tool once you get the hang of it. I hot oiled my entire head in less that 3 minutes!</li>
            <li> Use it evry other day to apply oil to my roots when wearing braids.  Would recommend to all who wair braided styles.</li>
            <li> love this product, have used it for many years.When you find it, buy two (they don&#x27;t last for ever and you will want it again!) $3 at walmart</li>
            <li> Have had one of these for 10 years, and still do not need another - but was looking for one since it is so essential to my home hair dying; use half the solution as normal. Clean with a drop of detergent and it will not clog.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why beauty supply places don&#x27;t carry this product. The roots only applicator is perfect and so easy to use. I now order two at a time so that I always have one available.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this after seeing it on a few Natural Hair Blogs. I use it for oiling my scalp which is something that I normally hate doing because it&#x27;s time consuming. I was able to oil my scalp in under a minute!!!! 1 MINUTE!! Can you say Happy, Happy, JOY JOY! I purchased mine from Sally&#x27;s and I am going to pick up a few more! :-)</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says, gets to the root of your hair!! I use it to oil my scalp when I want to prepoo or just do a scalp massage.  It gets right in between the hairs and doesn&#x27;t snag or anything.  I will purchase another one so I can do my shampoo or clay mix rinse.</li>
            <li> The roots only bottle is a great item to have when you just want to apply oils to your scalp for a massage.  Love it! Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Makes do it yourself hair color application a no brainer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair dying tool when I just want to do my roots.  I get great coverage without affecting the rest of my hair and with less mess.  Great simple invention for those of us that like to save money doing our own roots!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its supposed to do. I use it for oil and it allows my to oil my scalp while keeping my hands clean. I love that the bottle is large enough to hold a lot of oil and the applicator dispenses a good amount of oil. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Applies hair product and color evenly and easily.  Made in America.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product and shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> I loved this for how easy it was for me to use, however on the third use the hard plastic applicator top cracked.  I have arthritis in my hands so I would not say I over tightened, but if I buy another I will be more careful not to screw top on too tightly.</li>
            <li> Love the idea, but the bottle is really cheaply made.  It works, but the cap can cross thread the bottle so be careful when screwing on the application top.</li>
            <li> I am a busy working mom, and purchased this product hoping it would help me get the job of coloring my hair faster and more evenly as they claimed, but I was sorely disappointed as this product was messy, slow and wound up being aggravating and more trouble than it was worth as it doesn’t work the way it should.  On top of that beware that the sellers advertised photos are deceptive as the package they sent to me did not look at all like the one they advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial impression of the product was that it came in an an attractive pink color, but it felt cheaply designed and looked like a part my husband would buy in the plumbing department at a hardware store, not something I would want to use on use on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first issue with the product was that to use the product (as per instructions) one has to pour their hair color from the original color manufacturer bottles and tubes into the Roots only bottle, but no funnel is provided and if you don’t have a steady hand its can get messy.  Then they expect you to shake and mix your color in their bottle but they don’t provide anyway to cover the bottle (are they kidding?), so in order to do this you have to put your hand over top of the bottle or comb teeth so it doesn’t spill, resulting in more of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is designed to flow color through the tips of the comb applicator and one is supposed to run the comb tips along the scalp to color your hair.  I have average thickness of hair and yet I found that the comb teeth are too far apart requiring that I pass the comb through my hair repeatedly over the same area quite a few times to get full coverage. The applicator spacing is similar to a large hair pick and maybe the product is better suited with people with really thick hair but even then it would require many passes to get the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition although the packaging I received advertises the product has controlled release?  I sure didn’t experience it, and I found the color dye flows out more quickly than it should with my color dripping all over the place, especially when using the product on the side of your head as the farthest outside comb teeth miss your head, as the applicator is too wide, and drips all over your shoulder and the floor making the process even more messy than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that wasn&#x27;t aggravating enough,  the product was difficult to clean and as the base tube of the comb teeth are not visible to the eye it is impossible to know if the product is truly clean. In fact one of the comb teeth became clogged and required that I use a needle to attempt to clear it.  I wonder what gunk will lurk inside that tube over time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So did I save any time?  The total application time and cleanup was nearly half an hour nowhere near the “less than 5 minutes” nor “as easy a 1,2,3” as they claim on the package and ads.  I could have applied my hair color all in less time and with less mess with a standard comb brush and massage the color into my hair like I did before without this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone, and hope my comments will help spare others from the aggravation and expense of making the same mistake I did in purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting and coloring my own hair for about 10 years now (and I frequently get asked for recommendations to &amp;#34;my stylist&amp;#34; - so I&#x27;m not too bad at it, haha). I used to use the little buckets and brushes from beauty stores to touch up my roots. I had even gotten pretty good at applying it with the squeeze bottles that come with boxed hair color. But no matter what I did, I would always get random stains on my face.. the bathroom sink.. the walls in my bathroom.. etc and I had NO idea how they got there. That never happens with this product. I initially bought it at a store, lost it during a move, and was so desperate to replace it that I had to order from Amazon. Amazing deal for the money. I&#x27;m sure this would also be useful for highlights and other dye jobs aside from just roots. YOU NEED THIS THING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold!!!! After reading all the positive reviews of this product, I decided to try it. I use a semi-permanent color and have to touch up the roots every couple of week to a month. I hate it!! I was using a brush and a mug. I would put the color in the mug and dip the brush then blotch it on the roots. It takes a good half hour. 75 percent of the time, I would get frustrated and just end up putting the color all over. Today, I walked over to Sally Beauty Supply and bought this same product/brand for about the same price here. Simple product; it has a bottle to hold the color and a wide toothcomb/cap (with holes at the tips) to apply it with. In my situation, the cap fit directly onto the bottle that came with the brand of color I use. It was so simple. It took 5 minutes with minimal mess - first time user here. I found going from hairline to the back effective for me. I just got out of the shower and the root coverage is great. Now I don&#x27;t have to sacrifice the condition of my hair for color. (How come my stylist never told me about this product? hmmm)     PS - Thanks everyone for the helpful reviews. I would never have tried it otherwise.</li>
            <li> I got this for applying oil to my scalp while in braids or a weave. It was great , till it broke. Now oil spills everywhere. great Idea just not sturdy enough</li>
            <li> I like this and use it to oil my scalp.  Makes oiling very quickly.</li>
