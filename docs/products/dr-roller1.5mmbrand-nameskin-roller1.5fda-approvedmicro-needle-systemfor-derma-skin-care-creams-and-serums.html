            <li>As for creams to apply after words, in my research I found that any brand moisturizer with vitamin C and E works wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Loved it and very happy!</li>
            <li>This was a great roller but too pricey which is why it gets 4 stars.</li>

            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this roller, I have seen a nice change in my skin.</li>
            <li>The price was nice but the mentality of &#x27;throw it away&#x27; and fill another land fill, is why I rated it 3 instead of 4.</li>

            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>it looked interesting, that&#x27;s why I tried it...</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t check bent needles will scar your face more.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many cosmetic procedures and surgeries yet the scars remained.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product to see if my results get better.  </li>
            <li>I have been dermarolling for more than 2 years now</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t clean it well, it may cause more breakouts.</li>
            <li>Everything fine and on time</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too :)  Thank you!</li>
            <li>It cud be made sturdier and more user friendly don&#x27;t have a lot to say maybe its ok for first time users</li>
            <li>but after a few uses I am highly impressed with the decrease of visibility in my pores stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Im goin to continue using this till i get the full results.</li>
            <li>and this is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I sanitize it with a UV light and pour boiling water to sterilize as much as I can</li>
            <li>I began to see results within the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought this was a valuable tool for acne scars</li>
            <li>Have been using for one week now and can see a positive result in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I can say for certain using this device does hurt quite a bit as the needles prickle your skin</li>
            <li>: I received the product described above for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>but time will tell if it really works  </li>
            <li>I learned that Dr. Roller was the real deal and even FDA approved.    </li>
            <li>Dr. Roller is really helping my scars heal.  </li>
            <li>but I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>For ppl who have scars on their skin this product is really work with it and any other skin problems i already have one b4 and  its really helped me to make my skin look better</li>
            <li>If I am being honest I would not suggest this to anyone who has very sensitive skin or if you can not tolerate a little discomfort.</li>
            <li>Although I can see the stretch marks at this time, the skin is much more smoother and they are a lot less noticeable</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li>However if you are like me &amp; looking for a salon like treatment for a fraction of the price I would highly suggest The Derma Roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After doing research on this new roller technology, I learned that if I purchase a derma roller of any sort, that Dr. Roller was the one to get.  </li>
            <li>After seeing the results on my face and how it was beginning to smooth out, I tried it on a little area I had old flesh tone stretch marks and again....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Source: Professional Legal/Compliance Researcher</li>
            <li>the direct cover with the roller was also ripped and tayped.</li>
            <li>but, hey, I don&#x27;t mind the price so much if it works knowing how much I paid for the other procedures.    </li>
            <li>No other compensation was provided</li>
            <li>The only downfall so far is the price</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t bare to put myself through this torture.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about paying so much for a product that claimed to smooth out wrinkles, heal pitted scars and make stretch marks disappear.  </li>
            <li>Always looking for something simple and natural (well no products seeping into my skin) especially on my face...</li>

            <li> I must say that I am absolutely amazed that this little product is working!!!  </li>
            <li> I have tried several times over the course of a month and a half to use this.  </li>
            <li> and but after maybe less than ten times of use the needles started to bend.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly, but...doesn&#x27;t actually roll- stuck in &amp;#34;park.&amp;#34; Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Aside from the initial swelling and redness for the few times I did use this</li>
            <li> Like I said I have gone though other procedures</li>

            <li> Makes me question quality control in general- frightening, considering it&#x27;s use is to puncture holes in surface of skin.</li>
            <li> I try to do it every 4 weeks since it takes at least a month for the skin to heal itself from the wounds caused.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure!</li>
            <li> To me, its a little uncomfortable but nothing that hurts.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have pitted scaring due to childhood chicken pox.  </li>
            <li> It is unbelievably uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I use the Dr. Numb cream to help ease the pain.  </li>
            <li> But, it is still a bit painful.  </li>
            <li> As for if the roller is painful.  </li>
            <li> ; terrible return policy.</li>

            <li> Love this product.  Have been using for one week now and can see a positive result in my skin.  Would highly recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I will admit I was skeptical about this little device at first but after a few uses I am highly impressed with the decrease of visibility in my pores stretch marks. If I am being honest I would not suggest this to anyone who has very sensitive skin or if you can not tolerate a little discomfort. However if you are like me &amp; looking for a salon like treatment for a fraction of the price I would highly suggest The Derma Roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: I received the product described above for free in exchange for my unbiased review. No other compensation was provided</li>
            <li> There is no roller FDA approved in the beauty field and 1.5 mm is clinical use ONLY. I would like to see proof of certification from FDA from this company.</li>
            <li> i bought this to help reduce my acne scars as I have very deep pits and have skin akin to an orange peel i have been using this as of late. I can say for certain using this device does hurt quite a bit as the needles prickle your skin I do feel it doing something as it leaves a tingle in my skin but time will tell if it really works  I will check back here to show progression if any has been made thank you,</li>
            <li> this product actually works.. ive been using it on my face and the few stretchmarks that i do have.. within 4 treatments i notice a drastic change. Im goin to continue using this till i get the full results. definately a must have!!!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this roller, I have seen a nice change in my skin. I use the roller 2-3 times a week at night. Then, I put Vitamin A, Vitamin C and a night cream.  I use the Dr. Numb cream to help ease the pain.  But, it is still a bit painful.  I would definitely recommend this roller to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like to have procedures done on your face. Shipping was fast too :)  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Always looking for something simple and natural (well no products seeping into my skin) especially on my face...they said Jennifer Anniston uses one...it looked interesting, that&#x27;s why I tried it...I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Bent needles, you can&#x27;t see they&#x27;re bent untill you open. Open item is non-returnable so $60 in the trash. Never buy from &amp;#34;gifts2shop&amp;#34; terrible return policy. If you don&#x27;t check bent needles will scar your face more.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly, but...doesn&#x27;t actually roll- stuck in &amp;#34;park.&amp;#34; Disappointing. Makes me question quality control in general- frightening, considering it&#x27;s use is to puncture holes in surface of skin. Won&#x27;t be using it or buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I have never left a review for a product before but this one needs to be left as I was truly amazed.    After doing research on this new roller technology, I learned that if I purchase a derma roller of any sort, that Dr. Roller was the one to get.  Not the one that was featured on the Rachael Ray show as that had no needle length choices, etc.  I learned that Dr. Roller was the real deal and even FDA approved.    I was skeptical about paying so much for a product that claimed to smooth out wrinkles, heal pitted scars and make stretch marks disappear.  I purchased this product because I have pitted scaring due to childhood chicken pox.  I have tried many, many cosmetic procedures and surgeries yet the scars remained.  After doing my research if I wanted to see improvement I needed a 1.5mm-2.0mm needle length.    I purchased this product on Amazon due to their reputation and trusted that I would not be getting an imitation Dr. Roller and I was correct.  I started with the 1.5mm needle.  I must say that I am absolutely amazed that this little product is working!!!  I began to see results within the first week of use.  Again with the information I learned by research I should only use the 1.5mm needle up to 3 times a week.    After seeing the results on my face and how it was beginning to smooth out, I tried it on a little area I had old flesh tone stretch marks and again....it&#x27;s working.  Although I can see the stretch marks at this time, the skin is much more smoother and they are a lot less noticeable and I have only been using this little roller for a few weeks!    I will continue to use this product to see if my results get better.  After achieving my goal, I will discontinue use of the roller to see if they re-appear or if an ongoing routine is needed and I will report back with the findings.    As for if the roller is painful.  To me, its a little uncomfortable but nothing that hurts.  Like I said I have gone though other procedures and this is not bad at all.I don&#x27;t use an numbing topical at all.  As for creams to apply after words, in my research I found that any brand moisturizer with vitamin C and E works wonderful.  I found that at a regular drug store.  I also read that any moisturizer with collagen building ingredients work well also.    All in all I am very pleased and will continue my use of this product.  The only downfall so far is the price but, hey, I don&#x27;t mind the price so much if it works knowing how much I paid for the other procedures.    I am recommending this product.  Do all your research.  If you purchase this product I hope you get the results I am getting.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Dr. Roller is really helping my scars heal.  It takes some time, but there is definitely improvement.  It is also improving my hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> Read up a lot about this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month but I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it once and it&#x27;s been 3 weeks now since then, I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.still on the hope to see visible effects may be after second or third time. I&#x27;m not sure!</li>
            <li> It cud be made sturdier and more user friendly don&#x27;t have a lot to say maybe its ok for first time users</li>
            <li> I have tried several times over the course of a month and a half to use this.  I have read other users&#x27; reviews, watched YouTube instructionals, searched endlessly through blogs, and the bottom line is... this is NOT the product for me! It is unbelievably uncomfortable.  I bought it to use on my buttocks and thighs, since the 1.5mm length is recommended to combat cellulite and stretch marks.  Aside from the initial swelling and redness for the few times I did use this, I don&#x27;t see a difference and I can&#x27;t bare to put myself through this torture.  Hopefully seller will allow me to return.</li>
            <li> Good introductory roller.  After the 7th use, I noticed some of the needles have dulled and are leaving blood spots from larger holes. I have read that some use only one time and others use for multiple treatments.  The price was nice but the mentality of &#x27;throw it away&#x27; and fill another land fill, is why I rated it 3 instead of 4.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with this product. I try to do it every 4 weeks since it takes at least a month for the skin to heal itself from the wounds caused. I sanitize it with a UV light and pour boiling water to sterilize as much as I can</li>
            <li> Please know that there is no such thing as an FDA-Approved Derma Roller. A product can be registered through the FDA but derma rolllers are not reviewed or approved by the FDA. Do not rely on that claim.&lt;br /&gt;Source: Professional Legal/Compliance Researcher</li>
            <li> This is actually an update review. At first I thought this was a valuable tool for acne scars and but after maybe less than ten times of use the needles started to bend. Overall it does help with Acne scars somewhat but only temporary. It plumps your skin for a few days after use then back to normal. It also needs sanitary maintenance. If you don&#x27;t clean it well, it may cause more breakouts.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly what I ordered.  Recommend this to anyone that I looking to dermaroll.  Loved it and very happy!</li>
            <li> This was a great roller but too pricey which is why it gets 4 stars. I have been dermarolling for more than 2 years now and I have seen great results. You have to stick with it!</li>
            <li> For ppl who have scars on their skin this product is really work with it and any other skin problems i already have one b4 and  its really helped me to make my skin look better so i bought another one for my friend  she said i can see the difference in ur skin b4 and after the treatment  . i use vitamen E after the derma treatment&lt;br /&gt;Dont pay lots of money for gettin good skin clean it twice a day with toner and milk and then use the derma once a week  then vitamen E  tarra enjoy ur beautiful skin :)</li>
            <li> Everything fine and on time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order this roller from him/her, and I open the package. when I was opening this product and see, their was a ripped plastic case for the hygiene perpose since this is the product that you use for your skin and all. the direct cover with the roller was also ripped and tayped.</li>
