            <li>The price was much better then the department stores cosmetics.  </li>

            <li>Other than that, perfect!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you pick the right shade!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used this as eye liner with a fine edged brush, the color came out so rich and bold!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found this eyebrow powder and am thinking of getting a second one.  </li>
            <li>The powder works great and last longer than some of the brow pencils.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy especially if you know how to work with eye brow powder!</li>
            <li>BeautyOnline shipped the product quickly and thoughtfully protected the item with bubble wrap and sturdy cardboard.</li>
            <li>This one is the best one I have used, especially with a little water added to glide on better.</li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t dried out which is a great sign as well.</li>
            <li>I never used anything like this before and its really user friendly.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, very natural look.</li>
            <li>Made my brows look filled in naturally.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>If you have black hair, this soft black will blend in perfectly with your brows and do a super job filling in sparse spots.</li>
            <li>Ardell is a wonderful brand and this product will last me a very long time for the most natural look possible I brush some of the powder off onto my palm and mix this in with my clear mascara which i use to brush my brows in place, i get compliments on my eyebrows multiple times a day.</li>
            <li>What I like about this powder is that it&#x27;s not dusty and flaky like others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>really well with my brow.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like it&#x27;s staying power too.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and undamaged.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The formula is smoother and less &#x27;powdery&#x27; so application is very easy and controlled.  </li>
            <li>Its so hard to find black eyebrow powder, so I was very happy when I found this.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased a high end eyebrow powder at a local boutique for more than three times the purchase price of this item.</li>
            <li>This product is so much better--on another scale completely.</li>
            <li>Normally Sallys Beauty Supply carries it, but they were out.</li>
            <li>, the application is neat vibrant yet natural.</li>
            <li>Powder blends good and isn&#x27;t too dark for being black powder.</li>
            <li>Only use it with the water trick if it&#x27;s not too hot</li>
            <li>Makes eyebrows look so natural if you apply whats needed!</li>
            <li>Good color, but the brush it comes with is useless.  </li>
            <li>ANd even though the brush is so tiny, I actually like how it applies the product even more that other brushes (for example Mac eyeliner brush).  </li>
            <li>Although smaller in size, this brow powder is half the price, goes on smoothly, and looks natural.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Although smaller in size, this brow powder is half the price, goes on smoothly, and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard for me to find a black eyebrow powder because most powders only have dark brown as their darkest powder.</li>
            <li> It was not soft enough for me...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a soft black eyebrow powder for months and came across this one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Looks so natural for people with black eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural and you only need a small dab.  </li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s \\&quot;soft black\\&quot; was chalky and started breaking up after a few uses so that I could no longer carry it in my handbag.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is I found the brush it comes with pretty useless.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size of the brush -- tiny!</li>
            <li> Nothing crazy special</li>
            <li> Other products make the darkening look fake and obvious while this one gives a natural dark look.</li>
            <li> This is my only complaint about the product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the powder does the job!</li>
            <li> I have sparse almost black eye brows and have used eye brow pencil since forever.  </li>
            <li> Finally a black eyebrow powder.</li>
            <li> I have naturally black hair</li>
            <li> the color is just what i&#x27;ve been wanting and it is black but not too black.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I need it for my jet black hair.</li>
            <li> It goes on JET BLACK and looks unnatural.  </li>
            <li> I combine it with dark brown powder so it doesn&#x27;t look so harsh.</li>
            <li> Also the case is hard to open, and it&#x27;s just a bit too small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this powder for a few months now and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products for my fading thin eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a black brow powder on the market, everything else is brown, dark brown...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find black powder</li>
            <li> Too dark!!</li>
            <li> The shade is just what I was looking for; however, the brush is too small for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s often difficult to find black eyebrow powder to match my black hair.  </li>
            <li> Black is too severe and brown is just wrong.  </li>
            <li> I wish they made this type of brush in a bigger size :(</li>
            <li> They are impossible to deal with - they get dull and sharpening them is a exercise in futility as they keep breaking as you sharpen.  </li>
            <li> it is quite difficult to find this eyebrow powder shade in stores.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Made my brows look filled in naturally.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life.  I have sparse almost black eye brows and have used eye brow pencil since forever.  They are impossible to deal with - they get dull and sharpening them is a exercise in futility as they keep breaking as you sharpen.  This is so much better. Love it.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t too many brow powders suitable for women with black/graying hair.  Black is too severe and brown is just wrong.  If you look at the eyebrow of black-haired women, you&#x27;ll see that the actually color is a charcoal.  I have been using powders from high-end cosmetic companies bought from fancy department stores.  Estee Lauder was my favorite, but it was discontinued.  Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s \\&quot;soft black\\&quot; was chalky and started breaking up after a few uses so that I could no longer carry it in my handbag.  Although smaller in size, this brow powder is half the price, goes on smoothly, and looks natural.  I&#x27;m glad I discovered it.  I&#x27;ll always buy this brand now.</li>
            <li> This one is the best one I have used, especially with a little water added to glide on better. Only use it with the water trick if it&#x27;s not too hot or you don&#x27;t sweat. Otherwise, it will smear. But this is a great product. Have to order more.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a high end eyebrow powder at a local boutique for more than three times the purchase price of this item. This product is so much better--on another scale completely. If you have black hair, this soft black will blend in perfectly with your brows and do a super job filling in sparse spots. The brush makes application a breeze. Also, your eyebrows will not smudge if you get water on them. BeautyOnline shipped the product quickly and thoughtfully protected the item with bubble wrap and sturdy cardboard. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Finally a black eyebrow powder. I have naturally black hair and it&#x27;s hard for me to find a black eyebrow powder because most powders only have dark brown as their darkest powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a soft black eyebrow powder for months and came across this one on Amazon.  The price was much better then the department stores cosmetics.  I am Asian American and it&#x27;s often difficult to find black eyebrow powder to match my black hair.  What I like about this powder is that it&#x27;s not dusty and flaky like others I&#x27;ve used.  The formula is smoother and less &#x27;powdery&#x27; so application is very easy and controlled.  I use a separate eyebrow brush with a longer handle, not what came in the kit.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found this eyebrow powder and am thinking of getting a second one.  It will last me for YEARS!</li>
            <li> the color is just what i&#x27;ve been wanting and it is black but not too black.&lt;br /&gt;works really well with my brow. thanks</li>
            <li> Love this powder! It&#x27;s so hard to find black powder but I need it for my jet black hair. I combine it with dark brown powder so it doesn&#x27;t look so harsh. I really like it&#x27;s staying power too.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, very natural look.You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>

            <li> Very happy with item.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes EVERYWHERE!!  It goes on JET BLACK and looks unnatural.  I have to wash my face after applying it!!</li>
            <li> this is the only brow shadow I use.Normally Sallys Beauty Supply carries it, but they were out. This stuff will last a year for me, can&#x27;t beat the wear or price</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments after using this product!!! I never used anything like this before and its really user friendly.</li>
            <li> Good color, but the brush it comes with is useless.  Buy with eyebrow wax!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a black brow powder on the market, everything else is brown, dark brown...The powder works great and last longer than some of the brow pencils. The brush is not the best, so I don&#x27;t recommend. Also the case is hard to open, and it&#x27;s just a bit too small. Other than that, the powder does the job!</li>

            <li> Looks so natural for people with black eyebrows. Works best when eyebrows are waxed/threaded to keep a natural looking shape. Other products make the darkening look fake and obvious while this one gives a natural dark look.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and undamaged. Powder blends good and isn&#x27;t too dark for being black powder. Only thing is I found the brush it comes with pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and i love it.</li>
            <li> Too dark!! Would still use but not re-buy</li>
            <li> Its so hard to find black eyebrow powder, so I was very happy when I found this.  I really like this product. ANd even though the brush is so tiny, I actually like how it applies the product even more that other brushes (for example Mac eyeliner brush).

            <li> For someone who is a makeup artist and has been playing around with all types of makeup for years, I can honestly say this is a great product. Nothing crazy special but it does the job. Great smooth texture, the application is neat vibrant yet natural. I&#x27;ve had this powder for a few months now and it hasn&#x27;t dried out which is a great sign as well.
