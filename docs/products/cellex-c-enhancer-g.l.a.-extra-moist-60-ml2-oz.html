            <li>Your price is great and I will continue buying this product from you again.</li>
            <li>And, great price for what you get.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a number of years now and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>I also use it at night and my face feels great in the morning.</li>
            <li>and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It gives good moisture without clogging pores or feeling goopy.</li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>With sensitive skin I&#x27;ve often experienced breakouts from many creams but with this cream my skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>It is very light, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and absorbs quickly, so I can apply it either at night or under my makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>My fine lines have diminished and people notice my skin now.  </li>
            <li>This cream is really fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am an esthetician and highly recommend this moisturizer for anyone that is 50+ with dry skin, especially good for those with rosacea or psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a year and not found any other brand that makes your skin as beautiful as this.</li>
            <li>I will let you know later if it is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>Particularly good for people with very dry skin.</li>
            <li>A little too dewy for daytime, but great for moisturizing with staying power.  </li>
            <li>so it makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li>The price is right for what it does.  </li>
            <li>I am judging by Cellex C&#x27;s performance in the past with their serums and moisturizer with sunscreen, which are great and have used them for years....</li>
            <li>I was suprised this product was so much better than any of the over the counter products I had been using, such as Olay.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that I have to use it in combination with the other products in this line to get a pleasing result -- as it does well on its own.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>very hydrating...great stuff</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not especially pleasant but doesn&#x27;t detract too much I will keep using this product because my skin seems to stay more moist.</li>
            <li>But i have yet to find anything better for less money.  </li>
            <li>This is definately worth buying, I am not going back to the store products.</li>
            <li>Nice weight of moisturizer that last all night without feeling heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive redhead skin LOVES this!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended to all my friends young and old.</li>
            <li>My 87 year old mother in law has me send this to her every 3 mos.  </li>
            <li>This is the first cream I have used that doesn&#x27;t get shiny, greasy, and it lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li>It keeps your skin moisturized throughout the entire day and the small lines associated with dryness have diminished extraordinarily.  </li>
            <li>This is a must-have for mature women living in dry climates.  </li>
            <li>I have had eczema my entire life, this cream works wonders especially through the winter months (but also isn&#x27;t too heavy during the hot summer).  </li>

            <li> how many other lotions I have tried that have failed</li>
            <li> This is a basic moisturiser for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> My dermotologist offered me a sample of this mosturizer to help my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and have searched and searched for a cream that is not just superficial.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is meant for REALLY dry skin-</li>
            <li> If your skin is dry at all, this is the cream for you.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny and one jar lasts me almost a year.</li>

            <li> I was hesitant to try this one due to the cost.  </li>
            <li> A very small amount on rainy days or a larger dose on dry days makes a world of difference to my skin comfort.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard it causes break outs and little bumps on normal-oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy and your skin feels moist throughout the day and night.</li>
            <li> I have skin that is prone to acne, and this is one of the few products I can use on my face that doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> but this goes on feeling greasy but seems to absorb but the SMELL is not good.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it were not so expensive!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Received what i ordered.  This is the best moisturizer i have found for my face.  A little pricey.  But i have yet to find anything better for less money.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a must-have for mature women living in dry climates.  It does everything it promises. I&#x27;ve recommended to all my friends young and old.</li>
            <li> My dermotologist offered me a sample of this mosturizer to help my dry skin.  I was suprised this product was so much better than any of the over the counter products I had been using, such as Olay.  This is definately worth buying, I am not going back to the store products.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and have searched and searched for a cream that is not just superficial.  I have found that this cream moisturizes your skin and keeps it supple and beautiful.  I have been using it for about a year and not found any other brand that makes your skin as beautiful as this. My fine lines have diminished and people notice my skin now.  My search is over.  This is a keeper!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time. Your price is great and I will continue buying this product from you again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is meant for REALLY dry skin- I&#x27;ve heard it causes break outs and little bumps on normal-oily skin.  I have had eczema my entire life, this cream works wonders especially through the winter months (but also isn&#x27;t too heavy during the hot summer).  My doctors can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks now!  It keeps your skin moisturized throughout the entire day and the small lines associated with dryness have diminished extraordinarily.  I&#x27;ve lost count how many other lotions I have tried that have failed, it&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny and one jar lasts me almost a year.</li>
            <li> Nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li> My sensitive redhead skin LOVES this!  A very small amount on rainy days or a larger dose on dry days makes a world of difference to my skin comfort.  Give it a couple of minutes before you add makeup, so it soaks in all the way.  Stays plush all day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It gives good moisture without clogging pores or feeling goopy. A little goes a long way so it makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am judging by Cellex C&#x27;s performance in the past with their serums and moisturizer with sunscreen, which are great and have used them for years....but this goes on feeling greasy but seems to absorb but the SMELL is not good.  I checked to see if it had an expiration date and it was 2016 so that isn&#x27;t the problem.  I will let you know later if it is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If your skin is dry at all, this is the cream for you.  Incredibly creamy and moisturizing.  I love it.</li>
            <li> The box was a bit crumpled upon arrival. The fragrance is not especially pleasant but doesn&#x27;t detract too much I will keep using this product because my skin seems to stay more moist.</li>
            <li> Nice weight of moisturizer that last all night without feeling heavy or greasy.  My go to moisturizer for night.  A little too dewy for daytime, but great for moisturizing with staying power.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer. I had a facialist who turned me on to this stuff, and have been using it ever since. It&#x27;s great for sensitive, combination skin. And, great price for what you get.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer.  I use it anywhere (arms, legs, chest) if I need it.  I don&#x27;t feel that I have to use it in combination with the other products in this line to get a pleasing result -- as it does well on its own.  I apply my daily moisturizer (face, body) then just a dab of this wherever I like.  I only wish it were not so expensive!!</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and highly recommend this moisturizer for anyone that is 50+ with dry skin, especially good for those with rosacea or psoriasis.  The price is right for what it does.  Skin is noticeably hydrated within days.  My 87 year old mother in law has me send this to her every 3 mos.  She loves it as her over all daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a very long time, as it is the only thing I have found to keep my rosacea under control. For health reasons, I&#x27;ve been looking for something else for about a year, something that doesn&#x27;t contain parabens. Gave up and ordered another jar of this, and it no longer has them. Hooray for Cellex-C!</li>
            <li> This is a basic moisturiser for very dry skin.  No bells and whistles but works well.  I use this after I use my Cellex-C serum</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  I&#x27;ve been using for years.  Particularly good for people with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream for the face. I have used it for a number of years now and my skin looks great. It works for me so I will continue to use. Great mosturizer!</li>
            <li> very hydrating...great stuff</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
            <li> This cream is really fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy and your skin feels moist throughout the day and night. With sensitive skin I&#x27;ve often experienced breakouts from many creams but with this cream my skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> The product expired in 2012. Feel this product was misrepresented. No return instructions were included with the shipment. Overall not satisfied</li>
            <li> I swear I have tried every single hydrating facial cream known to man.  I was hesitant to try this one due to the cost.  I feel that I throw tons of money away on product after product.  This is the first cream I have used that doesn&#x27;t get shiny, greasy, and it lasts all day long.  I also use it at night and my face feels great in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. I have skin that is prone to acne, and this is one of the few products I can use on my face that doesn&#x27;t break me out. It is very light, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and absorbs quickly, so I can apply it either at night or under my makeup in the morning. It works very well for me and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
