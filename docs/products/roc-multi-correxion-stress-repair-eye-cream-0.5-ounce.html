    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy if what I see</li>
            <li>In addition, try roc&#x27;s multi correction night repair, another great product!!!!</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>The best eye cream I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Awesome</li>
            <li>Just incredible and combined with wrinkle filler......</li>
            <li>This eye cream is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This is really great eye cream that surprisingly is made in France.</li>
            <li>Nice and creamy and lasts all night leaving my eyes feeling good in the morning and helps throughout the day.</li>
            <li>LOVE RoC products!</li>
            <li>My under eye area is bright, luminous, wrinkle free and dewy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, feels nice going on.</li>
            <li>Product is nice and light, but effective, I guess it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Very smooth and hydrating</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>the more you use it the better you look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOVE...</li>
            <li>LOVE....</li>
            <li>However, it IS fragrance free, thankfully!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s promise.ry a fresh tube to give it a truly fair shot.  </li>
            <li>Just okay</li>
            <li>So, to be fair, I really would like to try a fresh tube to give it a truly fair shot.  </li>
            <li>Good Item, Fast Shipping Thank You!</li>
            <li>so it is important to me to find something that would be hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smooth application</li>
            <li>It is a perfect consistency, not too light or too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that my tube is a good year old...</li>
            <li>Lightning fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pretty happy with this eye cream...</li>
            <li>also liked how it worked to diminish fine lines and had a nice smoothing effect without any tight feeling.</li>
            <li>true Roc keeps</li>
            <li>I REALLY DONT HAVE THE TIME FOR THIS, BUT I LOVE THE PRODUCTF.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the fast results at such a great price.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I know that this is supposed to be super hydrating...</li>
            <li>It hydrates my under eye area, never feels or looks heavy or gives you those pesky white dots, works as a nice primer for makeup and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>I just thought maybe something for sensitive eyes would do even better.</li>
            <li>The RoC Multi Correxion Stress Repair Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce leaves the skin around my eyes feeling soft and more elastic.</li>
            <li>So far I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars though because I don&#x27;t think it provides exceptional moisture unless you put a lot on, but I also have very dry skin in the winter when I use this the most.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t see much difference, and after i&#x27;m through with this product, i will definitely buy Clinique again.</li>
            <li>I needed a light yet rich eye cream as I have crows feet and tiny lines underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice eye product from ROC that does not burn or sting on my sensitive skin, moisturizes and comforts, slightly brightens.  </li>
            <li>Then Lancôme abruptly changed the product formula (now called Genifique Yeux) and it no longer works effectively on my skin.</li>
            <li>so I can apply my make up immediately, for the price it works like more expensive eye creams, so get it good price for an amazing job, no more pufiness on you eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream, although I can&#x27;t say it has worked any miracles.  </li>
            <li>Really does what it said it will do.</li>
            <li>may give it another chance and use it even more sparingly and carefully than I already did.</li>
            <li>Much happier with my Loreal Revitalift eye cream in a tube.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have decided to work with this brand to see if I can at least maintain my skin&#x27;s relatively good genetics.</li>
            <li>It smoothed out some very fine lines, lightened the dark circles under my eyes and tightened the skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this cream is very gentle.</li>
            <li>Even better, you only have to use a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>but in terms of RoC, and in particular, it&#x27;s Multi Correxion Stress Repair Eye Cream,</li>
            <li>While retinol works wonders, especially when combined with rich emollients to counteract any dryness, it is important to be able to see the product on the skin long enough to NOT wind up accidentally winding up with it in your eyes or missing spots.</li>
            <li>I see a new person when I look into the Looking Glass....</li>
            <li>This is my new \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; eye cream.</li>
            <li>I am a skincare junkie and am always on the look-out for new cleansers, toners, serums, moisturizers, and eye creams.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this eye cream for a week and have seen an improvement with fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li>Expiration date was 2 years old!</li>
            <li>I do like what I am seeing so far, though!</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using this cream i see the results, the cream had light diffusing particles and reduces the appearance of the dark circles.</li>
            <li>the past few weeks, I have tried many different eye products from many different companies and I am pleased to report that this new product of RoCs does everything that the Lancôme eye product did at much less cost.</li>
            <li>I purchased the product, as I said, for my mother because it seemed easy to apply and seemed rich enough to be visible enough during application, as to not miss any of the delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li>When using the RoC Multi Correxion Stress Repair Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce I developed an itchy rash under my eyes with swelling.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and have had no problems with this product.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t last me anytime..seemed like there wasn&#x27;t much in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light cream that moisturizes your eye area, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>If you do not react well to Vitamin A in such a high concentration in a $200 eye cream, you are not going to react well to it in a RoC product.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it does smooth wrinkles, but only very slightly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a good replacement for a wrinkle cream, but great for dry under eyes that need a little boost.</li>
            <li>Also, in my opinion, when a product promises to help eliminate dark circles, and simply has something in it to reflect light and mask circles, it is really not holding up</li>
            <li>Also, in my opinion, when a product promises to help eliminate dark circles, and simply has something in it to reflect light and mask circles, it is really not holding up it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li>Having worked for years in the skincare/makeup industry, it didn&#x27;t take me long to realize that, with the exception of a handful of products within the various high end lines, an ingredient IS an ingredient.  </li>
            <li>but when I go for a hydrating eye cream, usually to apply OVER a simple retinol gel serum, I like the cream to be super creamy and</li>

            <li> This product is as good as any expensive department-store product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> definitely reduced puffiness of my upper eye lid, which always made one eye appear bigger than the other.</li>
            <li> I even got compliments from my mom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among other more expensive products, I&#x27;ve tried Murad&#x27;s renewing eye cream ($75)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and decided to start an anti-aging regimen, especially because I wanted to do something about the slightly dark circles under my eyes which are hereditary.</li>
            <li> and I was a long time user of Lancôme Genefique Eye.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and am always looking for products that have staying power and don&#x27;t disappear within an hour.  </li>
            <li> If I were to attempt to apply concealer under my eyes and over this cream, I  can tell it would be too dry and probably flake up, taking the eye cream with it.  </li>
            <li> I have had dark circles for years now, and thought i should try something different after trying Clinique eye cream and having it work wonders.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps reduce dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I still have the crows feet and tiny lines, but they are less noticeable than before.</li>
            <li> i feel like the lines around my eyes are less noticeable with only a couple of uses....</li>
            <li> Only worked a little.</li>
            <li> Was wrapped very tight in plastic, almost had to buzz saw it to get it open!  </li>
            <li> I use it with my other Roc products sometimes day and night.  </li>
            <li> have dark circles under my eyes due to allergies and asthma.</li>
            <li> so it hides these dark circles and</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I notice some reduction in eye puffiness and black circles.  </li>
            <li> It is always hard to know if your moisturizers are doing all that can be done to fulfill the stated claims of every brand.</li>
            <li> my complexion is restored to late 30s appearance.  </li>
            <li> It lasted for days and slowly went away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of eye cream and none of them have reduced sag, restored elasticity and decreased lines and papery texture like this cream!  </li>
            <li> So, in that regard, I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> so unfortunately I can&#x60;t comment on the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I started using this during tree pollen season which put this product to the test since my circles were really bad then.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I see a new person when I look into the Looking Glass.... I&#x27;m very happy if what I see</li>
            <li> Expiration date was 2 years old!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for a week and have seen an improvement with fine lines and dark circles. I can&#x27;t believe the fast results at such a great price. I have very sensitive skin and this cream is very gentle. I can&#x27;t wait to see future results. In addition, try roc&#x27;s multi correction night repair, another great product!!!!</li>
            <li> This product really make my eyes look out of stress after few days using it, it is not a greasy cream so I can apply my make up immediately, for the price it works like more expensive eye creams, so get it good price for an amazing job, no more pufiness on you eyes.</li>
            <li> When using the RoC Multi Correxion Stress Repair Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce I developed an itchy rash under my eyes with swelling. It lasted for days and slowly went away. I paid 19 dollars for the product and probably had a allergic reaction to it. Would not buy again or recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This eye cream seems to work.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I notice some reduction in eye puffiness and black circles.  The changes are not drastic, but I didn&#x27;t expect them to be.  I will wait until the tube is finished to give this cream my final rating.  I do like what I am seeing so far, though!</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this cream i see the results, the cream had light diffusing particles and reduces the appearance of the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It hydrates my under eye area, never feels or looks heavy or gives you those pesky white dots, works as a nice primer for makeup and feels great on the skin. I think it helped me with puffiness under the eyes  I only gave it 4 stars though because I don&#x27;t think it provides exceptional moisture unless you put a lot on, but I also have very dry skin in the winter when I use this the most. I feel like it does smooth wrinkles, but only very slightly. It&#x27;s not a good replacement for a wrinkle cream, but great for dry under eyes that need a little boost. For the price, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> As a gym goer I started having dehydration and crepping. This product stopped it.The best eye cream I&#x27;ve tried, I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and hydrating</li>
            <li> I am 71 and I was a long time user of Lancôme Genefique Eye. Then Lancôme abruptly changed the product formula (now called Genifique Yeux) and it no longer works effectively on my skin. I communicated with Lancome and they were totally unhelpful.&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few weeks, I have tried many different eye products from many different companies and I am pleased to report that this new product of RoCs does everything that the Lancôme eye product did at much less cost. Even better, you only have to use a tiny amount. My under eye area is bright, luminous, wrinkle free and dewy. RoC does keep its promises!</li>
            <li> This is really great eye cream that surprisingly is made in France. I have allergies so it is important to me to find something that would be hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;I have dark circles under my eyes due to allergies and asthma. I started using this during tree pollen season which put this product to the test since my circles were really bad then.&lt;br /&gt;This product has a reflective property to it so it hides these dark circles and the more you use it the better you look.&lt;br /&gt;I also liked how it worked to diminish fine lines and had a nice smoothing effect without any tight feeling.</li>
            <li> Ordered it July 24th, received it on July 26th !  Lightning fast delivery!!! Was wrapped very tight in plastic, almost had to buzz saw it to get it open!  Product is nice and light, but effective, I guess it&#x27;s true Roc keeps it&#x27;s promises!!</li>
            <li> This eye cream is AMAZING! I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and decided to start an anti-aging regimen, especially because I wanted to do something about the slightly dark circles under my eyes which are hereditary. So I tried this eye cream and I noticed the unsurpassed results within about two weeks... It smoothed out some very fine lines, lightened the dark circles under my eyes and tightened the skin. I even got compliments from my mom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among other more expensive products, I&#x27;ve tried Murad&#x27;s renewing eye cream ($75) but none yielded any comparable results. You won&#x27;t regret trying it!</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream, although I can&#x27;t say it has worked any miracles.  It is a perfect consistency, not too light or too heavy.  It absorbs quickly. I have sensitive skin, and have had no problems with this product.  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Really does what it said it will do. Awesome</li>
            <li> This RoC Multi Correxion Stress Repair Eye Cream is just what eyes over 50 need.  I&#x27;ve tried plenty of eye cream and none of them have reduced sag, restored elasticity and decreased lines and papery texture like this cream!  Just incredible and combined with wrinkle filler......my complexion is restored to late 30s appearance.  LOVE...LOVE....LOVE RoC products!</li>
            <li> This product is as good as any expensive department-store product I&#x27;ve used in the past. This is my new \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; eye cream.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and am always looking for products that have staying power and don&#x27;t disappear within an hour.  This is a very nice eye product from ROC that does not burn or sting on my sensitive skin, moisturizes and comforts, slightly brightens.  Does what it says its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it did my eyes any wonders. I have had dark circles for years now, and thought i should try something different after trying Clinique eye cream and having it work wonders. I just thought maybe something for sensitive eyes would do even better. To be honest, I don&#x27;t see much difference, and after i&#x27;m through with this product, i will definitely buy Clinique again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eye cream last year for my mother.  I am a skincare junkie and am always on the look-out for new cleansers, toners, serums, moisturizers, and eye creams.  Having worked for years in the skincare/makeup industry, it didn&#x27;t take me long to realize that, with the exception of a handful of products within the various high end lines, an ingredient IS an ingredient.  Yes, concentrations vary...but in terms of RoC, and in particular, it&#x27;s Multi Correxion Stress Repair Eye Cream, retinol IS retinol.  If you do not react well to Vitamin A in such a high concentration in a $200 eye cream, you are not going to react well to it in a RoC product.  I purchased the product, as I said, for my mother because it seemed easy to apply and seemed rich enough to be visible enough during application, as to not miss any of the delicate eye area.  While retinol works wonders, especially when combined with rich emollients to counteract any dryness, it is important to be able to see the product on the skin long enough to NOT wind up accidentally winding up with it in your eyes or missing spots. I have been using the cream nightly for about a week, now.  I feel that the cream, regardless of the amount I use, is always on the verge of flaking up (ya know...that pencil erasure thing some creams do?)  However, it hasn&#x27;t actually done it...so I can&#x27;t knock it for that.  I know that this is supposed to be super hydrating...but when I go for a hydrating eye cream, usually to apply OVER a simple retinol gel serum, I like the cream to be super creamy and almost never fully dry--kind of like lip balm, I suppose.  So, in that regard, I am not impressed.  If I were to attempt to apply concealer under my eyes and over this cream, I  can tell it would be too dry and probably flake up, taking the eye cream with it.  However, it IS fragrance free, thankfully!  I have to say that my tube is a good year old...just only used once or twice and sealed up.  So, to be fair, I really would like to try a fresh tube to give it a truly fair shot.  Also, in my opinion, when a product promises to help eliminate dark circles, and simply has something in it to reflect light and mask circles, it is really not holding up it&#x27;s promise.ry a fresh tube to give it a truly fair shot.

            <li> Caused redness, dryness and irritation made me stop using this treatment, so unfortunately I can&#x60;t comment on the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;I may give it another chance and use it even more sparingly and carefully than I already did.</li>
            <li> Good Item, Fast Shipping Thank You!</li>
            <li> I needed a light yet rich eye cream as I have crows feet and tiny lines underneath my eyes. I decided to purchase this cream. I still have the crows feet and tiny lines, but they are less noticeable than before. It&#x27;s a very light cream that moisturizes your eye area, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pretty happy with this eye cream... i feel like the lines around my eyes are less noticeable with only a couple of uses....</li>
            <li> Nice and creamy and lasts all night leaving my eyes feeling good in the morning and helps throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t last me anytime..seemed like there wasn&#x27;t much in it. Couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in my eye area. Just okay</li>
            <li> Smooth application and it doesn&#x27;t sting.  I use it with my other Roc products sometimes day and night.  Won&#x27;t flake under make up either.  Definitely helps reduce dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I just turned 36 last week, and this product left chemical burns all over my eye lids, under my eye, and along my eye sockets. I do not recommend this product. To anyone. Ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, feels nice going on.</li>
            <li> It is always hard to know if your moisturizers are doing all that can be done to fulfill the stated claims of every brand. The RoC Multi Correxion Stress Repair Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce leaves the skin around my eyes feeling soft and more elastic. Anyway, I have decided to work with this brand to see if I can at least maintain my skin&#x27;s relatively good genetics. So far I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I REALLY DONT HAVE THE TIME FOR THIS, BUT I LOVE THE PRODUCTF.  ARE YOU KIDDING 7 MOR WORDS REQUIRED</li>
            <li> definitely reduced puffiness of my upper eye lid, which always made one eye appear bigger than the other. tightened up skin on the bottom of my eyes too.</li>
            <li> Only worked a little. Much happier with my Loreal Revitalift eye cream in a tube.</li>
