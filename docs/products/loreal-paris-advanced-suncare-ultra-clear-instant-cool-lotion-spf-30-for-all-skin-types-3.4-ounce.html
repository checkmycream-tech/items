            <li>and I got it for a great price with Amazon Pantry.</li>
            <li>good price</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t sticky or oily and it smelled good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enter this amazing sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Loreal Paris Sunscreen is amazing</li>
            <li>Nice product, works as described and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my face.</li>
            <li>I really liked this as a Sun screen when I was j n</li>
            <li>I did receive a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I used spray sunscreen a lot and liked the way it felt</li>
            <li>Seems to protect well also, doesn&#x27;t sweat off very easily.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product at a discounted price through Amazon in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>The strong scent fades after a minute or so and at that point, it smells more pleasant than most SPF 30+ sunscreens I have used.</li>
            <li>Very light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Light and perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Cooling and refreshing while protecting your skin from sunburn - what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>It has a nice pleasant smell and it is clear and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or oily.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues with sun burns, so it seems pretty spot on.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t put my makeup easily because it felt like using a peeler product and not sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Had a really strong alcohol smell, was too watery.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as the high end moisturizers at a fraction  of the price</li>
            <li>good price, light citrus scent, goes on clear</li>
            <li>I like how it&#x27;s so light on my skin and still protects me from the UVA.  </li>
            <li>so it comes on pretty refreshing and cooling.</li>
            <li>Most give my sensitive skin a rash, most cause me to breakout, and all cause me to sweat profusely, basically canceling out the benefit of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it goes on clear.</li>
            <li>Great sunblock, it&#x27;s a little greasy</li>
            <li>Love that it is clear,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am impressed and plan on purchasing more of this the next time I am forced to go outside.  </li>
            <li>On top of all this, I am extremely fair and burn in minutes, so I spend as much time indoors as possible and am a whiny grump any time I must be outside, especially in the hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing about it is that the smell initially is so strong of alcohol that you can&#x27;t take a breath.</li>
            <li>but it turns out to be very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t make you sweat so much.</li>
            <li>This Sunscreen worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen is very vital in the summertime with the hot sun..</li>
            <li>Usually I use SPF 50 or more, but I went lighter to 30 this time and was not burnt!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less sticky than many sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Particularly given the price, I highly recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li>Initially, there is a strong alcohol scent, similar to hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>By some miracle, this causes only a slight reaction on my face (the best of all the brands I have tried, some costing $40+ per tube), it only made me sweat a little, and it actually kept me from getting any color during a weekend at the beach!  </li>
            <li>Clear and no sticky feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is a clear gel, and feels about the consistency of hair gel.  </li>
            <li>For those of us with sensitive skin, this is a godsend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have been using sunscreen for years and they cost 5-6 times more but at least never had this problem.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the initial cooling effect, even though it wasn&#x27;t strong made my eyes soar for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned but hate the way sunscreen feels.</li>
            <li>could not put enough product near below my eyes and that is why I will not buy this again.</li>

            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused me to burn, but gets a little frustrating.</li>
            <li> It is not completely flawless, but it does the job and it does it with the fewest negative side effects of any sunscreen I have tried, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens if not hundreds!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like to use sunscreen because it is not always made for women but this I feel helps my aging skin.</li>
            <li> I like how it&#x27;s so light on my skin and still protects me from the UVA.  It&#x27;s gel so it comes on pretty refreshing and cooling.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this lotion but it turns out to be very moisturizing. I like the finish of it. The only thing about it is that the smell initially is so strong of alcohol that you can&#x27;t take a breath. I was waiting for my face to burn but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> my wife likes it and uses it on a regular basis. good price</li>
            <li> Just as good as the high end moisturizers at a fraction  of the price</li>
            <li> Love it. L&#x27;oreal is definitely a name I trust. Light and perfect for my sensitive skin. Clear and no sticky feel afterwards. I was able to try this product at a discounted price through Amazon in exchange for an honest review. Thank You</li>
            <li> I hate sunscreen.  Most give my sensitive skin a rash, most cause me to breakout, and all cause me to sweat profusely, basically canceling out the benefit of sunscreen.  I hate how it feels, how it pills, how everything sticks to me- well, you get the point.  On top of all this, I am extremely fair and burn in minutes, so I spend as much time indoors as possible and am a whiny grump any time I must be outside, especially in the hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this amazing sunscreen.  This is a clear gel, and feels about the consistency of hair gel.  When it dried, it dries to a slightly tacky finish, but nothing too irritating.  By some miracle, this causes only a slight reaction on my face (the best of all the brands I have tried, some costing $40+ per tube), it only made me sweat a little, and it actually kept me from getting any color during a weekend at the beach!  For those of us with sensitive skin, this is a godsend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted a star because I did not notice any cooling effect, and it did pill a bit when I reapplied, every 90-120 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am impressed and plan on purchasing more of this the next time I am forced to go outside.  It is not completely flawless, but it does the job and it does it with the fewest negative side effects of any sunscreen I have tried, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens if not hundreds!  Particularly given the price, I highly recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li> I do like that this sunscreen is a gel rather than a lotion. I use this only to protect my face and arms/hands when out gardening or mowing the lawn. I have fair skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues with sun burns, so it seems pretty spot on.</li>
            <li> Had a really strong alcohol smell, was too watery.  Tried it once and got burnt.  Threw it out.</li>
            <li> good price, light citrus scent, goes on clear</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sunscreen for my face. I will not buy this again for two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;First, as soon as I started rubbing it on, it started solidifying. I couldn&#x27;t put my makeup easily because it felt like using a peeler product and not sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using sunscreen for years and they cost 5-6 times more but at least never had this problem.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the initial cooling effect, even though it wasn&#x27;t strong made my eyes soar for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I could not put enough product near below my eyes and that is why I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Nice product, works as described and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my face. Use it when I go on my daily runs.</li>
            <li> I really liked this as a Sun screen when I was j n the sun all day. It wasn&#x27;t sticky or oily and it smelled good.</li>
            <li> Cooling and refreshing while protecting your skin from sunburn - what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal - products you can always trust and count on.  It has a nice pleasant smell and it is clear and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or oily.  I would recommend this product.  I did receive a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Applies great!  It tends to ball up and come off about 15 minutes after applying.  It hasn&#x27;t caused me to burn, but gets a little frustrating.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is very vital in the summertime with the hot sun..Loreal Paris Sunscreen is amazing</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen a lot and I got it for a great price with Amazon Pantry. It&#x27;s nice that it goes on clear. It&#x27;s less sticky than many sunscreens I&#x27;ve used. The cooling effect is very minimal though. I did notice a slight difference, but it lasted maybe 10-15 seconds. Initially, there is a strong alcohol scent, similar to hand sanitizer. The strong scent fades after a minute or so and at that point, it smells more pleasant than most SPF 30+ sunscreens I have used.</li>
            <li> Very light and non greasy. I&#x27;m not sure about the cooling effect, but it feels very sheer so it doesn&#x27;t make you sweat so much.</li>
            <li> This Sunscreen worked really well for me.  Usually I use SPF 50 or more, but I went lighter to 30 this time and was not burnt!</li>
            <li> Great sunblock, it&#x27;s a little greasy but it does the job. Price is great!</li>
            <li> I feel it has a lot of alcohol in this sunscreen and a little sticky as well. Don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love that it is clear,</li>
            <li> my favorite sunscreen!!!</li>
            <li> Feels great! Not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make you sweat like lotion sunscreens do. Seems to protect well also, doesn&#x27;t sweat off very easily. A great buy for those who hate sunscreen but know they should wear it, like me! I&#x27;m very fair skinned but hate the way sunscreen feels. I used spray sunscreen a lot and liked the way it felt but it just didn&#x27;t coat evenly and I was afraid of inhaling the chemicals... This is a great alternative!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got an old product but soon as I started rubbing it on, it started solidifying so it felt like using a peeler product and not sunscreen. Have to try a couple of times to align the cap to the tiny hole and sometimes product just leaks to the cap and immediately changes color from clear to a milky swirl substance... not cool.</li>
