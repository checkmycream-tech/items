            <li>Works great, a good cut with no pulling</li>
            <li>so I went ahead and used the trimmers to bald fade it which was even more impressive.  </li>
            <li>trim properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not the best, but my 3yo Panasonic ER221 is much better</li>
            <li>Great and good looking clippers.</li>
            <li>very good clipper easy to use  and great for fading</li>
            <li>Like it works good for me</li>
            <li>I did an exhaustive survey and found this to be a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rate it a good C+ on vibrationlessness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good variety of attachments, but doesn&#x27;t come with comb or scissors.</li>
            <li>and it just dont look good</li>
            <li>All in all a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Good grip and feel.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t give these a good rating.  </li>
            <li>anyone could use them, and good with any styled hair cut.</li>
            <li>this is a excellent product ,would recommend it to all persons looking for a smooth cut.</li>
            <li>but if it continues to be this good</li>
            <li>To anyone thinking about making this purchse, it will be wise to invest.  </li>
            <li>My andis clippers Cut really smooth and fades Hair excellent</li>
            <li>They appeared to be a good compromise between price and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It appears that Andis does make good quality clippers.  </li>
            <li>Fair price.</li>
            <li>SO if your are looking for a good set of clippers look elsewhere</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great price for a good deal.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>The ceramic blade is great, it doesn&#x27;t get as warm as steel on steel blades.  </li>

            <li>Enjoy!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li>First off, allow me to preface that I take excellent care of all my tools.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these, and after reading the reviews I was sure I had made an excellent choice.  </li>
            <li>I really love the rubber/steel combo as well !</li>
            <li>Just make sure you oil it after every use!</li>
            <li>but all I can say is that this one is pretty great!</li>
            <li>Still running strong and gives a great haircut.</li>
            <li>It is very good at not cutting your skin.</li>
            <li>I am not a barber by any means but these are AMAZING.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s absolutely amazing in my book.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wait, just get it, its amazing.</li>
            <li>I got these clippers for my boyfriend who cuts his own hair at home.  </li>
            <li>I decided why not cut my own hair???</li>
            <li>This clippers are perfect, cut fast and efficiently, i use them for my head and face.</li>
            <li>They get warm after 20 mins but don&#x27;t burn you.</li>
            <li>After using a sideburns trimmer, and then a Remington Short-cut clipper (the one with the beveled edge) and then moving on to this, I can honestly say there is no comparison to using not-so-great clippers to using these.  </li>
            <li>I ordered my own.</li>
            <li>ceramic blades cut as good or better than steel blades but the don&#x27;t&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and I cut my own hair about once every three weeks.  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and sometimes it was hit or miss with the clippers I used.</li>
            <li>Have been using this two cut my own hair for over two years.</li>
            <li>After a friend told me he does his own hair cuts</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>They make my sons hair look so nice.</li>
            <li>i honestly can&#x27;t find a Con   well maybe just one</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
            <li>Use between haircuts- does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>Andis has an impressive level of pro level hair clipper tools,price is not a question for the quality,price,longevity in long term great results.</li>
            <li>Excellent, high quality tool for the price.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT, SUPER USSEFULL AND SILENCE....</li>
            <li>the ceramic blades cut very easily.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to operate and maintain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping wise I received them in a timely matter ordered them on the 14th got them on the 16th for free.</li>
            <li>ok the fact&#x27;s is these Clippers are Amazing</li>
            <li>These are by far the best I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>They were light weight and fit my hand beautifully.  </li>
            <li>is the brand most professional barbers use, and this model is the best I found in this price range( I paid $45).</li>
            <li>Upon finishing my haircut, trimming my goatee and moustache, the clippers were barely warm at the most, which is better than I can say on some of the others I had to return</li>
            <li>The clippers first of all they look great , not that that has anything to do with they way the cut hair.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive at first about getting these clippers, even after reading the great reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>This product is lightweight, easy to clean, many combs to choose from, and a great value.</li>
            <li>Very smooth with no tugging or pulling.</li>
            <li>onces i got the hang of it, it cut super good and it works awsome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s advertised to not get hot, but does however get very warm.</li>
            <li>Very good clipping and keeps pretty cool with the ceramic (also bought the Andis spray to keep in good condition and blades cool).  </li>
            <li>Value for money would be appropriate to say.</li>
            <li>But if you are mostly using the combs, that will not be an issue.</li>
            <li>Anyway, i returned them and will seek out a better set of clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, in this price range, there are much better clipper out there.  </li>
            <li>are some better alternatives that I suggest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wahl 5-Star Magic Clip $40</li>
            <li>Does everything you need and more with the guards.</li>
            <li>overall is still a great set!</li>
            <li>I cannot really say if it was actually a great product</li>
            <li>but I know there is better around this price.  </li>
            <li>They look better than all of my barbers clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I love these babies</li>
            <li>These clippers are simply outstanding.  </li>
            <li>They cut perfectly and feel like they are built to last forever.  </li>
            <li>imagine how the Osters could be any better.    </li>
            <li>The item that was sent to me had the voltage labels scratched off, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could use this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this unit.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with the quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>I just love to use this piece.</li>
            <li>They also vibrate a bit more noticeable than your 40-50 dollar pair purchased at Wal-mart.</li>
            <li>I was able to do the job and got the look I wanted without yet another buzz cut.</li>
            <li>These could be more versitile for the price.</li>
            <li>I still tried to tell myself it was ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Many size attachments.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>I use it for beard trimming and it does not take me more than 3-4 minutes</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>AS OUTSTANDING</li>
            <li>Just as described, Andis has in my opinion better guards the transition from a 1 guard to a 2 gaurd on whals</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I am going to love these, can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li>The Andis clippers are for sure a step up and seem to do a better job in every respect.  </li>
            <li>The budget set performed \\&quot;fine\\&quot; for many years, doing 2-4 clippings per month.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with these clippers.  </li>
            <li>I want to make the best decision since I expect to be using it for several years.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this clipper.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I cut my  hair once a week and do not do anything too sophisticated at all.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair clipper&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight</li>
            <li>This was purchased more than 6 years ago.</li>
            <li>I love Andis brand for my dog grooming clippers, so i bought these for my peoples&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>: I still love this clipper.  </li>
            <li>MY BROTHER PRACTICALLY LOVE HIS CLIPPER</li>
            <li>Nice and light as well.  </li>
            <li>Seem to cut a lot more even than the wahl.</li>
            <li>works great on straight hair and curly hair.</li>
            <li>i cut my friends hair with these clippers and my friends love the cuts i give them.</li>
            <li>looks great also and definitely backed by a good quality brand name.</li>
            <li>Product works perfectly comes with many different guards.</li>
            <li>he said they were better than the ones he wanted.</li>
            <li>Top quality clippers are sold in barber shops, online beauty shops, and you can basically buy anything on amazon.  </li>
            <li>One very good thing that I will say about these is that they do not get hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice clean cut.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I gave myself a haircut that I thought was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Every part of the Andis package is better; the attachments fit better, the scissors are sharper, and the oil smells better.</li>
            <li>vibrate pretty dern good.</li>
            <li>It gets pretty good close for a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li>the replacement is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>At first I loved this buzzer compared to my wahl.  </li>
            <li>But at around $42, this is a very good buy for those who want to upgrade to better quality clippers without spending the big bucks on the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; models.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that its quite and easily glide through the hair.</li>
            <li>It did eventually get warm to touch, so not a noticable difference for me there, but overall it is a great clipper for home use.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>(direct from Amazon via free super saver shipping)is totally  awesome.  </li>
            <li>After using it several times, I can say its a very good product.</li>
            <li>They run very cool.  </li>
            <li>Best $40 I have spent.</li>
            <li>Most of all cuts the hair with ease and the clip on blade covers actually fit..</li>
            <li>Make sure you oil it before and after each use.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic clips may pop off during use so check the fit each time.</li>
            <li>Great clipper so far.</li>
            <li>Great clippers for professional</li>
            <li>-attachments are very sturdy  -comes in good packaging  </li>
            <li>It is still working perfectly with minimal attention - much better than the cheap kits tried before ever worked.</li>
            <li>To begin with i really wanted these clippers to be good.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into fades then these clippers are right for you!!</li>
            <li>Awesome clippers, keeps me looking clean cut everyday, thank you kindly.</li>
            <li>I ordered this through Amazon with quality research prior to engaging in this excellent choice,and saved even more with Super Saver free shipping to Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>not a bad choice!</li>
            <li>I think it is the best vale for the money, and not very many clippers  are better for the paper.</li>
            <li>Plenty of power to run easily.</li>
            <li>The instructional videos for the care and use of the clippers is easy to find on youtube.</li>
            <li>So one can easily infer that the product is not designed to cut any closer than that 1/16\\&quot; gap between the blade components.  </li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>Still going strong</li>
            <li>I purchased it 5-6 years ago for about $35, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>This hair clipper is an awesome smart purchase and light years from most any general retailer - home owner level product.</li>
            <li>The Andis 24145 Speed Master 2 Clipper, Chrome; it is exactly what I was looking for, because I can cut my own hair once a month without the help of another if need be.</li>
            <li>i get a nice consistent fade everytime they cut well.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that I keep at a #2 length</li>
            <li>However, even at that this is a fine clipper and</li>
            <li>i could rate it any less than 1 star i certainly would!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>it otherwise the review would&#x27;ve been fine.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I get lucky and able to use em pain-free but 90% of the time</li>
            <li>: durable and doesn&#x27;t bog down, looks good, plastic end pieces make good zombie spears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Its quiet gives a really great haircut easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and powerful.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was going to write this review after the first time that I used it, but I waited to see if I was being too excited about its performance.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they fall off and buzz, you have to give yourself yet another buzz cut because of a huge spot of closely shaven hair.</li>
            <li>honestly i think it looks more professional with out it      </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and oil.</li>
            <li>I now own the Wahl 5-Star Senior, and I must say that they are top of the line and only $15 more than the Speed Master 2.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve cut my hair for over 15 years, primarily because it&#x27;s hassle-free.  </li>
            <li>Another cheaply made in china piece of junk.</li>
            <li>LOL, just found out that this review was mixed with a necklace I bougth.</li>
            <li>Works smooth, no pull.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t mind patting myself on the back, I did a great job with these clippers.</li>
            <li>I have the Andies Master as well, but they are too heavy for me to give a marvelous fade...</li>
            <li>Not an expert, only telling what I have experienced.  </li>
            <li>Best hair clipper and heavy duty.</li>
            <li>i would recomend them ,great buy for the low price</li>
            <li>The plastic cutter seems cheap and would not cut hair</li>
            <li>Use a couple times a week for a few months now, and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not a barber but my barber uses his set on kids who don&#x27;t like the sound of clippers).</li>
            <li>I thought that&#x27;s what all clippers sound like.  </li>
            <li>They are smaller than many clippers, but have a good heft to them.  </li>
            <li>And this may be a great product; obviously, many other reviewers thought so.  </li>
            <li>Low maintenance makes it very handy</li>
            <li>Super fast, cuts nice and close.  </li>
            <li>I purchased them and confirmed this to be true.</li>
            <li>These clippers in particular happened to have pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to give my first haircut with them.  </li>
            <li>the ceramic blade is new to me, and it glides so nicely and stays cooler.</li>
            <li>After using them a few times, I can safely say that I made a great choice.   </li>
            <li>I had to swipe 2 and 3 times to get a clean cut.  </li>
            <li>it clean it between the blades, spray coolant on it, even try to get the clogged hair out of the buzzer itself.  </li>
            <li>So much better than the noisy old trimmer that I bought many years ago.</li>
            <li>I relied on the positive reviews here and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Zero-gap the blades, and this machine will give you some of the best skin-fades ever, as well as knock out hard lines.</li>
            <li>very cool, not gotten hot</li>
            <li>Makes me look like I am a professional barber as long as you know what your doing and best brand as well.</li>
            <li>machine overall looks beautiful and feels really rugged    </li>
            <li>He raves how this one is much better &amp; more powerful than his old one.  </li>
            <li>Now she insists on doing the back, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>$49 (Not as good as the above 2, but still an overall good clipper.  </li>
            <li>Mostly made of metal, it is a bit heavier in the hand but also doesn&#x27;t vibrate quite as much.</li>
            <li>Mind you, if you want a buzz cut, these will surely do the job and fast.</li>
            <li>But now that i have these i am extra good on my fades..</li>
            <li>Quiet, well built and has a good assortment of trimmer combs.</li>
            <li>Oh and the Fact that these Run Cool</li>
            <li>that are designed to cool the blades off?  </li>
            <li>set overall, good price-</li>
            <li>The cermaic blades do stay cool though.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a beginner.</li>
            <li>I expected much more from these as I&#x27;ve easily gotten three or more years of use out of cheap store bought Wahl clippers.  </li>
            <li>Being that he loves to cut hair and is great at doing it, I decided to get him a new set of professional clippers.  </li>
            <li>Attachments fit pretty well, adjustment lever holds in place nice and firm, and motor sounds good and feels powerful.</li>
            <li>but it will not be as sharp or look as good or be as easy as it is with the Andis Outliner II ether way you have to buy a Outliner and this to have that barber experience     </li>
            <li>Wahl Super Taper II</li>
            <li>Pruduct arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>They do an excellent job of actually cutting hair, which is the most important bit,</li>
            <li>I have used other cordless trimmers and this one is the best by far</li>
            <li>They barely get warm.  </li>
            <li>Well...I was very surprised at how well this clipper performed, they&#x27;re very sharpe and cut very smoothly, I dont see how a higher priced clipper could do any better.</li>
            <li>The unit feels like it is high quality, it feels solid in the hand, and after over a year of use it is still holding up great.</li>
            <li>Since the unit plugs in it has much more power than the rechargeable clippers and they didn&#x27;t get that hot and were much more quiet to boot.</li>
            <li>There may be even better high end clippers on the market, but for the price these seem to be well built and can cut a nice precise short fade very well.  </li>
            <li>(You really won&#x27;t find many fading clippers that are better, outside of Andis Masters; has \\&quot;fade blade\\&quot; and cool running</li>
            <li>It gives a crisp clean cut.  </li>
            <li>Finally replaced it and this is just an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It did ok with #2 guard on the sides but when i got to the top is where i started having trouble with free handing it.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>He started to laugh when I said I got it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Nice and quiet...</li>
            <li>Might be worth checking into.    </li>
            <li>old one did the job &amp; lasted many years without doing any maintenance&lt;br /&gt;or oiling the blades.  </li>
            <li>These are a nice and quiet set.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It was pulling and not cutting evenly.  </li>
            <li>but it was quiet and did a nice job.  </li>
            <li>i purchased this andis because i thought it would be as powerful as the masters....</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>He tested them out right away.  </li>
            <li>So far new one workiing great just like old one.  </li>
            <li>The new clipper cuts hair MUCH slower than the old clipper, and not as good.  </li>
            <li>They cut fast and clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to blend cuts and cleans the back hairline close and neatly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any barber who enjoys giving their customers that nice, clean, sharp cut.</li>
            <li>These clippers are quiet, stay much cooler than the one&#x27;s my barber was using, they cut a better fade, they are professional class clippers,and the price is nice.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are easy to use, lightweight, quiet, and  provides smooth finish.</li>
            <li>, motor doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;whine\\&quot; under pressure thus ripping out your hair and follicles, and this shaver really is tried and true.</li>
            <li>I am not a professional barber; I cut my own hair . . .</li>
            <li>I live in an apartment and sound consideration is always a factor.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, it&#x27;s the only thing that can really wear.</li>
            <li>Hair cuts take less time and have a good FEEL afterwards.  </li>
            <li>They cut fast and the blade stays pretty cool.</li>
            <li>The clippers are very light and very quiet.  </li>
            <li>It moves very fast and doesn&#x27;t miss any of the hair.  </li>
            <li>very very well&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The only downside is that this kit doesn&#x27;t include tapered attachments, but the Wahl branded attachments fit great with just a little force needed to seat them.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend these to any guy who uses them very often like I do!</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful and the noise and shake is reasonable.    </li>
            <li>The result in the first use having just received this today ...</li>
            <li>I still consider these a mid-level clipper, and top of the line clippers can be had for around the same price.  </li>
            <li>The construction on these is much higher than the Wahls.</li>
            <li>&gt; get hot at all.&lt;br /&gt;-They</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>than they did the first time i used them.</li>
            <li>: It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as steel-bladed clippers.  </li>
            <li>First set of Andis clippers I have ever bought and they won&#x27;t be the last.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I considered the higher priced Andis clippers, but opted to try this one thinking it might be sufficient since its just for me.</li>
            <li>I received this clipper in the mail yesterday the exact time i had a haircut.</li>
            <li>I am a professional Lady barberstylist and i have to say these are the most light weight, quiet sounding clippers i have owned besides the Andis Speed Master 1.</li>
            <li>It took more trips over the same area to get a uniform cut.  </li>
            <li>The first problem was they kept tripping my GFCI switch.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a fluke, but it happened repeatedly.  </li>
            <li>I made my first swipe and noticed I needed to go over it again.  </li>
            <li>My first ceramic blade trimmer.</li>
            <li>Cuts hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>and they started to get pretty noisy in the 12-18 month timeframe.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had them get overly hot, even in the summertime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One reason we chose the Speed Master 2 over the higher priced Andis was based on reviews that said the others were HOT, and the ceramic blade of this model would keep them running cooler.  </li>
            <li>BUT ... the others were significantly higher priced, without the ceramic blade.  </li>
            <li>The ceramic blades keeps the blade temperature low and it cuts better.</li>
            <li>First I will say I turned the clippers on, found hair on it and grime on the the powerswitch.</li>
            <li>The unit can get pretty hot in the hand though after a while.</li>
            <li>It also gets hot even porcelain addition to prevent that.</li>
            <li>These clippers are better than what my barber was using, not just because they are Andis but because of proper cleaning, sanitation, and oiling.  </li>
            <li>I did my first cut</li>
            <li>hair and motor gets hot after a while</li>
            <li>/&gt;We got the first set and gave them a try.  </li>
            <li>I was able to send the clippers back for an exchange (on my dime).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them getting hot, as some reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the last clippers I had.  </li>
            <li>and I have had a consistent performance.</li>
            <li>Theses are the first pair of clippers I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li>These dont get as hot as others and dont pull at all</li>
            <li>this is the first time I used the ceramic blades</li>
            <li>After the first one delivered was return because it was &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; (had hair under the blades)</li>
            <li>i was going to get those instead of these clippers at first</li>
            <li>I did some extensive research and found Andis to be top of the line clippers.</li>
            <li>The blades haven&#x27;t dulled at all and it performs better than several cheaper clippers I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
            <li>The heavy duty cord sort of got in the way, but considering what a good, rapid and even job the clippers did</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T waste you money on this inferior product in spite of good reviews (which i relied on)</li>
            <li>Near the end of its life, it would get loose very quickly and I would tap it against my stone counter top and it would stop making noise for a minute; this process was repeated over and over.</li>
            <li>The Speed Master 2 clippers work very well and so far, seem like a fine product.  </li>
            <li>Certain ones work better for different hair type and thickness.</li>
            <li>I used them for about 45 minutes and they get warm but not hot</li>
            <li>I have seen some other clippers get hotter, but these are REALLY warm.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the other nice features</li>
            <li>Is this due to a superior clipper, or just a new blade?  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this machine the ceramic blades are awsome very smooth wile cutting and does not get warm and very quiet motor</li>
            <li>This is the best and ultimately the least costly of all of them.</li>
            <li>Works a ton better than the cheap Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve had for few years from Wallmart.</li>
            <li>and certainly they were not uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice haircut and with a guide on, it misses less hair on the first pass.</li>
            <li>I do not feel that they overheat any more or less than other clippers I have purchased, but they do give a superior cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that the attachments from my old one fit this newer one, and also that my old plastic case that came with the old one fits this new one, but it really doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the older one did.  </li>
            <li>I buzz my own hair every few weeks and have been using an old cheap Wahl clipper for years.</li>
            <li>As others have stated these clippers get hot fast.</li>
            <li>after 4 haircuts these are my favorite clippers yet, should have got these a long time ago.</li>
            <li>but this may be normal/expected for higher end, fast running clippers.  </li>
            <li>It becomes too hot really fast</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t owned them long at all, but I have the impression that I will be owning them for many years to come.  </li>
            <li>I also use this to trim my beard when I have one, and pretty much any hair on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The SpeedMaster 2 actually had a tougher time with my hair than its cheaper, older (and duller, I&#x27;m sure)</li>
            <li>I always order good professional clippers and I thought that this would be another good buy, WRONG!</li>
            <li>I had been using the Andis &#x27;Easy Cut&#x27; model ($19.95) at the local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Cuts so easily and is very quiet compared to any clipper I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how easy it is to use, and left my self wondering why I&#x27;ve paid for barber-shop cuts all these years.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use with adjustable tops for different functions.</li>
            <li>The body of the clipper is not so large that I cannot hold them like a lot of others...</li>
            <li>As for the refurb clippers, they run strong, cut Precisely, and have a cool white ceramic blade that is sharp and doesn&#x27;t snag.</li>
            <li>nice, smooth, quite, easy cutting.</li>
            <li>very high qulity</li>
            <li>Strong and quiet with several attachments that will come in handy with the different seasons.</li>
            <li>They do get a little warm after a while, but I can tolerate that.</li>
            <li>Now it is still super sharp and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Clippers do not get hot for normal use.  </li>
            <li>believe The Andis 24145 Speed Master 2 Clipper, Chrome is very well made and will last me many many years without any trouble</li>
            <li>runs wonderfully, much cheaper than the andis master.</li>
            <li>It is much sharper, has the adjustable blade, and is quieter than the Wahl I needed to replace.  </li>
            <li>I can tell it was really used because the steel cover looks washed and fingerprint marks were all over it.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>I expected more from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But opening the package to see someone else&#x27;s hair in the teeth changed the whole</li>
            <li>These clippers cut very well with one pass and don&#x27;t snag your hair even with the guard on.</li>
            <li>for the heat issue, none really to speak of.</li>
            <li>The 24145 cuts hair fast without pulling.</li>
            <li>This happened for the whole haircut.  </li>
            <li>This clipper works really well.  </li>
            <li>they cut really well .  </li>
            <li>You can definitely tell the difference between cheap clippers and these.</li>
            <li>i really think that this is a Steal i got these clippers cause</li>
            <li>but, they came rather fast.</li>
            <li>hahaha.</li>
            <li>Theyare STILL very \\&quot;W-A-R-M\\&quot; ....</li>
            <li>These cannot be repaired if they tear up, the American made clippers have replacement parts available.  </li>
            <li>These clippers cut very well.  </li>
            <li>Seems really smooth and fairly quiet.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>button and the lever feel really sturdy  -the</li>
            <li>I found that it is important to regularly lubricate the blades so they stay cooler during use.</li>
            <li>After breaking the Wahls, I figured I would upgrade since I&#x27;m saving so much on bi-weekly haircuts.  </li>
            <li>I said in the title, I really wanted to like these clippers.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and quiet operation.</li>
            <li>I have had it for 18 months now and it still works very well, stable and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I liked that the teeth on the guards were sturdy and close together, but the motor on this thing is not strong enough to get through one pass on my 4 yr olds fine hair.</li>
            <li>but i went with the speedmasters because they are known to be very versatile</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet compared to the wahl types that I have been using for the last 15 yrs.  </li>
            <li>It is cool, less noisy and cut through your hair smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that it gets hot fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I finally settled on the Andis because of the good Amazon reviews, they plugged in, and the fact that they had ceramic teeth which I assume will stay sharp longer that just steel clipping against steel.</li>
            <li>I was put off by the idea of having to oil blades on the high end clippers because I thought it would be a lot more trouble than it was worth.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind that I understand some other clippers may cut better depending on the texture of the hair.</li>
            <li>So it only made sense that I try to the Andis clippers as well and again I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>they are like a Sports car   compare to most other clippers in there price range</li>
            <li>Honestly, you can get other clippers that work fine for less money...  </li>
            <li>I gave away the complete old set, which means I had to buy another set of barber scissors, but the one with the first set weren&#x27;t that good anyway, about $6 with tax at Wally World, and a small mirror and a plastic box to hold everything, both from the dollar store.   </li>
            <li>I ended up buying and keeping the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade, which is also light weight and quiet.</li>
            <li>You get some REAL Clippers and the guards (and a real &#x27;professional&#x27; power cord)</li>
            <li>They are quiet and run cool.  </li>
            <li>The unit comes with a full set of combs for different hair lengths.</li>
            <li>these clippers have a robust motor and dont get nearly as hot as our old pair...</li>
            <li>This is significantly better than the more common commercial brands.</li>
            <li>After dealing with a barber that cut my hair for 24 years, putting up with poor treatment as a client,I decided to cut my own hair and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  </li>
            <li>the mean time, we found a Wahl clipper with a lithium battery that is much lighter and much more powerful</li>
            <li>After almost two years, it still runs like new!  </li>
            <li>I love them the power they light weight an can cut wet hair due to the ceramic blade.</li>
            <li>: none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent $30 on my first set of clippers, so the extra $10 is well worth it for better blades that will last much longer and a much quieter set of clippers.</li>
            <li>used to have a oster clippers than lasted 10 years and cost half, still liking em more...</li>
            <li>I purchased these clippers a year and a half ago after I dropped my Wahl clippers (with the color coded guards) and it cracked, being mostly plastic.</li>
            <li>I called the Andis problem number and learned that I would need to send the clippers back to Andis in Wisconsin; the Andis person was only able to give information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only issue is being able to brush away all the hair from the teeth, especially when lubricating it, just seems as if it just sticks between</li>
            <li>but I am particular</li>
            <li>After going multiple times over the same areas, I was able to pinch and pull hairs between my fingernail and thumb.  </li>
            <li>But my most recent one only lasted two years,</li>
            <li>I have found that I tend to use the #1, #3, and #5 and the result is a decent looking hair cut.  </li>
            <li>A heavy-duty trimmer for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I was using an older model for years.  </li>
            <li>Initially I was happy with them, but lately, as others have mentioned, they pull your hair rather than cut it.  </li>
            <li>I have been cutting my own hair for years and have tried many store brand clippers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for the do it yourself type.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can tell this thing is well constructed and high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for this purpose.</li>
            <li>Overall great set of clippers, they dont get stuck on hair wet or dry.</li>
            <li>They are also very balanced in weight so less stress on your wrist and fingers for those of you who cut your own trying to get the back of  your head, you know what I&#x27;m talking about!  </li>
            <li>The only thing so far I don&#x27;t like is the plastic attachments (they seem flimsy how they clip onto the blade with a little locking tab instead of sliding on solidly), but I have yet to break one off, and I&#x27;m generally good at breaking things quickly.  </li>
            <li>But these would have been mere irritants if I was getting a great haircut.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal or not</li>
            <li>I have been cutting my own hair most of my adult life.</li>
            <li>First, the clippers often pulled my hair--and I have very \\&quot;fine,\\&quot; very short hair.  </li>
            <li>and it was worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>If you are willing to buy this product, go for the real one and pay the extra money.</li>
            <li>the ceramic blade stays cool through a long cut.</li>
            <li>Many people say they break down before the first month, but its possibly becasue</li>
            <li>No tugging or snagging in the cut, no hard vibrating in my hand and not to the touch.</li>
            <li>They do OK, but don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>but not as much as steel is the only positive thing i can find with these.</li>
            <li>The plastic pieces that clip on the end are rather cheap made and sharp as heck.</li>
            <li>Once they were gone, I set out to research a new set of clippers.</li>
            <li>Returned these, bought new clippers from Wahl and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>(I live in Australia).</li>
            <li>, so I purchased the new one instead of trying to replace blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered a new set of blades.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone that&#x27;s looking for a new clipper.</li>
            <li>I had been procrastinating for quite a while, I only cut my hair every month of two, so replacing the old and bringing in the new really wasn&#x27;t a real high priority.</li>
            <li>The ceramic edge does an excellent job of cutting hair and it is very quiet.  </li>
            <li>The rubber patch is a crucial piece: It gives greater control and has prevented the clipper from slipping from my hand and breaking the combs on impact.</li>
            <li>The ceramic blade is new to me, but seems to do the job just fine without pulling or bogging down at all.  </li>
            <li>More expensive isn&#x27;t always better and these definitely prove that.</li>
            <li>The Negatives:  These clippers do get hot in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I have needed replacements were because I am pretty reckless and dropped them, breaking the ceramic blade or the adjustable guard.</li>
            <li>At the last minute (December 22nd to be exact) I made the decision to purchase this product and it arrived on Friday December 23rd.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers that we received back had the same performance issues as the original clippers.  </li>
            <li>I bought the new clipper based on my experience with the old one.  </li>
            <li>Seem a lot nicer than previous cheap models bought at wal-mart, go figure</li>
            <li>Obviously if the blade is yanking at the hair it&#x27;s not cutting fast enough, or the blade isn&#x27;t shark enough, so it was very time consuming to finish the hair cut.  </li>
            <li>The ceramic blade does generate a considerable amount of heat, but has never gotten hot enough to burn the skin.  </li>
            <li>It has worked well and does not get as hot as my several old trimmers.</li>
            <li>not a bad tool, cuts quiet...pretty effective at even cutting.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I decided to get these clippers, mainly because I have owned a set of the Andis t-liners for about (6) years and never had any major problems.</li>
            <li>The speedmasters, however, leave my hair feeling a bit different, where as I don&#x27;t feel that it shreads my hair to pieces, it more or less slices (in an analogy comparison) as it cuts smoother.     </li>
            <li>black plastic coating didnt last more than a week, started peeling</li>
            <li>I keep my hair short with a #2 on the sides and slightly longer on the top.</li>
            <li>Heads fit tightly to the shears.  </li>
            <li>The guards fit tight and they are well made.</li>
            <li>I had gone through countless sets of throw-away department store junk clippers before deciding to spend a little bit more.  </li>
            <li>This particular unit has never pulled or bogged down in any way on any kind of hair.  </li>
            <li>I chose these over the Oster Fast Feeds due to all the positive reviews on Amazon...and they were cheaper.  </li>
            <li>As a busy hairstylist I thought this would do the trick for close fades.  </li>
            <li>it yourselfer&#x27;s or the professional barber.</li>
            <li>I emphasize specifically the value for the price &amp; professional result(s),there</li>
            <li>I just used the 5/8\\&quot;, which I used with the old set.</li>
            <li>the Amazon one was about a third of the power of the real one.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re like a Cadillac compared to my old model(T).&lt;br</li>
            <li>No big deal really except I don&#x27;t always want a buzz cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has all the guards you need to create a professional looking haircut.</li>
            <li>Especially the fast feeds...</li>
            <li>I cannot give a complete answer to that.  </li>
            <li>and I do not have any complaints so far.</li>
            <li>And by the way, of course clippers are hot after long use, that&#x27;s why you buy a separate trimmer for your lineup/beard/sideburns, may I suggest the t- outliners?&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I even got the Andis T-trimmers for him, and now he has the complete set.</li>
            <li>I researched the Andis masters and decided to go with these after a review by a well known professional barber.</li>
            <li>This pair of clippers was bought to replace an old Conair pair I had bought from Costco, which I dropped at some point causing them to be extremely loud.  </li>
            <li>I did find that for some reason the #3 attachment seemed shorter on these clippers than on my old Conair, so I went up to a #4 to get the length I was used to.  </li>
            <li>AN PROFESSIONAL</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my hubby after his old one died.</li>
            <li>Two years old now.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what my old 8 year old clippers had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>2 months have been gone so far, and I continue to use the clipper on myself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a barber and have never had much success cutting my own hair because it would never look even, the clippers would \\&quot;pull\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Well, the cord is a full 8 feet long so I can step to the edge of the grass just outside of the landscaping.  </li>
            <li>My wife did her best to do the rest with scissors, but I looked like an idiot.</li>
            <li>I sent them back and ordered new blades for my very old and reliable Wahl clippers!</li>
            <li>I used it to trim down my beard when I don&#x27;t have time for a full shave.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey compare to others, but it is well worth it!</li>
            <li>ok, I mean, cuts hair.</li>
            <li>Although I still had to make several runs over the same area to catch the stray hair strands, it still cuts more evenly than the other Andis models that I owned.  </li>
            <li>After buying cheap Remington and various other brands over the years i thought i would buy a quality clipper for once.</li>
            <li>A good, steady hair cutting tool that feels like quality, sounds like quality and cuts like quality...</li>
            <li>It is hard to remember the first months using the previous clippers, but these seem to cut through the hair better than the others ever did, even when they were new.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these weekly for about 7 months now, enough time to give them a decent review for anyone considering this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could tell right away when I opened the package that the blade halves were not lined up flush with each other with the lever all the way up.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many clippers since cutting my own hair for 16 years,so i know a little bit about what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>I really like this set of clippers, there&#x27;re not loud without a lot of vibration either!</li>
            <li>After my last cut with the old clippers I decided that the only way to force me to buy a new set was to donate the old ones to a thrift store.  </li>
            <li>Overall great set for at-home hair cutting.</li>
            <li>an have never at a clipper so smooth cutting for so cheap</li>
            <li>I was not really sure at first if they really came in this condition</li>
            <li>I have used the cheaper sets from box stores for years and had to replace them after a few months since I cut my own hair every few weeks.</li>
            <li>These clippers buzz cut easily through my thick hair.</li>
            <li>While this clipper works pretty well for overall use, it isn&#x27;t as good as my older (and much less expensive) clipper of the same brand.  </li>
            <li>But other than that they do pretty well for what I need.</li>
            <li>I purchased these new, apparently Someone sent these back in or something...</li>
            <li>Delivered right on time, actually earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Andis are accurate in their claim of the clippers staying cooler than all-metal blades, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li>It does not feel like other cheap ones that you can find in walmart or other pharmacy store.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t expect a quality pair of clippers to struggle, but these clippers barely cut.</li>
            <li>I had an old Wahl clipping set that came with scissors, oil, comb, length attachments etc that finally died a couple months ago.</li>
            <li>I finally got out my old clippers and finished the job.  </li>
            <li>Only used it a couple times so far</li>
            <li>I finally had to breakout my old Remington clippers to finish the job.</li>
            <li>It is not cutting hair short enough like I expected.</li>
            <li>Considering that I cut my hair approximately every two weeks or so, this unit has paid for itself many times over.</li>
            <li>Good product  for cutting hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First and foremost, after going to barbers for the past 34 years, I&#x27;m used to clippers coming near my head and being so loud that I would not be able to hear a tornado touch down in the chair next to me.  </li>
            <li>Small and well built, combs are a little low end for a nice heavy clipper, not a bad deal, should last</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get half as hot</li>
            <li>It comes with a pack of 9 comb attachments (which fits most other Andis models) and a small bottle of oil.</li>
            <li>So, if you are purchasing these for line ups and all-around detail work for African American hair, you might want to consider a different set or buy different blades.  </li>
            <li>The blades are really sharp and they cut fast so they don&#x27;t pull the hair.  </li>
            <li>What is strange is that even though the faster motors, such as Andis or Wahl Senior, are fast and you can feel their power buzzing, the bladse are slightly different.</li>
            <li>They do get a little hot</li>
            <li>Gets a little hot after 3-4 mins of use.</li>
            <li>and i must say this is one of my best clippers it works quicker on wet, dry or thick hair no job too tough for this baby.</li>
            <li>that was noticibly hot by the time I was done with only one half of my head.</li>
            <li>But these clippers are a great buy, not just for the money, but Andis is a proven winner in the clipper line and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li>As far as the actual CUTTING goes, they do a nice job.  </li>
            <li>However, I can say without a doubt, the speedmasters due better on my semi kinky thick hair.</li>
            <li>As you know each set of clippers cuts a little differently and with the guard adjustment it also takes some getting used to how they perform so the first cut takes a bit longer than the norm.</li>
            <li>I was highly upset due to the fact that I just recived them.</li>
            <li>The noise level is comparable to other high end clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-They&#x27;re much quieter than my previous model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>do not fault andis, exactly what I expected minus the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it takes the same amount of time to cut the hair on the head which is full and thick as it does to shave my face with a disposable razor.(big</li>
            <li>It does not cut as short as the previous units I have used, but it does the job, and does it fast.  </li>
            <li>The product is very high quality chrome finish and the ceramic blades make them last longer, it even has a little weight to them.</li>
            <li>Works really well, feels hefty, requires little upkeep.</li>
            <li>Much like using cheap sheers, this machine will sometimes push hair forward instead of cutting it when doing clipper-over-comb.</li>

            <li> They work great for those things.</li>
            <li> It is a great clipper for beard trim, or neck trim.</li>
            <li> this is a cut about the rest, great product.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;these are great units.  </li>
            <li> Great set of clippers.</li>
            <li> This product has worked great and without issue.</li>
            <li> This clipper is really great.  </li>
            <li> GREAT AS A GIFT</li>
            <li> BUT SHOWS HIS GREAT BODY ....</li>

            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> great buy works great</li>
            <li> These are even better and mine were $40.50 Delivered!!  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> and they fade very nicely</li>
            <li> These clippers are amazing!  </li>
            <li> Also, the Andis T-Outliner is amazing too!</li>
            <li> Works great, a good cut with no pulling</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and used the trimmers to bald fade it which was even more impressive.  </li>
            <li> trim properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not the best, but my 3yo Panasonic ER221 is much better</li>
            <li> Great and good looking clippers.</li>
            <li> very good clipper easy to use  and great for fading</li>
            <li> Like it works good for me</li>
            <li> I did an exhaustive survey and found this to be a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate it a good C+ on vibrationlessness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good variety of attachments, but doesn&#x27;t come with comb or scissors.</li>
            <li> and it just dont look good</li>
            <li> All in all a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Good grip and feel.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t give these a good rating.  </li>
            <li> anyone could use them, and good with any styled hair cut.</li>
            <li> this is a excellent product ,would recommend it to all persons looking for a smooth cut.</li>
            <li> but if it continues to be this good</li>
            <li> To anyone thinking about making this purchse, it will be wise to invest.  </li>
            <li> My andis clippers Cut really smooth and fades Hair excellent</li>
            <li> They appeared to be a good compromise between price and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It appears that Andis does make good quality clippers.  </li>
            <li> Fair price.</li>
            <li> SO if your are looking for a good set of clippers look elsewhere</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great price for a good deal.</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> The ceramic blade is great, it doesn&#x27;t get as warm as steel on steel blades.  </li>
            <li> Super Great Seller!</li>
            <li> Its powerful, quite, excellent quality build.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and has a good feel to it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> First off, allow me to preface that I take excellent care of all my tools.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these, and after reading the reviews I was sure I had made an excellent choice.  </li>
            <li> I really love the rubber/steel combo as well !</li>
            <li> Just make sure you oil it after every use!</li>
            <li> but all I can say is that this one is pretty great!</li>
            <li> Still running strong and gives a great haircut.</li>
            <li> It is very good at not cutting your skin.</li>
            <li> I am not a barber by any means but these are AMAZING.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s absolutely amazing in my book.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait, just get it, its amazing.</li>
            <li> I got these clippers for my boyfriend who cuts his own hair at home.  </li>
            <li> I decided why not cut my own hair???</li>
            <li> This clippers are perfect, cut fast and efficiently, i use them for my head and face.</li>
            <li> They get warm after 20 mins but don&#x27;t burn you.</li>
            <li> After using a sideburns trimmer, and then a Remington Short-cut clipper (the one with the beveled edge) and then moving on to this, I can honestly say there is no comparison to using not-so-great clippers to using these.  </li>
            <li> I ordered my own.</li>
            <li> ceramic blades cut as good or better than steel blades but the don&#x27;t&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and I cut my own hair about once every three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and sometimes it was hit or miss with the clippers I used.</li>
            <li> Have been using this two cut my own hair for over two years.</li>
            <li> After a friend told me he does his own hair cuts</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> They make my sons hair look so nice.</li>
            <li> i honestly can&#x27;t find a Con   well maybe just one</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
            <li> Use between haircuts- does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> Andis has an impressive level of pro level hair clipper tools,price is not a question for the quality,price,longevity in long term great results.</li>
            <li> Excellent, high quality tool for the price.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, SUPER USSEFULL AND SILENCE....</li>
            <li> the ceramic blades cut very easily.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to operate and maintain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping wise I received them in a timely matter ordered them on the 14th got them on the 16th for free.</li>
            <li> ok the fact&#x27;s is these Clippers are Amazing</li>
            <li> These are by far the best I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> They were light weight and fit my hand beautifully.  </li>
            <li> is the brand most professional barbers use, and this model is the best I found in this price range( I paid $45).</li>
            <li> Upon finishing my haircut, trimming my goatee and moustache, the clippers were barely warm at the most, which is better than I can say on some of the others I had to return</li>
            <li> The clippers first of all they look great , not that that has anything to do with they way the cut hair.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first about getting these clippers, even after reading the great reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> This product is lightweight, easy to clean, many combs to choose from, and a great value.</li>
            <li> Very smooth with no tugging or pulling.</li>
            <li> onces i got the hang of it, it cut super good and it works awsome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertised to not get hot, but does however get very warm.</li>
            <li> Very good clipping and keeps pretty cool with the ceramic (also bought the Andis spray to keep in good condition and blades cool).  </li>
            <li> Value for money would be appropriate to say.</li>
            <li> But if you are mostly using the combs, that will not be an issue.</li>
            <li> Anyway, i returned them and will seek out a better set of clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, in this price range, there are much better clipper out there.  </li>
            <li> are some better alternatives that I suggest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wahl 5-Star Magic Clip $40</li>
            <li> Does everything you need and more with the guards.</li>
            <li> overall is still a great set!</li>
            <li> I cannot really say if it was actually a great product</li>
            <li> but I know there is better around this price.  </li>
            <li> They look better than all of my barbers clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I love these babies</li>
            <li> These clippers are simply outstanding.  </li>
            <li> They cut perfectly and feel like they are built to last forever.  </li>
            <li> imagine how the Osters could be any better.    </li>
            <li> The item that was sent to me had the voltage labels scratched off, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could use this</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this unit.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with the quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> I just love to use this piece.</li>
            <li> They also vibrate a bit more noticeable than your 40-50 dollar pair purchased at Wal-mart.</li>
            <li> I was able to do the job and got the look I wanted without yet another buzz cut.</li>
            <li> These could be more versitile for the price.</li>
            <li> I still tried to tell myself it was ok.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Many size attachments.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.</li>
            <li> I use it for beard trimming and it does not take me more than 3-4 minutes</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.</li>
            <li> AS OUTSTANDING</li>
            <li> Just as described, Andis has in my opinion better guards the transition from a 1 guard to a 2 gaurd on whals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I am going to love these, can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li> The Andis clippers are for sure a step up and seem to do a better job in every respect.  </li>
            <li> The budget set performed \\&quot;fine\\&quot; for many years, doing 2-4 clippings per month.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with these clippers.  </li>
            <li> I want to make the best decision since I expect to be using it for several years.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this clipper.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I cut my  hair once a week and do not do anything too sophisticated at all.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair clipper&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight</li>
            <li> This was purchased more than 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> I love Andis brand for my dog grooming clippers, so i bought these for my peoples&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> : I still love this clipper.  </li>
            <li> MY BROTHER PRACTICALLY LOVE HIS CLIPPER</li>
            <li> Nice and light as well.  </li>
            <li> Seem to cut a lot more even than the wahl.</li>
            <li> works great on straight hair and curly hair.</li>
            <li> i cut my friends hair with these clippers and my friends love the cuts i give them.</li>
            <li> looks great also and definitely backed by a good quality brand name.</li>
            <li> Product works perfectly comes with many different guards.</li>
            <li> he said they were better than the ones he wanted.</li>
            <li> Top quality clippers are sold in barber shops, online beauty shops, and you can basically buy anything on amazon.  </li>
            <li> One very good thing that I will say about these is that they do not get hot quickly.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice clean cut.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I gave myself a haircut that I thought was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Every part of the Andis package is better; the attachments fit better, the scissors are sharper, and the oil smells better.</li>
            <li> vibrate pretty dern good.</li>
            <li> It gets pretty good close for a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> the replacement is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> At first I loved this buzzer compared to my wahl.  </li>
            <li> But at around $42, this is a very good buy for those who want to upgrade to better quality clippers without spending the big bucks on the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; models.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that its quite and easily glide through the hair.</li>
            <li> It did eventually get warm to touch, so not a noticable difference for me there, but overall it is a great clipper for home use.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> (direct from Amazon via free super saver shipping)is totally  awesome.  </li>
            <li> After using it several times, I can say its a very good product.</li>
            <li> They run very cool.  </li>
            <li> Best $40 I have spent.</li>
            <li> Most of all cuts the hair with ease and the clip on blade covers actually fit..</li>
            <li> Make sure you oil it before and after each use.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic clips may pop off during use so check the fit each time.</li>
            <li> Great clipper so far.</li>
            <li> Great clippers for professional</li>
            <li> -attachments are very sturdy  -comes in good packaging  </li>
            <li> It is still working perfectly with minimal attention - much better than the cheap kits tried before ever worked.</li>
            <li> To begin with i really wanted these clippers to be good.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into fades then these clippers are right for you!!</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers, keeps me looking clean cut everyday, thank you kindly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this through Amazon with quality research prior to engaging in this excellent choice,and saved even more with Super Saver free shipping to Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> not a bad choice!</li>
            <li> I think it is the best vale for the money, and not very many clippers  are better for the paper.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power to run easily.</li>
            <li> The instructional videos for the care and use of the clippers is easy to find on youtube.</li>
            <li> So one can easily infer that the product is not designed to cut any closer than that 1/16\\&quot; gap between the blade components.  </li>
            <li> easy to use</li>
            <li> Still going strong</li>
            <li> I purchased it 5-6 years ago for about $35, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> This hair clipper is an awesome smart purchase and light years from most any general retailer - home owner level product.</li>
            <li> The Andis 24145 Speed Master 2 Clipper, Chrome; it is exactly what I was looking for, because I can cut my own hair once a month without the help of another if need be.</li>
            <li> i get a nice consistent fade everytime they cut well.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that I keep at a #2 length</li>
            <li> However, even at that this is a fine clipper and</li>
            <li> i could rate it any less than 1 star i certainly would!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> it otherwise the review would&#x27;ve been fine.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get lucky and able to use em pain-free but 90% of the time</li>
            <li> : durable and doesn&#x27;t bog down, looks good, plastic end pieces make good zombie spears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Its quiet gives a really great haircut easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight and powerful.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was going to write this review after the first time that I used it, but I waited to see if I was being too excited about its performance.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they fall off and buzz, you have to give yourself yet another buzz cut because of a huge spot of closely shaven hair.</li>
            <li> honestly i think it looks more professional with out it      </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and oil.</li>
            <li> I now own the Wahl 5-Star Senior, and I must say that they are top of the line and only $15 more than the Speed Master 2.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve cut my hair for over 15 years, primarily because it&#x27;s hassle-free.  </li>
            <li> Another cheaply made in china piece of junk.</li>
            <li> LOL, just found out that this review was mixed with a necklace I bougth.</li>
            <li> Works smooth, no pull.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t mind patting myself on the back, I did a great job with these clippers.</li>
            <li> I have the Andies Master as well, but they are too heavy for me to give a marvelous fade...</li>
            <li> Not an expert, only telling what I have experienced.  </li>
            <li> Best hair clipper and heavy duty.</li>
            <li> i would recomend them ,great buy for the low price</li>
            <li> The plastic cutter seems cheap and would not cut hair</li>
            <li> Use a couple times a week for a few months now, and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not a barber but my barber uses his set on kids who don&#x27;t like the sound of clippers).</li>
            <li> I thought that&#x27;s what all clippers sound like.  </li>
            <li> They are smaller than many clippers, but have a good heft to them.  </li>
            <li> And this may be a great product; obviously, many other reviewers thought so.  </li>
            <li> Low maintenance makes it very handy</li>
            <li> Super fast, cuts nice and close.  </li>
            <li> I purchased them and confirmed this to be true.</li>
            <li> These clippers in particular happened to have pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to give my first haircut with them.  </li>
            <li> the ceramic blade is new to me, and it glides so nicely and stays cooler.</li>
            <li> After using them a few times, I can safely say that I made a great choice.   </li>
            <li> I had to swipe 2 and 3 times to get a clean cut.  </li>
            <li> it clean it between the blades, spray coolant on it, even try to get the clogged hair out of the buzzer itself.  </li>
            <li> So much better than the noisy old trimmer that I bought many years ago.</li>
            <li> I relied on the positive reviews here and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Zero-gap the blades, and this machine will give you some of the best skin-fades ever, as well as knock out hard lines.</li>
            <li> very cool, not gotten hot</li>
            <li> Makes me look like I am a professional barber as long as you know what your doing and best brand as well.</li>
            <li> machine overall looks beautiful and feels really rugged    </li>
            <li> He raves how this one is much better &amp; more powerful than his old one.  </li>
            <li> Now she insists on doing the back, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Good product overall.</li>
            <li> $49 (Not as good as the above 2, but still an overall good clipper.  </li>
            <li> Mostly made of metal, it is a bit heavier in the hand but also doesn&#x27;t vibrate quite as much.</li>
            <li> Mind you, if you want a buzz cut, these will surely do the job and fast.</li>
            <li> But now that i have these i am extra good on my fades..</li>
            <li> Quiet, well built and has a good assortment of trimmer combs.</li>
            <li> Oh and the Fact that these Run Cool</li>
            <li> that are designed to cool the blades off?  </li>
            <li> set overall, good price-</li>
            <li> The cermaic blades do stay cool though.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a beginner.</li>
            <li> I expected much more from these as I&#x27;ve easily gotten three or more years of use out of cheap store bought Wahl clippers.  </li>
            <li> Being that he loves to cut hair and is great at doing it, I decided to get him a new set of professional clippers.  </li>
            <li> Attachments fit pretty well, adjustment lever holds in place nice and firm, and motor sounds good and feels powerful.</li>
            <li> but it will not be as sharp or look as good or be as easy as it is with the Andis Outliner II ether way you have to buy a Outliner and this to have that barber experience     </li>
            <li> Wahl Super Taper II</li>
            <li> Pruduct arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> They do an excellent job of actually cutting hair, which is the most important bit,</li>
            <li> I have used other cordless trimmers and this one is the best by far</li>
            <li> They barely get warm.  </li>
            <li> Well...I was very surprised at how well this clipper performed, they&#x27;re very sharpe and cut very smoothly, I dont see how a higher priced clipper could do any better.</li>
            <li> The unit feels like it is high quality, it feels solid in the hand, and after over a year of use it is still holding up great.</li>
            <li> Since the unit plugs in it has much more power than the rechargeable clippers and they didn&#x27;t get that hot and were much more quiet to boot.</li>
            <li> There may be even better high end clippers on the market, but for the price these seem to be well built and can cut a nice precise short fade very well.  </li>
            <li> (You really won&#x27;t find many fading clippers that are better, outside of Andis Masters; has \\&quot;fade blade\\&quot; and cool running</li>
            <li> It gives a crisp clean cut.  </li>
            <li> Finally replaced it and this is just an amazing product.</li>
            <li> It did ok with #2 guard on the sides but when i got to the top is where i started having trouble with free handing it.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> He started to laugh when I said I got it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Nice and quiet...</li>
            <li> Might be worth checking into.    </li>
            <li> old one did the job &amp; lasted many years without doing any maintenance&lt;br /&gt;or oiling the blades.  </li>
            <li> These are a nice and quiet set.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It was pulling and not cutting evenly.  </li>
            <li> but it was quiet and did a nice job.  </li>
            <li> i purchased this andis because i thought it would be as powerful as the masters....</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> He tested them out right away.  </li>
            <li> So far new one workiing great just like old one.  </li>
            <li> The new clipper cuts hair MUCH slower than the old clipper, and not as good.  </li>
            <li> They cut fast and clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to blend cuts and cleans the back hairline close and neatly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any barber who enjoys giving their customers that nice, clean, sharp cut.</li>
            <li> These clippers are quiet, stay much cooler than the one&#x27;s my barber was using, they cut a better fade, they are professional class clippers,and the price is nice.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are easy to use, lightweight, quiet, and  provides smooth finish.</li>
            <li> , motor doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;whine\\&quot; under pressure thus ripping out your hair and follicles, and this shaver really is tried and true.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional barber; I cut my own hair . . .</li>
            <li> I live in an apartment and sound consideration is always a factor.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, it&#x27;s the only thing that can really wear.</li>
            <li> Hair cuts take less time and have a good FEEL afterwards.  </li>
            <li> They cut fast and the blade stays pretty cool.</li>
            <li> The clippers are very light and very quiet.  </li>
            <li> It moves very fast and doesn&#x27;t miss any of the hair.  </li>
            <li> very very well&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The only downside is that this kit doesn&#x27;t include tapered attachments, but the Wahl branded attachments fit great with just a little force needed to seat them.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these to any guy who uses them very often like I do!</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful and the noise and shake is reasonable.    </li>
            <li> The result in the first use having just received this today ...</li>
            <li> I still consider these a mid-level clipper, and top of the line clippers can be had for around the same price.  </li>
            <li> The construction on these is much higher than the Wahls.</li>
            <li> &gt; get hot at all.&lt;br /&gt;-They</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> than they did the first time i used them.</li>
            <li> : It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as steel-bladed clippers.  </li>
            <li> First set of Andis clippers I have ever bought and they won&#x27;t be the last.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I considered the higher priced Andis clippers, but opted to try this one thinking it might be sufficient since its just for me.</li>
            <li> I received this clipper in the mail yesterday the exact time i had a haircut.</li>
            <li> I am a professional Lady barberstylist and i have to say these are the most light weight, quiet sounding clippers i have owned besides the Andis Speed Master 1.</li>
            <li> It took more trips over the same area to get a uniform cut.  </li>
            <li> The first problem was they kept tripping my GFCI switch.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a fluke, but it happened repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> I made my first swipe and noticed I needed to go over it again.  </li>
            <li> My first ceramic blade trimmer.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> and they started to get pretty noisy in the 12-18 month timeframe.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had them get overly hot, even in the summertime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One reason we chose the Speed Master 2 over the higher priced Andis was based on reviews that said the others were HOT, and the ceramic blade of this model would keep them running cooler.  </li>
            <li> BUT ... the others were significantly higher priced, without the ceramic blade.  </li>
            <li> The ceramic blades keeps the blade temperature low and it cuts better.</li>
            <li> First I will say I turned the clippers on, found hair on it and grime on the the powerswitch.</li>
            <li> The unit can get pretty hot in the hand though after a while.</li>
            <li> It also gets hot even porcelain addition to prevent that.</li>
            <li> These clippers are better than what my barber was using, not just because they are Andis but because of proper cleaning, sanitation, and oiling.  </li>
            <li> I did my first cut</li>
            <li> hair and motor gets hot after a while</li>
            <li> /&gt;We got the first set and gave them a try.  </li>
            <li> I was able to send the clippers back for an exchange (on my dime).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them getting hot, as some reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the last clippers I had.  </li>
            <li> and I have had a consistent performance.</li>
            <li> Theses are the first pair of clippers I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> These dont get as hot as others and dont pull at all</li>
            <li> this is the first time I used the ceramic blades</li>
            <li> After the first one delivered was return because it was &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; (had hair under the blades)</li>
            <li> i was going to get those instead of these clippers at first</li>
            <li> I did some extensive research and found Andis to be top of the line clippers.</li>
            <li> The blades haven&#x27;t dulled at all and it performs better than several cheaper clippers I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
            <li> The heavy duty cord sort of got in the way, but considering what a good, rapid and even job the clippers did</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste you money on this inferior product in spite of good reviews (which i relied on)</li>
            <li> Near the end of its life, it would get loose very quickly and I would tap it against my stone counter top and it would stop making noise for a minute; this process was repeated over and over.</li>
            <li> The Speed Master 2 clippers work very well and so far, seem like a fine product.  </li>
            <li> Certain ones work better for different hair type and thickness.</li>
            <li> I used them for about 45 minutes and they get warm but not hot</li>
            <li> I have seen some other clippers get hotter, but these are REALLY warm.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the other nice features</li>
            <li> Is this due to a superior clipper, or just a new blade?  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this machine the ceramic blades are awsome very smooth wile cutting and does not get warm and very quiet motor</li>
            <li> This is the best and ultimately the least costly of all of them.</li>
            <li> Works a ton better than the cheap Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve had for few years from Wallmart.</li>
            <li> and certainly they were not uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice haircut and with a guide on, it misses less hair on the first pass.</li>
            <li> I do not feel that they overheat any more or less than other clippers I have purchased, but they do give a superior cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that the attachments from my old one fit this newer one, and also that my old plastic case that came with the old one fits this new one, but it really doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the older one did.  </li>
            <li> I buzz my own hair every few weeks and have been using an old cheap Wahl clipper for years.</li>
            <li> As others have stated these clippers get hot fast.</li>
            <li> after 4 haircuts these are my favorite clippers yet, should have got these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> but this may be normal/expected for higher end, fast running clippers.  </li>
            <li> It becomes too hot really fast</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned them long at all, but I have the impression that I will be owning them for many years to come.  </li>
            <li> I also use this to trim my beard when I have one, and pretty much any hair on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The SpeedMaster 2 actually had a tougher time with my hair than its cheaper, older (and duller, I&#x27;m sure)</li>
            <li> I always order good professional clippers and I thought that this would be another good buy, WRONG!</li>
            <li> I had been using the Andis &#x27;Easy Cut&#x27; model ($19.95) at the local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Cuts so easily and is very quiet compared to any clipper I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how easy it is to use, and left my self wondering why I&#x27;ve paid for barber-shop cuts all these years.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use with adjustable tops for different functions.</li>
            <li> The body of the clipper is not so large that I cannot hold them like a lot of others...</li>
            <li> As for the refurb clippers, they run strong, cut Precisely, and have a cool white ceramic blade that is sharp and doesn&#x27;t snag.</li>
            <li> nice, smooth, quite, easy cutting.</li>
            <li> very high qulity</li>
            <li> Strong and quiet with several attachments that will come in handy with the different seasons.</li>
            <li> They do get a little warm after a while, but I can tolerate that.</li>
            <li> Now it is still super sharp and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Clippers do not get hot for normal use.  </li>
            <li> believe The Andis 24145 Speed Master 2 Clipper, Chrome is very well made and will last me many many years without any trouble</li>
            <li> runs wonderfully, much cheaper than the andis master.</li>
            <li> It is much sharper, has the adjustable blade, and is quieter than the Wahl I needed to replace.  </li>
            <li> I can tell it was really used because the steel cover looks washed and fingerprint marks were all over it.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I expected more from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But opening the package to see someone else&#x27;s hair in the teeth changed the whole</li>
            <li> These clippers cut very well with one pass and don&#x27;t snag your hair even with the guard on.</li>
            <li> for the heat issue, none really to speak of.</li>
            <li> The 24145 cuts hair fast without pulling.</li>
            <li> This happened for the whole haircut.  </li>
            <li> This clipper works really well.  </li>
            <li> they cut really well .  </li>
            <li> You can definitely tell the difference between cheap clippers and these.</li>
            <li> i really think that this is a Steal i got these clippers cause</li>
            <li> but, they came rather fast.</li>
            <li> hahaha.</li>
            <li> Theyare STILL very \\&quot;W-A-R-M\\&quot; ....</li>
            <li> These cannot be repaired if they tear up, the American made clippers have replacement parts available.  </li>
            <li> These clippers cut very well.  </li>
            <li> Seems really smooth and fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> button and the lever feel really sturdy  -the</li>
            <li> I found that it is important to regularly lubricate the blades so they stay cooler during use.</li>
            <li> After breaking the Wahls, I figured I would upgrade since I&#x27;m saving so much on bi-weekly haircuts.  </li>
            <li> I said in the title, I really wanted to like these clippers.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and quiet operation.</li>
            <li> I have had it for 18 months now and it still works very well, stable and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I liked that the teeth on the guards were sturdy and close together, but the motor on this thing is not strong enough to get through one pass on my 4 yr olds fine hair.</li>
            <li> but i went with the speedmasters because they are known to be very versatile</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet compared to the wahl types that I have been using for the last 15 yrs.  </li>
            <li> It is cool, less noisy and cut through your hair smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it gets hot fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I finally settled on the Andis because of the good Amazon reviews, they plugged in, and the fact that they had ceramic teeth which I assume will stay sharp longer that just steel clipping against steel.</li>
            <li> I was put off by the idea of having to oil blades on the high end clippers because I thought it would be a lot more trouble than it was worth.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that I understand some other clippers may cut better depending on the texture of the hair.</li>
            <li> So it only made sense that I try to the Andis clippers as well and again I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> they are like a Sports car   compare to most other clippers in there price range</li>
            <li> Honestly, you can get other clippers that work fine for less money...  </li>
            <li> I gave away the complete old set, which means I had to buy another set of barber scissors, but the one with the first set weren&#x27;t that good anyway, about $6 with tax at Wally World, and a small mirror and a plastic box to hold everything, both from the dollar store.   </li>
            <li> I ended up buying and keeping the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade, which is also light weight and quiet.</li>
            <li> You get some REAL Clippers and the guards (and a real &#x27;professional&#x27; power cord)</li>
            <li> They are quiet and run cool.  </li>
            <li> The unit comes with a full set of combs for different hair lengths.</li>
            <li> these clippers have a robust motor and dont get nearly as hot as our old pair...</li>
            <li> This is significantly better than the more common commercial brands.</li>
            <li> After dealing with a barber that cut my hair for 24 years, putting up with poor treatment as a client,I decided to cut my own hair and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  </li>
            <li> the mean time, we found a Wahl clipper with a lithium battery that is much lighter and much more powerful</li>
            <li> After almost two years, it still runs like new!  </li>
            <li> I love them the power they light weight an can cut wet hair due to the ceramic blade.</li>
            <li> : none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent $30 on my first set of clippers, so the extra $10 is well worth it for better blades that will last much longer and a much quieter set of clippers.</li>
            <li> used to have a oster clippers than lasted 10 years and cost half, still liking em more...</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers a year and a half ago after I dropped my Wahl clippers (with the color coded guards) and it cracked, being mostly plastic.</li>
            <li> I called the Andis problem number and learned that I would need to send the clippers back to Andis in Wisconsin; the Andis person was only able to give information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only issue is being able to brush away all the hair from the teeth, especially when lubricating it, just seems as if it just sticks between</li>
            <li> but I am particular</li>
            <li> After going multiple times over the same areas, I was able to pinch and pull hairs between my fingernail and thumb.  </li>
            <li> But my most recent one only lasted two years,</li>
            <li> I have found that I tend to use the #1, #3, and #5 and the result is a decent looking hair cut.  </li>
            <li> A heavy-duty trimmer for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I was using an older model for years.  </li>
            <li> Initially I was happy with them, but lately, as others have mentioned, they pull your hair rather than cut it.  </li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for years and have tried many store brand clippers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for the do it yourself type.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can tell this thing is well constructed and high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Overall great set of clippers, they dont get stuck on hair wet or dry.</li>
            <li> They are also very balanced in weight so less stress on your wrist and fingers for those of you who cut your own trying to get the back of  your head, you know what I&#x27;m talking about!  </li>
            <li> The only thing so far I don&#x27;t like is the plastic attachments (they seem flimsy how they clip onto the blade with a little locking tab instead of sliding on solidly), but I have yet to break one off, and I&#x27;m generally good at breaking things quickly.  </li>
            <li> But these would have been mere irritants if I was getting a great haircut.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal or not</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair most of my adult life.</li>
            <li> First, the clippers often pulled my hair--and I have very \\&quot;fine,\\&quot; very short hair.  </li>
            <li> and it was worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> If you are willing to buy this product, go for the real one and pay the extra money.</li>
            <li> the ceramic blade stays cool through a long cut.</li>
            <li> Many people say they break down before the first month, but its possibly becasue</li>
            <li> No tugging or snagging in the cut, no hard vibrating in my hand and not to the touch.</li>
            <li> They do OK, but don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> but not as much as steel is the only positive thing i can find with these.</li>
            <li> The plastic pieces that clip on the end are rather cheap made and sharp as heck.</li>
            <li> Once they were gone, I set out to research a new set of clippers.</li>
            <li> Returned these, bought new clippers from Wahl and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> (I live in Australia).</li>
            <li> , so I purchased the new one instead of trying to replace blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered a new set of blades.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone that&#x27;s looking for a new clipper.</li>
            <li> I had been procrastinating for quite a while, I only cut my hair every month of two, so replacing the old and bringing in the new really wasn&#x27;t a real high priority.</li>
            <li> The ceramic edge does an excellent job of cutting hair and it is very quiet.  </li>
            <li> The rubber patch is a crucial piece: It gives greater control and has prevented the clipper from slipping from my hand and breaking the combs on impact.</li>
            <li> The ceramic blade is new to me, but seems to do the job just fine without pulling or bogging down at all.  </li>
            <li> More expensive isn&#x27;t always better and these definitely prove that.</li>
            <li> The Negatives:  These clippers do get hot in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I have needed replacements were because I am pretty reckless and dropped them, breaking the ceramic blade or the adjustable guard.</li>
            <li> At the last minute (December 22nd to be exact) I made the decision to purchase this product and it arrived on Friday December 23rd.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers that we received back had the same performance issues as the original clippers.  </li>
            <li> I bought the new clipper based on my experience with the old one.  </li>
            <li> Seem a lot nicer than previous cheap models bought at wal-mart, go figure</li>
            <li> Obviously if the blade is yanking at the hair it&#x27;s not cutting fast enough, or the blade isn&#x27;t shark enough, so it was very time consuming to finish the hair cut.  </li>
            <li> The ceramic blade does generate a considerable amount of heat, but has never gotten hot enough to burn the skin.  </li>
            <li> It has worked well and does not get as hot as my several old trimmers.</li>
            <li> not a bad tool, cuts quiet...pretty effective at even cutting.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to get these clippers, mainly because I have owned a set of the Andis t-liners for about (6) years and never had any major problems.</li>
            <li> The speedmasters, however, leave my hair feeling a bit different, where as I don&#x27;t feel that it shreads my hair to pieces, it more or less slices (in an analogy comparison) as it cuts smoother.     </li>
            <li> black plastic coating didnt last more than a week, started peeling</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short with a #2 on the sides and slightly longer on the top.</li>
            <li> Heads fit tightly to the shears.  </li>
            <li> The guards fit tight and they are well made.</li>
            <li> I had gone through countless sets of throw-away department store junk clippers before deciding to spend a little bit more.  </li>
            <li> This particular unit has never pulled or bogged down in any way on any kind of hair.  </li>
            <li> I chose these over the Oster Fast Feeds due to all the positive reviews on Amazon...and they were cheaper.  </li>
            <li> As a busy hairstylist I thought this would do the trick for close fades.  </li>
            <li> it yourselfer&#x27;s or the professional barber.</li>
            <li> I emphasize specifically the value for the price &amp; professional result(s),there</li>
            <li> I just used the 5/8\\&quot;, which I used with the old set.</li>
            <li> the Amazon one was about a third of the power of the real one.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re like a Cadillac compared to my old model(T).&lt;br</li>
            <li> No big deal really except I don&#x27;t always want a buzz cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has all the guards you need to create a professional looking haircut.</li>
            <li> Especially the fast feeds...</li>
            <li> I cannot give a complete answer to that.  </li>
            <li> and I do not have any complaints so far.</li>
            <li> And by the way, of course clippers are hot after long use, that&#x27;s why you buy a separate trimmer for your lineup/beard/sideburns, may I suggest the t- outliners?&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I even got the Andis T-trimmers for him, and now he has the complete set.</li>
            <li> I researched the Andis masters and decided to go with these after a review by a well known professional barber.</li>
            <li> This pair of clippers was bought to replace an old Conair pair I had bought from Costco, which I dropped at some point causing them to be extremely loud.  </li>
            <li> I did find that for some reason the #3 attachment seemed shorter on these clippers than on my old Conair, so I went up to a #4 to get the length I was used to.  </li>
            <li> AN PROFESSIONAL</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my hubby after his old one died.</li>
            <li> Two years old now.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what my old 8 year old clippers had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2 months have been gone so far, and I continue to use the clipper on myself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a barber and have never had much success cutting my own hair because it would never look even, the clippers would \\&quot;pull\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Well, the cord is a full 8 feet long so I can step to the edge of the grass just outside of the landscaping.  </li>
            <li> My wife did her best to do the rest with scissors, but I looked like an idiot.</li>
            <li> I sent them back and ordered new blades for my very old and reliable Wahl clippers!</li>
            <li> I used it to trim down my beard when I don&#x27;t have time for a full shave.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey compare to others, but it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> ok, I mean, cuts hair.</li>
            <li> Although I still had to make several runs over the same area to catch the stray hair strands, it still cuts more evenly than the other Andis models that I owned.  </li>
            <li> After buying cheap Remington and various other brands over the years i thought i would buy a quality clipper for once.</li>
            <li> A good, steady hair cutting tool that feels like quality, sounds like quality and cuts like quality...</li>
            <li> It is hard to remember the first months using the previous clippers, but these seem to cut through the hair better than the others ever did, even when they were new.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these weekly for about 7 months now, enough time to give them a decent review for anyone considering this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could tell right away when I opened the package that the blade halves were not lined up flush with each other with the lever all the way up.  </li>
            <li> I have bought many clippers since cutting my own hair for 16 years,so i know a little bit about what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> I really like this set of clippers, there&#x27;re not loud without a lot of vibration either!</li>
            <li> After my last cut with the old clippers I decided that the only way to force me to buy a new set was to donate the old ones to a thrift store.  </li>
            <li> Overall great set for at-home hair cutting.</li>
            <li> an have never at a clipper so smooth cutting for so cheap</li>
            <li> I was not really sure at first if they really came in this condition</li>
            <li> I have used the cheaper sets from box stores for years and had to replace them after a few months since I cut my own hair every few weeks.</li>
            <li> These clippers buzz cut easily through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> While this clipper works pretty well for overall use, it isn&#x27;t as good as my older (and much less expensive) clipper of the same brand.  </li>
            <li> But other than that they do pretty well for what I need.</li>
            <li> I purchased these new, apparently Someone sent these back in or something...</li>
            <li> Delivered right on time, actually earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that Andis are accurate in their claim of the clippers staying cooler than all-metal blades, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li> It does not feel like other cheap ones that you can find in walmart or other pharmacy store.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t expect a quality pair of clippers to struggle, but these clippers barely cut.</li>
            <li> I had an old Wahl clipping set that came with scissors, oil, comb, length attachments etc that finally died a couple months ago.</li>
            <li> I finally got out my old clippers and finished the job.  </li>
            <li> Only used it a couple times so far</li>
            <li> I finally had to breakout my old Remington clippers to finish the job.</li>
            <li> It is not cutting hair short enough like I expected.</li>
            <li> Considering that I cut my hair approximately every two weeks or so, this unit has paid for itself many times over.</li>
            <li> Good product  for cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First and foremost, after going to barbers for the past 34 years, I&#x27;m used to clippers coming near my head and being so loud that I would not be able to hear a tornado touch down in the chair next to me.  </li>
            <li> Small and well built, combs are a little low end for a nice heavy clipper, not a bad deal, should last</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get half as hot</li>
            <li> It comes with a pack of 9 comb attachments (which fits most other Andis models) and a small bottle of oil.</li>
            <li> So, if you are purchasing these for line ups and all-around detail work for African American hair, you might want to consider a different set or buy different blades.  </li>
            <li> The blades are really sharp and they cut fast so they don&#x27;t pull the hair.  </li>
            <li> What is strange is that even though the faster motors, such as Andis or Wahl Senior, are fast and you can feel their power buzzing, the bladse are slightly different.</li>
            <li> They do get a little hot</li>
            <li> Gets a little hot after 3-4 mins of use.</li>
            <li> and i must say this is one of my best clippers it works quicker on wet, dry or thick hair no job too tough for this baby.</li>
            <li> that was noticibly hot by the time I was done with only one half of my head.</li>
            <li> But these clippers are a great buy, not just for the money, but Andis is a proven winner in the clipper line and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> As far as the actual CUTTING goes, they do a nice job.  </li>
            <li> However, I can say without a doubt, the speedmasters due better on my semi kinky thick hair.</li>
            <li> As you know each set of clippers cuts a little differently and with the guard adjustment it also takes some getting used to how they perform so the first cut takes a bit longer than the norm.</li>
            <li> I was highly upset due to the fact that I just recived them.</li>
            <li> The noise level is comparable to other high end clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-They&#x27;re much quieter than my previous model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> do not fault andis, exactly what I expected minus the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it takes the same amount of time to cut the hair on the head which is full and thick as it does to shave my face with a disposable razor.(big</li>
            <li> It does not cut as short as the previous units I have used, but it does the job, and does it fast.  </li>
            <li> The product is very high quality chrome finish and the ceramic blades make them last longer, it even has a little weight to them.</li>
            <li> Works really well, feels hefty, requires little upkeep.</li>
            <li> Much like using cheap sheers, this machine will sometimes push hair forward instead of cutting it when doing clipper-over-comb.</li>
            <li> It cuts right through his thick hair with no problems.  </li>
            <li> In fact i&#x27;ve never cut hair before so using this razor was a little confusing for me at first, with the whole oil thing, but</li>
            <li> I purchased another Andis as the old one outlasted the other 2.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair (what&#x27;s left) using no guard for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I had was the first pair had hair on them, so</li>
            <li> The motor is so slow that it misses a lot of hair on the first cut found myself going over and over the same spot to get it to cut the ones sticking up.</li>
            <li> believe, also because of the ceramic blade, they run much quieter than other clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past, which is always a plus - who likes loud clippers...?</li>
            <li> Its hard to describe what they had that is different, but the cut is smoother and better on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair fairly short (bit less than a 1/4 of an inch) and finally buckled down and got one that absolutely rocks.  </li>
            <li> Andis cuts much faster, does not need time for recharging stupid batteries, and looks/feels more solid.</li>
            <li> , the cord was only a minor hassle.</li>
            <li> I plan on using these for as long as they will last.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair in various styles for 50 years and tried several other trimmers.</li>
            <li> With the \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; Andis clippers it took twice as long to get an even buzz-cut and left me with the equivalent of 5 days of growth.  </li>
            <li> they last a long time.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t vibrate as much which makes it less noisy than other Andis models.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair for over a decade and have gone through many different shavers over the years.</li>
            <li> This item performs well and has many options for different needs in cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> This product is not good for using more than five times, very high noise and disturbing, I recommend to not buy it.</li>
            <li> After the last inexpensive Wahl clippers became dull, we decided to finally upgrade to a professional quality clipper.  </li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long?</li>
            <li> Researched this buy for a long time.</li>
            <li> My son likes his hair cut military style...very short.  </li>
            <li> While they are NOT professional grade Masters, they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I cannot give it a 5* rating only because they seem to be running hotter than I expected and are not servicable.  </li>
            <li> They also come with a set of guide/guard combs in a wide range of lengths from short to long.</li>
            <li> After poking around with several cheaper models that kept just getting dull or tired, I can&#x27;t be happier with my new powerful clipper.</li>
            <li> They are very powerful and unless you are professionally cutting 20 people a day you do not need to purchase the more expensive versions.</li>
            <li> By the time you are finished with the main cutting and are ready to trim, you have to be careful around bare skin, when trimming the neckline for example, or around the ears.  </li>
            <li> the clipper cuts well, smoothly, silently, but the guards are too sharp, they tend to pull the hair.</li>
            <li> These clippers are a definite step up from the 20dollar wahls and other ones from wally world etc.</li>
            <li> The cord is fairly long, its addicting to use!</li>
            <li> Our family has only owned one other set of clippers, the $25 budget model purchased in a department store.  </li>
            <li> I researched Amazon and several other sites and found these Andis Speed Master 2 clippers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also considerably quieter and generates much less vibration than other units.  </li>
            <li> The cord is also very long (about 4.5 feet).  </li>
            <li> I still had multiple longer hairs that were missed, whereas I&#x27;ve never had more than one or two a cutting with my previous clippers.  </li>
            <li> But it was time for a change as they were starting to get a little dull and hair cuts were taking much longer.  </li>
            <li> is no need to consider average hair clippers from various surface retailers.</li>
            <li> When my wife saw the result all hell broke loose.</li>
            <li> Only thing is it does heat up a little bit if you use it for a long period of time</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t suddenly die, it was making increasing amounts of noise due to a bad design where the screws holding the top blade would get oiled up and become loose from the vibration.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d used a short guard on my head hair previously) and have not once nicked myself in</li>
            <li> While this was gratifying in the moment, I was left in a lurch with half a haircut.</li>
            <li> black rubber grip is a plus &amp; should be a standard on all clippers</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it ends up lasting longer than any of the Norelcos I&#x27;ve thrown away in the past, but I&#x27;ve come to the realization that saying Andis and Norelco in the same sentence doesn&#x27;t do Andis any justice.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a Wahl brand clipper set that wore out after about 5 years of occasional use.  </li>
            <li> The total time I spent shaving my beard was about eight and a half seconds.  </li>
            <li> As expected, having owned a similar Andis product previously..</li>
            <li> His hair is a little longer, but still short.  </li>
            <li> the     Con is that the lil lever on the side does not have the little indents to see how open or how close the blade is</li>
            <li> I have taken a little extra time with this review because I appreciate knowing everything I can when purchasing a product like this.  </li>
            <li> Even though I received a fake, the real one is still not sufficient enough.  </li>
            <li> The guy behind the counter just concluded that he just went straight to the Andis Masters</li>
            <li> A few pieces flew off, and they certainly won&#x27;t go back together.  </li>
            <li> Got one for my bf a few years back, and he couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Not very good..doesn&#x27;t do an even cut it you cut with the grain.    </li>
            <li> I can hold a conversation with my dog as he stares at me curiously while I&#x27;m trimming around me</li>
            <li> Too slow for a professional.</li>
            <li> As long as it doesn&#x27;t break down anytime soon&lt;</li>
            <li> If my previous experience is any indication, other parts of the clippers will likely fail before they need to be sharpened, in which case I will likely just buy a new set.</li>
            <li> Being more than a little disappointed in the last pair of Wahls I owned, I decided to try Andis.  </li>
            <li> A few things about the clippers is you have to be very careful and fragile with the cermaic blades.  </li>
            <li> These clippers not only were the smoothest cutting and quietest set, but they also do not get hot with the ceramic blade.</li>
            <li> The clipper works flawlessly, no pulling hair, not too hot or noisey.</li>
            <li> I use it on myself and other family members.</li>
            <li> also had two other problems.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several Wahl clippers over the past 15 years to cut hair for the family.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t \\&quot;Pull\\&quot; due to the 4X power.</li>
            <li> The old clippers that we had were rechargeable, and I cut my hair very short, so I was used to walking into the middle of the yard and cutting away.  </li>
            <li> The other day I was using it to shave my head, as I always do, and the front of it (the razor part) just fell apart in my hands.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t blame it on a small company or private seller.  </li>
            <li> Ceramic blades stay sharp.  </li>
            <li> But the thing that sets this apart from any other trimmer I have ever used is that it did the job in one pass.  </li>
            <li> Would other clippers in this class run cooler?</li>
            <li> Blades are still sharp -</li>
            <li> Seems sharp and also has plenty of attachments.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong, at least I don&#x27;t expect to be adding them to the cheap clipper graveyard under the sink anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp and it doesn&#x27;t bog down.</li>
            <li> Cost, they were a step down from the better/best Andis model, but based on other reviews seem to work well.  </li>
            <li> Dont like the fact that the reduction on the blades is not stepped, its continuos, which makes it hard to use the same lenght</li>
            <li> This product had a hard time actually doing what it was suposed to do, cut hair.  </li>
            <li> If they ever broke (which they haven&#x27;t after at least two years of regular use) I would buy another pair immediately.  </li>
            <li> This thing is of average noise level, that is to say at barber shops I have heard louder, and quieter clippers.  </li>
            <li> As I hate the hustle of shopping in stores during the busiest season of the year, I decided to go online to puchase most gifts this year.  </li>
            <li> I may be forced to purchase a second trimmer, which I hadn&#x27;t  planned on.</li>
            <li> The hair pulling is what I hate most</li>
            <li> I have to admit I have since started shaving my chest as well and have used it all the way down to no guard for this</li>
            <li> The ceramic blade does keep the temp on the clippers down.</li>
            <li> When trying to cut close and the blade all the way down with no guard, you almost don&#x27;t need the trimmers to fade it</li>
            <li> These clippers are advertised to adjust down to 0.0.  </li>
            <li> My previous clippers were a rechargeable unit with all the added stuff that I purchased at Costco.</li>
            <li> They leave a typical machine buzz cut.</li>
            <li> I bought this less than 90 days ago.</li>
            <li> I would have sent them back, however as they are for my customers I merely sterilized them as they will be used on multiple heads.  </li>
            <li> I previously bought the Andis 20140 Hair Clipper/Trimmer Combo Pack to replace another Andis clipper that broke.</li>
            <li> I have owned about a half dozen beard trimmers in my life.  </li>
            <li> Since this unit was less than the cost of 2 barber shop cuts, I figured i wasn&#x27;t out a lot of money if it didn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> There is less hair that is MISSED as you pass through (using the guards/guides).  </li>
            <li> One could even make the argument that ALL of the SpeedMaster 2 units manufactured are defective, as it&#x27;s likely that, due to the design, not one of them is capable of cutting to the specifications advertised!  </li>
            <li> Having high expectations for this clipper, and ill also be ordering the andis sonic plus.</li>
            <li> Although quiet and light weight, the ceramic teeth felt a bit sticky, flimsy clip ons also made even cutting difficult.</li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting my hair since we were married 31 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Maybe be a little cautious letting the husband cut your hair.</li>
            <li> Mine got a little carried away.</li>
            <li> I thought they were gonna cut a little closer</li>
            <li> A little adjustment to the blades</li>
            <li> so I decided I was going to spend a little bit of money this time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned these guys for a little over two years</li>
            <li> I decided to keep, but I feel a little cheated...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a $20 or $30 model when you can get this for a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say it takes even 2 hours of cutting for these to get really hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve endured two years of painful haircuts just to get my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Kinda noisy after a few cuts.</li>
            <li> I tried to a use a set of $9 clippers for a few months.</li>
            <li> Have had zero problems with it and paid for itself in just a few months.  </li>
            <li> I am probably not the type to go get these sharpened in a few years, so the ceramic makes sense to me.</li>
            <li> Even the guy behind the counter turned it on and for a split second</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on those $40 &#x27;</li>
            <li> Cuts unevenly and drops dead mid-use.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years for myself and my son and it has given me no problems.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, these clippers are heavy and well-built.  </li>
            <li> : pulls and won&#x27;t cut thick hair, cheap and SHARP plastic length pieces, annoying cord that tangles up</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half the price!</li>
            <li> Eventually, however, the noise got so bad and came back so quickly that I got frustrated and smashed the clippers into several pieces.</li>
            <li> It is too stiff and inflexable.</li>
            <li> My main problem was always keeping the comb attachments on the clipper when cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bad pair in the past that would pretty much just comb through the hair without really cutting it.</li>
            <li> In the past 57 years I have worn out 3 clippers.</li>
            <li> Takes no more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Ordered this thinking it would be a step up from the Wahl clippers that I&#x27;ve used for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this purchase was a big hassle; I won&#x27;t buy Andis</li>
            <li> Second, it was often difficult to attach the combs.  </li>
            <li> he concluded that it was used, at least a few years.  </li>
            <li> I got used to it fairly easily, as it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The hybrid ceramic blade actually reached an uncomfortable temperature about 3-5 minutes before the Wahl all-steel blade would.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to be one of the only nay-sayers here,</li>
            <li> We usually use the #3 to #5 attachments.  </li>
            <li> no more trips to the barber shop.</li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed  with the cut the first time i used them.</li>
            <li> If something goes wrong, I&#x27;ll come back and update my review.</li>
            <li> Seriously felt like it have been used for at least a few years.  </li>
            <li> The Conair clippers worked well, but they got dull about 6 months ago, which is why I bought</li>
            <li> wahl sucks.</li>
            <li> Not liked</li>
            <li> Use it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I have used a $20 Wahl setup for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> A brief explanation of my cutting routine: I have thick head hair</li>
            <li> I believe it has something to do with the teflon/plastic upper cutting piece.</li>
            <li> He has semi thick hair but straighter than mine.</li>
            <li> The motor ran so slowly that the hair was being chewed, rather than cut.  </li>
            <li> these are too slow</li>
            <li> being said, my hair is thick and these cutters do not do well.</li>
            <li> you got thick hair or lots of moles, avoid these clippers.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t order personal products from Amazon again, the bad thing is it said it was sold and fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> This bad boy comes with a bunch of different trimmer attachments, so I can even use it to cut my hair in the summer if I want.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used Andis after all the bad, noisy, headache of experiences I&#x27;ve had trying to operate a pair of Wahls.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the machine lacks power.</li>
            <li> which was a bit weak.</li>
            <li> It just glides through my hair whenever I am using it, so it makes my cutting time much less than I am use to.</li>
            <li> The previous units I have tried (Conair and Wahl) both caught and pulled the hair rather then cutting it, and when &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; my head they would scrape and gouge my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and this thing powers through it with no problem.</li>
            <li> They tend to get a little on the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; side when cutting hair.</li>
            <li> but thats such a stupid Con</li>
            <li> The plastic covering the blades was broken and was not even attached to it.  </li>
            <li> After an exhausting search, I decided on the Speedmaster II.</li>
            <li> It was one of the worse clippers I owned.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> I shave my head approximately every three weeks.</li>
            <li> so im in the game.</li>
            <li> It brought my cutting time down from about 20 minutes (told you they were bad) to about 5-7 minutes.  </li>
            <li> sorry happened here too).  </li>
            <li> Lo and behold, the SpeedMaster 2 failed all three of my requirements:  </li>
            <li> Ill try all that zero gapping stuff and let all you fellow barbers how they come out to be.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace a battery-driven unit, which failed after just 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I thought I was upgrading, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was beyond 30 days, so I had to deal with the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t turn out that way for me.</li>
            <li> You can see why these are used by professionals and for 45 dollars or so, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> wrong wahl is garbage too.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are terrible after falling apart in less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for about a year now.  </li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t tried to adjust the ceramic cutting blade on these, they just do not cut as well as my Wahl Seniors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> The one thing it could improve on is cutting the hair closer to the skin.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with that.  </li>
            <li> The blade NEVER snags, even when cutting against the grain.  </li>
            <li> The speed of the motor, or cutting speed does seem faster.  </li>
            <li> We DO use oil - oil at start up, and oil during the cutting.  </li>
            <li> been cutting for 25 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad.</li>
            <li> This was not the point that made me mad.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this!</li>
            <li> not at all the blade is a plus but the machine it self was a cheesy product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that bad at all.  </li>
            <li> They do heat up after a while, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product and the delivery time wasn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> my hair and everyone would ask me if I cut my hair this time. :(</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But what a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> GREATLY disappointed in the 24145 performance.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> but its   so stupid to let it bother you</li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>
            <li> (god i hate that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And worst of all, the advertised \\&quot;1/100 inch\\&quot; closeness touted in the specs is not even close!  </li>
            <li> VERY annoying.  </li>
            <li> Unless u have a nasty Forrest of har, these clippers do the job.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They blew up and smoked during the second use. Says I can&#x27;t return after 30 days. Yup because people shave their head that often. I&#x27;m so mad.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Kinda noisy after a few cuts. Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal or not</li>
            <li> In the past 57 years I have worn out 3 clippers. I purchased another Andis as the old one outlasted the other 2. It gives a nice haircut and with a guide on, it misses less hair on the first pass. Very easy to blend cuts and cleans the back hairline close and neatly. Easy to clean and oil.</li>
            <li> As a busy hairstylist I thought this would do the trick for close fades.  Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Like it works good for me</li>
            <li> I got these clippers for my boyfriend who cuts his own hair at home.  He is very happy with them!  The blades are really sharp and they cut fast so they don&#x27;t pull the hair.  Clippers do not get hot for normal use.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> The Andis 24145 Speed Master 2 Clipper, Chrome; it is exactly what I was looking for, because I can cut my own hair once a month without the help of another if need be. (I keep it short, but not to short)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Andis it takes the same amount of time to cut the hair on the head which is full and thick as it does to shave my face with a disposable razor.(big plus)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe The Andis 24145 Speed Master 2 Clipper, Chrome is very well made and will last me many many years without any trouble what so ever.</li>
            <li> I tried to a use a set of $9 clippers for a few months. Had to scrub them back and forth across my head till they gradually wore the hair off. These you run them through once, and the hair is gone. Takes no more than 10 minutes. Worth it.</li>
            <li> It works great.  Still going strong and we have been using it for awhile</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for over a month and have cut my hair and my son&#x27;s hair a couple of times and the results have been great.  The clippers are very light and very quiet.  They do get a little hot but thats after about 40 minutes.  Cuts evenly.</li>
            <li> Too slow for a professional. Not bad for a beginner.</li>
            <li> I was spending close to $30 a hair cut. I decided why not cut my own hair??? I get it cut one length anyway. This clippers are perfect, cut fast and efficiently, i use them for my head and face. They get warm after 20 mins but don&#x27;t burn you. Just noticeable. Best $40 I have spent. Highly recommend for the do it yourself type. I am not a barber by any means but these are AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Works great, a good cut with no pulling</li>
            <li> i am a barber for 12 ytears and i must say this is one of my best clippers it works quicker on wet, dry or thick hair no job too tough for this baby.</li>
            <li> very high qulity, I doubt I&#x27;ll need to ever buy another clipper.</li>
            <li> I have used the cheaper sets from box stores for years and had to replace them after a few months since I cut my own hair every few weeks. These clippers not only were the smoothest cutting and quietest set, but they also do not get hot with the ceramic blade. I would recommend these to any guy who uses them very often like I do!</li>
            <li> After using a sideburns trimmer, and then a Remington Short-cut clipper (the one with the beveled edge) and then moving on to this, I can honestly say there is no comparison to using not-so-great clippers to using these.  I cut my hair fairly short (bit less than a 1/4 of an inch) and finally buckled down and got one that absolutely rocks.  The ceramic edge does an excellent job of cutting hair and it is very quiet.  I live in an apartment and sound consideration is always a factor.  It brought my cutting time down from about 20 minutes (told you they were bad) to about 5-7 minutes.  It moves very fast and doesn&#x27;t miss any of the hair.  The guides it comes with won&#x27;t see use for me, but the lever on the left side adjusts the steel guide from skin to about 3/8\\&quot;.  The cord is also very long (about 4.5 feet).  I have no complaints.  Buy this product.</li>
            <li> After getting a haircut from my daughter with this clipper I was so impressed I ordered my own. When it arrived I gave myself a haircut that I thought was pretty good. When my wife saw the result all hell broke loose. She was very critical of the back of my head. Now she insists on doing the back, which is a good thing. The clipper works flawlessly, no pulling hair, not too hot or noisey.</li>
            <li> I never had any trimmer before, so did not know which one to buy. I did an exhaustive survey and found this to be a good product. After using it several times, I can say its a very good product. Value for money would be appropriate to say. But remember it is only a trimmer, do not expect a close shave with this. For shaver get some panasonic ES381K etc.</li>
            <li> This is a solidly built clipper. The 9 (included) combs makes it a sweeter deal. The motor is powerful and the noise and shake is reasonable.    The only downside is that it gets hot fairly quickly. But if you are mostly using the combs, that will not be an issue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the clipper I got was faulty, or if they are all like that...but these clippers would yank at my hair while trying to cut.  Obviously if the blade is yanking at the hair it&#x27;s not cutting fast enough, or the blade isn&#x27;t shark enough, so it was very time consuming to finish the hair cut.  Anyway, i returned them and will seek out a better set of clippers.</li>
            <li> Although quiet and light weight, the ceramic teeth felt a bit sticky, flimsy clip ons also made even cutting difficult. I ended up buying and keeping the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade, which is also light weight and quiet.</li>
            <li> dont buy anything else but andis.  the best clippers i&#x27;ve ever used. fricken awesome.  the ceramic blades cut very easily.  wahl sucks.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of these already, but I didn&#x27;t ship them to Afghanistan with me.  Of course, I needed them after two months, so I ordered another pair instead.  They are quiet and run cool.  Good product overall.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper for any hair texture. I use it on myself and other family members. This is a great buy for the do it yourselfer&#x27;s or the professional barber.</li>
            <li> runs wonderfully, much cheaper than the andis master. i didn&#x27;t know it had a plastic blade, but when i tested the clipper out, it works perfectly. the clipper cuts well, smoothly, silently, but the guards are too sharp, they tend to pull the hair. great clipper tho</li>
            <li> Use this about every 3 weeks or so for the last 3 years.  Very good clipping and keeps pretty cool with the ceramic (also bought the Andis spray to keep in good condition and blades cool).  Have had zero problems with it and paid for itself in just a few months.  Side note:  I have to admit I have since started shaving my chest as well and have used it all the way down to no guard for this (I&#x27;d used a short guard on my head hair previously) and have not once nicked myself in probably about 15 shaves now.  Not liked I&#x27;d -try- to hurt myself with it, but I no longer fear it without a guard whatsoever for anyone concerned.</li>
            <li> This Andis Speed Master 2 Clipper is bar none a pro- quality tool.The best value/price is these Andis Pro Clippers.No Questions.This hair clipper is an awesome smart purchase and light years from most any general retailer - home owner level product.I ordered this through Amazon with quality research prior to engaging in this excellent choice,and saved even more with Super Saver free shipping to Hawaii.  The result in the first use having just received this today ...(direct from Amazon via free super saver shipping)is totally  awesome.  I emphasize specifically the value for the price &amp; professional result(s),there is no need to consider average hair clippers from various surface retailers.Andis has an impressive level of pro level hair clipper tools,price is not a question for the quality,price,longevity in long term great results.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair most of my adult life. My previous clippers were a rechargeable unit with all the added stuff that I purchased at Costco. I had been procrastinating for quite a while, I only cut my hair every month of two, so replacing the old and bringing in the new really wasn&#x27;t a real high priority. After my last cut with the old clippers I decided that the only way to force me to buy a new set was to donate the old ones to a thrift store.  Once they were gone, I set out to research a new set of clippers. I finally settled on the Andis because of the good Amazon reviews, they plugged in, and the fact that they had ceramic teeth which I assume will stay sharp longer that just steel clipping against steel. I gave away the complete old set, which means I had to buy another set of barber scissors, but the one with the first set weren&#x27;t that good anyway, about $6 with tax at Wally World, and a small mirror and a plastic box to hold everything, both from the dollar store.   The unit comes with a full set of combs for different hair lengths. I just used the 5/8\\&quot;, which I used with the old set. Why did I wait so long? Since the unit plugs in it has much more power than the rechargeable clippers and they didn&#x27;t get that hot and were much more quiet to boot. The heavy duty cord sort of got in the way, but considering what a good, rapid and even job the clippers did, the cord was only a minor hassle.</li>
            <li> Ordered this thinking it would be a step up from the Wahl clippers that I&#x27;ve used for the past 5 years. I have fine hair that I keep at a #2 length so I wouldn&#x27;t expect a quality pair of clippers to struggle, but these clippers barely cut. I had to go at a snails pace, over the same area repeatedly and every pass was ripping hairs out of my head.  After finishing up and washing my hair I still had multiple longer hairs that were missed, whereas I&#x27;ve never had more than one or two a cutting with my previous clippers.  Returned these, bought new clippers from Wahl and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  More expensive isn&#x27;t always better and these definitely prove that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for about a year now.  These were my start-up clippers, and they served me well.  One very good thing that I will say about these is that they do not get hot quickly.  I would say it takes even 2 hours of cutting for these to get really hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in this price range, there are much better clipper out there.  I now own the Wahl 5-Star Senior, and I must say that they are top of the line and only $15 more than the Speed Master 2.  If you&#x27;re looking to cut the nicest, crispest fades, then the Speed Master 2 is not the way to go.  I still consider these a mid-level clipper, and top of the line clippers can be had for around the same price.  Although I haven&#x27;t tried to adjust the ceramic cutting blade on these, they just do not cut as well as my Wahl Seniors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some better alternatives that I suggest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wahl 5-Star Senior $58 (You really won&#x27;t find many fading clippers that are better, outside of Andis Masters; has \\&quot;fade blade\\&quot; and cool running V9000 motor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Wahl 5-Star Magic Clip $40 (Has the same fade blade and newer models have V9000 motor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Wahl Super Taper II $49 (Not as good as the above 2, but still an overall good clipper.  Uses regular Wahl blade and V5000 motor)</li>
            <li> Great clippers for using at home for yourself or kids.  These clippers are easy to use, lightweight, quiet, and  provides smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I had an old Wahl clipping set that came with scissors, oil, comb, length attachments etc that finally died a couple months ago. It didn&#x27;t suddenly die, it was making increasing amounts of noise due to a bad design where the screws holding the top blade would get oiled up and become loose from the vibration. Near the end of its life, it would get loose very quickly and I would tap it against my stone counter top and it would stop making noise for a minute; this process was repeated over and over. Eventually, however, the noise got so bad and came back so quickly that I got frustrated and smashed the clippers into several pieces. While this was gratifying in the moment, I was left in a lurch with half a haircut. My wife did her best to do the rest with scissors, but I looked like an idiot. Anyway, I researched a bit and came across several models by Andis, which were lauded for their high-quality construction. The recency of my debacle with the Wahl clippers made me steer away from them and I ended up buying this kit. After using them a few times, I can safely say that I made a great choice.   The construction on these is much higher than the Wahls. Mostly made of metal, it is a bit heavier in the hand but also doesn&#x27;t vibrate quite as much. Every part of the Andis package is better; the attachments fit better, the scissors are sharper, and the oil smells better. The lower part of the blade is ceramic, which is meant to stay sharper longer. I find that it gets a bit warmer than steel on steel clippers. I am probably not the type to go get these sharpened in a few years, so the ceramic makes sense to me. I don&#x27;t even know where I would go to get the blades sharpened. If my previous experience is any indication, other parts of the clippers will likely fail before they need to be sharpened, in which case I will likely just buy a new set. Overall great set for at-home hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the Andis Speedmaster II based on the reviews and its excellent price.  And this may be a great product; obviously, many other reviewers thought so.  But my Andis Speedmaster II broke during my third haircut:  the white lower blade (is this the ceramic one?) flew apart.  I called the Andis problem number and learned that I would need to send the clippers back to Andis in Wisconsin; the Andis person was only able to give information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve cut my hair for over 15 years, primarily because it&#x27;s hassle-free.  Unfortunately, this purchase was a big hassle; I won&#x27;t buy Andis again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had two other problems.  First, the clippers often pulled my hair--and I have very \\&quot;fine,\\&quot; very short hair.  Second, it was often difficult to attach the combs.  But these would have been mere irritants if I was getting a great haircut.</li>
            <li> So happy I brought this to go with my shape up clippers. Does everything you need and more with the guards. Use it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I really like this set of clippers, there&#x27;re not loud without a lot of vibration either! My only issue is being able to brush away all the hair from the teeth, especially when lubricating it, just seems as if it just sticks between and when you usr the brush included, it pulls strands of brush out...overall is still a great set!</li>
            <li> Clipper is great. My only criticism has to do with the cord. It is too stiff and inflexable. However, even at that this is a fine clipper and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have bought several Wahl clippers over the past 15 years to cut hair for the family.  They do OK, but don&#x27;t last very long.  I read the reviews for the Andis clipper and decided to give it a chance.  What a difference!  It is much sharper, has the adjustable blade, and is quieter than the Wahl I needed to replace.  It did eventually get warm to touch, so not a noticable difference for me there, but overall it is a great clipper for home use.</li>
            <li> Yes, I said it. however, it depends on texture. I have been cutting my hair for over a decade and have gone through many different shavers over the years. I&#x27;ve owned and used the Andis Master (improved), Oster 76, Wahl Senior (recently), the speedmasters (of course), phillips (cant remember the model), and some consumer cheapies from target/walmart, etc    From all the machines I have used and tested, I have found the best cut to be from the speedmasters. Its hard to describe what they had that is different, but the cut is smoother and better on my thick hair. Keep in mind that I understand some other clippers may cut better depending on the texture of the hair. However, I can say without a doubt, the speedmasters due better on my semi kinky thick hair. What is strange is that even though the faster motors, such as Andis or Wahl Senior, are fast and you can feel their power buzzing, the bladse are slightly different. I feel that both the Andis Master and Senior cut my hair the same. They leave a typical machine buzz cut. The speedmasters, however, leave my hair feeling a bit different, where as I don&#x27;t feel that it shreads my hair to pieces, it more or less slices (in an analogy comparison) as it cuts smoother.     With that said, the reason I purchased the Wahl Senior is that I noticed those work best on my son&#x27;s hair. When taking him to the barber, I noticed his cuts, his hair would simply come out different when the barber used the Seniors. I purchased them and confirmed this to be true. He has semi thick hair but straighter than mine. Now I can cut his hair and get the same results as the barber. But for me, I always end up reaching for those speedmasters.</li>
            <li> I know Andis has a great reputation and has great products.  Somehow Amazon ruined it.  I received my product used.  The plastic covering the blades was broken and was not even attached to it.  Also, there was hair on the blade.  I can tell it was really used because the steel cover looks washed and fingerprint marks were all over it.  This was not the point that made me mad.  As soon as I turned it on, the motor felt like it was dying.  Seriously felt like it have been used for at least a few years.  I was not really sure at first if they really came in this condition so I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  I compared the two and the Amazon one was about a third of the power of the real one.  Even the guy behind the counter turned it on and for a split second he concluded that it was used, at least a few years.  He started to laugh when I said I got it from Amazon.  Even though I received a fake, the real one is still not sufficient enough.  I cannot really say if it was actually a great product but I know there is better around this price.  The guy behind the counter just concluded that he just went straight to the Andis Masters and it was worth the extra money.  He also added that the Wahl Designer is a great clipper for home use.  If you are willing to buy this product, go for the real one and pay the extra money.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this machine the ceramic blades are awsome very smooth wile cutting and does not get warm and very quiet motor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a barber and have never had much success cutting my own hair because it would never look even, the clippers would \\&quot;pull\\&quot; my hair and everyone would ask me if I cut my hair this time. :( I had been using the Andis &#x27;Easy Cut&#x27; model ($19.95) at the local beauty supply store. I decided to upgrade and began studying every possible option on Amazon. After an exhausting search, I decided on the Speedmaster II. I&#x27;ve been using these weekly for about 7 months now, enough time to give them a decent review for anyone considering this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-They Cut Even! Even on a lopsided head. (not mine of course...)&lt;br /&gt;-They don&#x27;t \\&quot;Pull\\&quot; due to the 4X power. No mo snags on the tea bags!&lt;br /&gt;-The ceramic blades cut as good or better than steel blades but the don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt; get hot at all.&lt;br /&gt;-They come with 9 attachments to cut all lengths of hair from Kojak to Ronald&lt;br /&gt;  McDonald (whatever happened to him anyway?...)&lt;br /&gt;-They look Beautiful! They look better than all of my barbers clippers.&lt;br /&gt;-That black rubber grip is a plus &amp; should be a standard on all clippers&lt;br /&gt;-They&#x27;re much quieter than my previous model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Con:&lt;br /&gt;-They vibrate pretty dern good. I got used to it fairly easily, as it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I&#x27;d rate it a good C+ on vibrationlessness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;-I love these babies, I Even name them \\&quot;Harry\\&quot;. They&#x27;re like a Cadillac compared to my old model(T).&lt;br /&gt;This is the brand most professional barbers use, and this model is the best I found in this price range( I paid $45). Please note that these are not for lining/edging hair. For that try Andis T-Liners</li>
            <li> Small and well built, combs are a little low end for a nice heavy clipper, not a bad deal, should last</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a barber or hair dresser. In fact i&#x27;ve never cut hair before so using this razor was a little confusing for me at first, with the whole oil thing, but onces i got the hang of it, it cut super good and it works awsome. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This clipper has worker well for the 3 months I&#x27;ve had it. It is very good at not cutting your skin. The one thing it could improve on is cutting the hair closer to the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using some of the cheaper clippers that you would pick up at Target, WalMart, etc...  Ordered these on a Tuesday and had them by Friday afternoon.  The old clippers that we had were rechargeable, and I cut my hair very short, so I was used to walking into the middle of the yard and cutting away.  So, one concern I had with these was the use of the cord.  Well, the cord is a full 8 feet long so I can step to the edge of the grass just outside of the landscaping.  All good!!!  These clippers are simply outstanding.  They cut perfectly and feel like they are built to last forever.  I chose these over the Oster Fast Feeds due to all the positive reviews on Amazon...and they were cheaper.  I could not possible imagine how the Osters could be any better.    Bottom line, if you are thinking about buying these.  DO IT!!!  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I make no mistake when I say this is the best clipper I have bought. To be honest, I was going to write this review after the first time that I used it, but I waited to see if I was being too excited about its performance. It is very light weight and powerful. It just glides through my hair whenever I am using it, so it makes my cutting time much less than I am use to. It has been almost three months now since I have been using this speed master 2 clipper and my feelings about it has not change. It is a little pricey compare to others, but it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Avesome! Thanks a lot! Super Great Seller! Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I buzz my own hair every few weeks and have been using an old cheap Wahl clipper for years. Finally replaced it and this is just an amazing product. Cuts so easily and is very quiet compared to any clipper I have ever used. I relied on the positive reviews here and am glad I did. I could only be happier if this thing also vacuumed the hair off the floor for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this less than 90 days ago. The other day I was using it to shave my head, as I always do, and the front of it (the razor part) just fell apart in my hands. A few pieces flew off, and they certainly won&#x27;t go back together.  Another cheaply made in china piece of junk. Stay away.</li>
            <li> The item that was sent to me had the voltage labels scratched off, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could use this (I live in Australia).</li>
            <li> After poking around with several cheaper models that kept just getting dull or tired, I can&#x27;t be happier with my new powerful clipper. I have very thick hair, and this thing powers through it with no problem. You can tell it&#x27;s well made the moment you pick it up - solid, quality construction. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a $20 or $30 model when you can get this for a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 11/11/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still working as well as day 1. I&#x27;ve been oiling it regularly, which I believe helps. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if my review was helpful!</li>
            <li> Plenty of power to run easily. Blades are sharp and it doesn&#x27;t bog down. Good variety of attachments, but doesn&#x27;t come with comb or scissors. Maybe be a little cautious letting the husband cut your hair. Mine got a little carried away. Oh well, hair does grow back. ;-)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this unit.  Although I am balding, I have very coarse hair.  The previous units I have tried (Conair and Wahl) both caught and pulled the hair rather then cutting it, and when &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; my head they would scrape and gouge my scalp.  This particular unit has never pulled or bogged down in any way on any kind of hair.  It does not cut as short as the previous units I have used, but it does the job, and does it fast.  The ceramic blade does generate a considerable amount of heat, but has never gotten hot enough to burn the skin.  After over 100 cuts, the blade still functions as it did the day it came out of the box.  It&#x27;s also considerably quieter and generates much less vibration than other units.  The included attachments are great.  They are solidly made.  The only downside is that this kit doesn&#x27;t include tapered attachments, but the Wahl branded attachments fit great with just a little force needed to seat them.  Considering that I cut my hair approximately every two weeks or so, this unit has paid for itself many times over.</li>
            <li> The clippers first of all they look great , not that that has anything to do with they way the cut hair. I thought they were gonna cut a little closer than they did the first time i used them. A little adjustment to the blades and they cut to the desired length. The ceramic blade does keep the temp on the clippers down. Overall great set of clippers, they dont get stuck on hair wet or dry. Wish it would have come with a bag to put everything in.</li>
            <li> 20 years ago I had the former SpeedMasters (plastic at the time) and they were $80..  These are even better and mine were $40.50 Delivered!!  They are GREAT barber shop quality, period.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on those $40 &#x27;Home Cut&#x27; clipper sets.  You get some REAL Clippers and the guards (and a real &#x27;professional&#x27; power cord)</li>
            <li> Use these a lot, no problems yet.  Seem a lot nicer than previous cheap models bought at wal-mart, go figure lol</li>
            <li> LOL, just found out that this review was mixed with a necklace I bougth. About the clipper now..:&lt;br /&gt;works ok, I mean, cuts hair. Dont like the fact that the reduction on the blades is not stepped, its continuos, which makes it hard to use the same lenght one changed (if not impossible).&lt;br /&gt;The black plastic coating didnt last more than a week, started peeling and it just dont look good anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a oster clippers than lasted 10 years and cost half, still liking em more...</li>
            <li> Researched this buy for a long time. I don&#x27;t care that it shaves heads but I do care about my beard. Strong and quiet with several attachments that will come in handy with the different seasons. I wanted something that would last me the rest of my life and I believe I have it in this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, cuts well.  Heads fit tightly to the shears.  Pleased with the quality for the price.  Bought this one because we never used the battery powered one we had which was a bit weak.</li>
            <li> Pruduct arrived quickly. Works as described. It would be great if it was coordless. All in all a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper.  The adjustment toggle needs some preset notches to ensure the level of hair cut.  It gives a crisp clean cut.  I always remember to add two drops of oil before each use.  The instructional videos for the care and use of the clippers is easy to find on youtube.</li>
            <li> Best quality clipper out there. Good grip and feel. Works smooth, no pull. I just love to use this piece.</li>
            <li> I give the product 5 stars.  My problem is with Amazon.  I purchased these new, apparently Someone sent these back in or something... I received a pair which had hair in the blades and under the blades (I read a review that said the same thing,  sorry happened here too).  Had they been for personal use I would have sent them back, however as they are for my customers I merely sterilized them as they will be used on multiple heads.  I was unhappy with that.  I probably won&#x27;t order personal products from Amazon again, the bad thing is it said it was sold and fulfilled by Amazon. So I can&#x27;t blame it on a small company or private seller.  I expected more from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping wise I received them in a timely matter ordered them on the 14th got them on the 16th for free. But opening the package to see someone else&#x27;s hair in the teeth changed the whole expierence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not fault andis, exactly what I expected minus the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0029XVT2O Andis 24145 Speed Master 2 Clipper, Chrome]]</li>
            <li> As others have stated these clippers get hot fast. But they are excellent for fading and cut really good. They also vibrate a bit more noticeable than your 40-50 dollar pair purchased at Wal-mart.</li>
            <li> I use it to maintain my buzz cut and for that purpose it is perfect. Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> These clippers are amazing!  I purchased some Conair clippers in 2005 and I cut my own hair about once every three weeks.  That makes for about 110 haircuts before buying the SpeedMaster 2.  The Conair clippers worked well, but they got dull about 6 months ago, which is why I bought these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as steel-bladed clippers.  Ceramic blades stay sharp.  It is ultra quiet.  The blade NEVER snags, even when cutting against the grain.  The Andis name and reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent $30 on my first set of clippers, so the extra $10 is well worth it for better blades that will last much longer and a much quieter set of clippers.</li>
            <li> nice, smooth, quite, easy cutting. No tugging or snagging in the cut, no hard vibrating in my hand and not to the touch. Most of all cuts the hair with ease and the clip on blade covers actually fit..</li>
            <li> I have used Andis Trimliner series trimmers for years with great results to shave my face and hair.  It&#x27;s the only trimmer/shaver I could use to prevent my face from breaking out in razor bumps.  So it only made sense that I try to the Andis clippers as well and again I was not disappointed.  The best set of clipppers I&#x27;ve used, ever! As you know each set of clippers cuts a little differently and with the guard adjustment it also takes some getting used to how they perform so the first cut takes a bit longer than the norm. Upon finishing my haircut, trimming my goatee and moustache, the clippers were barely warm at the most, which is better than I can say on some of the others I had to return that was noticibly hot by the time I was done with only one half of my head. These clippers cut very well with one pass and don&#x27;t snag your hair even with the guard on. When trying to cut close and the blade all the way down with no guard, you almost don&#x27;t need the trimmers to fade it but I am particular so I went ahead and used the trimmers to bald fade it which was even more impressive.  But these clippers are a great buy, not just for the money, but Andis is a proven winner in the clipper line and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  They are also very balanced in weight so less stress on your wrist and fingers for those of you who cut your own trying to get the back of  your head, you know what I&#x27;m talking about!  Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t mind patting myself on the back, I did a great job with these clippers. I cut my own hair and sometimes it was hit or miss with the clippers I used. My main problem was always keeping the comb attachments on the clipper when cutting my hair. Sometimes they fall off and buzz, you have to give yourself yet another buzz cut because of a huge spot of closely shaven hair. No big deal really except I don&#x27;t always want a buzz cut.&lt;br /&gt;These clippers work well and perform flawlessly without any worries about the attachments coming off. I was able to do the job and got the look I wanted without yet another buzz cut. Mind you, if you want a buzz cut, these will surely do the job and fast. First set of Andis clippers I have ever bought and they won&#x27;t be the last.&lt;br /&gt;As for the heat issue, none really to speak of. I used them for about 45 minutes and they get warm but not hot and certainly they were not uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I bought the Andis 24145 model for $45 on Amazon. The 24145 cuts hair fast without pulling. Although I still had to make several runs over the same area to catch the stray hair strands, it still cuts more evenly than the other Andis models that I owned.  It also didn&#x27;t vibrate as much which makes it less noisy than other Andis models. The blade is a white ceramic material which runs cooler than a steel blade. It comes with a pack of 9 comb attachments (which fits most other Andis models) and a small bottle of oil. Overall, I like this model and would consider buying it again. I previously bought the Andis 20140 Hair Clipper/Trimmer Combo Pack to replace another Andis clipper that broke. The 20140 was a piece of junk and it pulled my son&#x27;s hair. It was one of the worse clippers I owned.</li>
            <li> I considered the higher priced Andis clippers, but opted to try this one thinking it might be sufficient since its just for me. Well...I was very surprised at how well this clipper performed, they&#x27;re very sharpe and cut very smoothly, I dont see how a higher priced clipper could do any better. They do get a little warm after a while, but I can tolerate that. Great product thats already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I received this clipper in the mail yesterday the exact time i had a haircut. I am a professional Lady barberstylist and i have to say these are the most light weight, quiet sounding clippers i have owned besides the Andis Speed Master 1. I have the Andies Master as well, but they are too heavy for me to give a marvelous fade... But now that i have these i am extra good on my fades.. I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> With all of its great reviews and a price point under $50, the Andis SpeedMaster 2 seemed like a no-brainer.  But what a disappointment!  First off, allow me to preface that I take excellent care of all my tools.  Not only do I treat my clipper with premium clipper oil after each use; I blow out all the bits of hair using a can of compressed air prior to oiling.  Prior to the SpeedMaster 2, I had been using a cheapo Wahl kit of similar design and dimensions to buzz my hair.  I purchased it 5-6 years ago for about $35, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  The reason for my change of heart was because the all-steel Wahl blades would heat up after about ten minutes of use.  Also, I figured I could get a closer buzz and save time with a faster oscillating blade.  Lo and behold, the SpeedMaster 2 failed all three of my requirements:  * The so-called \\&quot;4x\\&quot; feature???  4x compared to WHAT?  The SpeedMaster 2 actually had a tougher time with my hair than its cheaper, older (and duller, I&#x27;m sure) Wahl counterpart.  It took more trips over the same area to get a uniform cut.  * The hybrid ceramic blade actually reached an uncomfortable temperature about 3-5 minutes before the Wahl all-steel blade would.  * And worst of all, the advertised \\&quot;1/100 inch\\&quot; closeness touted in the specs is not even close!  After going multiple times over the same areas, I was able to pinch and pull hairs between my fingernail and thumb.  The shortest cut hair I measured was 1/16 inch!  I could tell right away when I opened the package that the blade halves were not lined up flush with each other with the lever all the way up.  Furthermore, the screws that hold the blade in place are not adjustable.  So one can easily infer that the product is not designed to cut any closer than that 1/16\\&quot; gap between the blade components.  One could even make the argument that ALL of the SpeedMaster 2 units manufactured are defective, as it&#x27;s likely that, due to the design, not one of them is capable of cutting to the specifications advertised!  Sorry to be one of the only nay-sayers here, but I&#x27;m just THAT dissatisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I have owned about a half dozen beard trimmers in my life.  They have all beed made my Norelco.  But my most recent one only lasted two years, so I decided I was going to spend a little bit of money this time.  I was put off by the idea of having to oil blades on the high end clippers because I thought it would be a lot more trouble than it was worth.  It turns out, it&#x27;s not that bad at all.  In fact, I&#x27;d rather oil the blades before and after use than have to go over my trim job a dozen times just to get all of the stray hairs.  That&#x27;s where the benefit lies.  This bad boy comes with a bunch of different trimmer attachments, so I can even use it to cut my hair in the summer if I want.  But the thing that sets this apart from any other trimmer I have ever used is that it did the job in one pass.  The total time I spent shaving my beard was about eight and a half seconds.  That&#x27;s absolutely amazing in my book.  Time will tell if it ends up lasting longer than any of the Norelcos I&#x27;ve thrown away in the past, but I&#x27;ve come to the realization that saying Andis and Norelco in the same sentence doesn&#x27;t do Andis any justice.</li>
            <li> These clippers are advertised to adjust down to 0.0.  They do not adjust that low.  So, if you are purchasing these for line ups and all-around detail work for African American hair, you might want to consider a different set or buy different blades.  Otherwise, these clippers are quiet and feel as though they are made well.  These could be more versitile for the price.</li>
            <li> Have been using this two cut my own hair for over two years. Still running strong and gives a great haircut. Has saved me a ton of money and time in not having to go to barber. You can tell this thing is well constructed and high quality.</li>
            <li> These clippers are amazing.  If they ever broke (which they haven&#x27;t after at least two years of regular use) I would buy another pair immediately.  They&#x27;ve paid for themselves maybe 20 times over by now.</li>
            <li> After a friend told me he does his own hair cuts I decided to try it out.  Since this unit was less than the cost of 2 barber shop cuts, I figured i wasn&#x27;t out a lot of money if it didn&#x27;t work well.  I was amazed at how easy it is to use, and left my self wondering why I&#x27;ve paid for barber-shop cuts all these years.  This thing is of average noise level, that is to say at barber shops I have heard louder, and quieter clippers.  The unit came with a variety of guards in various sizes. I have found that I tend to use the #1, #3, and #5 and the result is a decent looking hair cut.  The unit feels like it is high quality, it feels solid in the hand, and after over a year of use it is still holding up great.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these, and after reading the reviews I was sure I had made an excellent choice.  They were light weight and fit my hand beautifully.  Nice and quiet...I was very excited to give my first haircut with them.  The first problem was they kept tripping my GFCI switch.  At first I thought it was a fluke, but it happened repeatedly.  VERY annoying.  My son likes his hair cut military style...very short.  I made my first swipe and noticed I needed to go over it again.  This happened for the whole haircut.  I still tried to tell myself it was ok.  Then came my husband&#x27;s haircut.  His hair is a little longer, but still short.  I had to swipe 2 and 3 times to get a clean cut.  I finally got out my old clippers and finished the job.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just a fluke or what, but I can&#x27;t give these a good rating.  I sent them back and ordered new blades for my very old and reliable Wahl clippers!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice trimmer. Quiet, well built and has a good assortment of trimmer combs. A heavy-duty trimmer for a decent price.</li>
            <li> This clipper works really well.  I use it about once a week to shave my head.  I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and never had a problem.</li>
            <li> My first ceramic blade trimmer. It has worked well and does not get as hot as my several old trimmers.</li>
            <li> These clippers are beautiful. While they are NOT professional grade Masters, they get the job done. I use them for touch up my taper fades and to shadow my beard. They work great for those things. I tried to use them to fade and they dont blend as well as I need to. That&#x27;s my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Gives a nice clean cut. I would recommend this to any barber who enjoys giving their customers that nice, clean, sharp cut.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair pretty well. Make sure you oil it before and after each use.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic clips may pop off during use so check the fit each time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its quiet gives a really great haircut easy to handle.Has all the guards you need to create a professional looking haircut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used Andis after all the bad, noisy, headache of experiences I&#x27;ve had trying to operate a pair of Wahls.  I&#x27;ve owned these guys for a little over two years and they started to get pretty noisy in the 12-18 month timeframe.  I use these every week to cut about 10 heads.  The adjuster lever wears a groove on the inside and doesn&#x27;t keep the head strait on the clipper.  To be honest, it&#x27;s the only thing that can really wear.</li>
            <li> I always order good professional clippers and I thought that this would be another good buy, WRONG! These clippers are terrible after falling apart in less than 3 months. The adjustable blade part has a screw that loosens from the vibrations and eventually rips out from the socket, and will just rattle when using. I would never buy these so buyers beware! DO NOT BUY these..</li>
            <li> very good clipper easy to use  and great for fading</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers a year and a half ago after I dropped my Wahl clippers (with the color coded guards) and it cracked, being mostly plastic. The &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; of these clippers are metal, and come with a ceramic blade as indicated in the description. They do an excellent job of actually cutting hair, which is the most important bit, right? I&#x27;ve found that Andis are accurate in their claim of the clippers staying cooler than all-metal blades, at least in my experience. I&#x27;ve never had them get overly hot, even in the summertime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe, also because of the ceramic blade, they run much quieter than other clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past, which is always a plus - who likes loud clippers...? They also come with a set of guide/guard combs in a wide range of lengths from short to long. The only downside for me is that it didn&#x27;t come with a case like my Wahls did - but you can&#x27;t always get what you want. Honestly, you can get other clippers that work fine for less money...  But at around $42, this is a very good buy for those who want to upgrade to better quality clippers without spending the big bucks on the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; models.  I plan on using these for as long as they will last.</li>
            <li> I had to return it without using it, as there was what appeared to be hair on the blades.</li>
            <li> these clippers have a robust motor and dont get nearly as hot as our old pair... they cut really well .  The body of the clipper is not so large that I cannot hold them like a lot of others...</li>
            <li> This product is not good for using more than five times, very high noise and disturbing, I recommend to not buy it.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a $20 junk clipper a year ago.  Now it is still super sharp and smooth.  It is truly a Lamborghini in clippers.</li>
            <li> It is a great clipper for beard trim, or neck trim. Powerful-rechargeable. Many size attachments. I have used other cordless trimmers and this one is the best by far</li>
            <li> This works like a charm. I should have bought this item in the begining. I love these clippers. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent clipper, trimmer. Gets a little hot after 3-4 mins of use. I use it for beard trimming and it does not take me more than 3-4 minutes so works excellent for me, no batteries to charge or worry about.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers. They make my sons hair look so nice. You can definitely tell the difference between cheap clippers and these. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase at all. This is the second Andis clipper that I have bought. Got one for my bf a few years back, and he couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I got this one for my brother after his regular clippers broke (he LOVES his Andis trimmer/line-up tool) and it just refuses to work properly. Wouldn&#x27;t even turn on out of the box. Cuts unevenly and drops dead mid-use.</li>
            <li> I AM TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY BY THIS PRODUCT I WENT ON YOUTUBE TO SEE ACTUAL REVIEWS AND THIS TRIMMER IS RATED AS OUTSTANDING AND THAT DOESN&#x27;T DO IT JUSTICE. THESE ARE THE BEST TRIMMERS ON THE MARKET, NOTHING ELSE COMPARES AND THE PRICE IS AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> My son purchased these for college and he loves them. He is also using them to cut some of his teammates hair with them.</li>
            <li> ok the fact&#x27;s is these Clippers are Amazing they are like a Sports car   compare to most other clippers in there price range i really think that this is a Steal i got these clippers cause i wanted to get into Barbering and my God this has to be the best 50 bucks i&#x27;ve ever spend i&#x27;ve already made about 200 bucks off them and i just got them like 3 days ago i honestly can&#x27;t find a Con   well maybe just one but its   so stupid to let it bother you the     Con is that the lil lever on the side does not have the little indents to see how open or how close the blade is but thats such a stupid Con honestly i think it looks more professional with out it      and you can outline with these but it will not be as sharp or look as good or be as easy as it is with the Andis Outliner II ether way you have to buy a Outliner and this to have that barber experience     Oh and the Fact that these Run Cool And the clippers dont pull the hair is a Big BIG plus</li>
            <li> I will be ordering these clippers, i have a been a barber for 6 years now, and have messed with alot of clippers. Especially the fast feeds...those are my go to clippers. Bald fades, taper fades, combovers, you name it. I will be doing a comparison of the two, and see which ones works best for me.  Having high expectations for this clipper, and ill also be ordering the andis sonic plus. Ill try all that zero gapping stuff and let all you fellow barbers how they come out to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over a year now, and they show no signs of giving up yet.  I had gone through countless sets of throw-away department store junk clippers before deciding to spend a little bit more.  Being more than a little disappointed in the last pair of Wahls I owned, I decided to try Andis.  The ceramic blade is new to me, but seems to do the job just fine without pulling or bogging down at all.  They are smaller than many clippers, but have a good heft to them.  They are also very quiet.  The only thing so far I don&#x27;t like is the plastic attachments (they seem flimsy how they clip onto the blade with a little locking tab instead of sliding on solidly), but I have yet to break one off, and I&#x27;m generally good at breaking things quickly.  Also I wish it came with ear taper attachments, but I have gotten used to doing it differently.  Overall, for under $50 (the price of 3-4 simple haircuts) you can&#x27;t go wrong, at least I don&#x27;t expect to be adding them to the cheap clipper graveyard under the sink anytime soon.</li>
            <li> These clippers are a definite step up from the 20dollar wahls and other ones from wally world etc. There may be even better high end clippers on the market, but for the price these seem to be well built and can cut a nice precise short fade very well.  Attachments fit pretty well, adjustment lever holds in place nice and firm, and motor sounds good and feels powerful. They do heat up after a while, but not too bad.  Ceramic blade is the way to go too... after 4 haircuts these are my favorite clippers yet, should have got these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these yet but, they came rather fast. Just as described, Andis has in my opinion better guards the transition from a 1 guard to a 2 gaurd on whals is a big difference, with Andis there is a gaurd in the middle of a 1 and 2 which helps with fading. I&#x27;m sure I am going to love these, can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace a battery-driven unit, which failed after just 2 uses. Andis cuts much faster, does not need time for recharging stupid batteries, and looks/feels more solid. Nothing wrong with it so far.</li>
            <li> One of the best clippers on the market NO QUESTION!!! I just love the way they work!!! anyone could use them, and good with any styled hair cut.</li>
            <li> this is a excellent product ,would recommend it to all persons looking for a smooth cut. this is a cut about the rest, great product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this! Don&#x27;t wait, just get it, its amazing. Its powerful, quite, excellent quality build. It looks superb and feels so as well. The cord is fairly long, its addicting to use! hahaha.</li>
            <li> Our family has only owned one other set of clippers, the $25 budget model purchased in a department store.  The Andis clippers are for sure a step up and seem to do a better job in every respect.  The budget set performed \\&quot;fine\\&quot; for many years, doing 2-4 clippings per month.  But it was time for a change as they were starting to get a little dull and hair cuts were taking much longer.  The Speed Master 2 clippers work very well and so far, seem like a fine product.  The Positives:  Cost, they were a step down from the better/best Andis model, but based on other reviews seem to work well.  Since I am not in the \\&quot;business\\&quot;, I am hoping these will last several years for home use.  The ceramic blade is supposed to last longer and run cooler than metal/steel blade before needing replaced.  Hair cuts take less time and have a good FEEL afterwards.  Is this due to a superior clipper, or just a new blade?  I cannot give a complete answer to that.  The speed of the motor, or cutting speed does seem faster.  It is hard to remember the first months using the previous clippers, but these seem to cut through the hair better than the others ever did, even when they were new.  There is less hair that is MISSED as you pass through (using the guards/guides).  The Negatives:  These clippers do get hot in a short amount of time.  We usually use the #3 to #5 attachments.  By the time you are finished with the main cutting and are ready to trim, you have to be careful around bare skin, when trimming the neckline for example, or around the ears.  I have seen some other clippers get hotter, but these are REALLY warm.  I suppose it is the blade speed that causes the heat to build up.  Not an expert, only telling what I have experienced.  One reason we chose the Speed Master 2 over the higher priced Andis was based on reviews that said the others were HOT, and the ceramic blade of this model would keep them running cooler.  We DO use oil - oil at start up, and oil during the cutting.  Theyare STILL very \\&quot;W-A-R-M\\&quot; .... but this may be normal/expected for higher end, fast running clippers.  These are NOT made in the USA, but the best Andis clippers ARE.  I LIKE to buy American.  BUT ... the others were significantly higher priced, without the ceramic blade.  These cannot be repaired if they tear up, the American made clippers have replacement parts available.  FINALLY:  I am pleased with these clippers.  I chose an Andis product based on reviews.  I cannot give it a 5* rating only because they seem to be running hotter than I expected and are not servicable.  Would other clippers in this class run cooler? I don&#x27;t know. As far as the actual CUTTING goes, they do a nice job.  As good as the BEST Andis model?  I can&#x27;t answer that.  I hear there are products (gel of foam?) that are designed to cool the blades off?  Might be worth checking into.    NOTE:  I have taken a little extra time with this review because I appreciate knowing everything I can when purchasing a product like this.  I want to make the best decision since I expect to be using it for several years.  I hope I can help someone else do the same.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this clipper. It does not feel like other cheap ones that you can find in walmart or other pharmacy store. It is cool, less noisy and cut through your hair smoothly.  It is very easy to use and has a good feel to it. It is also very easy to clean. The ceramic blades keeps the blade temperature low and it cuts better. I have been using it for over 6 months and I do not have any complaints so far.</li>
            <li> These clippers cut very well.  Gives a pro result.  Saves a lot of $ by not having to  go to the shop.  They run very cool.  We trim two kids at a time.  They barely get warm.  Very good for kids.</li>
            <li> As expected, having owned a similar Andis product previously..</li>
            <li> I used it to trim down my beard when I don&#x27;t have time for a full shave. It gets pretty good close for a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. I highly recommend for this purpose. Also, well made. Please comment if this review has been helpful.</li>
            <li> Great clipper so far. Seems really smooth and fairly quiet. Only used it a couple times so far but if it continues to be this good i&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
            <li> First I will say I turned the clippers on, found hair on it and grime on the the powerswitch. I see they are refurbished. I decided to keep, but I feel a little cheated... As for the refurb clippers, they run strong, cut Precisely, and have a cool white ceramic blade that is sharp and doesn&#x27;t snag. Unless u have a nasty Forrest of har, these clippers do the job. And by the way, of course clippers are hot after long use, that&#x27;s why you buy a separate trimmer for your lineup/beard/sideburns, may I suggest the t- outliners?&lt;br /&gt;Good set overall, good price- I think it is the best vale for the money, and not very many clippers  are better for the paper.</li>
            <li> Best hair clipper and heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I was using an older model for years.  The blades were starting to&lt;br /&gt;dull, so I purchased the new one instead of trying to replace blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old one did the job &amp; lasted many years without doing any maintenance&lt;br /&gt;or oiling the blades.  So far new one workiing great just like old one.  I my try&lt;br /&gt;to oil it once in a while to hopefully increase the lifespan.  But for the price&lt;br /&gt;these are great units.  As long as it doesn&#x27;t break down anytime soon&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers, keeps me looking clean cut everyday, thank you kindly. Makes me look like I am a professional barber as long as you know what your doing and best brand as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned these for about 8 months now.  Initially I was happy with them, but lately, as others have mentioned, they pull your hair rather than cut it.  I&#x27;ve pulled them apart, cleaned them, oiled them and they still pull my hair.  I expected much more from these as I&#x27;ve easily gotten three or more years of use out of cheap store bought Wahl clippers.  I thought I was upgrading, but I was wrong.  I&#x27;m going back to Wahl and will never purchase Andis again.</li>
            <li> I bought the 24145 based on my experience with an Andis cordless that I bought about 15 years ago.  It has finally cut its last hair.  The new clipper cuts hair MUCH slower than the old clipper, and not as good.  I bought the new clipper based on my experience with the old one.  GREATLY disappointed in the 24145 performance.</li>
            <li> This is significantly better than the more common commercial brands. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This item performs well and has many options for different needs in cutting hair.  It is easy to use with adjustable tops for different functions.</li>
            <li> For me, it gets the job done. I am not a professional barber; I cut my own hair . . .</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers.</li>
            <li> A good, steady hair cutting tool that feels like quality, sounds like quality and cuts like quality...and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  It&#x27;s paid for itself several times over since I get my hair cut about every 10 days.</li>
            <li> I love these. Have been using these for years. Only reason I have needed replacements were because I am pretty reckless and dropped them, breaking the ceramic blade or the adjustable guard. But other than that they do pretty well for what I need. I cut my  hair once a week and do not do anything too sophisticated at all.  They cut fast and the blade stays pretty cool. The unit can get pretty hot in the hand though after a while. I really love the rubber/steel combo as well !</li>
            <li> Pros    -Can give myself 10 - 15 minute haircuts now.  -attachments are very sturdy  -comes in good packaging  -the on/off button and the lever feel really sturdy  -the machine overall looks beautiful and feels really rugged    No cons    summary: If you bought this to remove the barber shop from your life, you have succeeded</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on reviews. It is not cutting hair short enough like I expected. It also gets hot even porcelain addition to prevent that.</li>
            <li> Not very good..doesn&#x27;t do an even cut it you cut with the grain.    Even cuttin against the grain won&#x27;t give u an even cut</li>
            <li> I started thinking about the perfect Christmas gift for my fiance around October. As I hate the hustle of shopping in stores during the busiest season of the year, I decided to go online to puchase most gifts this year.  Being that he loves to cut hair and is great at doing it, I decided to get him a new set of professional clippers.  I was apprehensive at first about getting these clippers, even after reading the great reviews for this product. At the last minute (December 22nd to be exact) I made the decision to purchase this product and it arrived on Friday December 23rd.  The look on my fiance&#x27;s face was priceless!  He could not stop smiling and grinning as I thought \\&quot;BINGO!\\&quot;, I had found the perfect gift for him. He tested them out right away.  I even got the Andis T-trimmers for him, and now he has the complete set. To anyone thinking about making this purchse, it will be wise to invest.  The product is very high quality chrome finish and the ceramic blades make them last longer, it even has a little weight to them.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clipper&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Very Quiet&lt;br /&gt;Runs very cool, not gotten hot&lt;br /&gt;Cuts my hair very very well&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use</li>
            <li> My andis clippers Cut really smooth and fades Hair excellent i would recomend them ,great buy for the low price i have no complaints...</li>
            <li> After dealing with a barber that cut my hair for 24 years, putting up with poor treatment as a client,I decided to cut my own hair and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  These clippers are better than what my barber was using, not just because they are Andis but because of proper cleaning, sanitation, and oiling.  These clippers are quiet, stay much cooler than the one&#x27;s my barber was using, they cut a better fade, they are professional class clippers,and the price is nice.  I researched the Andis masters and decided to go with these after a review by a well known professional barber. Also, the Andis T-Outliner is amazing too!</li>
            <li> Purchased in July of 2011. This product has worked great and without issue. I found that it is important to regularly lubricate the blades so they stay cooler during use. Blades are still sharp - I shave my head approximately every three weeks.</li>
            <li> I like my purchase. I now have the magnetic guards to accompany them so im in the game. I did my first cut and i didn&#x27;t disappoint myself. i also purchased some T-outliners to go along with them too. no more trips to the barber shop.</li>
            <li> My husband did not like them at all.</li>
            <li> This product had a hard time actually doing what it was suposed to do, cut hair.  The plastic cutter seems cheap and would not cut hair</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and the delivery time wasn&#x27;t that bad.  A few things about the clippers is you have to be very careful and fragile with the cermaic blades.  I used them once and a tooth from the cermaic blade broke off. I was highly upset due to the fact that I just recived them. I ordered a new set of blades.  They tend to get a little on the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; side when cutting hair. I try to take my time when I cut hair and motor gets hot after a while but obviously that is because I take my time with fades.  The cermaic blades do stay cool though. Just make sure you oil it after every use!</li>
            <li> This was purchased more than 6 years ago. It is still working perfectly with minimal attention - much better than the cheap kits tried before ever worked. The rubber patch is a crucial piece: It gives greater control and has prevented the clipper from slipping from my hand and breaking the combs on impact. I have been cutting my own hair in various styles for 50 years and tried several other trimmers. This is the best and ultimately the least costly of all of them.</li>
            <li> I love Andis brand for my dog grooming clippers, so i bought these for my peoples&#x27; hair. This product is lightweight, easy to clean, many combs to choose from, and a great value. the ceramic blade is new to me, and it glides so nicely and stays cooler. i do have a can of clipper cooler spray that is awesome if you have clippers on for an extended time. It&#x27;s just a fact of life that the blade is going to heat up! The noise level is comparable to other high end clippers. A great choice for animals or people!!!</li>
            <li> I have used a $20 Wahl setup for at least 5 years.  Dropping them on a tile floor recently converted them to a vibrating noisemaker.  I have been cutting my own hair (what&#x27;s left) using no guard for as long as I can remember.  After breaking the Wahls, I figured I would upgrade since I&#x27;m saving so much on bi-weekly haircuts.  With the \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; Andis clippers it took twice as long to get an even buzz-cut and left me with the equivalent of 5 days of growth.  Back to the $20 Wahls for me.</li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting my hair since we were married 31 years ago.  In that time, we have went through several sets of clippers.  After the last inexpensive Wahl clippers became dull, we decided to finally upgrade to a professional quality clipper.  I researched Amazon and several other sites and found these Andis Speed Master 2 clippers.  They appeared to be a good compromise between price and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got the first set and gave them a try.  The motor ran so slowly that the hair was being chewed, rather than cut.  Unfortunately, it was beyond 30 days, so I had to deal with the manufacturer.  We were sure that there was something wrong with the clippers, so I contacted Andis.  I was able to send the clippers back for an exchange (on my dime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers that we received back had the same performance issues as the original clippers.  I called Andis again and was told that was how the clippers performed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that Andis does make good quality clippers.  Unfortunately, at this price point, all that can be purchased from Andis is a clipper set that has a few good features, such as ceramic blades, but a lethargic motor.  The guides are also second class, with a plastic milk-jug feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time, we found a Wahl clipper with a lithium battery that is much lighter and much more powerful that the Andis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said in the title, I really wanted to like these clippers.  The reviews and the specs seemed to indicate a top-notch product.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t turn out that way for me.</li>
            <li> Update: 7/22/16: I still love this clipper.  After almost two years, it still runs like new!  This clipper is really great.  I bought the clippers about a year ago to cut my husband&#x27;s hair every couple of weeks.  It cuts right through his thick hair with no problems.  I&#x27;ve used a bad pair in the past that would pretty much just comb through the hair without really cutting it. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them getting hot, as some reviewers have mentioned.  This pair of clippers was bought to replace an old Conair pair I had bought from Costco, which I dropped at some point causing them to be extremely loud.  We couldn&#x27;t take the noise anymore.  I did find that for some reason the #3 attachment seemed shorter on these clippers than on my old Conair, so I went up to a #4 to get the length I was used to.  I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> Smooth and quiet operation. Fair price. Ceramic blades are a plus! Works a ton better than the cheap Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve had for few years from Wallmart. Would definitely recommend this clipper.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, SUPER USSEFULL AND SILENCE.... GREAT AS A GIFT MY BROTHER PRACTICALLY LOVE HIS CLIPPER HE USES AS AN PROFESSIONAL ITS HEAVE BUT SHOWS HIS GREAT BODY ....</li>
            <li> While this clipper works pretty well for overall use, it isn&#x27;t as good as my older (and much less expensive) clipper of the same brand.  It&#x27;s nice that the attachments from my old one fit this newer one, and also that my old plastic case that came with the old one fits this new one, but it really doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the older one did.  I may be forced to purchase a second trimmer, which I hadn&#x27;t  planned on.</li>
            <li> Came on time.  Seems to work well.  Good product  for cutting hair.  Seems sharp and also has plenty of attachments.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Super fast, cuts nice and close.  Nice and light as well.  Much better than the last clippers I had.  Use a couple times a week for a few months now, and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Awesome Awesome.Great clippers for professional</li>
            <li> I have had it for 18 months now and it still works very well, stable and sturdy. I use it once a week and I have had a consistent performance. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It becomes too hot really fast&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t trim properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not the best, but my 3yo Panasonic ER221 is much better and it&#x27;s half the price!</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Cuts without misses. It&#x27;s advertised to not get hot, but does however get very warm.</li>
            <li> Theses are the first pair of clippers I&#x27;ve purchased and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. I recommend these clippers for beginners</li>
            <li> These have to be the prettiest clippers i have ever seen. I bougt them for my hubby who cuts hair. He wanted one with a ceramic piece over the teeth (helps with the heat). These dont get as hot as others and dont pull at all</li>
            <li> Very good clippers this is the first time I used the ceramic blades and I am very happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;Hope they last a long time.</li>
            <li> been cutting for 25 years an have never at a clipper so smooth cutting for so cheap I love them the power they light weight an can cut wet hair due to the ceramic blade.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years for myself and my son and it has given me no problems.</li>
            <li> After the first one delivered was return because it was &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; (had hair under the blades) the replacement is pretty good.  These are a nice and quiet set.  (I&#x27;m not a barber but my barber uses his set on kids who don&#x27;t like the sound of clippers).</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to get these clippers, mainly because I have owned a set of the Andis t-liners for about (6) years and never had any major problems. Great and good looking clippers. Worth every penny. A barber cost $15 plus tip, 2 or three times a month. I&#x27;m saving about six-hundred dollars a year. Not counting the gas and the waiting. (Time is money.) They cut fast and clean. The guards fit tight and they are well made.</li>
            <li> the clippers work awesome...they save me a ton of time compared to what I was using...I will definitely be a return customer</li>
            <li> Excellent, high quality tool for the price. It has paid for itself several times over. Use between haircuts- does a nice job.  Shipping was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Purchased 4 months ago and used 8-10 times. I will NEVER go back to the Walmart shavers after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HUGE difference. Doesn&#x27;t get half as hot, motor doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;whine\\&quot; under pressure thus ripping out your hair and follicles, and this shaver really is tried and true.</li>
            <li> To begin with i really wanted these clippers to be good. I was sadly disappointed  with the cut the first time i used them. The motor is so slow that it misses a lot of hair on the first cut found myself going over and over the same spot to get it to cut the ones sticking up.I finally had to breakout my old Remington clippers to finish the job.I keep my hair short with a #2 on the sides and slightly longer on the top.It did ok with #2 guard on the sides but when i got to the top is where i started having trouble with free handing it.I have bought many clippers since cutting my own hair for 16 years,so i know a little bit about what I&#x27;m doing. After buying cheap Remington and various other brands over the years i thought i would buy a quality clipper for once. Even the cheapest clippers i ever bought runs circles around this piece of junk.The ceramic blades do heat up but not as much as steel is the only positive thing i can find with these. SO if your are looking for a good set of clippers look elsewhere DON&#x27;T I REPEAT DON&#x27;T waste you money on this inferior product in spite of good reviews (which i relied on) you read.&lt;br /&gt;If i could rate it any less than 1 star i certainly would!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had them for about 1 1/2 months now. Nice and quiet compared to the wahl types that I have been using for the last 15 yrs.  Seem to cut a lot more even than the wahl.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my hubby after his old one died. He raves how this one is much better &amp; more powerful than his old one.  Works well, very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I am truly impressed.  I previously owned a Wahl brand clipper set that wore out after about 5 years of occasional use.  I decided to switch from battery operated to corded in hopes of it lasting longer.  I didn&#x27;t expect the other nice features I was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, after going to barbers for the past 34 years, I&#x27;m used to clippers coming near my head and being so loud that I would not be able to hear a tornado touch down in the chair next to me.  I thought that&#x27;s what all clippers sound like.  These produce a low and quiet hum.  I can hold a conversation with my dog as he stares at me curiously while I&#x27;m trimming around me ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, these clippers are heavy and well-built.  I haven&#x27;t owned them long at all, but I have the impression that I will be owning them for many years to come.  If something goes wrong, I&#x27;ll come back and update my review.</li>
            <li> I liked that the teeth on the guards were sturdy and close together, but the motor on this thing is not strong enough to get through one pass on my 4 yr olds fine hair. It was pulling and not cutting evenly.  I would not reccommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers when i was a junior in highschool and now I am a sophmore in college i use them every week and they work like they did on day one. i cut my hair once a week and they fade very nicely i get a nice consistent fade everytime they cut well. the ceramic blade stays cool through a long cut. works great on straight hair and curly hair. i cut my friends hair with these clippers and my friends love the cuts i give them. for this price i feel like getting another one cause i paid like 60 for mine when i got mine lol but if i do get another pair of clippers i may go for the oysters 76 i was going to get those instead of these clippers at first but i went with the speedmasters because they are known to be very versatile and i was a beginner 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> Works really well, feels hefty, requires little upkeep. I guess I&#x27;ve never had one that didn&#x27;t work well but all I can say is that this one is pretty great!</li>
            <li> not enough power these are too slow</li>
            <li> not a bad tool, cuts quiet...pretty effective at even cutting. not a bad choice! looks great also and definitely backed by a good quality brand name.</li>
            <li> Works very good. It is very easy to operate and maintain.I would recommend, this brand to anyone who cuts hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into fades then these clippers are right for you!! Many people say they break down before the first month, but its possibly becasue they dont treat them correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price for a good deal.</li>
            <li> These clippers work well. I bought because of the motor being different than the clippers I already have. Certain ones work better for different hair type and thickness. The only complaint I had was the first pair had hair on them, so my guess is they were either refurbished and not cleaned properly or someone purchased, used, and returned them. I called Amazon though and the customer service representative took care of it. 😊</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for years and have tried many store brand clippers. These are by far the best I have ever purchased. They are very powerful and unless you are professionally cutting 20 people a day you do not need to purchase the more expensive versions. These clippers buzz cut easily through my thick hair. I do not feel that they overheat any more or less than other clippers I have purchased, but they do give a superior cut. Very smooth with no tugging or pulling. You can see why these are used by professionals and for 45 dollars or so, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Works good. Two years old now.</li>
            <li> Delivered right on time, actually earlier than I expected. Product works perfectly comes with many different guards. Only thing is it does heat up a little bit if you use it for a long period of time but that&#x27;s not a big deal</li>
            <li> I bought these for my picky boyfriend (he&#x27;s a barber). They weren&#x27;t the ones he wanted... he said they were better than the ones he wanted. Enough said.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this buzzer compared to my wahl.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong wahl is garbage too.  You can buy it at wal mart, thats already saying something.  Top quality clippers are sold in barber shops, online beauty shops, and you can basically buy anything on amazon.  I did some extensive research and found Andis to be top of the line clippers. These clippers in particular happened to have pretty good reviews.  The ceramic blade is great, it doesn&#x27;t get as warm as steel on steel blades.  After a while the blades started pulling hair.  I cut hair on various people all the time.  I properly oil it every time.  Brush it clean it between the blades, spray coolant on it, even try to get the clogged hair out of the buzzer itself.  The hair pulling is what I hate most it otherwise the review would&#x27;ve been fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using these clippers for over two years now. A brief explanation of my cutting routine: I have thick head hair and I shave it to 1/8\\&quot; short twice a month. I also use this to trim my beard when I have one, and pretty much any hair on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my hair is thick and these cutters do not do well. It seems they get stuck on a hair and pull it and you can&#x27;t do anything but back it up and try again and yet it still pulls the hairs. Sometimes I get lucky and able to use em pain-free but 90% of the time the damn thing yanks my hair! I believe it has something to do with the teflon/plastic upper cutting piece. I oil this before every cut so it&#x27;s well oiled. The plastic pieces that clip on the end are rather cheap made and sharp as heck. You could take out a zombie with them. I have a mole or two on my head and neck and the clipper pieces cut em all the time. Annoying. I&#x27;ve endured two years of painful haircuts just to get my money&#x27;s worth but now it&#x27;s time to look for alternatives, and one that uses metal blades cuz that&#x27;s what my old 8 year old clippers had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: durable and doesn&#x27;t bog down, looks good, plastic end pieces make good zombie spears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: pulls and won&#x27;t cut thick hair, cheap and SHARP plastic length pieces, annoying cord that tangles up (god i hate that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you got thick hair or lots of moles, avoid these clippers.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Gives a great buzz cut.</li>
            <li> Zero-gap the blades, and this machine will give you some of the best skin-fades ever, as well as knock out hard lines. The only bad thing is the machine lacks power. Much like using cheap sheers, this machine will sometimes push hair forward instead of cutting it when doing clipper-over-comb.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly for my kids and I. It is quite and durable. Low maintenance makes it very handy</li>
            <li> I use this product for home haircuts and after 6 uses, the clippers work great!  They do not pull or tug my hair. I had the same pair for 7years before I had a problem with them. I consider that a good value for the money!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Light and easy to handle. I would recommend this product to everyone that&#x27;s looking for a new clipper.</li>
            <li> 2 months have been gone so far, and I continue to use the clipper on myself.  I love the fact that its quite and easily glide through the hair.</li>
            <li> Only used it once but it was quiet and did a nice job.  So much better than the noisy old trimmer that I bought many years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these clippers for 8 or 9 haircuts. The blades haven&#x27;t dulled at all and it performs better than several cheaper clippers I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
            <li> great buy works great</li>
            <li> i purchased this andis because i thought it would be as powerful as the masters.... not at all the blade is a plus but the machine it self was a cheesy product! they need to place that blade on the masters then they&#x27;ll be cooking with oil!!!</li>
