            <li>/&gt;It is gentle and smells great.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
            <li>I must buy some more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get creative and change a thing please.</li>
            <li>I love this shower gel.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff and so does my husband.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and it smells and feels very clean when I use this.</li>
            <li>I originally found this at Target and have not used anything else since!</li>
            <li>I love the product, but it did not come with a push top applicator, as shown in the original picture.</li>
            <li>The light scent is heavenly and it works.</li>
            <li>I found a new favorite :)</li>
            <li>Fell in love with this product from my local supermarket and when I could no longer find it there, was thrilled to discover I can order a 6-pack from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>
            <li>The product last quite awhile because it is of a good quality.  </li>
            <li>Makes my super dry skin feel AMAZING!    </li>
            <li>The smell is really mild</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the product shipped very quickly and Amazon&#x27;s customer service via email was very responsive.</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels after use, It&#x27;s a wonderful smell to go to bed in because it is present but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Has a great subtle scent and leaves my skin feeling clean, not perfumed.</li>
            <li>It is non-drying, great for sensitive skin and although there is slight scent at first, the scent washes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to purchase this at my local grocery store but they no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li>Only gripe is that when you buy them in bulk, they don&#x27;t come with a pump top.</li>
            <li>I used this product more than ten years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for my daughters fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this body wash consistently for two years straight.</li>
            <li>Pure indulgence.  </li>
            <li>Consistency is refreshingly NOT slimy like most gels, and the soft fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>The smell is beautiful, subtle and soft.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes and calms my skin.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast, as promised, well sealed, no leaking.</li>
            <li>I really like the way my skin feels and smells after using this soap.</li>
            <li>We use the shower gel &amp; body lotion.not greasy &amp; you can shave with the body lotion.does not take much shower gel to shower.</li>
            <li>It is creamy but not sticky and leaves your skin feeling fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves your skin feeling gently cleansed and nourished.</li>
            <li>Thank you for forwarding the product, I distributed some to my office staff who LOVE IT and are now buying it at their local retailers for daily use.  </li>
            <li>I realized the connection, started using it again, and unless I find something better or they stop making this, I&#x27;ll continue using it indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for your face, I definitely recommend pairing this with CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is a terrific soap that for some reason isn&#x27;t available at my local stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my sensitive skin soft and clear of acne.  </li>
            <li>Soft smell but not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any issues.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference.</li>
            <li>in which I like and it keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>All Makeup and even waterproof mascara are easily removed in a single wash yet it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and the large bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not more readily available.  </li>
            <li>If you are shopping for a new body wash or facial cleanser look no further.</li>
            <li>I used to use another product for that shave action that was 4x more expensive.</li>
            <li>A subtle hint of clean and freshness.</li>
            <li>The scent is maybe a little sweet, but it&#x27;s so subtle that you don&#x27;t really notice it unless you take a really deep whiff while you have your skin pressed to your nose.</li>

            <li> A little bit goes a long way as this soap lathers up really well.</li>
            <li> The smell does not linger after a shower so if you are looking for a long lasting effect you may not get it with this.  </li>
            <li> lost one bottle because it burst open on all the other ones.</li>
            <li> He immediately threw away his other moisturizing shower gels and began using this product (I did the same).</li>
            <li> I bought it for myself since I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I buy them in 6 packs to keep the price down, and they always come individually bagged for any spillage in transport.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - a bottle of this lasts me several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when i opened it half the bottles were open and all leaked out.</li>
            <li> It improves my skin condition and never leave my skin very dry after shower.</li>
            <li> As many body washes I&#x27;ve used throughout the years, I&#x27;m shocked I&#x27;ve never come accross this one.</li>
            <li> I actually gave a few to some friends.</li>
            <li> When I purchased it I got it because it was cheaper than other moisturizing products</li>
            <li> My only complaint is not about the product itself but about the packaging.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve looked in lots of the typical stores.  </li>
            <li> I thought it had cured on its own...until I stopped using Skin Milk for a few months.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product I purchased was labled as a PUMP and what was received was actually a flip-top container, which still works well.  </li>
            <li> complained that my package was dripping.</li>
            <li> For shaving, it lathers and also coats your skin with a thin frictionless coating so you can shave close but not scrape the skin.</li>
            <li> Also 3 of the bottles were broken and when the replacement came 2 of those bottles were damaged.</li>
            <li> when my order arrived the mail carrier was mad.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE PACKAGING!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash consistently for two years straight. Duane Reade stopped carrying it, and now I get mine in bulk on Amazon. The smell is beautiful, subtle and soft. Makes my super dry skin feel AMAZING!    TERRIBLE PACKAGING! lost one bottle because it burst open on all the other ones.</li>
            <li> when my order arrived the mail carrier was mad. complained that my package was dripping. when i opened it half the bottles were open and all leaked out. i poured the remaining bottles together and only ended up with just over 3 out of 6 bottles.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific soap that for some reason isn&#x27;t available at my local stores anymore.  It is non-drying, great for sensitive skin and although there is slight scent at first, the scent washes away quickly.</li>
            <li> SkinMilk shower gel is a great product, however the product description on Amazon is a bit misleading.  Description lists 22-oz pump, however the bottles I received had a snap-top cap rather than a pump.  Nevertheless, the product shipped very quickly and Amazon&#x27;s customer service via email was very responsive.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this product from my local supermarket and when I could no longer find it there, was thrilled to discover I can order a 6-pack from Amazon.  Consistency is refreshingly NOT slimy like most gels, and the soft fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li> Love love love SkinMilk Shower Gel. The light scent is heavenly and it works. All Makeup and even waterproof mascara are easily removed in a single wash yet it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It&#x27;s gentle enough for my daughters fair sensitive skin. If you are shopping for a new body wash or facial cleanser look no further. This is the perfect product for both.</li>
            <li> Skin Milk does not dry my skin out and smells really good as well!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Pure indulgence.  Soft smell but not overbearing.  The smell does not linger after a shower so if you are looking for a long lasting effect you may not get it with this.  I order a 6 pack every 4-6 months.  It keeps my sensitive skin soft and clear of acne.  I used to have acne scars all over my shoulders.  This is the only non soap product I can use that does not break me out.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years.  I used to be able to purchase this at my local grocery store but they no longer carry it.  Amazon usually stocks it consistently.  My only complaint is not about the product itself but about the packaging.  When I ordered, the product was described \\&quot;with pump\\&quot; as the picture shows.  When the product arrived, all bottles were without pumps.  I prefer the pump over the standard bottle as it is easier to facilitate.  Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents. Love the way my skin feels after use, It&#x27;s a wonderful smell to go to bed in because it is present but not overwhelming. A subtle hint of clean and freshness. Put the lotion on after it and you&#x27;re in store for a day of lingering freshness.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product so many times that I have a stash of six bottles of it in my basement just in case they discontinue it. I use it for washing and shaving in the shower. Also works great in conjunction with my favorite sugar scrub. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any issues. Light, pleasant smell and great lather. Inexpensive and the large bottle lasts a long time. Only gripe is that when you buy them in bulk, they don&#x27;t come with a pump top. Been using the same one for years!</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle and smells great. It keeps my skin most. Its a great soap that I wish was sold in stores</li>
            <li> I used this product more than ten years. It improves my skin condition and never leave my skin very dry after shower.</li>
            <li> I used to use different gel bathing soaps, and a different product for shaving. I originally found this at Target and have not used anything else since! It&#x27;s a great 2-in-1 product - as a shower gel it leaves a light very pleasant scent and lathers nicely with a shower poof. For shaving, it lathers and also coats your skin with a thin frictionless coating so you can shave close but not scrape the skin. It washes away without leaving a film. I used to use another product for that shave action that was 4x more expensive. A little goes a long way - a bottle of this lasts me several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be heartbroken if/when I can&#x27;t find this to order online anymore! I buy them in 6 packs to keep the price down, and they always come individually bagged for any spillage in transport.</li>
            <li> Love the soothing warm milky-vanilla smell of this shower soap.  Really moisturizes and calms my skin.  Shipped fast, as promised, well sealed, no leaking.</li>
            <li> Thank you for forwarding the product, I distributed some to my office staff who LOVE IT and are now buying it at their local retailers for daily use.  Unfortunately the product I purchased was labled as a PUMP and what was received was actually a flip-top container, which still works well.  Just don&#x27;t expect a pump which is shown as it won&#x27;t arrive, the boxes sent were labled pump, but what was in the box was flip-top lids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skin Milk shower gel for about 5 years. Before that I used to use all of the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; stuff that is marketed at my demographic. Wow, what a difference. My skin is softer and it smells and feels very clean when I use this. Also, it just about cleared up all of the Keratosis Pilaris I had on my upper arms. I thought it had cured on its own...until I stopped using Skin Milk for a few months. I realized the connection, started using it again, and unless I find something better or they stop making this, I&#x27;ll continue using it indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for your face, I definitely recommend pairing this with CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser. Both of these products are cost-efficient. Use this for your body, that for your face.</li>
            <li> As someone who has sensitve skin, this may very well be the best body wash i have ever used. Added bonus is that my girlfriend loves the after smell as well...WIN WIN!</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels and smells after using this soap. The scent is maybe a little sweet, but it&#x27;s so subtle that you don&#x27;t really notice it unless you take a really deep whiff while you have your skin pressed to your nose. A little bit goes a long way as this soap lathers up really well. One bottle lasts me over a month. I use this soap with the Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/towel.</li>
            <li> Great shower gel!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin. Would recommend it to friends. I actually gave a few to some friends. They loved it! I&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
            <li> As many body washes I&#x27;ve used throughout the years, I&#x27;m shocked I&#x27;ve never come accross this one. I must buy some more. Nice scent, great lather and the price is reasonable. Please keep it that way. Don&#x27;t get creative and change a thing please. I found a new favorite :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this products for years now. The smell is really mild in which I like and it keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! My only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t come with the pump and I wish they sold the bigger 32 oz size. I used to buy it elsewhere and it came with the pump in the larger size, but they discontinued selling it,. It was also cheaper too--but since I cannot find it anywhere else I bought it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this shower gel. I bought it for myself since I have dry skin and then my husband tried it because it had a pleasant scent and now he loves it! He immediately threw away his other moisturizing shower gels and began using this product (I did the same). When I purchased it I got it because it was cheaper than other moisturizing products and I wanted to try it. It is great, I used to have an Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion in every room in the house, I no longer need to do so. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this product locally.  We&#x27;ve looked in lots of the typical stores.  I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not more readily available.  Has a great subtle scent and leaves my skin feeling clean, not perfumed.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but it did not come with a push top applicator, as shown in the original picture. Also 3 of the bottles were broken and when the replacement came 2 of those bottles were damaged.</li>
            <li> Love this product by Skin Milk!</li>
            <li> We use the shower gel &amp; body lotion.not greasy &amp; you can shave with the body lotion.does not take much shower gel to shower.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after someone from Austria gave me a milk bar soap.  It is creamy but not sticky and leaves your skin feeling fresh and soft.  The product last quite awhile because it is of a good quality.  I have given it to several college students who swear by it.  I don&#x27;t think the name gel explains the actual product.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth and smells great and leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this when I grocery shopped, but they stopped carrying it. Nothing else compares to it. This product leaves your skin feeling gently cleansed and nourished. I love the stuff and so does my husband.</li>
