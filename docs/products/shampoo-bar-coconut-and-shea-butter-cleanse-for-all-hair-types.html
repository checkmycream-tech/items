            <li> Makes your black natural hair feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought</li>
            <li> After a normal wash, it leaves my hair feeling a little waxy when wet.</li>
            <li> It did not take long for me to receive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the instructions are written on a sticker on the outside of a plastic package that you HAVE to open and remove to get to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with a previous reviewer who said it had enough slip to use to detangle your hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> Not stripped like other harsh shampoos.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped like with my previous liquid shampoos.</li>
            <li> Now it is shiny black with blue overtones, which I have always had, but it was difficult to see just how dark my hair is with all of the frizz and dry damage.  </li>
            <li> It is awful) that people who didn&#x27;t know me in my younger years, are just now seeing me for the first time!!  </li>
            <li> my pale skin and my very green eyes--which even I didn&#x27;t realize were an emerald shade, stand out.  </li>
            <li> When using as shampoo, for some strange reason, it was difficult to untangle my hair.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for someone transitioning because it makes the relaxed hair hard to detangle.&lt;br /&gt;*Bar</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to comb through after a shower, even when using a conditioner and/or leave-in after shampooing.</li>

            <li> This plus Denman brush equals magic.</li>
            <li> Works well on fully natural hair. I would not recommend this for someone transitioning because it makes the relaxed hair hard to detangle.&lt;br /&gt;*Bar does not come with a holder.</li>
            <li> This shampoo bar has my hair squeaky clean LITERALLY...I love it!! Must follow up with the Babassu conditioner to bring the softness back to your hair. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This bar leaves my hair feeling great.  Not stripped like other harsh shampoos.  I love it because the bar lasts a long time.  Be sure to buy a soap dish to put the bar in when it is not in use.</li>
            <li> It smells devine.  Will order another.  I use it with the curling custard and my hair is so soft.  I think I will try the conditioner too.</li>
            <li> i tried this as soon as i got it from amazon. came right on time. only complaint is that the instructions are written on a sticker on the outside of a plastic package that you HAVE to open and remove to get to the shampoo. i had to take it out of the garbage 3x just to remember how to use it. it would be helpful if there was another way to seal it up. other than that, i love it!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a natural shampoo bar and I feel so-so about it. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair. It doesn&#x27;t clean so well after an oil treatment though - I need at least two rinse and repeats before my hair feels clean. After a normal wash, it leaves my hair feeling a little waxy when wet. It&#x27;s hard to comb through after a shower, even when using a conditioner and/or leave-in after shampooing. I might try a different blend that works better for my hair type (dry and fine).</li>
            <li> First off, the shipping was FAST! I placed my order on 9/25 and I had my product on 9/27. This stuff is GREAT! I will never use another traditional shampoo again. This bar has tons of slip so it&#x27;s great for detangling, it lathers well, and smells pretty good. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped like with my previous liquid shampoos. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This soap makes my hair feel so soft, and it makes it very shiny and my natural curls bouncy.

I actually feel really good in my own skin, which I know sounds funny, due to using a particular shampoo bar--but my pale skin and my very green eyes--which even I didn&#x27;t realize were an emerald shade, stand out.  I am sure due to my lack of self-esteem with my prior hair and the fact no one could really see past this huge frizz puff (my hair is extremely thick, so if it does frizz up on me, it literally stands about a foot out from my head!!  It is awful) that people who didn&#x27;t know me in my younger years, are just now seeing me for the first time!!  Buy this, regardless of your hair type, so healthy for you.</li>
            <li> This soap is AMAZING!  Makes your black natural hair feel very soft.  Wonderful sweet coconut fragrance!  This is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> Excellent and did not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, I almost wanted to eat it. Its my favorite natural shampoo bar, its better than j.r. Liggetts.</li>
            <li> I like the soap for my body instead. When using as shampoo, for some strange reason, it was difficult to untangle my hair. As a body soap, it leaves my skin supple.</li>
            <li> This bar soap smells so good and I love the way it cleans my hair. It did not take long for me to receive.</li>
            <li> First time use and fall in love with it. will recommend to anyone who want to try it. love it</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product! 1 bar has lasted several months &amp; I generally use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> Great product I love the shampoo bar concept my hair feels great and it&#x27;s a wonderful detangler</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought but otherwise, I loved it!</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and last a while. I don&#x27;t agree with a previous reviewer who said it had enough slip to use to detangle your hair in the shower. Sometimes it does make my hair feel kinda waxy but then i just use my Shea Moisture conditioner and the end result is beautiful.</li>
