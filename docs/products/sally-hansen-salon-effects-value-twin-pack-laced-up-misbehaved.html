            <li>THEY WERE AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>Even so, they&#x27;re a very good deal considering</li>
            <li>If you take your time and follow the directions, they go on beautifully.  </li>
            <li>however, it just doesn&#x27;t look great.</li>
            <li>The twin pack is a great value, and will not buy from the box stores any longer.</li>
            <li>But the shipping was great and on time.</li>
            <li>Looks great.</li>
            <li>These darker designs are great for winter months.</li>
            <li>love buying these, they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>FOR A SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION&lt;</li>
            <li>Loved the pair of designs.</li>
            <li>I loved the misbehaved pattern but not the lace.</li>
            <li>I also did a nude color and everyone complimented how gorgeous they looked...</li>
            <li>good, they work.</li>
            <li>however, they look good</li>
            <li>AND SHE LOVED IT</li>
            <li>Now you might think this is a good thing</li>
            <li>Some are just gorgeous.</li>
            <li>this was really good for its price.</li>
            <li>They are superb, and have lasted me up to 2 weeks, and are EASY to get off and EASY to apply!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the sally hensen polish strips!</li>
            <li>:) Hope this helps!</li>
            <li>I am a waitress and it lasted a week without chipping for me which is outstanding!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love these strips!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I just love these!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love these things!</li>
            <li>These work great and the instructions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Incoco&#x27;s designs are beautiful and more appropriate for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS</li>
            <li>These look amazing with lacy dresses and tops.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was because they remained out of the package or if my room was to warm.  </li>
            <li>if I were you and you love changing your nails, these are good to buy</li>
            <li>I have also liked the Sally Hansen brand for some time and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a great product for special occasions</li>
            <li>Take some time to learn how to correctly apply, but very easy once you figure it out.</li>
            <li>They look smooth, shiny and just about as good as a salon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great wear if you use a top coat and can be on our nails for up to 10 days chip free if the top coat is reapplied.</li>
            <li>sure the room is WARM.  </li>
            <li>Make sure the surface of your nails is very clean!</li>
            <li>I topped it with 2 coats of Sally Hansen Super Shine Tope Coat and I am thrilled!  </li>
            <li>But they really looks good, I got a lot of complements!</li>
            <li>The first time I used them was great and they stayed on for almost 3 weeks with me keeping my hands in water a lot,</li>
            <li>Amazon has lots of good prices on them from reputable and well-rated sellers, so they are definitely worth a shot!</li>
            <li>I love getting it in twin packs.</li>
            <li>no where in the instructions do they tell you to put on a top coat.</li>
            <li>Received many comments.  </li>
            <li>Will gladly buy again.</li>
            <li>I love Sally hansen Salon effects.</li>
            <li>I use them all the time:)</li>
            <li>These are a lifesaver, I love these, 20 minutes</li>
            <li>I WILL be buying more.  </li>
            <li>It gives the salon look for a much better price.</li>
            <li>I do wish {though I understand why they wouldn&#x27;t} that they would put more in the pack.</li>
            <li>she has many of these collected in her make up box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these are probably better than any manicure or polish</li>
            <li>You can get more time than they say even.</li>
            <li>better.</li>
            <li>KIDS LOVE THEM</li>
            <li>This will make them more flexible and easier to manipulate.</li>
            <li>Enjoy them!</li>
            <li>Most of Sally Hansen&#x27;s patterns are targeted at teens.  </li>
            <li>My friends wear these and they look really cute</li>
            <li>they were really cute though.</li>
            <li>I love the design on these nail colors.  </li>
            <li>but I love these for my toenails.</li>
            <li>Thanks demand is excellent and I liked it a lot and will re-application of this product so much and thank you again</li>
            <li>so this on is pretty good</li>
            <li>Sure it lasts longer than the leading nail polish, but this stuff still tends to chip fairly easily around the tips and the cuticle.</li>
            <li>Yes acetone is more damaging, but if you use a topcoat and/or basecoat with these, you&#x27;ll need a strong remover.</li>
            <li>This takes time to apply but will look great and last for about a week depending on what kind of work you do with your hands.</li>
            <li>These salon effects are perfect for a quick manicure and pedicure, very simple and easy to do and they work great for anyone who wants to do their nails for any event.</li>
            <li>I learned how to smooth the edges better so no chips.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, stays for up to two weeks.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to clean your nails with nail polish remover before you apply the stickers on the nail.</li>
            <li>The ones I got to use went on and came off easily</li>
            <li>and you have new gorgeous nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also done light housework and they are holding up well.  </li>
            <li>So that made it even more worth it for the 5 dollars I paid compared to the 10 in stores!&lt;br /&gt;-tons cheaper than the store price</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Sally Hansen&#x27;s strips are often available on Prime</li>
            <li>I love these polishes and misbehaved is my absolute favorite color by salon effects.</li>
            <li>For such a really cheap product, they looked very nice.</li>
            <li>I used Orly Bonder, which I have found very effective with regular polish.</li>
            <li>My first experience has been great so far.</li>
            <li>Came as described, wearing the \\&quot;Laced Up\\&quot; strips and they look AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth getting it online for 3$ for 2 instead of what I would get anywhere else for 20!</li>
            <li>I tried these for the first time and I LOVE them already.  </li>
            <li>These seemed to be a little thinner and took a bit more care to apply, but once they&#x27;re on they looked great and lasted over two weeks</li>
            <li>I think they are great if you can get a good deal on them because then if you do get a dud box (perhaps a box that sat in back stock for too long, or something like that)</li>
            <li>They go on so easy and you can do dishes right afterward.</li>
            <li>guess she really does love them</li>
            <li>Next I tried AVON - Not as good.  </li>
            <li>Look beautiful with black nail polish...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many Salon Effects and these are my favorite overall.  </li>
            <li>I more than likely will buy again :)</li>
            <li>Particularly if you do use a top coat, this will help seal the polish strip over the edge of your nail, preventing it from chipping or wearing away as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The very first Nail decor strips I used were the KISS brand.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to apply, just make sure you clean the nailbed free of cuticles, and a definite buff and polish with the nail file beforehand, wipe clean with nail polish remover and you are ready to apply.</li>
            <li>Some geometric patterns with more subtle colors would be great.</li>
            <li>This is great if you just need it for a few days.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes Salon Effects nails go on smoothly and stay on for nearly two weeks (sometimes longer) and look fabulous and snag compliments and all that jazz.  </li>
            <li>Recommend clear top coat to extend wear.</li>
            <li>I use a good base and then cover it with a nice top coat to get more out of the look.</li>
            <li>More than pushing back your cuticles, try to get rid of peeling edges and buff the surface of your nails smooth.</li>
            <li>a clear top coat within 24</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, realy long lasting, great designs, and you can not beat this price.  </li>
            <li>I was very careful about wiping my nail with polish remover to remove any residue, I would suggest that you do the same for the best results.</li>
            <li>If you want NICE, Long Lasting, Easy to apply AND REMOVE Nail dressings, USE THE KISS brand!</li>
            <li>I found it best to bend them a little to suit the shape of my nail, then lay it on similar to how you would an acrylic.  </li>
            <li>sure to smooth the tips well - any rough edges will &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on fabric and chip&lt;br /&gt;*Apply</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to make the others stick on to my fingers, but they chipped really easily.</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more of these.</li>
            <li>These strips are great, and they do last a long time</li>
            <li>Alot better than paying like $35-$40  for exact same order in store.</li>
            <li>I also added sally hansens diamond flash 60 second top coat with strengthener.</li>
            <li>These strips, especially the lacey ones, were my favorite.</li>
            <li>So I decided to remove the plastic from the opposite end,got better results there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, the first trial didn&#x27;t go well.  </li>
            <li>second trial was much better-</li>
            <li>a second top coat after 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li>They began to chip/tear off within the first hour of applying them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There were easy as pie to put on, I was in a rush the first time I tried them and had them done in about 15 minutes (with no dry time!).</li>
            <li>Just make sure to MATCH the KIND of gold or black that you&#x27;re using with it because they all have different sheens to them.</li>
            <li>And to clarify, this item is one full set (16 strips - enough for both hands) of each pattern, not two full sets of each.</li>
            <li>They still look pretty decent!</li>
            <li>Salon Effects will only last one day without a top coat of clear nail polish, or maybe two to three days with the top coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are a little pricey in the store (I got them at Target on clearance, but the regular price is almost $9), but this value twin pack is a great deal.</li>
            <li>The seller is very prompt delivering.</li>
            <li>It just depends on how fast your nails grow.</li>
            <li>my nails were really damaged they just break in a funy way (vertically), so now I stop using nail strips till my nails grow for like a moth</li>
            <li>And I really like them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are a couple of duds out there in every lot, but it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve done as much grooming as you want, wash your hands thoroughly - immediately before you want to apply these - and then swipe your nails with some rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Also, once you apply the strips to your nails, rub them for about 15 secs or so to ensure they are really stuck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>there isnt really much of a difference from the store bought ones</li>
            <li>So I groomed my nails exactly per the instructions and these babies lasted 3 full days before beginning to chip (and very tiny chips at that)!</li>
            <li>If you cut them in half, you have a better use of them, but make sure your nails are not too long for this.</li>
            <li>The patterned ones in particular are just so fun, and would cost you so much more do get done in a salon and may not last as long!</li>
            <li>and then I will use this only for special occasions.</li>
            <li>They look great on your nails instantly dry stays on for a while without great use of your nails, and absolutely so easy to use, comes off with nailpolish remover (glitter ones are a little harder to get off) great and funky colors, I would reduce the price so more people buy them because the single ones are less expensive in the stores!!</li>
            <li>They last almost a full two weeks</li>
            <li>I picked up a fun, patterned set at the local drug store last week, excited to try them again on my rehabilitated nails.</li>
            <li>This particular twin pack is the oldest I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>I suspect the patterned ones are more complicated since they probably have more layers of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love both of these designs and this brand had always worked perfectly for me in the past, but when I put on the fishnet ones, one of the two packages had a hole in it and nearly half of the strips were dried out completely.</li>
            <li>They offer a beautiful look (like you paid money at a salon to get a manicure) but with less than half the cost!</li>
            <li>It even goes nicely with other golds or blacks as a French manicure.</li>
            <li>I really like Sally Hansen nail strip, are easy to apply and with a layer of clear polish they last a week, BUT I used different models (all Sally Hansen) and after maybe 6 weeks  </li>
            <li>My strips came intact and and spanking new condition.</li>
            <li>They dry out super fast and then its a huge waste.</li>
            <li>THEY COMPLETELY FALL APART!</li>
            <li>When trying to put them on, following the instructions exactly, they ripped while taking them off the piece of plastic the came on.</li>
            <li>When putting the other ones on the were cute but only lasted one day.</li>
            <li>you have the polish in place, smooth it down well with your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were easy to apply but if you have trouble polishing the hand that you don&#x27;t write with then</li>
            <li>They require a little more effort than that (takes me about 1/2 an hour on average), but the results I get are well worth it.</li>
            <li>Fast forward about a year and change: I have been religiously taking care of my nails for about 6 weeks now, and they are much longer, stronger and generally, well-groomed.</li>
            <li>I will say this: my mother is a frequent user of this product and has had more hits than misses, but those few bad boxes greatly discouraged her from continuing to purchase them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used both a solid color and a pattern, and thus far both feel like real nail polish to me, not plastic-y stickers.</li>
            <li>to apply&lt;br /&gt;--Mine stayed in for about 7-8 days (I did go swimming once) but did use a clear coat</li>
            <li>I have purchased these before in store but paid nearly four times the price I paid for this set.</li>
            <li>A topcoat is not necessary, but it really does help extend the life of these things.</li>
            <li>I bought these based on the reviews and I had very low expectations, I think because what works for most people&#x27;s nails usually doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li>While pretty and inexpensive, these were not very durable.  </li>
            <li>Most strips are long enough that you can use them for two nails if you cut them in half.</li>
            <li>Product was received in new condition and earlier than exspected.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ease of use and fast application, as well as no time to wait around to dry or get smudged</li>
            <li>So beware that you can only get one use for the price, which is a bit much for only one use.  </li>
            <li>I bought them on a whim when they first came out, not expecting them to be any better than regular nail polish, which, on me, is just about useless.</li>
            <li>I spent most of the time filing them down and even when I pushed the cuticles back</li>
            <li>Yesterday, I priced these at the local Target and they were running $8 for a single box, so needless to say these are a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of polish strips before and they pale in comparison - the polish was sheerer and they lasted a day or two at most.</li>
            <li>The other nail-sticker thing by OPI is the same exact way.</li>
            <li>Finally a polish with style that will last for several days on your natural nails.</li>
            <li>any case, I have learned a few things about making these polish strips work to the max, for those interested in giving them a try.</li>
            <li>First off, when I went to remove them from the package, the pull tab on the back pulled down, but left the plastic seal in place.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ll probably get at least another day or two out of them (making this at least a 7-day mani), which is truly amazing to</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was because they remained out of the package or if my room was to warm.  </li>

            <li> Take some time to learn how to correctly apply, but very easy once you figure it out.</li>
            <li> They look smooth, shiny and just about as good as a salon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great wear if you use a top coat and can be on our nails for up to 10 days chip free if the top coat is reapplied.</li>
            <li> sure the room is WARM.  </li>
            <li> Make sure the surface of your nails is very clean!</li>
            <li> I topped it with 2 coats of Sally Hansen Super Shine Tope Coat and I am thrilled!  </li>
            <li> But they really looks good, I got a lot of complements!</li>
            <li> The first time I used them was great and they stayed on for almost 3 weeks with me keeping my hands in water a lot,</li>
            <li> Amazon has lots of good prices on them from reputable and well-rated sellers, so they are definitely worth a shot!</li>
            <li> I love getting it in twin packs.</li>
            <li> no where in the instructions do they tell you to put on a top coat.</li>
            <li> Received many comments.  </li>
            <li> Will gladly buy again.</li>
            <li> I love Sally hansen Salon effects.</li>
            <li> I use them all the time:)</li>
            <li> These are a lifesaver, I love these, 20 minutes</li>
            <li> I WILL be buying more.  </li>
            <li> It gives the salon look for a much better price.</li>
            <li> I do wish {though I understand why they wouldn&#x27;t} that they would put more in the pack.</li>
            <li> she has many of these collected in her make up box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these are probably better than any manicure or polish</li>
            <li> You can get more time than they say even.</li>
            <li> better.</li>
            <li> KIDS LOVE THEM</li>
            <li> This will make them more flexible and easier to manipulate.</li>
            <li> Enjoy them!</li>
            <li> Most of Sally Hansen&#x27;s patterns are targeted at teens.  </li>
            <li> My friends wear these and they look really cute</li>
            <li> they were really cute though.</li>
            <li> I love the design on these nail colors.  </li>
            <li> but I love these for my toenails.</li>
            <li> Thanks demand is excellent and I liked it a lot and will re-application of this product so much and thank you again</li>
            <li> so this on is pretty good</li>
            <li> Sure it lasts longer than the leading nail polish, but this stuff still tends to chip fairly easily around the tips and the cuticle.</li>
            <li> Yes acetone is more damaging, but if you use a topcoat and/or basecoat with these, you&#x27;ll need a strong remover.</li>
            <li> This takes time to apply but will look great and last for about a week depending on what kind of work you do with your hands.</li>
            <li> These salon effects are perfect for a quick manicure and pedicure, very simple and easy to do and they work great for anyone who wants to do their nails for any event.</li>
            <li> I learned how to smooth the edges better so no chips.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, stays for up to two weeks.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to clean your nails with nail polish remover before you apply the stickers on the nail.</li>
            <li> The ones I got to use went on and came off easily</li>
            <li> and you have new gorgeous nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also done light housework and they are holding up well.  </li>
            <li> So that made it even more worth it for the 5 dollars I paid compared to the 10 in stores!&lt;br /&gt;-tons cheaper than the store price</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Sally Hansen&#x27;s strips are often available on Prime</li>
            <li> I love these polishes and misbehaved is my absolute favorite color by salon effects.</li>
            <li> For such a really cheap product, they looked very nice.</li>
            <li> I used Orly Bonder, which I have found very effective with regular polish.</li>
            <li> My first experience has been great so far.</li>
            <li> Came as described, wearing the \\&quot;Laced Up\\&quot; strips and they look AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth getting it online for 3$ for 2 instead of what I would get anywhere else for 20!</li>
            <li> I tried these for the first time and I LOVE them already.  </li>
            <li> These seemed to be a little thinner and took a bit more care to apply, but once they&#x27;re on they looked great and lasted over two weeks</li>
            <li> I think they are great if you can get a good deal on them because then if you do get a dud box (perhaps a box that sat in back stock for too long, or something like that)</li>
            <li> They go on so easy and you can do dishes right afterward.</li>
            <li> guess she really does love them</li>
            <li> Next I tried AVON - Not as good.  </li>
            <li> Look beautiful with black nail polish...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Salon Effects and these are my favorite overall.  </li>
            <li> I more than likely will buy again :)</li>
            <li> Particularly if you do use a top coat, this will help seal the polish strip over the edge of your nail, preventing it from chipping or wearing away as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The very first Nail decor strips I used were the KISS brand.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to apply, just make sure you clean the nailbed free of cuticles, and a definite buff and polish with the nail file beforehand, wipe clean with nail polish remover and you are ready to apply.</li>
            <li> Some geometric patterns with more subtle colors would be great.</li>
            <li> This is great if you just need it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes Salon Effects nails go on smoothly and stay on for nearly two weeks (sometimes longer) and look fabulous and snag compliments and all that jazz.  </li>
            <li> Recommend clear top coat to extend wear.</li>
            <li> I use a good base and then cover it with a nice top coat to get more out of the look.</li>
            <li> More than pushing back your cuticles, try to get rid of peeling edges and buff the surface of your nails smooth.</li>
            <li> a clear top coat within 24</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, realy long lasting, great designs, and you can not beat this price.  </li>
            <li> I was very careful about wiping my nail with polish remover to remove any residue, I would suggest that you do the same for the best results.</li>
            <li> If you want NICE, Long Lasting, Easy to apply AND REMOVE Nail dressings, USE THE KISS brand!</li>
            <li> I found it best to bend them a little to suit the shape of my nail, then lay it on similar to how you would an acrylic.  </li>
            <li> sure to smooth the tips well - any rough edges will &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on fabric and chip&lt;br /&gt;*Apply</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to make the others stick on to my fingers, but they chipped really easily.</li>
            <li> I will definitely get more of these.</li>
            <li> These strips are great, and they do last a long time</li>
            <li> Alot better than paying like $35-$40  for exact same order in store.</li>
            <li> I also added sally hansens diamond flash 60 second top coat with strengthener.</li>
            <li> These strips, especially the lacey ones, were my favorite.</li>
            <li> So I decided to remove the plastic from the opposite end,got better results there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, the first trial didn&#x27;t go well.  </li>
            <li> second trial was much better-</li>
            <li> a second top coat after 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> They began to chip/tear off within the first hour of applying them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There were easy as pie to put on, I was in a rush the first time I tried them and had them done in about 15 minutes (with no dry time!).</li>
            <li> Just make sure to MATCH the KIND of gold or black that you&#x27;re using with it because they all have different sheens to them.</li>
            <li> And to clarify, this item is one full set (16 strips - enough for both hands) of each pattern, not two full sets of each.</li>
            <li> They still look pretty decent!</li>
            <li> Salon Effects will only last one day without a top coat of clear nail polish, or maybe two to three days with the top coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a little pricey in the store (I got them at Target on clearance, but the regular price is almost $9), but this value twin pack is a great deal.</li>
            <li> The seller is very prompt delivering.</li>
            <li> It just depends on how fast your nails grow.</li>
            <li> my nails were really damaged they just break in a funy way (vertically), so now I stop using nail strips till my nails grow for like a moth</li>
            <li> And I really like them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are a couple of duds out there in every lot, but it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve done as much grooming as you want, wash your hands thoroughly - immediately before you want to apply these - and then swipe your nails with some rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Also, once you apply the strips to your nails, rub them for about 15 secs or so to ensure they are really stuck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> there isnt really much of a difference from the store bought ones</li>
            <li> So I groomed my nails exactly per the instructions and these babies lasted 3 full days before beginning to chip (and very tiny chips at that)!</li>
            <li> If you cut them in half, you have a better use of them, but make sure your nails are not too long for this.</li>
            <li> The patterned ones in particular are just so fun, and would cost you so much more do get done in a salon and may not last as long!</li>
            <li> and then I will use this only for special occasions.</li>
            <li> They look great on your nails instantly dry stays on for a while without great use of your nails, and absolutely so easy to use, comes off with nailpolish remover (glitter ones are a little harder to get off) great and funky colors, I would reduce the price so more people buy them because the single ones are less expensive in the stores!!</li>
            <li> They last almost a full two weeks</li>
            <li> I picked up a fun, patterned set at the local drug store last week, excited to try them again on my rehabilitated nails.</li>
            <li> This particular twin pack is the oldest I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> I suspect the patterned ones are more complicated since they probably have more layers of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love both of these designs and this brand had always worked perfectly for me in the past, but when I put on the fishnet ones, one of the two packages had a hole in it and nearly half of the strips were dried out completely.</li>
            <li> They offer a beautiful look (like you paid money at a salon to get a manicure) but with less than half the cost!</li>
            <li> It even goes nicely with other golds or blacks as a French manicure.</li>
            <li> I really like Sally Hansen nail strip, are easy to apply and with a layer of clear polish they last a week, BUT I used different models (all Sally Hansen) and after maybe 6 weeks  </li>
            <li> My strips came intact and and spanking new condition.</li>
            <li> They dry out super fast and then its a huge waste.</li>
            <li> THEY COMPLETELY FALL APART!</li>
            <li> When trying to put them on, following the instructions exactly, they ripped while taking them off the piece of plastic the came on.</li>
            <li> When putting the other ones on the were cute but only lasted one day.</li>
            <li> you have the polish in place, smooth it down well with your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were easy to apply but if you have trouble polishing the hand that you don&#x27;t write with then</li>
            <li> They require a little more effort than that (takes me about 1/2 an hour on average), but the results I get are well worth it.</li>
            <li> Fast forward about a year and change: I have been religiously taking care of my nails for about 6 weeks now, and they are much longer, stronger and generally, well-groomed.</li>
            <li> I will say this: my mother is a frequent user of this product and has had more hits than misses, but those few bad boxes greatly discouraged her from continuing to purchase them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used both a solid color and a pattern, and thus far both feel like real nail polish to me, not plastic-y stickers.</li>
            <li> to apply&lt;br /&gt;--Mine stayed in for about 7-8 days (I did go swimming once) but did use a clear coat</li>
            <li> I have purchased these before in store but paid nearly four times the price I paid for this set.</li>
            <li> A topcoat is not necessary, but it really does help extend the life of these things.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the reviews and I had very low expectations, I think because what works for most people&#x27;s nails usually doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> While pretty and inexpensive, these were not very durable.  </li>
            <li> Most strips are long enough that you can use them for two nails if you cut them in half.</li>
            <li> Product was received in new condition and earlier than exspected.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ease of use and fast application, as well as no time to wait around to dry or get smudged</li>
            <li> So beware that you can only get one use for the price, which is a bit much for only one use.  </li>
            <li> I bought them on a whim when they first came out, not expecting them to be any better than regular nail polish, which, on me, is just about useless.</li>
            <li> I spent most of the time filing them down and even when I pushed the cuticles back</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I priced these at the local Target and they were running $8 for a single box, so needless to say these are a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of polish strips before and they pale in comparison - the polish was sheerer and they lasted a day or two at most.</li>
            <li> The other nail-sticker thing by OPI is the same exact way.</li>
            <li> Finally a polish with style that will last for several days on your natural nails.</li>
            <li> any case, I have learned a few things about making these polish strips work to the max, for those interested in giving them a try.</li>
            <li> First off, when I went to remove them from the package, the pull tab on the back pulled down, but left the plastic seal in place.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ll probably get at least another day or two out of them (making this at least a 7-day mani), which is truly amazing to</li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t be just one random one, it will be the whole box that has a tearing problem) and then they start peeling almost right away.  </li>
            <li> Got them on at the first try, the shipping was incredibly fast, the sizes for the nails are a bit weird</li>
            <li> So far, as of day 6, they haven&#x27;t actually chipped but rather just worn away slightly around the edges of about 1/2 of my nails.</li>
            <li> They do take time to apply, but do last quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> Fifth: It took me 10 minutes of rubbing hard with pure ACETONE to get them removed from only FIVE fingers!</li>
            <li> It tends to peel, but if you use a clear coat after it will last a little longer.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that if I put a coat of clear polish over them they can last a little longer even.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the second set can dry out and not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was worried that my hair would go under them and peel them loose in the shower- no such problem.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried these polish strips, I was initially skeptical but ended up being very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful when you actually place them on your nail.  </li>
            <li> These were old and dried up, could not use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful and your nails are short, you can use 1 strip for 2 nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have been totally spoiled  for any other nail product.</li>
            <li> These SALLY HANSEN strips are also MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> I do not have very long nails</li>
            <li> /&gt;*They are instantly dry - no waking up in the morning with smudges!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The single packs come with two sets.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Nails last at least 7 days (they probably last longer, but I have to keep my nails very short for my sport, so I have to change nail polish once</li>
            <li> Without using a base or topcoat though, I was able to remove the solid color ones no problem with regular polish remover.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how people have had problems with these chipping after a few days, I have had them on for 6 days and there is not a single chip!</li>
            <li> i bought the black lace and my skin turned blue.</li>
            <li> If u have short nails just cut the strips in half</li>
            <li> I have on the black and white polka dots</li>
            <li> While there is no \\&quot;drying time\\&quot; per se, they do need to set on your nails and they will harden slightly once properly applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those who tried to reuse, remember to place strips back in tightly sealed  ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> But when this product is old the adhesive becomes ruined and hard to try to use.</li>
            <li> it peels off sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I usually use a sticker on one nail only so it stands out...</li>
            <li> These strips go for 9.99 at other stores for just one pack.</li>
            <li> At that time, my nails were short and weak, and regular manicures -</li>
            <li> BUY THE OTHER BRAND</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40+ woman and am not interested in skulls and tattoo art on my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I have used similar products from different companies, and know that they should have lasted at least a few days before they began to deteriorate.</li>
            <li> I pressed it down, and it sort of stayed in place.</li>
            <li> I read various previous reviews where people had trouble with the application, however I had very little trouble.  </li>
            <li> I cut each one in half and use it on 2 nails.</li>
            <li> I try to press the polish strip over the edge of my nail and then file off the excess from slightly under the nail.</li>
            <li> You can get all you need including polish for less then $20.00 on amazon.</li>
            <li> they peel off a little if you play with your finger nails a lot.</li>
            <li> The polish did split a little where my pointer finger nail bends, but none whatsoever came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also find that it helps to rub the strips a little bit between your fingers before applying them.</li>
            <li> They are NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!</li>
            <li> you might have a lil trouble applying these.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend waiting a few hours before applying a topcoat.</li>
            <li> I have read so many reviews of these on other websites saying they chip, they&#x27;re awful, etc.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be lazy just polish your nails</li>
            <li> My nails are thin and any nail polish I used chipped within two days - sometimes they chipped in less than one day.</li>
            <li> also, they are hard to take off with nail polish.</li>
            <li> but the biggest complaint is the difficulty of removing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the people who would like to see less flashy patters, the zebra and leopard are tacky and hideous.</li>
            <li> but the colors mixed and stained my hands badly.</li>
            <li> I am very hard on my hands -</li>
            <li> It was frustrating and upsetting trying to use these.</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a regular basecoat, I WOULD recommend using a bonding basecoat (like Orly Bonder, Essie FirstBase or CND Sticky Base).</li>
            <li> THEY DON&#x27;T. Three days after applying these worthless strips, they were chipping and coming off like regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Getting manicures has always been a disappointment for me ever since I removed my acrylic.</li>
            <li> but after about 8 days the tips were chipping making it look bad.</li>
            <li> If you are expecting to slap these on and go, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-removal is almost impossible!!</li>
            <li> They were the WORST experience EVER.</li>
            <li> They chipped almost immediately around the edges, but it wasn&#x27;t terribly noticeable because of the pattern.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> She like this because of it&#x27;s ease of use and fast application, as well as no time to wait around to dry or get smudged</li>
            <li> Sometimes Salon Effects nails go on smoothly and stay on for nearly two weeks (sometimes longer) and look fabulous and snag compliments and all that jazz.  Sometimes they tear when applied (and it won&#x27;t be just one random one, it will be the whole box that has a tearing problem) and then they start peeling almost right away.  It depends entirely on the box.  I will say this: my mother is a frequent user of this product and has had more hits than misses, but those few bad boxes greatly discouraged her from continuing to purchase them.  I think they are great if you can get a good deal on them because then if you do get a dud box (perhaps a box that sat in back stock for too long, or something like that) then it&#x27;s not such a financial loss.</li>
            <li> This is the best stick on nail polish I have ever used. I love getting it in twin packs. It lasted for 3 weeks, and I had to take it off only because it grew out. It never came off. The seller is very prompt delivering. I will definitely get more of these.</li>
            <li> Easier to put on than i thought.  however, it just doesn&#x27;t look great. it lacks the sheen of a regular nail polish and no where in the instructions do they tell you to put on a top coat. it peels off sooner than expected. but the biggest complaint is the difficulty of removing. yes you do it with regular nail polish remover but the colors mixed and stained my hands badly. i bought the black lace and my skin turned blue. removing the blue from my cuticles and hands was difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would not use again</li>
            <li> Product was received in new condition and earlier than exspected.  They do take time to apply, but do last quite a long time.  Received many comments.  The twin pack is a great value, and will not buy from the box stores any longer.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the sally hensen polish strips! They look great on your nails instantly dry stays on for a while without great use of your nails, and absolutely so easy to use, comes off with nailpolish remover (glitter ones are a little harder to get off) great and funky colors, I would reduce the price so more people buy them because the single ones are less expensive in the stores!!</li>
            <li> These strips are great, and they do last a long time but you can only get one use out of them.  The first time I used them was great and they stayed on for almost 3 weeks with me keeping my hands in water a lot, once I tried to use the remaining strips they would not stick they just broke into pieces.  I don&#x27;t know if it was because they remained out of the package or if my room was to warm.  So beware that you can only get one use for the price, which is a bit much for only one use.  I tried two different packages and they did the same thing.</li>
            <li> These seemed to be a little thinner and took a bit more care to apply, but once they&#x27;re on they looked great and lasted over two weeks - my nails grew out faster than these wore out!  I&#x27;ve tried many Salon Effects and these are my favorite overall.  Will gladly buy again.</li>
            <li> I love Sally hansen Salon effects.I use them all the time:)</li>
            <li> These are a lifesaver, I love these, 20 minutes and you have new gorgeous nails. They are so easy to apply, just make sure you clean the nailbed free of cuticles, and a definite buff and polish with the nail file beforehand, wipe clean with nail polish remover and you are ready to apply. I do not have very long nails so I actually use one pack twice (as there are 2 individually wrapped packs in each. I cut each one in half and use it on 2 nails. I have ordered these to keep in stock, great to put on anywhere, and no drying time!</li>
            <li> Came as described, wearing the \\&quot;Laced Up\\&quot; strips and they look AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth getting it online for 3$ for 2 instead of what I would get anywhere else for 20!</li>
            <li> I love both of these designs and this brand had always worked perfectly for me in the past, but when I put on the fishnet ones, one of the two packages had a hole in it and nearly half of the strips were dried out completely. I was lucky enough to make the others stick on to my fingers, but they chipped really easily.</li>
            <li> Amazed at only paying $4.12 for 2 designs when each design ranges from $8-$10 in stores. I bought a total of 2 boxes (4 designs) and only payed $11.90 Yes shipping and handling was a part of that final price. Alot better than paying like $35-$40  for exact same order in store. My strips came intact and and spanking new condition. For those who tried to reuse, remember to place strips back in tightly sealed  ziplock bag. Remember the nail polish dries out if left out and any laquer would do. I also added sally hansens diamond flash 60 second top coat with strengthener. Im sooo amazed! If u have short nails just cut the strips in half so u can get double use. :) Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I tried these for the first time and I LOVE them already.  I read various previous reviews where people had trouble with the application, however I had very little trouble.  If you take your time and follow the directions, they go on beautifully.  You do have to be careful when you actually place them on your nail.  I found it best to bend them a little to suit the shape of my nail, then lay it on similar to how you would an acrylic.  I topped it with 2 coats of Sally Hansen Super Shine Tope Coat and I am thrilled!  I was worried that my hair would go under them and peel them loose in the shower- no such problem.  I&#x27;ve also done light housework and they are holding up well.  Yesterday, I priced these at the local Target and they were running $8 for a single box, so needless to say these are a great deal.  I WILL be buying more.  It gives the salon look for a much better price.</li>
            <li> Loved the pair of designs. I do wish {though I understand why they wouldn&#x27;t} that they would put more in the pack. The single packs come with two sets. The twin pack came with one set of each.</li>
            <li> This nail strips only last 4 or 5 days. I did not like it at all. But the shipping was great and on time.</li>
            <li> HUGE WASTE OF MONEY! THEY COMPLETELY FALL APART! I AM SO UPSET ABOUT THIS ORDER, DO NOT BUY!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, stays for up to two weeks. Just make sure to clean your nails with nail polish remover before you apply the stickers on the nail. If you cut them in half, you have a better use of them, but make sure your nails are not too long for this.</li>
            <li> love buying these, they work wonderfully. if I were you and you love changing your nails, these are good to buy</li>
            <li> I loved the misbehaved pattern but not the lace. This takes time to apply but will look great and last for about a week depending on what kind of work you do with your hands. I am a waitress and it lasted a week without chipping for me which is outstanding!</li>
            <li> These strips, especially the lacey ones, were my favorite. For such a really cheap product, they looked very nice. I will continue using these in the future.</li>
            <li> i am not the user of this but the g/f loves these things and gave it 5 starts. she has many of these collected in her make up box. guess she really does love them</li>
            <li> These were old and dried up, could not use.</li>
            <li> This is great if you just need it for a few days.  It tends to peel, but if you use a clear coat after it will last a little longer.</li>
            <li> Sure it lasts longer than the leading nail polish, but this stuff still tends to chip fairly easily around the tips and the cuticle. I&#x27;ll still buy it though.</li>
            <li> I usually use a sticker on one nail only so it stands out... Look beautiful with black nail polish... I also did a nude color and everyone complimented how gorgeous they looked... Love it!</li>
            <li> good, they work. they peel off a little if you play with your finger nails a lot. also, they are hard to take off with nail polish. however, they look good</li>
            <li> Get some ooh la la for your nails. Take some time to learn how to correctly apply, but very easy once you figure it out. Just place, shape with file and go about your day- or night. Looks great. Recommend clear top coat to extend wear. Share your flair and style your nails to suit your outfit and personality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how people have had problems with these chipping after a few days, I have had them on for 6 days and there is not a single chip! I was very careful about wiping my nail with polish remover to remove any residue, I would suggest that you do the same for the best results. The polish did split a little where my pointer finger nail bends, but none whatsoever came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were easy as pie to put on, I was in a rush the first time I tried them and had them done in about 15 minutes (with no dry time!). They look smooth, shiny and just about as good as a salon manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a little pricey in the store (I got them at Target on clearance, but the regular price is almost $9), but this value twin pack is a great deal. They&#x27;re more expensive than a bottle of polish, but cheaper than a manicure. If you&#x27;re careful and your nails are short, you can use 1 strip for 2 nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are probably better than any manicure or polish I&#x27;ve ever had. NEVER has my polish lasted with zero chips for this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the people who would like to see less flashy patters, the zebra and leopard are tacky and hideous. I have on the black and white polka dots and I get compliments all the time. Some geometric patterns with more subtle colors would be great.</li>
            <li> This is 99% the ONLY brand I use for basic nail cover. You can get more time than they say even. It just depends on how fast your nails grow. I use a good base and then cover it with a nice top coat to get more out of the look. I like the &amp;#34;Misbehaved&amp;#34; better. It even goes nicely with other golds or blacks as a French manicure. Just make sure to MATCH the KIND of gold or black that you&#x27;re using with it because they all have different sheens to them.</li>
            <li> I really like Sally Hansen nail strip, are easy to apply and with a layer of clear polish they last a week, BUT I used different models (all Sally Hansen) and after maybe 6 weeks  my nails were really damaged they just break in a funy way (vertically), so now I stop using nail strips till my nails grow for like a moth and then I will use this only for special occasions. But they really looks good, I got a lot of complements!</li>
            <li> Thanks demand is excellent and I liked it a lot and will re-application of this product so much and thank you again</li>
            <li> I have purchased these before in store but paid nearly four times the price I paid for this set. They are both beautiful designs!</li>
            <li> lasts a solid week or two on hands</li>
            <li> I have read so many reviews of these on other websites saying they chip, they&#x27;re awful, etc. My first experience has been great so far. Got them on at the first try, the shipping was incredibly fast, the sizes for the nails are a bit weird but that&#x27;s Sally Hansen&#x27;s issue. I more than likely will buy again :)</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS WORK MY 12YRD AND SHE LOVED IT, THEY WERE SHIPPED QUIKLY AND GAVE ME NO PROBLEMS. KIDS LOVE THEM AND I THINK ADULTS WOULD AS WELL!</li>
            <li> Love these strips! Easy to apply, realy long lasting, great designs, and you can not beat this price.  These strips go for 9.99 at other stores for just one pack.</li>
            <li> These salon effects are perfect for a quick manicure and pedicure, very simple and easy to do and they work great for anyone who wants to do their nails for any event.</li>
            <li> These things are awesome! They were easy to apply but if you have trouble polishing the hand that you don&#x27;t write with then you might have a lil trouble applying these. I had no problem. They offer a beautiful look (like you paid money at a salon to get a manicure) but with less than half the cost!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Sally Hansen Effects for some time now. And I really like them. But when this product is old the adhesive becomes ruined and hard to try to use. This particular twin pack is the oldest I have ever seen. It was frustrating and upsetting trying to use these.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried these polish strips, I was initially skeptical but ended up being very pleasantly surprised. I bought them on a whim when they first came out, not expecting them to be any better than regular nail polish, which, on me, is just about useless. At that time, my nails were short and weak, and regular manicures - whether I did them myself or I went to a salon, lasted a maximum of 24 hrs on me before chipping and getting utterly destroyed. I am very hard on my hands - another reviewer put it perfectly: I use my nails like a Swiss army knife! So I groomed my nails exactly per the instructions and these babies lasted 3 full days before beginning to chip (and very tiny chips at that)! I think I had to throw in the towel on them after about 5 days when they started cracking. Still, a miracle to me and only a $10 investment. Fast forward about a year and change: I have been religiously taking care of my nails for about 6 weeks now, and they are much longer, stronger and generally, well-groomed. (Nailtiques Formula 2 - it works!). I picked up a fun, patterned set at the local drug store last week, excited to try them again on my rehabilitated nails. So far, as of day 6, they haven&#x27;t actually chipped but rather just worn away slightly around the edges of about 1/2 of my nails. They still look pretty decent! I feel like I&#x27;ll probably get at least another day or two out of them (making this at least a 7-day mani), which is truly amazing to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used both a solid color and a pattern, and thus far both feel like real nail polish to me, not plastic-y stickers. I&#x27;m sure there are a couple of duds out there in every lot, but it&#x27;s to be expected. And to clarify, this item is one full set (16 strips - enough for both hands) of each pattern, not two full sets of each. Even so, they&#x27;re a very good deal considering you&#x27;ll now pay $11 a pop for them in your local drug store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I have learned a few things about making these polish strips work to the max, for those interested in giving them a try. If you are expecting to slap these on and go, you will be disappointed. They require a little more effort than that (takes me about 1/2 an hour on average), but the results I get are well worth it. Here are my tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Do the grooming part! More than pushing back your cuticles, try to get rid of peeling edges and buff the surface of your nails smooth. This will help the polish strips stick better.&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure the surface of your nails is very clean! Once you&#x27;ve done as much grooming as you want, wash your hands thoroughly - immediately before you want to apply these - and then swipe your nails with some rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;- While I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a regular basecoat, I WOULD recommend using a bonding basecoat (like Orly Bonder, Essie FirstBase or CND Sticky Base). I used Orly Bonder, which I have found very effective with regular polish. Sticky basecoat + sticky polish strips &#x3D; a longer lasting effect!&lt;br /&gt;- I also find that it helps to rub the strips a little bit between your fingers before applying them. This will make them more flexible and easier to manipulate. Also, once you apply the strips to your nails, rub them for about 15 secs or so to ensure they are really stuck.&lt;br /&gt;- I try to press the polish strip over the edge of my nail and then file off the excess from slightly under the nail. Particularly if you do use a top coat, this will help seal the polish strip over the edge of your nail, preventing it from chipping or wearing away as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;- A topcoat is not necessary, but it really does help extend the life of these things. I would also recommend waiting a few hours before applying a topcoat. While there is no \\&quot;drying time\\&quot; per se, they do need to set on your nails and they will harden slightly once properly applied.&lt;br /&gt;- I would recommend using acetone to remove these. If you find a non-acetone polish remover is not working rightaway, try acetone. Yes acetone is more damaging, but if you use a topcoat and/or basecoat with these, you&#x27;ll need a strong remover. Without using a base or topcoat though, I was able to remove the solid color ones no problem with regular polish remover. I suspect the patterned ones are more complicated since they probably have more layers of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I just love these! The patterned ones in particular are just so fun, and would cost you so much more do get done in a salon and may not last as long! I have tried other brands of polish strips before and they pale in comparison - the polish was sheerer and they lasted a day or two at most. I have also liked the Sally Hansen brand for some time and these polish strips just keep me coming back! Amazon has lots of good prices on them from reputable and well-rated sellers, so they are definitely worth a shot! Enjoy them!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! The amount of different salon looking styles you can get is great!&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;-Tons of colors and styles&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;--Mine stayed in for about 7-8 days (I did go swimming once) but did use a clear coat&lt;br /&gt;-Fit my nails well&lt;br /&gt;-I got three uses out of each box!!!!!! My nails are fairly short so for each strip of polish I could do 2 nails. So that made it even more worth it for the 5 dollars I paid compared to the 10 in stores!&lt;br /&gt;-tons cheaper than the store price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;-removal is almost impossible!! Now you might think this is a good thing but after about 8 days the tips were chipping making it look bad. So when I tried to remove with nail polish remover it took forever to get off one nail! Then I tried peeling, scraping, and filing the polish away... This worked easier and faster but left my nails a bit damaged. Not cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product for special occasions but I would not use this for every manicure I give myself because of the removal process. If your looking for something similar I would invest in a Konad nail stamping kit. You get the same salon effect but with out stickers. You can get all you need including polish for less then $20.00 on amazon. Happy nail art!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have been totally spoiled  for any other nail product. The very first Nail decor strips I used were the KISS brand. THEY WERE AWESOME.  Next I tried AVON - Not as good.  So I decided to try the Sally Hansen brand, as they are number one in Nail Care products.  They were the WORST experience EVER. First off, when I went to remove them from the package, the pull tab on the back pulled down, but left the plastic seal in place. So I had to get out the scissors to cut the box open.  Second; I prepped my nails as per the instruction. peeled the backing off the nail strip, and went to apply it to the nail. IT WASN&#x27;T Sticky! I pressed it down, and it sort of stayed in place. I got out the next nail strip, started to peel the plastic off it, and in the process, it tore crookedly into the nail strip, so that one was shot and not usable. Went for another... It did the same thing! So I decided to remove the plastic from the opposite end,got better results there. IT TOOK ME 45 MINUTES TO GET 10 FINGERNAILS COVERED with all the fussing around. Three: The directions say to stretch the nail strip over the end of the nail, which I did, and it promptly broke off halfway up the nail. So, DO NOT stretch the strip unless you want it to break off mid-nail. Fourth: the box says they last UP TO 10 Days... NO THEY DON&#x27;T. Three days after applying these worthless strips, they were chipping and coming off like regular nail polish. Fifth: It took me 10 minutes of rubbing hard with pure ACETONE to get them removed from only FIVE fingers! This is ridiculous! If you want NICE, Long Lasting, Easy to apply AND REMOVE Nail dressings, USE THE KISS brand! They are superb, and have lasted me up to 2 weeks, and are EASY to get off and EASY to apply! These SALLY HANSEN strips are also MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE! They are NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY! MY Recommendation?:  BUY THE OTHER BRAND</li>
            <li> These work great and the instructions are easy to follow. These darker designs are great for winter months. I get tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> I love these polishes and misbehaved is my absolute favorite color by salon effects. It&#x27;s a great wear if you use a top coat and can be on our nails for up to 10 days chip free if the top coat is reapplied.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Sally Hansen nail strips (and Incoco nail strips)!  Finally, I can have painted nails!  My nails are thin and any nail polish I used chipped within two days - sometimes they chipped in less than one day. I bought these based on the reviews and I had very low expectations, I think because what works for most people&#x27;s nails usually doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, the first trial didn&#x27;t go well.  They chipped almost immediately around the edges, but it wasn&#x27;t terribly noticeable because of the pattern.  The rest of the polish stayed on nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second trial was much better- I learned how to smooth the edges better so no chips.  After 7 applications, I thought I&#x27;d write a review - it&#x27;s FOR REAL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;*Nails last at least 7 days (they probably last longer, but I have to keep my nails very short for my sport, so I have to change nail polish once a week)&lt;br /&gt;*The patterns make my short nails look feminine&lt;br /&gt;*They are instantly dry - no waking up in the morning with smudges!!!&lt;br /&gt;*They are affordable - I get TWO applications from each box because my nails are short&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DOWNSIDE:&lt;br /&gt;*Taking the nail polish off is a process - have plenty of nail polish remover on hand and patience, too.&lt;br /&gt;*Putting the nail strips on takes longer than painting nails. (If you count dry-time the strips are faster than regular polish, but the application time is longer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SALLY HANSEN VS. INCOCO&lt;br /&gt;*Sally Hansen&#x27;s strips come in TWO separate pouches, so I can have two applications.  Incoco&#x27;s strips come in one pouch that can be resealed.  Sometimes the second set can dry out and not work.&lt;br /&gt;*Sally Hansen&#x27;s strips are often available on Prime so you can get them faster (and cheaper) than Incoco&#x27;s strips&lt;br /&gt;*Incoco&#x27;s big advantage is tasteful designs.  Some are just gorgeous. I&#x27;m a 40+ woman and am not interested in skulls and tattoo art on my fingers.  Most of Sally Hansen&#x27;s patterns are targeted at teens.  Incoco&#x27;s designs are beautiful and more appropriate for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS FOR A SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION&lt;br /&gt;*Make sure the room is WARM.  I turn on a space heater.&lt;br /&gt;*Once you have the polish in place, smooth it down well with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;*Make sure to smooth the tips well - any rough edges will &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on fabric and chip&lt;br /&gt;*Apply a clear top coat within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;*Apply a second top coat after 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Sally Hansen Salon Effects products! These look amazing with lacy dresses and tops. Most strips are long enough that you can use them for two nails if you cut them in half.</li>
            <li> These things are 8.50 and they do not stick at all. I followed the instructions to a &#x27;T&#x27;. I spent most of the time filing them down and even when I pushed the cuticles back they still overlapped my cuticles or didn&#x27;t cover enough. Don&#x27;t be lazy just polish your nails (that&#x27;s the lesson I have learned).</li>
            <li> Finally a polish with style that will last for several days on your natural nails. Getting manicures has always been a disappointment for me ever since I removed my acrylic. These polish strips may not look 100% for 10 days but it definitely lasts longer than any polish I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> My friends wear these and they look really cute so I decided to buy them. When trying to put them on, following the instructions exactly, they ripped while taking them off the piece of plastic the came on. All of them ripped so I couldn&#x27;t even wear the ace ones. When putting the other ones on the were cute but only lasted one day. They all pealed off the next day which I don&#x27;t think should happen. They day they were on they were really cute though.</li>
            <li> While pretty and inexpensive, these were not very durable.  They began to chip/tear off within the first hour of applying them.  I have used similar products from different companies, and know that they should have lasted at least a few days before they began to deteriorate.</li>
            <li> These were priced so low how could you not buy them? I love these things! They go on so easy and you can do dishes right afterward. They last almost a full two weeks and I have noticed that if I put a coat of clear polish over them they can last a little longer even.</li>
            <li> What they don&#x27;t tell you is DO NOT OPEN THESE UNLESS YOU ARE ABOUT TO USE THEM. They dry out super fast and then its a huge waste. The ones I got to use went on and came off easily but I would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> Salon Effects will only last one day without a top coat of clear nail polish, or maybe two to three days with the top coat. The other nail-sticker thing by OPI is the same exact way.</li>
            <li> this was really good for its price. there isnt really much of a difference from the store bought ones so this on is pretty good</li>
            <li> I love the design on these nail colors.  I haven&#x27;t yet tackled my fingernails but I love these for my toenails.</li>
