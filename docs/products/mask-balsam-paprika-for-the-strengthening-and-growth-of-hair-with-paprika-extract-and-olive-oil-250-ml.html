            <li>So happy to have it.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t that great either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like steaming your face and putting a great mask after it.</li>
            <li>Package it better please!!</li>
            <li>Package it better please!!</li>
            <li>I really liked this one!</li>
            <li>If you have any kind of shedding, this product stops it in its track!</li>
            <li>My hair really warm, but in a good way!</li>
            <li>This is some good stuff</li>
            <li>It was a really good hair mask.</li>
            <li>but it works good</li>
            <li>nothing else in the world that I have tried conditions my hair as good as this one.</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>I like the way it tingles and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product does BURN and its a GOOD BURN.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my scalp feel - very warm sensation and the smell is great.  </li>
            <li>Hair becomes more beautiful, shiny, silky and you see GROWTH.</li>
            <li>But, I believe, it is good on it&#x27;s own as well.</li>
            <li>I did not experience this burning sensation that I&#x27;m seeing a lot of comments about, it was more of a very warm sensation.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>But it sure looks and feels healthier and thicker already!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t yet know if it will make my hair grow but reading about cayenne pepper and making your own cayenna pepper oil to make it grow</li>
            <li>but I like the idea of making my own now.</li>
            <li>It had a nice smell and gave my hair a lot of volume.</li>
            <li>After about 3 minute it began to warm my scalp and after about 6-7 minutes</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a really nice smell but bearable.  </li>
            <li>Really nice product</li>
            <li>Ok I am going to be perfectly honest.</li>
            <li>I am AA and was 6 months post relaxer when I purchased this product and my new growth and texlax hair loved it!</li>
            <li>But I figured maybe I need more time, but I had things to do, and while rinsing it, it made my hair so silky</li>
            <li>sure</li>
            <li>Wish there was more product</li>
            <li>Then, I&#x27;ll be able to better understand if it worked for me.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Love this, you can feel your scalp burning, but not to a point where it&#x27;s not tolerable.</li>
            <li>I love this hair mask,it&#x27;s doing wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to know what it feels like with your hair out all day.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;balsam/paprika is my favorite, it kicks a</li>
            <li>and it feels thicker and healthy after I use it.</li>
            <li>Love the tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>Nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of circulation</li>
            <li>so I can donate it to Locks of Love.</li>
            <li>From the way it feels, I am sure this product will stimulate hair growth.</li>
            <li>a lovely  mask  </li>
            <li>and at a lovely price.</li>
            <li>I chose to buy this product because I&#x27;ve fallen in love with their hair products and wanted to give this a try</li>
            <li>This conditioner does a great job keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful and love it.</li>
            <li>After the first use, my hair is sooo much better!</li>
            <li>I thought people were &amp;#34;confusing&amp;#34; it for the cooling feeling peppermint does, you know kind of like icey hot, but no, I have to give credit</li>
            <li>I try to do a cap full of each product and slightly more water.</li>
            <li>Honestly though I&#x27;d buy it again, I really like that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair all greasy</li>
            <li>the fact that this burns, opens up your pores, therefore, whatever treatments and / or conditioners you use on your head is absorbed better in your scalp (which feeds your hair).</li>
            <li>the fact that this burns, opens up your pores, therefore, whatever treatments and / or conditioners you use on your head is absorbed better in your scalp (which feeds your hair).</li>
            <li>: So far so good, the mask did stimulate my scalp &amp; tingled, I&#x27;ll continue to use and see how things go.</li>
            <li>I would apply this mask, wash it out, and add your usual hair oils to achieve the best results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the burn!</li>
            <li>put this on first (the longer the better</li>
            <li>Because it can heat up pretty darn good, but I love spices eating or apparently on my head.</li>
            <li>It changed my hair,now my hair is healthy not breaking and growing really fast</li>
            <li>its not a painful burn just discomforting</li>
            <li>but after about 5-7 minutes it was full on</li>
            <li>I rinsed well with cool water</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone UNLESS spices are not your thing, if peppers bother you incredibly quickly then don&#x27;t get this or if you think you can handle it.</li>
            <li>My DD loves this product and has me consistently reordering it as it really has made her hair grow very quickly!</li>
            <li>Makes hair super shiny, brings out hairs natural highlights, lovely smell.</li>
            <li>Amazing, will definitely reorder..</li>
            <li>Golden - Powerful Skin and Hair Moisturizer - 4 fl.oz.&lt;br /&gt;Hesh</li>
            <li>I am going to order me some more of this stuff, it is the real deal, and yes, it BURNS to the high heavens</li>
            <li>thinking when I first applied it, it wasn&#x27;t getting hot, but wait for it!</li>
            <li>then it says, like 40-50 min, and ur hair super smooth, shiny, moisturized, soft.</li>
            <li>I just received the item todAy,so shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>: Arrived before the anticipated date, very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t feel any heat on my head.</li>
            <li>or maybe I just had really hot water that I couldnt feel it until 5 minutes after my shower.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what is described about it.</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t get so damn hot</li>
            <li>Love it, wish the jar came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it really made my hair grow but felt great and conditioning on the scalp.</li>
            <li>ok just as a regular rinse after shampoo, I find it does not have strength to help my hair grow.</li>
            <li>It really make hair grow faster!</li>
            <li>My sides are shaved and in the middle is slightly more (a mohawk)</li>
            <li>also make sure I do this in the middle of the day or in the morning</li>
            <li>UNTIL I put the shower cap on and now its hot all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>UNTIL I put the shower cap on and now its hot all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is helping me not to worry so much about it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely order again and use it in conjunction with the shampoo :)</li>
            <li>Also leaves a funny feeling in my nasal passages for some reason.</li>
            <li>first I tried leaving it on for 5 minutes---felt nothing.</li>
            <li>so what I can tell you is that if you can&#x27;t handle spices at all DON&#x27;T TOUCH IT, the product does heat up your scalp a little bit which is a GOOD THING, because opening up my pores on my head allows me to rinse it out afterwards and place another conditioner on it to really soak up.</li>
            <li>okay, 1 cm...does not sound like much, but it is for one week!!!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t shed as much and its much softer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I got a good batch.  </li>
            <li>I would high recommend this and will be ordering more in the future...</li>
            <li>Oil Pure Premium</li>
            <li>I didnt see too much shine or softbess in my hair</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>After shampooing my hair I used this and applied it to my scalp, then gently massaged it in.</li>
            <li>I really hope they do not stop selling this stuff, because there is nothing else out on the market like it, that I know of.....</li>
            <li>I really hope they do not stop selling this stuff, because there is nothing else out on the market like it, that I know of.....</li>
            <li>really helped my ahir to grow</li>
            <li>I am AA with relaxed hair and this product really does stimulate the scalp.</li>
            <li>However, I did not feel much of a burn.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>It is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>...I mean burn in a good way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I saw hair growth within a month of using it, and recommend highly, and certainly will use it again.  </li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of rose &amp; hot peppers mixed, nothing extreme and</li>
            <li>I love it makes my dry hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my hair is SUPER SHORT</li>
            <li>I hate my hair being this short but knew it was the best choice if I wanted my hair to grow healthy and natural.</li>
            <li>The only concern is that you have to make sure you keep your eyes closed with rinsing it out; and, as time goes, on the heat is not as intense as in the beginning.</li>
            <li>However make sure you wash your hair out a few times as if this stays and gets on your skin</li>
            <li>Things started off slow but the paprika did warm up to the reviews that I read about...</li>
            <li>I leave this on for about 30-50 min and make sure you put it in wet hair, not dry.</li>
            <li>The only issue was the Mask-Balsam Paprika&#x27;s top was loose, some of the product spilled into the box.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I find other regular conditioners doing better work.</li>
            <li>(but I like it, for the most part, because it feels like a heating pad on your head, however last night when I applied it, REALLY REALLY burned, but I still could take it)because as black female that used to get perms, I am used to burning...and thats what it feels like a perm that burns,</li>
            <li>so so soft after I rinse this out.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair, but it is colored.  </li>
            <li>Balsam Paprika mask leaves hair soft and silky after use.</li>
            <li>like I knew I didnt want to go COMPLETELY bald, so I chopped all my hair</li>
            <li>My scalp felt tingly and it made my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>I did my \\&quot;big chop\\&quot; in January 2013 because while I had a decent length of hair, it was severley damaged from me not taking care of it like I should.</li>
            <li>One more thing, I didnt have time to actually twist my hair into knots last night, so I did put knots using the little rubberbands again, but GET this, where is the last time I had like 10-15 little knots all over my head, because I was trying to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; hair if that makes sense, last night when I did it, I only have like 5 or 6, because my hair has grown that I can grab MORE hair per knot if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before I go any further, let me state that my hair is completley natural.</li>
            <li>I am a multiracial young model who is constantly doing shows and my hair is always being fried.</li>
            <li>I think I just waste my money, like really !</li>
            <li>t night, so I did put knots using the little rubberbands again, but GET this, where is the last time I had like 10-15 little knots all over my head, because I was trying to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; hair if that makes sense, last night when I did it, I only have like 5 or 6, because my hair has grown that I can grab MORE hair per knot if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; sensation on my scalp is a little much.</li>

            <li> thinking when I first applied it, it wasn&#x27;t getting hot, but wait for it!</li>
            <li> then it says, like 40-50 min, and ur hair super smooth, shiny, moisturized, soft.</li>
            <li> I just received the item todAy,so shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> : Arrived before the anticipated date, very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t feel any heat on my head.</li>
            <li> or maybe I just had really hot water that I couldnt feel it until 5 minutes after my shower.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is described about it.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t get so damn hot</li>
            <li> Love it, wish the jar came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really made my hair grow but felt great and conditioning on the scalp.</li>
            <li> ok just as a regular rinse after shampoo, I find it does not have strength to help my hair grow.</li>
            <li> It really make hair grow faster!</li>
            <li> My sides are shaved and in the middle is slightly more (a mohawk)</li>
            <li> also make sure I do this in the middle of the day or in the morning</li>
            <li> UNTIL I put the shower cap on and now its hot all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> UNTIL I put the shower cap on and now its hot all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is helping me not to worry so much about it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely order again and use it in conjunction with the shampoo :)</li>
            <li> Also leaves a funny feeling in my nasal passages for some reason.</li>
            <li> first I tried leaving it on for 5 minutes---felt nothing.</li>
            <li> so what I can tell you is that if you can&#x27;t handle spices at all DON&#x27;T TOUCH IT, the product does heat up your scalp a little bit which is a GOOD THING, because opening up my pores on my head allows me to rinse it out afterwards and place another conditioner on it to really soak up.</li>
            <li> okay, 1 cm...does not sound like much, but it is for one week!!!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t shed as much and its much softer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a good batch.  </li>
            <li> I would high recommend this and will be ordering more in the future...</li>
            <li> Oil Pure Premium</li>
            <li> I didnt see too much shine or softbess in my hair</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> After shampooing my hair I used this and applied it to my scalp, then gently massaged it in.</li>
            <li> I really hope they do not stop selling this stuff, because there is nothing else out on the market like it, that I know of.....</li>
            <li> I really hope they do not stop selling this stuff, because there is nothing else out on the market like it, that I know of.....</li>
            <li> really helped my ahir to grow</li>
            <li> I am AA with relaxed hair and this product really does stimulate the scalp.</li>
            <li> However, I did not feel much of a burn.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> It is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> ...I mean burn in a good way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I saw hair growth within a month of using it, and recommend highly, and certainly will use it again.  </li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of rose &amp; hot peppers mixed, nothing extreme and</li>
            <li> I love it makes my dry hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my hair is SUPER SHORT</li>
            <li> I hate my hair being this short but knew it was the best choice if I wanted my hair to grow healthy and natural.</li>
            <li> The only concern is that you have to make sure you keep your eyes closed with rinsing it out; and, as time goes, on the heat is not as intense as in the beginning.</li>
            <li> However make sure you wash your hair out a few times as if this stays and gets on your skin</li>
            <li> Things started off slow but the paprika did warm up to the reviews that I read about...</li>
            <li> I leave this on for about 30-50 min and make sure you put it in wet hair, not dry.</li>
            <li> The only issue was the Mask-Balsam Paprika&#x27;s top was loose, some of the product spilled into the box.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I find other regular conditioners doing better work.</li>
            <li> (but I like it, for the most part, because it feels like a heating pad on your head, however last night when I applied it, REALLY REALLY burned, but I still could take it)because as black female that used to get perms, I am used to burning...and thats what it feels like a perm that burns,</li>
            <li> so so soft after I rinse this out.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, but it is colored.  </li>
            <li> Balsam Paprika mask leaves hair soft and silky after use.</li>
            <li> like I knew I didnt want to go COMPLETELY bald, so I chopped all my hair</li>
            <li> My scalp felt tingly and it made my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> I did my \\&quot;big chop\\&quot; in January 2013 because while I had a decent length of hair, it was severley damaged from me not taking care of it like I should.</li>
            <li> One more thing, I didnt have time to actually twist my hair into knots last night, so I did put knots using the little rubberbands again, but GET this, where is the last time I had like 10-15 little knots all over my head, because I was trying to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; hair if that makes sense, last night when I did it, I only have like 5 or 6, because my hair has grown that I can grab MORE hair per knot if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I go any further, let me state that my hair is completley natural.</li>
            <li> I am a multiracial young model who is constantly doing shows and my hair is always being fried.</li>
            <li> I think I just waste my money, like really !</li>
            <li> t night, so I did put knots using the little rubberbands again, but GET this, where is the last time I had like 10-15 little knots all over my head, because I was trying to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; hair if that makes sense, last night when I did it, I only have like 5 or 6, because my hair has grown that I can grab MORE hair per knot if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; sensation on my scalp is a little much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never left my hair out exposed to the elements for too long</li>
            <li> I am a black female, that recently did what is called a \\&quot;big chop\\</li>
            <li> then re-solidified as if it were a little old.</li>
            <li> and this time I had the time to let it sit for 30 mins, but I didn&#x27;t need to wait that long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> , I can actually TWIST my hair (even in the back, and I cut the back a little shorter than the front)!</li>
            <li> am a black female with natural tight coiled hair curls</li>
            <li> one of the other customers for this product said they did a big chop).</li>
            <li> The winter is doing a number on my hair - extremely dry and brittle this year.  </li>
            <li> Dry, frizzy and falling out!</li>
            <li> : I ordered 3 products, all came in the same box (tightly taped brown box).</li>
            <li> I have been using different products and my hair has been growing back at an ok rate(i am one of those people that hair grows slowly), HOWEVER after my second application of this after washing my hair, and applying little tiny knots in my hair, when I went to wash my hair yesterday, my hair had grown at least 1-1.5 cm!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling/burning that was spoken about, and I left it in for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to monitor what my hair is doing over the next few weeks.  </li>
            <li> the color is light/pail pink in color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(After showering hair should be wet)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sleeping with wet or oily hear.</li>
            <li> thats why I had to use the tiny black rubberbands and place in little knots all over my head, however when i took my hair out of the knots to wash my hair yesterday</li>
            <li> where it is due-</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a miracle product by any means, but I do feel it helps with the absorption of other hair treatments.</li>
            <li> In fact, only used it a couple of times and was not satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> When I use it I do not  need any other products to put in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m just waiting to see if any results other than the warming effect take place.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick but is curly and wavy in different sections for my hair.</li>
            <li> The product cap was taped down with packing tape, and when I opened the jar there wasn&#x27;t a seal.</li>
            <li> The package exploded in the mail though, so half of it was on the bag when I received it.</li>
            <li> Isle Living Jamaican Coconut Black Castor Oil 4oz</li>
            <li> I noticed less shedding too.  </li>
            <li> This is just an expensive lotion that has absolutely no benefit other than a simple conditioner, which any lotion can do.  </li>
            <li> The bottom was a little dirty/dusty as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it myself but just might as I&#x27;m trying to grow my locks a little longer</li>
            <li> No lie, I have a set of twins, and when I took my hair out my the little knots, they were like mommy</li>
            <li> Product burns a little.</li>
            <li> Mix all the products with a little water so my hair isn&#x27;t to oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> I was feeling a little bad, like aww man</li>
            <li> I noticed a few people saying it did not burn.</li>
            <li> I shampooed as usual, applied a generous amount from scalp to ends, and massaged it in.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working but not sure yet.</li>
            <li> I have (for the past 4 days)</li>
            <li> I did not feel a burn for the first few minutes applying it and leaving it on (I thought this crap didn&#x27;t work)</li>
            <li> I did not feel a burn for the first few minutes applying it and leaving it on (I thought this crap didn&#x27;t work)</li>
            <li> I used this at least a year or two ago.</li>
            <li> It is part of my anti-hair loss treatment mask (1 tbsp of this mas+ 1 egg yolk+2 tbsp of mustard powder+ 2 tbsp of burdock oil+1tsp of water) that I apply at least once/week for an hour</li>
            <li> When people say heat, they mean it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it to my scalp in a thin layer, and a thick layer, massaging my scalp, leaving it on for an hour... nothing.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all with this product.</li>
            <li> Will keep buying since im already obsessed with it .</li>
            <li> if its NOT BURNING then your doing SOMETHING WRONG.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately there was no burn or tingling.  </li>

            <li> It cleared up a really bad case of dandruff.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t that disappointed.</li>
            <li> thing I do hate is that it came packaged horribly, some of the cream was all over the paper and the bottle</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Ok I am going to be perfectly honest. The first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t feel any heat on my head. I massaged it into my scalp left it on for 10 mins and I didnt feel anything. I was feeling a little bad, like aww man I got gypt. But I figured maybe I need more time, but I had things to do, and while rinsing it, it made my hair so silky so I wasn&#x27;t that disappointed. I got out of the shower and I guess I didn&#x27;t the product out or maybe I just had really hot water that I couldnt feel it until 5 minutes after my shower. I was sitting at my computer and I started feeling the heat. When people say heat, they mean it. I thought people were &amp;#34;confusing&amp;#34; it for the cooling feeling peppermint does, you know kind of like icey hot, but no, I have to give credit where it is due- they know what they&#x27;re talking about. The second time I tried it i didn&#x27;t just massage it into my scalp i used it like i was washing my hair with the conditioner, meaning I was scratching my scalp with my nails and sure and this time I had the time to let it sit for 30 mins, but I didn&#x27;t need to wait that long. I felt that heat in 5 minutes, plus I used 2 plastic caps.. I don&#x27;t yet know if it will make my hair grow but reading about cayenne pepper and making your own cayenna pepper oil to make it grow I believe it will and the heat is in there so I feel that if you feel it &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; then its going to work. Wish there was more product but I like the idea of making my own now.</li>
            <li> it works great, It&#x27;s wonderful. I recommend buying it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Does exactly what is described about it. Hair becomes more beautiful, shiny, silky and you see GROWTH. Thank you to whoever invented it!  PS-one 1 issue-it dries out hair, so apply on the roots only and just in case apply any  conditioner  on the length in the meantime.</li>
            <li> This product smells beautiful! If it didn&#x27;t get so damn hot I would leave it on longer so my hair could smell just like it!!! My hair is so so so so soft after I rinse this out. I am AA and was 6 months post relaxer when I purchased this product and my new growth and texlax hair loved it! A little goes a long way and I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a good batch.  I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling/burning that was spoken about, and I left it in for a few hours.  I&#x27;ll have to monitor what my hair is doing over the next few weeks.  Then, I&#x27;ll be able to better understand if it worked for me.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised.  I saw hair growth within a month of using it, and recommend highly, and certainly will use it again.  The only concern is that you have to make sure you keep your eyes closed with rinsing it out; and, as time goes, on the heat is not as intense as in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I used this at least a year or two ago. This is some good stuff</li>
            <li> The hair mask was spilt around the container and packaging box.  There was no seal lid inside.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> Love it, wish the jar came in a bigger size. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on the scalp.  It cleared up a really bad case of dandruff.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this, you can feel your scalp burning, but not to a point where it&#x27;s not tolerable. You know that it&#x27;s stimulating your scalp. I would high recommend this and will be ordering more in the future... Love it!</li>
            <li> This hair mask definitely &amp;#34;tingles&amp;#34;. I shampooed as usual, applied a generous amount from scalp to ends, and massaged it in. Left it on for about 20 minutes total, and you can definitely feel a tingling/warming sensation 5 minutes into the treatment. I think the key point is to massage it well into your scalp. This isn&#x27;t a miracle product by any means, but I do feel it helps with the absorption of other hair treatments. I would apply this mask, wash it out, and add your usual hair oils to achieve the best results.</li>
            <li> It was a really good hair mask. It had a nice smell and gave my hair a lot of volume. I didnt see too much shine or softbess in my hair which is why i didnt give it 5 stars but it works good</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all with this product. In fact, only used it a couple of times and was not satisfied with the results. Did absolutely nothing for me. Would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love it makes my dry hair soft and manageable. Will keep buying since im already obsessed with it .</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used this twice.  I didn&#x27;t find that it burned like others had stated.  But it is bringing my hair back to life.  I have natural hair, but it is colored.  The winter is doing a number on my hair - extremely dry and brittle this year.  I used this mask as well as some liquid protein and I can tell that my hair is getting stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask,it&#x27;s doing wonders for my hair.I will admitt my hair WAS DOOMED until i started using this stuff.It changed my hair,now my hair is healthy not breaking and growing really fast</li>
            <li> PRODUCT: After shampooing my hair I used this and applied it to my scalp, then gently massaged it in. After about 3 minute it began to warm my scalp and after about 6-7 minutes I could feel it all over my head. I rinsed it after 13 minutes and my hair was softer.  The smell reminds me of rose &amp; hot peppers mixed, nothing extreme and the color is light/pail pink in color. I like this product so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING: I ordered 3 products, all came in the same box (tightly taped brown box). The only issue was the Mask-Balsam Paprika&#x27;s top was loose, some of the product spilled into the box. I opened it and around the neck of the container part of the product seemed smeared/melted/ then re-solidified as if it were a little old. The bottom was a little dirty/dusty as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHIPMENT: Arrived before the anticipated date, very fast shipping. Gold Star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: So far so good, the mask did stimulate my scalp &amp; tingled, I&#x27;ll continue to use and see how things go. I did not experience this burning sensation that I&#x27;m seeing a lot of comments about, it was more of a very warm sensation. I would still purchase from this Seller again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does a great job keeping my hair soft. I&#x27;ve never left my hair out exposed to the elements for too long so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to know what it feels like with your hair out all day. Do not rub or scratch your scalp while applying this conditioner because as you let it rest for a view minutes your scalp with start to feel the burn. I suggest you massage onto your scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the burn! nothing else in the world that I have tried conditions my hair as good as this one. When I use it I do not  need any other products to put in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just the best product I&#x27;ve put my hands on, all the rest I threw away.</li>
            <li> It smells good but I don&#x27;t like the fact that it has parabens and the &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation on my scalp is a little much.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product along with the egg/onion/burdock oil hair mask. I&lt;br /&gt;loved the way they made my hair silky. being an AA female, I had to read some of the&lt;br /&gt;reviews before I purchased it. the \\&quot;balsam/paprika is my favorite, it kicks a**! I&lt;br /&gt;was thinking when I first applied it, it wasn&#x27;t getting hot, but wait for it! after&lt;br /&gt;about I&#x27;d say five minutes WOW! My hair really warm, but in a good way! I plan on ordering the \\&quot;garlic hair mask\\&quot; next. Great product!</li>
            <li> Balsam Paprika mask leaves hair soft and silky after use. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! Amazing, will definitely reorder..</li>
            <li> I like the way it tingles and it smells really good. The package exploded in the mail though, so half of it was on the bag when I received it. Honestly though I&#x27;d buy it again, I really like that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair all greasy and it feels thicker and healthy after I use it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this one! I put it on longer then it says, like 40-50 min, and ur hair super smooth, shiny, moisturized, soft. I do 3-4 different mask every week, my hair grew longer. So happy to have it.</li>
            <li> Love the tingling sensation. Not sure if it really made my hair grow but felt great and conditioning on the scalp. Nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working but not sure yet.</li>
            <li> AA male with receding hairline, thought that this product would be beneficial for my Situation. I just received the item todAy,so shipping was super fast and I tried it as soon as I took it out the box. Things started off slow but the paprika did warm up to the reviews that I read about...I love the feeling of circulation now I&#x27;m just waiting to see if any results other than the warming effect take place.</li>
            <li> My DD loves this product and has me consistently reordering it as it really has made her hair grow very quickly! It doesn&#x27;t have a really nice smell but bearable.  She leaves it on longer than suggested like 2 hours so don&#x27;t know if thats an added benefit.  I haven&#x27;t tried it myself but just might as I&#x27;m trying to grow my locks a little longer so I can donate it to Locks of Love.</li>
            <li> it´s ok just as a regular rinse after shampoo, I find it does not have strength to help my hair grow. I find other regular conditioners doing better work.</li>
            <li> Very good! I bought the second one! It really make hair grow faster!</li>
            <li> ...I mean burn in a good way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a black female with natural tight coiled hair curls and I did a big chop as well (one of the other customers for this product said they did a big chop). My sides are shaved and in the middle is slightly more (a mohawk) I hate my hair being this short but knew it was the best choice if I wanted my hair to grow healthy and natural. I had perms before, even dreads once but chopped that off. I&#x27;m been searching desperately and doing a lot of research on things to promote hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO I purchased:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tropic Isle Living Jamaican Coconut Black Castor Oil 4oz&lt;br /&gt;Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Mask - Balsam &amp;#34;Paprika&amp;#34; for the Strengthening and Growth of Hair with Paprika Extract and Olive Oil 250 Ml (this product)&lt;br /&gt;Emu Oil Pure Premium Golden - Powerful Skin and Hair Moisturizer - 4 fl.oz.&lt;br /&gt;Hesh Brahmi Amla Herbal Hair Oil 200ml&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is SUPER SHORT I have (for the past 4 days) been using all these products all my hair each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on first (the longer the better I think and it didn&#x27;t come with directions in english so I&#x27;m following what everyone else has said) I leave this on for about 30-50 min and make sure you put it in wet hair, not dry. WEAR A SHOWER CAP&lt;br /&gt;Then the Shampoo I listed above leaving it in for 3-5 min in the shower&lt;br /&gt;(After showering hair should be wet) Mix all the products with a little water so my hair isn&#x27;t to oily or heavy. And I leave it in until the next day I do the treatment again. I try to do a cap full of each product and slightly more water. I did enough to put all throughout my hear and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also make sure I do this in the middle of the day or in the morning so I&#x27;m not sleeping with wet or oily hear. But just in case I sleep with a hand towel covering my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does BURN and its a GOOD BURN. I noticed a few people saying it did not burn. It either did burn but not enough for them or not at all...if its NOT BURNING then your doing SOMETHING WRONG. I believe for optimal results you should put this on and cover it with a shower cap. I covered mine with a terry cloth liner inside my shower cap and not just a plastic one (because it was the only one i had).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I did not feel a burn for the first few minutes applying it and leaving it on (I thought this crap didn&#x27;t work) UNTIL I put the shower cap on and now its hot all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;BUY IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I do hate is that it came packaged horribly, some of the cream was all over the paper and the bottle it self. Package it better please!! And screw the lid SHUT!rn. It either did burn but not enough for them or not at all...if its NOT BURNING then your doing SOMETHING WRONG.

            <li> I am a black female, that recently did what is called a \\&quot;big chop\\&quot;. I did my \\&quot;big chop\\&quot; in January 2013 because while I had a decent length of hair, it was severley damaged from me not taking care of it like I should. Before I go any further, let me state that my hair is completley natural. I havent had a perm since 2010, and prior to getting one in 2010, I hadn&#x27;t had one since about 2005.  In January, I chopped all of my hair off, like I knew I didnt want to go COMPLETELY bald, so I chopped all my hair the closest I could get it to my scalp (I did leave about 1cm in the front though). I have been using different products and my hair has been growing back at an ok rate(i am one of those people that hair grows slowly), HOWEVER after my second application of this after washing my hair, and applying little tiny knots in my hair, when I went to wash my hair yesterday, my hair had grown at least 1-1.5 cm!!!! okay, 1 cm...does not sound like much, but it is for one week!!! No lie, I have a set of twins, and when I took my hair out my the little knots, they were like mommy your hair has grew!!! Lets put it this way, when I washed my hair LAST Thursday, I didnt have enough hair to even twist thats why I had to use the tiny black rubberbands and place in little knots all over my head, however when i took my hair out of the knots to wash my hair yesterday, I can actually TWIST my hair (even in the back, and I cut the back a little shorter than the front)! I am going to order me some more of this stuff, it is the real deal, and yes, it BURNS to the high heavens (but I like it, for the most part, because it feels like a heating pad on your head, however last night when I applied it, REALLY REALLY burned, but I still could take it)because as black female that used to get perms, I am used to burning...and thats what it feels like a perm that burns, but of course its the paprika...and not harmful chemicals. One more thing, I didnt have time to actually twist my hair into knots last night, so I did put knots using the little rubberbands again, but GET this, where is the last time I had like 10-15 little knots all over my head, because I was trying to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; hair if that makes sense, last night when I did it, I only have like 5 or 6, because my hair has grown that I can grab MORE hair per knot if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I think its like the 1st reviewer said (who was the reason I decide to give this a try) the fact that this burns, opens up your pores, therefore, whatever treatments and / or conditioners you use on your head is absorbed better in your scalp (which feeds your hair). I dont think the product ITSELF is what is growing my hair, I think the fact that it opens up my pores, so my hair can absorb my homemade treatments (like a mixture of Brahini and emo oil) and conditioners (cocounut)is what is causing my hair to grow.  I really hope they do not stop selling this stuff, because there is nothing else out on the market like it, that I know of.....t night, so I did put knots using the little rubberbands again, but GET this, where is the last time I had like 10-15 little knots all over my head, because I was trying to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; hair if that makes sense, last night when I did it, I only have like 5 or 6, because my hair has grown that I can grab MORE hair per knot if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I think its like the 1st reviewer said (who was the reason I decide to give this a try) the fact that this burns, opens up your pores, therefore, whatever treatments and / or conditioners you use on your head is absorbed better in your scalp (which feeds your hair).

            <li> I have only used it two times and can already tell a difference in my hair! it doesn&#x27;t shed as much and its much softer! LOVE THIS PRODUCT! However make sure you wash your hair out a few times as if this stays and gets on your skin it burns but its not a painful burn just discomforting</li>
            <li> really helped my ahir to grow</li>
            <li> I actually dont know how I feel about this product! I think I just waste my money, like really !</li>
            <li> I just used this product 30 minutes ago and my head is still tingling. I am AA with relaxed hair and this product really does stimulate the scalp. I applied the product to my hair and massaged into my scalp and put a plastic cap on and let it sit. After about 3 minutes or so I could feel a tingle here and there but after about 5-7 minutes it was full on and I left it on about 15 minutes total. I rinsed well with cool water but my scalp stills feels the effects of the cayenne pepper extract. From the way it feels, I am sure this product will stimulate hair growth. I will update later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a terrible time with my hair.. Dry, frizzy and falling out! I think it&#x27;s stress, hormones and damage from coloring :S&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just started using this product along with the Russian shampoo... After the first use, my hair is sooo much better! I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it.. I&#x27;ve tried tons of deep conditioners. I don&#x27;t know why this is different but it is! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll help my hair stop falling out.. But it sure looks and feels healthier and thicker already! Which is helping me not to worry so much about it! I&#x27;ll definitely order again and use it in conjunction with the shampoo :)</li>
            <li> awesome product . You need to wash hair with regular shampoo and then use it  like regular conditioner but wait for 3 minutes or so for effect.  Best on the market for restore hair</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks! My scalp felt tingly and it made my hair silky soft. I noticed less shedding too.  I am African-American with relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Product burns a little. Also leaves a funny feeling in my nasal passages for some reason. The smell isn&#x27;t that great either. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my scalp feel - very warm sensation and the smell is great.  If you have any kind of shedding, this product stops it in its track!</li>
            <li> The product does moisturize the hair. However, I did not feel much of a burn.&lt;br /&gt;At first I tried leaving it on for 5 minutes---felt nothing. Then I went up to 10 mins---nothing. And now I also tried 20 mins under a shower cap-----still nothing!&lt;br /&gt;However, the hair does feel softer.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I thought I would give this a try.  Unfortunately there was no burn or tingling.  This is just an expensive lotion that has absolutely no benefit other than a simple conditioner, which any lotion can do.  The product cap was taped down with packing tape, and when I opened the jar there wasn&#x27;t a seal. I&#x27;ve applied it to my scalp in a thin layer, and a thick layer, massaging my scalp, leaving it on for an hour... nothing.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Really nice product sometimes i feel the burn on my scalp sometimes i don&#x27;t! Overall felt it help the overall health of my hair thus accelerating the growth</li>
            <li> It is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a lovely  mask  and at a lovely price. Makes hair super shiny, brings out hairs natural highlights, lovely smell.</li>
            <li> I am a multiracial young model who is constantly doing shows and my hair is always being fried. My hair is thick but is curly and wavy in different sections for my hair. I chose to buy this product because I&#x27;ve fallen in love with their hair products and wanted to give this a try so what I can tell you is that if you can&#x27;t handle spices at all DON&#x27;T TOUCH IT, the product does heat up your scalp a little bit which is a GOOD THING, because opening up my pores on my head allows me to rinse it out afterwards and place another conditioner on it to really soak up. It&#x27;s like steaming your face and putting a great mask after it. It&#x27;s very useful and love it. I would recommend it to anyone UNLESS spices are not your thing, if peppers bother you incredibly quickly then don&#x27;t get this or if you think you can handle it. Because it can heat up pretty darn good, but I love spices eating or apparently on my head.</li>
            <li> I like this mask-balm. It is part of my anti-hair loss treatment mask (1 tbsp of this mas+ 1 egg yolk+2 tbsp of mustard powder+ 2 tbsp of burdock oil+1tsp of water) that I apply at least once/week for an hour and I already see some improvement (hair fall reduced on 50% or so). But, I believe, it is good on it&#x27;s own as well.</li>
