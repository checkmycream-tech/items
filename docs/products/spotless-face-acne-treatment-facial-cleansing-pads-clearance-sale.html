            <li>I noticed impressive results..</li>
            <li>Do not buy it this will make your acne break out even more then what you had!!!</li>
            <li>This morning (Tuesday), when I woke him up, saw continued successful results!</li>
            <li>I am still happy with the product, though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am happy to recommend this for anyone who are trying to get rid of their pimples.</li>
            <li>They were Great..</li>
            <li>Really great.  </li>
            <li>it is magical!!</li>
            <li>and I already see amazing results!</li>
            <li>We are absolutely thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li>i bought this item because of the good reviews</li>
            <li>Too be fair</li>
            <li>worked good for the time I used them</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>I think  the thing I like best about this is that it leaves my skin clean and smells pleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>although I&#x27;ve always thought them beautiful, they look even better without the acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that I gave these pads a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are thrilled beyond words.  </li>
            <li>i have acne and this kind</li>
            <li>and it kind of prevented my skin from having breakouts,</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried tea tree oil, which helps but has it&#x27;s own issues if used on</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>no, this isn&#x27;t the best new acne treatment.  </li>
            <li>#34;what could it hurt&amp;#34; i was super happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Much more effective on my skin than Clearisil acne pads.</li>
            <li>I love these easy to use pads!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, which is a plus for any teenager, but not all that effective</li>
            <li>I have a combi skin, and most of the acne products dries my skin.</li>
            <li>My face is not worst, i would rather keep washing my face with dettol.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the products I had been purchasing.</li>
            <li>My daughter is at that wonderful pre teen phase and this has cleared up her face within 2 weeks!!  </li>
            <li>and maybe it could work better for you.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get your hopes up if you are suffering acne breakout and thinks this can magically make it disappear.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and diet modifications over the years.  </li>
            <li>Many products on the market just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I m glad it worked for others.</li>
            <li>I absousltely love this product.</li>
            <li>And its better than them gimick 3 step treatment stuff advertised on television.</li>
            <li>I have tried many name brand products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought top rated products on Amazon with no succeess.  </li>
            <li>will order them again for the convenience and the nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>To be honest the pink label appeared geared more towards teenagers than adults but this product has been incredible.  </li>
            <li>and most importantly, 4.</li>
            <li>but I loved this product too much not to write anything.</li>
            <li>#34;they smell really nice &amp; fresh; not like medicine at all.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>And the feeling after application is clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Great product will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li>and it was a free for all.</li>
            <li>They make it super easy to apply the medication to the skin.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>It has a unique combination of glycolic acid, lactic acid, and salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li>everytime i use it, my skin feels super clean</li>
            <li>Plus, the pads here are good quality and don&#x27;t shred if you have some facial stubble at the end of the</li>
            <li>Maybe if the pads were more saturated I would have stuck with them but three days was as much as I could stand.</li>
            <li>If anything, it would be great if they try to make it a bit softer, I tried to use the other side which was a bit &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly the product worked.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it said it would!</li>
            <li>really think you&#x27;ll love this as much as my granddaughters.</li>
            <li>it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It is a bit costly but worth its price.</li>
            <li>this stuff isn&#x27;t exactly a cure in a bottle, I still have some pimples, but certainly not as bad as it had been.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice difference right after the first application!</li>
            <li>This takes me to Hollywood&#x27;s Secrets - the reviews were very very promising.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy and convenient to use after a long day.  </li>
            <li>My first review ever in my life, can&#x27;t believe this a 4 stars product.</li>
            <li>I saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now , and i really can see the difference !</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I thought this might be it.  </li>
            <li>Good solution, it could make the big pimples smaller, but it can&#x27;t eliminate pimples at all.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>This is my first review on Amazon, or anywhere really</li>
            <li>Pretty pissed I paid this much for something that didn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li>I am an adult who never had acne until after I was pregnant and afterward.  </li>
            <li>This product contains the same active ingredient as many other anti-acne medication, but is in a much easier to use format!&lt;br /&gt;Simply having the anti-acne medication in a facial wipe makes it quick and easy to use, and it seems to be working great so far!</li>
            <li>Just made pimples more obvious &amp; even made new ones appear.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re really fast &amp; easy to use, especially after an event when she&#x27;s &amp;#34;tired and just wants to go to sleep&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It really works, and</li>
            <li>around Thanksgiving I received a code to get this for free (only because I am a repeat customer).</li>
            <li>These pads really work.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>This product worked really well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it worked really well for the acne and to some degree on acne marks.</li>
            <li>so I can see if this really works.</li>
            <li>It cause skin irritation and doesnt help much with acne problem.</li>
            <li>I really like how they make my skin feel after I use them.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and so I didn&#x27;t get much of the product on my face with each use.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this product because I saw it helps with lowering oil production.</li>
            <li>really works</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>This is a real solution to your problems.</li>
            <li>until finally i had a clear face to the point that i was confident in going out with out any foundation.</li>
            <li>Many sensitive acne prone folks can&#x27;t use any glycerin (my daughter included) and these actually made her break</li>
            <li>They also have a nice smell, not a strong astringent smell, that takes your breath away.  </li>
            <li>Hands down best stuff I have tried as of late</li>
            <li>My new year resolution (I never do new year resolutions) was to get rid of acne for good, or at least limit it as much as posible.  </li>
            <li>You have to be careful at first because it will dry your skin out if you are not careful, just use a good moisturizing noncomedogenic lotion like cetaphil if you are having this problem.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>far it is working really well</li>
            <li>Received Saturday &amp; we saw instant success...</li>
            <li>I contacted Cherie, and she told me right away that she will make a note of my name and address and send it as soon as its back in stock.</li>
            <li>Since I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product actually removed the blackheads in my cheeks and nose after the first use</li>
            <li>in one week my face was not only clean but most of the red acnes dried up !</li>
            <li>Blackheads came to the surface and easily removed the bumps on my face dried up.</li>
            <li>I have tried others in the past but this is by far better.</li>
            <li>And thus could be the reason it&#x27;s been such positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really strong and effective on currently bad skin.  </li>
            <li>Twice a day seems to dry his face out too much &amp;, in turn, produced more oil, causing heavy acne again.</li>
            <li>It took about a month for my acne to totally clear up.</li>
            <li>I have tried hundreds of products to clear up my acne, and some of them worked....</li>
            <li>they seem to &amp;#34;work and clear up the pimples in a couple of days as long as [she] start to use them at the first sign of a breakout&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and I found that I needed a product to help clear it up.  </li>
            <li>It irritated my skin and didn&#x27;t clear my acne at all.</li>
            <li>I have not had the same problem, if anything my face is very moisturized after.</li>
            <li>I have used it maybe a week so far.</li>
            <li>Nor, did I really want to go onto a prescription remedy if possible.</li>
            <li>Benefits outweigh the drawbacks by far.</li>
            <li>But Salicylic Acid is probably the most common ingredient in Acne treatment products.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And while I prefer natural and organic skincare, I was getting desparate.  </li>
            <li>That said, it could be that she hasn&#x27;t used it long enough to see true improvements.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product for free but that does not mean that I do not love it!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most store brand products because they make my face worse.</li>
            <li>They leave it clean feeling, but not dry and tight like a lot of products.  </li>
            <li>which I won&#x27;t expand on, but I will say that I keep a small bottle of TreeActive+ in my medicine cabinet, but very rarely use it.  </li>
            <li>No other product has ever worked.</li>
            <li>We tried this after having only monderate success with the other name brand products.</li>
            <li>and one week later, my face is clear.</li>
            <li>However, recently I had been having a problem with some adult acne</li>
            <li>Got this for my 15 year old son who has some relatively severe acne problems.</li>
            <li>I am a 42 year old male who has suffered with adult cystic acne for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>I say it&#x27;s hormonal because I&#x27;m a very vegetarian and lead an active life.  </li>
            <li>Although it is a bit expensive (I&#x27;m only 16 and have to buy my own stuff)</li>
            <li>It does dry up faster the break outs and keeps skin clear.</li>
            <li>the pads are really dry, feels like they send me an two yrs old storaged product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really like how they make my skin feel after I use them.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and so I didn&#x27;t get much of the product on my face with each use.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product because I saw it helps with lowering oil production.</li>
            <li> really works</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> This is a real solution to your problems.</li>
            <li> until finally i had a clear face to the point that i was confident in going out with out any foundation.</li>
            <li> Many sensitive acne prone folks can&#x27;t use any glycerin (my daughter included) and these actually made her break</li>
            <li> They also have a nice smell, not a strong astringent smell, that takes your breath away.  </li>
            <li> Hands down best stuff I have tried as of late</li>
            <li> My new year resolution (I never do new year resolutions) was to get rid of acne for good, or at least limit it as much as posible.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful at first because it will dry your skin out if you are not careful, just use a good moisturizing noncomedogenic lotion like cetaphil if you are having this problem.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> far it is working really well</li>
            <li> Received Saturday &amp; we saw instant success...</li>
            <li> I contacted Cherie, and she told me right away that she will make a note of my name and address and send it as soon as its back in stock.</li>
            <li> Since I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product actually removed the blackheads in my cheeks and nose after the first use</li>
            <li> in one week my face was not only clean but most of the red acnes dried up !</li>
            <li> Blackheads came to the surface and easily removed the bumps on my face dried up.</li>
            <li> I have tried others in the past but this is by far better.</li>
            <li> And thus could be the reason it&#x27;s been such positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really strong and effective on currently bad skin.  </li>
            <li> Twice a day seems to dry his face out too much &amp;, in turn, produced more oil, causing heavy acne again.</li>
            <li> It took about a month for my acne to totally clear up.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of products to clear up my acne, and some of them worked....</li>
            <li> they seem to &amp;#34;work and clear up the pimples in a couple of days as long as [she] start to use them at the first sign of a breakout&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I found that I needed a product to help clear it up.  </li>
            <li> It irritated my skin and didn&#x27;t clear my acne at all.</li>
            <li> I have not had the same problem, if anything my face is very moisturized after.</li>
            <li> I have used it maybe a week so far.</li>
            <li> Nor, did I really want to go onto a prescription remedy if possible.</li>
            <li> Benefits outweigh the drawbacks by far.</li>
            <li> But Salicylic Acid is probably the most common ingredient in Acne treatment products.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And while I prefer natural and organic skincare, I was getting desparate.  </li>
            <li> That said, it could be that she hasn&#x27;t used it long enough to see true improvements.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product for free but that does not mean that I do not love it!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most store brand products because they make my face worse.</li>
            <li> They leave it clean feeling, but not dry and tight like a lot of products.  </li>
            <li> which I won&#x27;t expand on, but I will say that I keep a small bottle of TreeActive+ in my medicine cabinet, but very rarely use it.  </li>
            <li> No other product has ever worked.</li>
            <li> We tried this after having only monderate success with the other name brand products.</li>
            <li> and one week later, my face is clear.</li>
            <li> However, recently I had been having a problem with some adult acne</li>
            <li> Got this for my 15 year old son who has some relatively severe acne problems.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old male who has suffered with adult cystic acne for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s hormonal because I&#x27;m a very vegetarian and lead an active life.  </li>
            <li> Although it is a bit expensive (I&#x27;m only 16 and have to buy my own stuff)</li>
            <li> It does dry up faster the break outs and keeps skin clear.</li>
            <li> the pads are really dry, feels like they send me an two yrs old storaged product.</li>
            <li> Barely moist and about 2/3s out and its dry.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, you&#x27;re face will probably get worse before it gets better because whatever is in this stuff rips the impurities from deep down, so it&#x27;s going to pull up those pimples that had started under the surface, but they will go away a lot quicker.  </li>
            <li> The dark spots on his skin have began to clear up as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They did not cause my skin to get red, dry out or peel.</li>
            <li> It did dry my face out a bit which seemed to help acne, BUT it felt like tiny peices of glass were sitting on my face trying to get into my pores.  </li>
            <li> The pads were also very scratchy and irritating for my skin, which is wildly sensitive.</li>
            <li> of treated my acne, not completely treated it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands on products in the last year</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and they ended up being a complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I am usually leery of trying new products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to understand how a single father of teen boy s feels when your son prays for and asks for nothing but a clear face for prom night.  </li>
            <li> All prior acne lesions are gone and the few new cystic acne that have appeared resolved in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> bad.make my face dry and itchy and to make it worste it makes the zit worste</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife actually because she has been having a problem lately with adult acne.</li>
            <li> The pads were very dry when it arrived</li>
            <li> A little too harsh for clear skin, but it&#x27;s geared for problem skin.  </li>
            <li> Wow this stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> God knows I&#x27;ve spent thousands on so called helps and cures</li>
            <li> I spent $35 dollars for this.</li>
            <li> I waited an extra few weeks</li>
            <li> I have only been using these for a few days and have already noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> My teenage autistic son will not use any product that requires him to wash his face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several things, some worked for a few days, some didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This is a GIANT waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I missed the 30 day money back guarantee by just a few days.  </li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t dry her skin out and leave it red and flaky, like some other products she has tried in the past.</li>
            <li> These are the large deep painful variety that last for months.  </li>
            <li> Ordered it O/N on a Friday to hope for results by Monday (due to reviews).</li>
            <li> but I still usually had several cystic acne on my face at any given time.  </li>
            <li> And when I saw the active ingredient: Salicylic Acid</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave behind a gross residue.</li>
            <li> I am ecstatic with this product and definitely recommend for anyone who suffers with adult acne.</li>
            <li> The product is a little smelly</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on it</li>
            <li> its a waste of money.it smells</li>
            <li> It just dried my skin out and made my zits sting.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with acne for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I work in a business environment and meet clients regularly, so acne is never attractive nor helps you feel confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left my face sticky, started breaking out WORSE after just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this simple regiment for over 5 months now with dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> I get small pimples under my glasses.  </li>
            <li> It felt sticky on my face after it dried, and made me break out worse after a few days.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t use make-up usually but we&#x27;ve been going out to events a lot lately so that has changed</li>
            <li> It looked dull and irritated and the acne was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has used it for one week and his pimples have reduced at least 50%.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Still being a little skeptical, i was desprate to try anything.</li>
            <li> But after the second use, I noticed how bad it makes my skin look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking big, painful pimples.  </li>
            <li> They had tried all types of creams, moisturizers and pimple removers only to be disappointed time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was too dumb to believe in this online fruad.</li>
            <li> and it was expensive, common</li>
            <li> She is worried about it getting worse</li>
            <li> Expensive wipes</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, someone posted the code online</li>
            <li> This thing is extremely expensive and I kept using it for 3 weeks and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews on this product and though it was a bit expensive, I decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> Some smelled weird.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t smell weird, but almost sugary.  </li>
            <li> I guess the acne could be caused by stress as well, which I have plenty of (sadly).  </li>
            <li> I did, and boy was I disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe i am this stupid.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work on me, and the smell is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have 2 granddaughters who have suffered for a year with acne.  They had tried all types of creams, moisturizers and pimple removers only to be disappointed time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get this for them to see how it would work.&lt;br /&gt;They are thrilled beyond words.  It really works, and although I&#x27;ve always thought them beautiful, they look even better without the acne.&lt;br /&gt;I really think you&#x27;ll love this as much as my granddaughters.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice difference right after the first application!</li>
            <li> My first review ever in my life, can&#x27;t believe this a 4 stars product. Do not buy it this will make your acne break out even more then what you had!!!</li>
            <li> Barely moist and about 2/3s out and its dry. Felt sand saw no medication helping. Expensive wipes</li>
            <li> Work great!! Although it is a bit expensive (I&#x27;m only 16 and have to buy my own stuff) it was definitely worth it. I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most store brand products because they make my face worse. But these worked perfect! It took about a month for my acne to totally clear up.</li>
            <li> Really strong and effective on currently bad skin.  A little too harsh for clear skin, but it&#x27;s geared for problem skin.  Much more effective on my skin than Clearisil acne pads.</li>
            <li> My daughter is the one who uses this product. It is convenient because it is in the form of pads, but I don&#x27;t think it works all that well. That said, it could be that she hasn&#x27;t used it long enough to see true improvements. I recommend getting this treatment if you can afford it and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work  Don&#x27;t waste money on it</li>
            <li> i bought this item because of the good reviews and i wanted to.get rid of my zit but its a waste of money.it smells bad.make my face dry and itchy and to make it worste it makes the zit worste</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again in the future. I have tried others in the past but this is by far better.</li>
            <li> This product contains the same active ingredient as many other anti-acne medication, but is in a much easier to use format!&lt;br /&gt;Simply having the anti-acne medication in a facial wipe makes it quick and easy to use, and it seems to be working great so far!</li>
            <li> But this stuff worked and, just in time for the prom.  It&#x27;s hard to understand how a single father of teen boy s feels when your son prays for and asks for nothing but a clear face for prom night.  God knows I&#x27;ve spent thousands on so called helps and cures but this stuff worked.  There is nothing else to say; this stuff worked and did as it promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon, or anywhere really but I loved this product too much not to write anything. I have tried hundreds of products to clear up my acne, and some of them worked....for awhile. I started using the pads 2x a day for about 2 weeks and then just used them once a day ( after washing face, at night). In a bout a week i started having fewer pimples than before. until finally i had a clear face to the point that i was confident in going out with out any foundation. I am now on my second pot, the acne is not showing any signs of coming back so i will definitely be ordering a 3rd!!!  edit: Wonderful customer service! around Thanksgiving I received a code to get this for free (only because I am a repeat customer). Unfortunately, someone posted the code online and it was a free for all. So by the time i wanted to use the coupon it was invalid. I contacted Cherie, and she told me right away that she will make a note of my name and address and send it as soon as its back in stock. Also, I noticed some reviews on here stating that they need to moisturize after using the pads. I have not had the same problem, if anything my face is very moisturized after. (I have combination skin).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my entire after puberty life. When I felt like &amp;#34;what could it hurt&amp;#34; i was super happy with the results. I was amazed at how quickly the product worked. I use it twice a day. it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave behind a gross residue.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail. I have used it maybe a week so far. It seems to be working. I would give it a five star but it hasn&#x27;t been 30 days yet and I want to see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I never had acne until I hit about 21 and since then I have tried EVERYTHING known to man, I&#x27;m talking prescriptions, otc, tv advertised brands (no names mentioned), organic remedies and nothing has ever worked! Too be fair this stuff isn&#x27;t exactly a cure in a bottle, I still have some pimples, but certainly not as bad as it had been.  Furthermore, you&#x27;re face will probably get worse before it gets better because whatever is in this stuff rips the impurities from deep down, so it&#x27;s going to pull up those pimples that had started under the surface, but they will go away a lot quicker.  This product actually removed the blackheads in my cheeks and nose after the first use so it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Good solution, it could make the big pimples smaller, but it can&#x27;t eliminate pimples at all.&lt;br /&gt;It takes 3 weeks to see its impact.</li>
            <li> These pads really work. I bought them for my teenage son and they helped a lot. I started using them too for occasional breakouts before my period and I am hooked! I have zero breakouts now. Ever. Seriously. I love these easy to use pads!</li>
            <li> I saw results after the first use. Blackheads came to the surface and easily removed the bumps on my face dried up. I really like this</li>
            <li> I have a combi skin, and most of the acne products dries my skin. This product worked really well on my skin. I used it daily or every 2-3 day depending on if my skin was breaking out. I noticed that it worked really well for the acne and to some degree on acne marks. It&#x27;s very easy and convenient to use after a long day.  If anything, it would be great if they try to make it a bit softer, I tried to use the other side which was a bit &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34;. I would def buy this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife actually because she has been having a problem lately with adult acne. She doesn&#x27;t use make-up usually but we&#x27;ve been going out to events a lot lately so that has changed and she thinks that has contributed to the problem. She likes these pads because 1. they&#x27;re really fast &amp; easy to use, especially after an event when she&#x27;s &amp;#34;tired and just wants to go to sleep&amp;#34;. 2. &amp;#34;they smell really nice &amp; fresh; not like medicine at all.&amp;#34; 3. they don&#x27;t dry her skin out and leave it red and flaky, like some other products she has tried in the past. and most importantly, 4. they seem to &amp;#34;work and clear up the pimples in a couple of days as long as [she] start to use them at the first sign of a breakout&amp;#34;. Bottom line she says that she would recommend them to others and intends to purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I was too dumb to believe in this online fruad. It didn&#x27;t work at all. what happens after pasting this s*** on your face is, you feel like you used lemon on your face. nothing else.. no changes, pimples keep coming on my face. My face is not worst, i would rather keep washing my face with dettol. I can&#x27;t believe i am this stupid. I spent $35 dollars for this.</li>
            <li> Since I have very sensitive skin I am usually leery of trying new products. However, recently I had been having a problem with some adult acne and I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the products I had been purchasing. Nor, did I really want to go onto a prescription remedy if possible. I was very pleased that I gave these pads a try. They did not cause my skin to get red, dry out or peel. My skin felt refreshed after using them. The blemishes cleared up and have not reoccurred. I would definitely recommend these to anyone battling with break outs.</li>
            <li> My daughter is at that wonderful pre teen phase and this has cleared up her face within 2 weeks!!  Definitely ordering again!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my 15 year old son who has some relatively severe acne problems. Ordered it O/N on a Friday to hope for results by Monday (due to reviews). Received Saturday &amp; we saw instant success...literally by two uses on Sunday morning. This morning (Tuesday), when I woke him up, saw continued successful results! We are absolutely thrilled with this product! Does exactly what it said it would! His face is rapidly clearning up!! Thankful to have found it!!  --SIDE NOTE-- Twice a day seems to dry his face out too much &amp;, in turn, produced more oil, causing heavy acne again. So, he washes his face in the morning &amp; the evening but, only uses the pads at night now. I am still happy with the product, though.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me and maybe it could work better for you. This thing is extremely expensive and I kept using it for 3 weeks and nothing happened. I waited an extra few weeks so I can see if this really works. Not gonna call it scam because I could be an exception but since it didn&#x27;t work for me at all, 1 star is warranted imo. Don&#x27;t get your hopes up if you are suffering acne breakout and thinks this can magically make it disappear. I did, and boy was I disappointed.</li>
            <li> in one week my face was not only clean but most of the red acnes dried up !</li>
            <li> I think  the thing I like best about this is that it leaves my skin clean and smells pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;So often this sort of product has a medicine odor, not this one, smells nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does what it says, without drying my face out.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help my acne. It just dried my skin out and made my zits sting. I returned it for a refund. Since then I cleared my skin using vitamin B5 (aka pantothenic acid) look up the reviews. I take 3 grams every night.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work on me, and the smell is awful. the pads are really dry, feels like they send me an two yrs old storaged product. and it was expensive, common</li>
            <li> I am a father of an &amp;#34;eleventeen&amp;#34; girl and she has just started getting pimples. She is worried about it getting worse so I got these Acne treatment wipes on a recommendation from a friend because her daughter was also getting pimples too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it is working really well and I can see that it is clearing up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to recommend this for anyone who are trying to get rid of their pimples.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff sucks. It leaves your face sticky and gooey and actually causes you to breakout rather than getting rid of any acne. I would not recommend this product and I guarantee you most of these reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well on my teenage son&#x27;s acne that he&#x27;s been fighting with for years.  We tried this after having only monderate success with the other name brand products.</li>
            <li> Hands down best stuff I have tried as of late and I have gone through a bunch of products. My pores are shrinking and my acne is going away which is awesome! You have to be careful at first because it will dry your skin out if you are not careful, just use a good moisturizing noncomedogenic lotion like cetaphil if you are having this problem. The product is a little smelly but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Benefits outweigh the drawbacks by far.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! Helps with blemishes.</li>
            <li> They were Great.. Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> After using these pads for a month I no longer have breakouts.  Best product I have found and I have tried several.</li>
            <li> Struggled with acne for about 5 years, i received this product two days ago and I already see amazing results! I have tried everything doctors proscribed me to drug store products and nothing worked until I bought this! Will definitely be buying this product again when I&#x27;m all out!</li>
            <li> It cause skin irritation and doesnt help much with acne problem.</li>
            <li> I loved this mask!! i have acne and this kind of treated my acne, not completely treated it but my pimples are going away and it kind of prevented my skin from having breakouts, everytime i use it, my skin feels super clean&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now , and i really can see the difference ! i totally recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, which is a plus for any teenager, but not all that effective</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old male who has suffered with adult cystic acne for as long as I can remember. These are the large deep painful variety that last for months.  I have tried many products and diet modifications over the years.  Reducing sugar and gluten definitely reduced the frequency but I still usually had several cystic acne on my face at any given time.  That was until I tried Spotless Face by Hollywood Glam.  It has a unique combination of glycolic acid, lactic acid, and salicylic acid.  I did some research on the internet and each one appears to target the formation of acne is a different way.  To be honest the pink label appeared geared more towards teenagers than adults but this product has been incredible.  My regiment is to wash my face in the morning and evening with Cetaphil Daily Cleanser followed by rubbing the medicated pad over my face.  I have been using this simple regiment for over 5 months now with dramatic results.  All prior acne lesions are gone and the few new cystic acne that have appeared resolved in just a few days.  I am ecstatic with this product and definitely recommend for anyone who suffers with adult acne.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work well had no change or clearing up</li>
            <li> What a disappointment! The ingredients on the container (glycerin!) don&#x27;t match the ingredients listed here on amazon. Many sensitive acne prone folks can&#x27;t use any glycerin (my daughter included) and these actually made her break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they&#x27;d remove the glycerin because the pads are otherwise well-formulated.</li>
            <li> worked good for the time I used them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problem skin for years. Many products on the market just don&#x27;t work. And when I saw the active ingredient: Salicylic Acid 2%, I thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve tried that before.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Benzoyl Peroxide products, this will not discolor dyed fabrics. So that&#x27;s nice. But Salicylic Acid is probably the most common ingredient in Acne treatment products. So what makes this different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, there&#x27;s something to be said about these pads. They make it super easy to apply the medication to the skin. Not having to buy separate cotton pads and put astringent on is convenient. Plus, the pads here are good quality and don&#x27;t shred if you have some facial stubble at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tingling sensation lets you know it&#x27;s working. And the feeling after application is clean and refreshing. After just a week I&#x27;m seeing a difference. My skin feels smoother overall and any breakouts seem to heal faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being so convenient may be the reason I&#x27;ve been keeping up with the treatment (1 pad morning and night). And thus could be the reason it&#x27;s been such positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order them again for the convenience and the nice clean feeling. But I think I need to supplement this with something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do they work? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Are they a miracle product? No.&lt;br /&gt;Is there any miracle product? Probably not.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me at all. Just made pimples more obvious &amp; even made new ones appear. Pretty pissed I paid this much for something that didn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people with sensitive skin. I tried this for 3 days and every time I would apply it on my face it made my skin irritated and itchy, I even tried to sit in front of a fan to ease the pain but it was unbearable. I m glad it worked for others.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with acne for a few years now. i tried several products that you buy at the local stores. i seen this advertised on amazon, and read the reviews. i was blown away and orderded this product. Still being a little skeptical, i was desprate to try anything. i recieved Hollywood glam within 5 days of purchase. I used it imediatly, and within one day. I noticed impressive results.. ......... and one week later, my face is clear. I absousltely love this product. And its better than them gimick 3 step treatment stuff advertised on television. I use it twice a day, one pad in the morning..... and one pad at nite. DEFFIENTLY ORDER !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using these for a few days and have already noticed a difference in my skin.  I really like how they make my skin feel after I use them.  They leave it clean feeling, but not dry and tight like a lot of products.  They also have a nice smell, not a strong astringent smell, that takes your breath away.  I recommend these.</li>
            <li> My teenage autistic son will not use any product that requires him to wash his face.  I have tried many name brand products.  I saw the reviews on this product and though it was a bit expensive, I decided to try it anyway.  He has used it for one week and his pimples have reduced at least 50%.  The dark spots on his skin have began to clear up as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It does dry up faster the break outs and keeps skin clear. It is a bit costly but worth its price.</li>
            <li> Really great.  I get small pimples under my glasses.  This works well at keeping them under control.</li>
            <li> The pads were very dry when it arrived and so I didn&#x27;t get much of the product on my face with each use. The pads were also very scratchy and irritating for my skin, which is wildly sensitive. I was really looking forward to this product because I saw it helps with lowering oil production. Maybe if the pads were more saturated I would have stuck with them but three days was as much as I could stand.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t wipe away pimples.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Left my face sticky, started breaking out WORSE after just a few days.  I am an adult who never had acne until after I was pregnant and afterward.  Stress inflamed my acne and I found that I needed a product to help clear it up.  I&#x27;ve tried several things, some worked for a few days, some didn&#x27;t.  Some smelled weird.  This didn&#x27;t smell weird, but almost sugary.  It felt sticky on my face after it dried, and made me break out worse after a few days.  I&#x27;m talking big, painful pimples.  This is a GIANT waste of money.  I missed the 30 day money back guarantee by just a few days.  Don&#x27;t bother with this product.</li>
            <li> it is not clearing up the acne</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It irritated my skin and didn&#x27;t clear my acne at all.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product for free but that does not mean that I do not love it! It really works!</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy Eminence Probiotic products instead!  Read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned 30 last year but have been strugling with what appears to be hormonal acne for years now.  I say it&#x27;s hormonal because I&#x27;m a very vegetarian and lead an active life.  I guess the acne could be caused by stress as well, which I have plenty of (sadly).  My new year resolution (I never do new year resolutions) was to get rid of acne for good, or at least limit it as much as posible.  I&#x27;ve spent thousands on products in the last year (my guess would be under $2k, but definitely over $1k) trying everything.  And while I prefer natural and organic skincare, I was getting desparate.  I work in a business environment and meet clients regularly, so acne is never attractive nor helps you feel confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried tea tree oil, which helps but has it&#x27;s own issues if used on it&#x27;s own which I won&#x27;t expand on, but I will say that I keep a small bottle of TreeActive+ in my medicine cabinet, but very rarely use it.  I&#x27;ve tried almost all acne products from Sephora.  I&#x27;ve bought top rated products on Amazon with no succeess.  This takes me to Hollywood&#x27;s Secrets - the reviews were very very promising.  I ordered it instantly.  The first time I used it, I thought this might be it.  It did dry my face out a bit which seemed to help acne, BUT it felt like tiny peices of glass were sitting on my face trying to get into my pores.  Again, if this would be such a miracle, I would tolerate it.  But after the second use, I noticed how bad it makes my skin look.  It looked dull and irritated and the acne was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no, this isn&#x27;t the best new acne treatment.  Save your money and try Eminence Probiotic face wash and cream.  Eminence has probiotic face mask as well, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  Eminence is not a miracle either, but gets rid of 90%+ of acne on my face.  Good luck, I know how it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I am not paid by Eminence at all, but if you&#x27;re readingthis Eminence, I will take your money and become your biggest spokesperson!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and they ended up being a complete waste of time and money. They did nothing to help her acne!</li>
            <li> it is magical!! really works</li>
            <li> Not working at all!!!</li>
            <li> It really works. I will recommend this to anyone. No other product has ever worked. This is a real solution to your problems.</li>
