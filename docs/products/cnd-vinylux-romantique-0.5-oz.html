            <li>I also own the cake pop color</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>I normally do my manicure on Sunday and after one week, most nails are still perfect.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy with the quality although I don&#x27;t like the color much</li>
            <li>I love Vinylux, just not this color.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this color for at home use unless you love steaks.</li>
            <li>this was a lovely color</li>
            <li>(Vinylux top coat required)</li>
            <li>I love Vinylux.</li>
            <li>Love the concept though.  </li>
            <li>Going to try a darker color and see if it has a better result.</li>
            <li>and I love the look it gives my fingers and toes.</li>
            <li>and I like romantique way better.  </li>
            <li>Love love love the color ...</li>
            <li>Never before has nail polish endured a week&#x27;s worth of dish washing and not chipped!!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer the full coverage look and opted for 3 coats plus the top coat.</li>
            <li>use the top coat to get a full week&#x27;s wear out of it</li>
            <li>I think it has a smooth finish and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It looked fine after 2 coats</li>
            <li>Great color shine and dry time</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a full week</li>
            <li>pretty good a bit better than regualr polish lasts a little longer</li>
            <li>Even better, it came off so easily with regular nail polish remover</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last a week without chipping but liked the look.</li>
            <li>I got a professional manicure with this color and the CND Vinylux top coat</li>
            <li>Even after about 5 coats, I still couldn&#x27;t get this color to look quite right.</li>
            <li>The polish does last quite a long time with the top coat, but this color is very, very light -- and I like light colors.  </li>
            <li>heavier first coat, lighter second coat, then the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a real fan now of this product and will stay with it!</li>
            <li>Definitely better than regular nail polish</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s turn out really pretty</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding that perfect neutral pink color</li>
            <li>Like the product but color too light, looks white when on..</li>
            <li>Wanted more of a pink..</li>
            <li>I think this is more durable than normal nail polish, but not near Shellac--which grows out before chipping on me.  </li>
            <li>It takes three coats to look decent.</li>
            <li>Nail polish seemed a little lighter and wat more liquids then my friends bottle</li>
            <li>After taking nearly three weeks to arrive, it went on very streaky.  </li>
            <li>This color is a perfect nude (but I do usually need at least 3 coats to make it opaque).</li>
            <li>Purchased this product in a couple of colors, and I used this pretty pink color first.  </li>
            <li>apply this one carefully to get full coverage...</li>
            <li>I really should have taken the review more seriously.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the color, it is too translucent and clear for me.</li>
            <li>Nice, professional pale pink.</li>
            <li>the pale color is trickier to apply to get a smooth finish without streaks.  </li>
            <li>Usually my polish Is starting to look tacky by the second day, but this one, with its top coat companion, last a whole week!  </li>
            <li>This is pretty pink!</li>
            <li>This stuff really stays on days longer than any other polish I have ever used.  </li>

            <li> This stuff really stays on days longer than any other polish I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> took me a few tries to get it right since it&#x27;s the opposite of what you would do with a darker shade.  </li>
            <li> very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s closer to white than pink.</li>
            <li> It dose start to peel off after being in water for a long time.</li>
            <li> It last a lot longer than other polishes</li>
            <li> Although I think it takes longer to dry</li>
            <li> Only lasts a few days like a regular polish does.</li>
            <li> looks pink in the bottle but</li>
            <li> That said it won&#x27;t just chip off due to wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use other polish that doesn&#x27;t streak--</li>
            <li> If you expect total salon quality, you might be a little disappointed, but it is still better than your average everyday nail polish.</li>
            <li> It is not the worst polish I&#x27;ve tried, but it was certainly nothing special.</li>
            <li> Very poor coverage and very streaky.</li>
            <li> This color does stay on with little or no chipping.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hold up any better with both the stickey base and weekly top coat, but it could have just been that I thought it looked terrible to begin with!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it actually does make it through the week.  </li>
            <li> Manicurist said to defy the instructions and use base coat first.</li>
            <li> the finish was Dull and chipped in about 4 days.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> It lasted 6.5 days before chipping at all, despite the serious wear/tear I did on my hands.</li>
            <li> and my nails didn&#x27;t look unhealthy</li>
            <li> This polish stays on but the streaks are horrible enough to make it unwearable.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Streaky, with and without filler or base coat/</li>
            <li> Nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> These products are the worst nail polish I ever had</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nasty stuff. Ruined my nails. Manicurist said to defy the instructions and use base coat first.</li>
            <li> Very sheer.  Goes on &#x27;blotchy&#x27;  Needed 3 coats.</li>
            <li> After taking nearly three weeks to arrive, it went on very streaky.  By the time you put on enough coats to get rid of the streaks, it looks like you&#x27;ve painted your nails with White Out.  It is not the worst polish I&#x27;ve tried, but it was certainly nothing special.</li>
            <li> Found out about this through a blog. Had to have a nail polish that lasts a week. It came and I tried it out. Although I think it takes longer to dry it does stay put once on. Although if you go messing with it, scratching at it, picking a cuticle you could scratch the paint. That said it won&#x27;t just chip off due to wear and tear. I think it has a smooth finish and is easy to apply. I checked out a video on youtube to assure I was putting it on correctly. I&#x27;d advise you to do that too if you purchase it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product in a couple of colors, and I used this pretty pink color first.  My nails were streaky, but I&#x27;ll give it another try. I&#x27;ve use other polish that doesn&#x27;t streak--possibly it&#x27;s thicker.  I didn&#x27;t get a week out of this--did have some chipping.  I think this is more durable than normal nail polish, but not near Shellac--which grows out before chipping on me.  This is pretty pink!</li>
            <li> This color does stay on with little or no chipping. However it is a sheer color and requires extra coats to cover.</li>
            <li> great product.  very long lasting.  the pale color is trickier to apply to get a smooth finish without streaks.  heavier first coat, lighter second coat, then the top coat.  took me a few tries to get it right since it&#x27;s the opposite of what you would do with a darker shade.  looks pink in the bottle but whiteish/neutral on the hand.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the color, it is too translucent and clear for me. It didn&#x27;t chip after days so I&#x27;m happy with the quality although I don&#x27;t like the color much</li>
            <li> Even after about 5 coats, I still couldn&#x27;t get this color to look quite right. I love Vinylux, just not this color. I&#x27;ll be looking for another neutral. Also, it&#x27;s closer to white than pink.</li>
            <li> This polish stays on but the streaks are horrible enough to make it unwearable. I&#x27;m a novice with nail polish and maybe a manicurist has some trick to make it not streak. Don&#x27;t buy this color for at home use unless you love steaks.</li>
            <li> This stuff really stays on days longer than any other polish I have ever used.  this was a lovely color and I was amazed at how resilient it was!  Usually my polish Is starting to look tacky by the second day, but this one, with its top coat companion, last a whole week!  I&#x27;m a real fan now of this product and will stay with it!</li>
            <li> Like the product but color too light, looks white when on.. Wanted more of a pink.. Polish does last tho</li>
            <li> Never before has nail polish endured a week&#x27;s worth of dish washing and not chipped!! Unbelievable! (Vinylux top coat required)</li>
            <li> Nice coverage.  Didn&#x27;t last a week without chipping but liked the look.</li>
            <li> It lasts about a week - just as their claims state. Longer lasting than OPI.</li>
            <li> These products are the worst nail polish I ever had</li>
            <li> This is a good polish. I didn&#x27;t get a full week rather it lasted 5-6 days. Definitely better than regular nail polish</li>
            <li> I love Vinylux. I will put on a few coats, and it lasts for at least a week, sometimes more with no chipping. This color is a perfect nude (but I do usually need at least 3 coats to make it opaque).</li>
            <li> For some reason, the bottle that I got seems to separate once applied.  Love the concept though.  Going to try a darker color and see if it has a better result.</li>
            <li> My go to nail polish for the summer! It last a lot longer than other polishes and I love the look it gives my fingers and toes. I use it as a French manicure sometimes.</li>
            <li> Designed to be an alternative to salon gel nails, I think this is a good product. It worked as promised and lasted 5 days before beginning to chip. The color is great for summer, and the ease of use makes it a worthwhile purchase. If you expect total salon quality, you might be a little disappointed, but it is still better than your average everyday nail polish.</li>
            <li> Streaky, with and without filler or base coat/</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding that perfect neutral pink color and I think I finally have.  I also own the cake pop color and I like romantique way better.  It looked fine after 2 coats but I prefer the full coverage look and opted for 3 coats plus the top coat.</li>
            <li> This polish stayed on well over a week without chipping, peeling or coming off in any way!  I love it when a product truly does what it says it will!</li>
            <li> Stays on great and is very very very pretty! It dose start to peel off after being in water for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love love love the color ... It&#x27;s turn out really pretty and yesssss it does stay on for 7 days sometimes its even more👍</li>
            <li> Nail polish seemed a little lighter and wat more liquids then my friends bottle</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this and I&#x27;m thrilled with this product. It does not chip. It will start to grow out as your nails grow. It takes some work to get it off but for someone like me who washes their hands all the time at work, this is a perfect solution!</li>
            <li> This system is advertised as being a weekly polish.  I was skeptical, but it actually does make it through the week.  I normally do my manicure on Sunday and after one week, most nails are still perfect. Great for the workweek!</li>
            <li> apply this one carefully to get full coverage...use the top coat to get a full week&#x27;s wear out of it</li>
            <li> Very poor coverage and very streaky. The Polish has been on two days and it is already chipping. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It lasted for 5 days. I work in the medical field so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands.</li>
            <li> the finish was Dull and chipped in about 4 days. Same as regular polish.  I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> Great color shine and dry time I like it&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  Lasts for over a week when used with CND Vinylux topcoat.  Color is similar to OPI bubble bath.  Nice, professional pale pink.</li>
            <li> I got a professional manicure with this color and the CND Vinylux top coat and then the next day went on a one-week vacation that included hiking/climbing on rocks, carrying a ton of luggage, and basically setting myself up for an instantly ruined manicure. WRONG! It lasted 6.5 days before chipping at all, despite the serious wear/tear I did on my hands. Even better, it came off so easily with regular nail polish remover and my nails didn&#x27;t look unhealthy/thinned like they do after gel manicures. This is the holy grail of nail polishes.</li>
            <li> The polish does last quite a long time with the top coat, but this color is very, very light -- and I like light colors.  It takes three coats to look decent.</li>
            <li> pretty good a bit better than regualr polish lasts a little longer</li>
            <li> Does not last a week as promised. Only lasts a few days like a regular polish does.</li>
            <li> I really should have taken the review more seriously. I tried five coats and it still looked streaky. It didn&#x27;t hold up any better with both the stickey base and weekly top coat, but it could have just been that I thought it looked terrible to begin with!  Not impressed at all!</li>
