            <li> Excellent product - Does the job - Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes - I wish they could remove the sting - If they could, five stars</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  I saw results right away.  However, it is greasy and caused my makeup to not stay on well.</li>
            <li> This product is exceptional.  A must try for the over 50 crowd!</li>
            <li> The item is not working very well, I am not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This night cream is not too heavy or greasy. It is absorbed into your skin quickly and leaves no residue. I would definitely recommend this cream for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Signature Club A are my go-to anti aging products. I&#x27;ve been with SCA for a year now and my skin on my face and neck have never to led better. Vitamin C products might be where its at now. My skin is softer, smoother, more even toned, smooth texture, and even my pores have gotten smaller. I personally think that this is the best night cream out there so far. I will continue to buy all of Adrienne&#x27;s anti aging products until I find something that works better for me. I recommend all of Signature Club A&#x27;s anti aging products who are just starting to show signs of premature aging.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better products in my opinion of this series.  It feels nice while applying on the face, too.  I see no difference, however, in my facial skin....no profound improvement.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years - has helped rid of brownish &amp; red places and my skin just wasn&#x27;t the same without it.  Very happy to find on Amazon ..... Excellent vitamin c product I keep going back to as it does more than moisturize, it erases some effects of time.</li>
            <li> I like this creme.  It is like whipped butter and goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin feel smooth. I will need to stock up.</li>
            <li> Signature Club A By Adrienne Arpel Rapid Transport C Infused Night Creme. Complete protection non greasy and helps with skin texture</li>
            <li> Mediocre night creme at best.  I see absolutely no difference in my skin at all....plus I dislike the texture. Trying another.</li>
            <li> I did not like this at all</li>
            <li> My mother loves this skincare, and she is 81 years old.  She says it keeps her skin moist all day.  She will have me keep ordering this for her.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to find will purchase again thanks</li>
            <li> Love Adrienne Arpel Products, but do not like to pay her price  This serves me find</li>
            <li> Honestly, it seems to do the best job in slowing and helping with current wrinkles.  I also use it on my neck.</li>
            <li> Sorry, Signature Club, but you may have missed the mark here, although I must&lt;br /&gt;admit, this product had a pleasant fragrance...Wished I could have seen results,&lt;br /&gt;but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me..</li>
            <li> Love it.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Brought on the pimples!  Ugh.</li>
