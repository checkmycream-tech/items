            <li>good mask for cleaning.</li>
            <li>34;too good to be true&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but, fair warning, the smell does linger.</li>
            <li>I agree that it&#x27;s a good value b/c</li>
            <li>Excellent product for adult acne and very good seller.</li>
            <li>I love this mask!</li>
            <li>Peter Thomas Roth needs to get with it and use chemicals that are safe!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love his products!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it!</li>
            <li>Smells very good even though it contains sulfur, nice cooling feeling, leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I think it is good,  smell very nice and feel cool when apply it on face.</li>
            <li>AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This mask is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I had no objections to the scent of texture of the product, in fact I liked the way it tingled on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality cheaper substitute for DDF sulphur mask which does work better.</li>
            <li>what kind</li>
            <li>After trying this product for myself, I can honestly say that it works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The masque that I ordered off of Amazon has a much stronger (almost chemical-y) scent and it may be my mind getting the best of me, but it does not seem to work as well as the masque that I had bought in-stores.</li>
            <li>So effective.</li>
            <li>The mask glides on easily, rinses easily, smells good, and leaves the skin feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li>The best part about this product is that, depending on your usage, it does not dry out your skin to the point of peeling and flaking.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to leave it on for the recommended time.</li>
            <li>My fault for not researching more.</li>
            <li>and I love the cooling effect.  </li>
            <li>better -</li>
            <li>Even my husband likes it :)</li>
            <li>I dont think I have many acne anymore</li>
            <li>this treatment worked great and was very soothing.</li>
            <li>but I do find this mask not any Better than a $4 tube of queene Helene sulfer mask.</li>
            <li>after trying it, I felt so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love the Vitaville</li>
            <li>I searched online for more sulfur products and came across this one, which is 10% sulfur.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels with this on and better</li>
            <li>However, better followed by hydration products to prevent skin from dehydrating.</li>
            <li>You will love the cooling sensation and yuor acne going away.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better...</li>
            <li>i love using this mask it has helped regulate my oils a bit.</li>
            <li>the mask itself has a refreshing feel to it</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>This product is just OK, because I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>I might need order more for her.</li>
            <li>I really really love this product, and have been using it weekly for over a year.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price for it that I&#x27;ve found ($25 when I last bought it vs. $40 at Sephora).    </li>
            <li>/&gt;First the good: it works very very well.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good.</li>
            <li>After these precautions, it works wonderfully at clearing acne, fading hyperpigmentation, smoothing, and brightening the skin - much more so than many other masks</li>
            <li>After these precautions, it works wonderfully at clearing acne, fading hyperpigmentation, smoothing, and brightening the skin - much more so than many other masks I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li>There are better sulfur products out there that are paraben free.</li>
            <li>This is a great mask to use for keeping your skin clear.  </li>
            <li>It is really good, even okay for normal</li>
            <li>Love it too much !!!</li>
            <li>Gives you a refreshing and clean feeling after use.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have strong odors, and don&#x27;t bleach my sheets.</li>
            <li>It has a strong eucalyptus smell, but nothing that is repugnant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as i thought it would be</li>
            <li>Hands down the Best mask for oily, acne skin!</li>
            <li>very good, but be careful</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that it doesnt smell that great.  </li>
            <li>I use the mask on a regular basis, its a great product.</li>
            <li>It feels comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!!</li>
            <li>this is awesome for acne, and safe during pregnancy, smells much better than other sulfur products on the market, better price per ounce than Olay sulfur mask, beware drying effects if you have dry skin to start with.</li>
            <li>But once the product has gotten rid of that first rounds of toxins, your skin is going to clear up and look great.</li>
            <li>I find the scent pleasant, more eucalyptus, not really sulfury at all.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>This masque gets my face squeekie clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;it can help me clean my skin every week</li>
            <li>It sure felt refreshing on my face, but did nothing at all to clear my face.</li>
            <li>Honestly I did not find the product to be any better than the over the counter masks you can buy at any local drugstore.</li>
            <li>Helps fight acne right away!</li>
            <li>but for once a week usage its good enough.</li>
            <li>It could make face feel cool, but seems not work for me.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping product works wonders but too about a week and and to get results definitely a winning face product</li>
            <li>but not a bad mask.</li>
            <li>I have tried a bunch of different kinds of masks that claim to clear skin, and most of them either just do an okay job or don&#x27;t really work at all, but this one is amazing!</li>
            <li>WORKS QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>particular sulfur application is better than the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>4 FL OZ, Super Size.]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but sulfur is the most effective active ingredient I have used for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This masque feels cool and comfortable, and the best part is I can use it before bed, when the outside of the masks dries slightly to the touch I don&#x27;t have to worry too much about the mask rubbing off onto my pillow or anything like that, and if a bit does come onto some fabric I can easily wash it</li>
            <li>good mask to dry out unwanted blemishes</li>
            <li>It feels strong &amp; works fast, but it doesn&#x27;t ruin your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and helped dry some zits, but it didn&#x27;t prevent more pimples from forming and didn&#x27;t work on every pimple.</li>
            <li>/eyes accidentally (totally my fault), it is still such an effective and amazing product that I continue to use it and purchase</li>
            <li>Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>I have rarely used a product one time and seen results.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>But I still like to use it for fun.</li>
            <li>The next morning my skin will continue to look even better, with a noticeable reduced size in pores and blemishes, faded hyperpigmentation, a smooth texture, and firmed skin.</li>
            <li>This gets rid of it right away.</li>
            <li>However, it may have been due to the warm climate - I do live in the Bahamas :).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know a clay mask could be so refreshing and not dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li>I only need one per year (very cost effective).</li>
            <li>10% of sulfur proved to be too strong for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Ruined by whole face!</li>
            <li>It really has cleared my skin and it does shrink pores as well!</li>
            <li>It just overall has made my skin look  lot better.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When you first start using it, you are going to break out.</li>
            <li>It is not the first time I bought this.</li>
            <li>now I have kept using it for several weeks and the condition is slightly better.</li>
            <li>Currently only two, four days in time, as for the effect was not as strong as online introduction of clean power, may be to stick with it, in a word, it is also a high cost can product.</li>
            <li>I also love how it gently exfoliates my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li>It was more of a grayish tone was opposed to light green.</li>
            <li>Although she has soft and smooth skin, she takes care of her skin so much</li>
            <li>I also have SUPER sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>And a second sulfur ointment that comes suspended in a liquid and isn&#x27;t as easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried getting more sun to help dry out the skin, to no avail.</li>
            <li>but I hit a certain age and BLAMMO</li>
            <li>I mainly seek a smooth texture, less noticeable fine lines, and reduced acne/redness/</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole face once a week and then spot treat as needed.  </li>
            <li>but I do have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>i use it as an on the spot treatment and it really helps speed up the process.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>This really works well on those irritable bumps on the face.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t really feel the cooling feel everyone was talking about.</li>
            <li>I have tried EVERYTHING for my acne, from drugstore, high end, and prescription and nothing has worked as well as this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on my whole face.</li>
            <li>The smell is repugnant &amp; it really lasts no mattter</li>
            <li>how much I tried to wash away the smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t review much on Amazon, but I have to write about how much this product improved my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it so much</li>
            <li>it even color and gives such smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not irritating to the eyes, as I&#x27;ve found some to be.</li>
            <li>I have used this for about 10 years to calm my sensitive skin and combat acne.</li>
            <li>This mask is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I use it only once a week, perhaps using more frequently would be too much</li>
            <li>She love it and said it worked as she expected.</li>
            <li>Smell is more bearable than other sulfur masks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this same Peter Thomas Roth masque in stores (Sephora) before and was excited since the one that I ordered off of Amazon came at a &amp;#</li>
            <li>can use this stuff once a week for a deep clean and dab it on zits overnight, and they&#x27;ll be defeated and shriveled up by morning.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I dont have as many pimples and healing the ones I previously had.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly as a spot treatment</li>
            <li>They wear it overnight as a spot treatment, or use it as an allover masque ten minutes before washing, or (most recent finding by my daughter) keep it in the shower and wash affected areas with it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for people with oily/acneic skin.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price for it that I&#x27;ve found ($25 when I last bought it vs. $40 at Sephora).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware of the sulfur/eucalyptus/medicinal smell that can make your hair/towel smell faintly of sulfur until you shower if you&#x27;re not careful, like myself, when rinsing.</li>
            <li>My face will smell like sulfer (gas) for a few hours after, so dont use it right before a first date!!</li>
            <li>Its not too expensive, so i say its definitely worth a try if you are looking for a great facial mask!</li>
            <li>This mask really helps clear my skin.  </li>
            <li>Undeniably has strong clay smell however one does not bother much after a few applications.</li>
            <li>stuff is strong, effective, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my crazy sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li>and my skin is completely clear!</li>
            <li>the smell of this product maybe not really good, but i kind like sulfur and its decent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t try this for the first time before any big event!</li>
            <li>, my advice is to definitely patch test and be careful when you first get it, just to make sure that it won&#x27;t burn your skin or cause any irritation, and to keep it away from sensitive areas as much as possible.</li>
            <li>So, my advice is to definitely patch test and be careful when you first get it, just to make sure that it won&#x27;t burn your skin or cause any irritation, and to keep it away from sensitive areas as much as possible.</li>
            <li>A little medicated, but I think the smell is fine.</li>
            <li>Not as well as some other similarly-priced products, but it certainly keeps occasional blemishes at bay and helps speed healing whether I spot treat them or do a full mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all, but I put a moisturizer on right afterwards anyway.</li>
            <li>and apply it around the eyes right after the masque so that it doesn&#x27;t get dry and wrinkly.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it is when I have it close to my eyes and around my mouth, so I&#x27;ve limited to putting it only on the top of my nose, cheeks, jaw, chin, and forehead and have kept it as far away from my eyes, mouth, and the sides of my nose as possible.</li>
            <li>I use Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s facial wash and wanted to use an exfoliate with a little more power.</li>
            <li>My wife and I use this as an overnight mask to reduce swelling on pimples, and to clear blackheads.</li>
            <li>but nothing has begun to rapidly clear my skin like this product.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin clear and oiliness to a minimum.</li>
            <li>product is not meant for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My advice if you have sensitive skin stay away from this product, its seems to work for some - not me.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does wonders when a blemish begins to pop up and also works well as a preventative mask.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and my skin problems have almost completely evaporated.</li>
            <li>, I really can&#x27;t say enough about how much of an improvement I got from using this regularly.</li>
            <li>I make sure to use it at least once a week</li>
            <li>This has really helped my teenage son&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really smooth, and I could see an improvement after using it just a few times.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Glycolic, Lactic, and Salicylic Acids Professional Chemical Peel</li>
            <li>Glycolic, Lactic, and Salicylic Acids Professional Chemical Peel</li>
            <li>As different kinds of ance caused by different reasons, no drugs or anything else could be useful for every people.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean and pores tight.</li>
            <li>Takes my fine lines down 65% after one use!!</li>
            <li>Alittle goes a long way, so it has certainly lasted me awhile.</li>
            <li>and it helped a lot to calm down the skin and clear the blemishes.</li>
            <li>I recently gave it to my teenage kids to use when they got terrible teen acne, and they have had amazing results, and beautiful clear skin.</li>
            <li>You can take it off with  wet  paper  towels  dampened with hot water.</li>
            <li>I started developing cystic acne on my cheeks and even prescription creams weren&#x27;t really helping, and were causing my skin to dry up in places and darken.</li>
            <li>but there is enough in a jar to last you a whole year.</li>
            <li>It has a thick texture with a strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a small amount of smell that does dissipate, however, the results are well worth it!</li>
            <li>One word of warning though:  make sure you screw the lid down tight every time you use it.  </li>
            <li>This product helped clear out some stubborn deep acne.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and after two uses, my pores look so much smaller.</li>
            <li>Wow, this actually works!</li>
            <li>My blemishes have been reduced, the oil has decreased, and clearer, more even-toned skin has surfaced.</li>
            <li>It is also a thick white material that you need to completely wash away, otherwise you will get white spots on your towels (that don&#x27;t stain and do wash away easily, but are unsightly while they are there).</li>
            <li>It is also a thick white material that you need to completely wash away, otherwise you will get white spots on your towels (that don&#x27;t stain and do wash away easily, but are unsightly while they are there).</li>
            <li>For several years my skin was pretty clear, but not sure what happened</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and this is one of the first products that has caused this kind of painful reaction (I think due to the eucalyptus).</li>
            <li>So, despite the occasional pain when I am not careful and put it close to my mouth</li>
            <li>I just make sure that I leave it only not more than 10 minutes, as indicated on the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does dry out the skin if not used properly as it helps to dry out the blemishes.</li>
            <li>I would put it on at night, let it dry, and then leave it on until morning when I would rinse it off with a salicylic acid (Neutrogena clear body wash).</li>
            <li>This sulfur masks helps me to dry the pimples and clear the skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin that is prone to pimples.</li>
            <li>After just a few uses (every other day), I noticed a significant reduction in the size of my acne.</li>
            <li>I have tried MULTIPLE other high end products and until I tried the Peter Thomas Roth line I was not getting relief.</li>

            <li> Its one of the most awesome products i have used.</li>
            <li> GORGEOUS SKIN.</li>
            <li> good mask for cleaning.</li>
            <li> 34;too good to be true&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but, fair warning, the smell does linger.</li>
            <li> I agree that it&#x27;s a good value b/c</li>
            <li> Excellent product for adult acne and very good seller.</li>
            <li> I love this mask!</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth needs to get with it and use chemicals that are safe!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love his products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it!</li>
            <li> Smells very good even though it contains sulfur, nice cooling feeling, leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I think it is good,  smell very nice and feel cool when apply it on face.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This mask is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> I had no objections to the scent of texture of the product, in fact I liked the way it tingled on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality cheaper substitute for DDF sulphur mask which does work better.</li>
            <li> what kind</li>
            <li> After trying this product for myself, I can honestly say that it works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The masque that I ordered off of Amazon has a much stronger (almost chemical-y) scent and it may be my mind getting the best of me, but it does not seem to work as well as the masque that I had bought in-stores.</li>
            <li> So effective.</li>
            <li> The mask glides on easily, rinses easily, smells good, and leaves the skin feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li> The best part about this product is that, depending on your usage, it does not dry out your skin to the point of peeling and flaking.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to leave it on for the recommended time.</li>
            <li> My fault for not researching more.</li>
            <li> and I love the cooling effect.  </li>
            <li> better -</li>
            <li> Even my husband likes it :)</li>
            <li> I dont think I have many acne anymore</li>
            <li> this treatment worked great and was very soothing.</li>
            <li> but I do find this mask not any Better than a $4 tube of queene Helene sulfer mask.</li>
            <li> after trying it, I felt so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love the Vitaville</li>
            <li> I searched online for more sulfur products and came across this one, which is 10% sulfur.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels with this on and better</li>
            <li> However, better followed by hydration products to prevent skin from dehydrating.</li>
            <li> You will love the cooling sensation and yuor acne going away.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better...</li>
            <li> i love using this mask it has helped regulate my oils a bit.</li>
            <li> the mask itself has a refreshing feel to it</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> This product is just OK, because I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I might need order more for her.</li>
            <li> I really really love this product, and have been using it weekly for over a year.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price for it that I&#x27;ve found ($25 when I last bought it vs. $40 at Sephora).    </li>
            <li> /&gt;First the good: it works very very well.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good.</li>
            <li> After these precautions, it works wonderfully at clearing acne, fading hyperpigmentation, smoothing, and brightening the skin - much more so than many other masks</li>
            <li> After these precautions, it works wonderfully at clearing acne, fading hyperpigmentation, smoothing, and brightening the skin - much more so than many other masks I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li> There are better sulfur products out there that are paraben free.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask to use for keeping your skin clear.  </li>
            <li> It is really good, even okay for normal</li>
            <li> Love it too much !!!</li>
            <li> Gives you a refreshing and clean feeling after use.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have strong odors, and don&#x27;t bleach my sheets.</li>
            <li> It has a strong eucalyptus smell, but nothing that is repugnant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as strong as i thought it would be</li>
            <li> Hands down the Best mask for oily, acne skin!</li>
            <li> very good, but be careful</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it doesnt smell that great.  </li>
            <li> I use the mask on a regular basis, its a great product.</li>
            <li> It feels comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!!</li>
            <li> this is awesome for acne, and safe during pregnancy, smells much better than other sulfur products on the market, better price per ounce than Olay sulfur mask, beware drying effects if you have dry skin to start with.</li>
            <li> But once the product has gotten rid of that first rounds of toxins, your skin is going to clear up and look great.</li>
            <li> I find the scent pleasant, more eucalyptus, not really sulfury at all.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> This masque gets my face squeekie clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;it can help me clean my skin every week</li>
            <li> It sure felt refreshing on my face, but did nothing at all to clear my face.</li>
            <li> Honestly I did not find the product to be any better than the over the counter masks you can buy at any local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Helps fight acne right away!</li>
            <li> but for once a week usage its good enough.</li>
            <li> It could make face feel cool, but seems not work for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping product works wonders but too about a week and and to get results definitely a winning face product</li>
            <li> but not a bad mask.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of different kinds of masks that claim to clear skin, and most of them either just do an okay job or don&#x27;t really work at all, but this one is amazing!</li>
            <li> WORKS QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> particular sulfur application is better than the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> 4 FL OZ, Super Size.]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but sulfur is the most effective active ingredient I have used for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This masque feels cool and comfortable, and the best part is I can use it before bed, when the outside of the masks dries slightly to the touch I don&#x27;t have to worry too much about the mask rubbing off onto my pillow or anything like that, and if a bit does come onto some fabric I can easily wash it</li>
            <li> good mask to dry out unwanted blemishes</li>
            <li> It feels strong &amp; works fast, but it doesn&#x27;t ruin your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and helped dry some zits, but it didn&#x27;t prevent more pimples from forming and didn&#x27;t work on every pimple.</li>
            <li> /eyes accidentally (totally my fault), it is still such an effective and amazing product that I continue to use it and purchase</li>
            <li> Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I have rarely used a product one time and seen results.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> But I still like to use it for fun.</li>
            <li> The next morning my skin will continue to look even better, with a noticeable reduced size in pores and blemishes, faded hyperpigmentation, a smooth texture, and firmed skin.</li>
            <li> This gets rid of it right away.</li>
            <li> However, it may have been due to the warm climate - I do live in the Bahamas :).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know a clay mask could be so refreshing and not dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> I only need one per year (very cost effective).</li>
            <li> 10% of sulfur proved to be too strong for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Ruined by whole face!</li>
            <li> It really has cleared my skin and it does shrink pores as well!</li>
            <li> It just overall has made my skin look  lot better.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> When you first start using it, you are going to break out.</li>
            <li> It is not the first time I bought this.</li>
            <li> now I have kept using it for several weeks and the condition is slightly better.</li>
            <li> Currently only two, four days in time, as for the effect was not as strong as online introduction of clean power, may be to stick with it, in a word, it is also a high cost can product.</li>
            <li> I also love how it gently exfoliates my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> It was more of a grayish tone was opposed to light green.</li>
            <li> Although she has soft and smooth skin, she takes care of her skin so much</li>
            <li> I also have SUPER sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> And a second sulfur ointment that comes suspended in a liquid and isn&#x27;t as easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried getting more sun to help dry out the skin, to no avail.</li>
            <li> but I hit a certain age and BLAMMO</li>
            <li> I mainly seek a smooth texture, less noticeable fine lines, and reduced acne/redness/</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole face once a week and then spot treat as needed.  </li>
            <li> but I do have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> i use it as an on the spot treatment and it really helps speed up the process.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> This really works well on those irritable bumps on the face.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t really feel the cooling feel everyone was talking about.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING for my acne, from drugstore, high end, and prescription and nothing has worked as well as this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my whole face.</li>
            <li> The smell is repugnant &amp; it really lasts no mattter</li>
            <li> how much I tried to wash away the smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review much on Amazon, but I have to write about how much this product improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it so much</li>
            <li> it even color and gives such smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not irritating to the eyes, as I&#x27;ve found some to be.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 10 years to calm my sensitive skin and combat acne.</li>
            <li> This mask is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I use it only once a week, perhaps using more frequently would be too much</li>
            <li> She love it and said it worked as she expected.</li>
            <li> Smell is more bearable than other sulfur masks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this same Peter Thomas Roth masque in stores (Sephora) before and was excited since the one that I ordered off of Amazon came at a &amp;#</li>
            <li> can use this stuff once a week for a deep clean and dab it on zits overnight, and they&#x27;ll be defeated and shriveled up by morning.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I dont have as many pimples and healing the ones I previously had.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly as a spot treatment</li>
            <li> They wear it overnight as a spot treatment, or use it as an allover masque ten minutes before washing, or (most recent finding by my daughter) keep it in the shower and wash affected areas with it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for people with oily/acneic skin.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price for it that I&#x27;ve found ($25 when I last bought it vs. $40 at Sephora).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware of the sulfur/eucalyptus/medicinal smell that can make your hair/towel smell faintly of sulfur until you shower if you&#x27;re not careful, like myself, when rinsing.</li>
            <li> My face will smell like sulfer (gas) for a few hours after, so dont use it right before a first date!!</li>
            <li> Its not too expensive, so i say its definitely worth a try if you are looking for a great facial mask!</li>
            <li> This mask really helps clear my skin.  </li>
            <li> Undeniably has strong clay smell however one does not bother much after a few applications.</li>
            <li> stuff is strong, effective, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my crazy sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li> and my skin is completely clear!</li>
            <li> the smell of this product maybe not really good, but i kind like sulfur and its decent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t try this for the first time before any big event!</li>
            <li> , my advice is to definitely patch test and be careful when you first get it, just to make sure that it won&#x27;t burn your skin or cause any irritation, and to keep it away from sensitive areas as much as possible.</li>
            <li> So, my advice is to definitely patch test and be careful when you first get it, just to make sure that it won&#x27;t burn your skin or cause any irritation, and to keep it away from sensitive areas as much as possible.</li>
            <li> A little medicated, but I think the smell is fine.</li>
            <li> Not as well as some other similarly-priced products, but it certainly keeps occasional blemishes at bay and helps speed healing whether I spot treat them or do a full mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all, but I put a moisturizer on right afterwards anyway.</li>
            <li> and apply it around the eyes right after the masque so that it doesn&#x27;t get dry and wrinkly.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it is when I have it close to my eyes and around my mouth, so I&#x27;ve limited to putting it only on the top of my nose, cheeks, jaw, chin, and forehead and have kept it as far away from my eyes, mouth, and the sides of my nose as possible.</li>
            <li> I use Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s facial wash and wanted to use an exfoliate with a little more power.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use this as an overnight mask to reduce swelling on pimples, and to clear blackheads.</li>
            <li> but nothing has begun to rapidly clear my skin like this product.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my skin clear and oiliness to a minimum.</li>
            <li> product is not meant for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My advice if you have sensitive skin stay away from this product, its seems to work for some - not me.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does wonders when a blemish begins to pop up and also works well as a preventative mask.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and my skin problems have almost completely evaporated.</li>
            <li> , I really can&#x27;t say enough about how much of an improvement I got from using this regularly.</li>
            <li> I make sure to use it at least once a week</li>
            <li> This has really helped my teenage son&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really smooth, and I could see an improvement after using it just a few times.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Glycolic, Lactic, and Salicylic Acids Professional Chemical Peel</li>
            <li> Glycolic, Lactic, and Salicylic Acids Professional Chemical Peel</li>
            <li> As different kinds of ance caused by different reasons, no drugs or anything else could be useful for every people.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean and pores tight.</li>
            <li> Takes my fine lines down 65% after one use!!</li>
            <li> Alittle goes a long way, so it has certainly lasted me awhile.</li>
            <li> and it helped a lot to calm down the skin and clear the blemishes.</li>
            <li> I recently gave it to my teenage kids to use when they got terrible teen acne, and they have had amazing results, and beautiful clear skin.</li>
            <li> You can take it off with  wet  paper  towels  dampened with hot water.</li>
            <li> I started developing cystic acne on my cheeks and even prescription creams weren&#x27;t really helping, and were causing my skin to dry up in places and darken.</li>
            <li> but there is enough in a jar to last you a whole year.</li>
            <li> It has a thick texture with a strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a small amount of smell that does dissipate, however, the results are well worth it!</li>
            <li> One word of warning though:  make sure you screw the lid down tight every time you use it.  </li>
            <li> This product helped clear out some stubborn deep acne.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and after two uses, my pores look so much smaller.</li>
            <li> Wow, this actually works!</li>
            <li> My blemishes have been reduced, the oil has decreased, and clearer, more even-toned skin has surfaced.</li>
            <li> It is also a thick white material that you need to completely wash away, otherwise you will get white spots on your towels (that don&#x27;t stain and do wash away easily, but are unsightly while they are there).</li>

            <li> For several years my skin was pretty clear, but not sure what happened</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and this is one of the first products that has caused this kind of painful reaction (I think due to the eucalyptus).</li>
            <li> So, despite the occasional pain when I am not careful and put it close to my mouth</li>
            <li> I just make sure that I leave it only not more than 10 minutes, as indicated on the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does dry out the skin if not used properly as it helps to dry out the blemishes.</li>
            <li> I would put it on at night, let it dry, and then leave it on until morning when I would rinse it off with a salicylic acid (Neutrogena clear body wash).</li>
            <li> This sulfur masks helps me to dry the pimples and clear the skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin that is prone to pimples.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses (every other day), I noticed a significant reduction in the size of my acne.</li>
            <li> I have tried MULTIPLE other high end products and until I tried the Peter Thomas Roth line I was not getting relief.</li>
            <li> I found that if the skin gets dried out too much, the blemishes gets actually worse as the skin tries to produce more oil to compensate for the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that I&#x27;m conscious about is the around the eye area.</li>
            <li> Other than diet and wearing less makeup, I have found that being consistent with my facial products has been beneficial.</li>
            <li> this mask is very cleansing and soothing and after removing the mask, the skin shows very little irritation.</li>
            <li> Overall, my skin has improved but it is not completely clear.</li>
            <li> I try to avoid them—I didn&#x27;t do as much research for this product as I normally do for skincare, out of desperation from a terrible breakout—and I&#x27;m fairly sure this contains several types.</li>
            <li> I sleep with it on my face over night, when I woke the next morning, the bumps were going, but the face was dry.</li>
            <li> Except to dry one or two pimples if left overnight.</li>
            <li> I have found that overuse of benzoyl peroxide gels can leave my skin painfully dry and cracked, this product does no such thing.</li>
            <li> I used several other products and tried numerous cremes and lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25, have normal to dry skin, and have occasional small hormonal breakouts and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> It was a little soft says if it melted.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask in the place of several Mario Badescu masks that I had tried in the past to clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> The mask also doesn&#x27;t need to stay on long either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of PTR products and I&#x27;d rate this somewhere in the dead center between the line&#x27;s best and worst products.</li>
            <li> That is a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> The clay can dry out</li>
            <li> My son has acne,  and  I  have him wash his face and dry it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son as he wanted something to sooth dry, chapped skin...</li>
            <li> to dry skin (like me).</li>
            <li> but a week later I experienced the worst breakout I have had in years</li>
            <li> I never have any inflammation, dry patches, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and just recently started having acne problems (sensitive break outs on cheeks, redness, and enlarged pores).</li>
            <li> Also, be aware of the sulfur/eucalyptus/medicinal smell that can make your hair/towel smell faintly of sulfur until you shower if you&#x27;re not careful, like myself, when rinsing.</li>
            <li> I also use it as an overnight spot treatment for particularly large/bad breakouts, placing a thick blob on the area and rinsing it off in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my [sensitive acne-prone] skin, the trick to getting actual results is to leave it on for at least 15 minutes and not longer than 30 minutes—the directions say 10 to 15 minutes, but less than 15 is too short to have an affect.</li>
            <li> Not only do you get a ton of product for the price, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I no longer have painful cysts, no blackheads, the skin is healthy but not overly dry.</li>
            <li> I have slight acne, every few weeks a pimple comes up and my skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really thick, luxurious consistency, which means that I can take out just a little glob with two fingers and it covers my whole face.</li>
            <li> When I open the bottle， it was half empty somehow!</li>
            <li> Using it once or twice weekly is all I&#x27;ve managed so far, as I don&#x27;t want to risk negative effects from too-frequent use.</li>
            <li> But that is what is expected from Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
            <li> Also, the masque was not as firm my last one purchased from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Also no much effects.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the evening and the next day I find my face is less oily, then usual, by mid day.</li>
            <li> If I have any blemishes, they usually look less inflamed, smaller, and not as red.</li>
            <li> oh and a little goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tossing all my other clay masks.  </li>
            <li> I like the other one by Peter Thomas Roth</li>
            <li> 3 months ago I started to use this Sulfur cooling masque every other night</li>
            <li> The only product that gave me a glimmer of hope was a small tube of 6% sulfur mask that came with a Walgreens-brand Proactiv type kit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was a much lighter color than I remembered.</li>
            <li> small tub lasts a long time, about 7-9 months of weekly use all over my face with some spot treatments here and there.</li>
            <li> The small tub lasts a long time, about 7-9 months of weekly use all over my face with some spot treatments here and there.</li>
            <li> The oils leaked out during shipping and ran down the sides of the container.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 27, have combination/oily skin, and have always had acne flareups (particularly on my cheeks and forehead), and have a difficult time finding products that I can use on my skin overnight to reduce the size of the blemish.</li>
            <li> It always gives me a little radiance boost when i need it.</li>
            <li> It makes me crying</li>
            <li> I use it everyday twice a day</li>
            <li> I started to break out a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I also use it at night as spot treatment--in the morning when I wake up and take it off the pimples have dried up.</li>
            <li> I had very bad cystic acne and after doing a research for many products, I came to find this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from large, painful, cystic acne all of my life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this does flake REALLY bad if left on too long</li>
            <li> Use it just once a week to start, but no more than twice a week once you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne for the past year.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why cheaper than therapeutic mask...</li>
            <li> EVERY other acne treatment (and in 15 years, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything) has just irritated my skin and made my acne worse.  </li>
            <li> I put on a thin layer after cleansing and leave it on for about ~20 minutes, then rinse and follow with my other products.</li>
            <li> My back was so broken out into deep, painful cystic acne that I was devastated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when used all over my face, sometimes I find this very painful for the first few minutes I have it on until it dries.</li>
            <li> my skin SUCKS.</li>
            <li> That said, I believe that it is a fake product; as it came partially unsealed with a runny liquid in between the container and the plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> I have thick pimples all over my face, cheeks, forehead, between my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding that it relaxes my skin and my brown spots are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> i mean i am speechless.  </li>
            <li> Not a pleasant thing at all.</li>
            <li> I spread a thin layer over my skin, and when I had washed it off, my pimples looked &amp; felt subdued.</li>
            <li> It smell not good  and make me feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have the habit of picking at them, so I still have scars from them, but no more painful raised bumps.</li>
            <li> It leaves a funky lingering sulfur smell after washing it off which can be a little annoying and embarrassing if you&#x27;re not keen on smelling like sulfur all day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my forties &amp; still unfortunately have acne.</li>
            <li> I recently went off the pill and almost as soon as I did, my skin exploded into the worst acne I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> And when I say BAD, I mean BAD.</li>
            <li> There is no need to slather that dangerous stuff on your skin.</li>
            <li> Virgin Cold Pressed, Grade A, Odorless.</li>
            <li> But feel bad if you put it on the skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li> BAD.</li>
            <li> If I do not, it burns and makes my eyes water, and I have to wait a couple minutes for the painful sensation to go away.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have slight acne, every few weeks a pimple comes up and my skin is extremely sensitive. I read the reviews on this site and bought the product. I had no objections to the scent of texture of the product, in fact I liked the way it tingled on my skin. I used it for two weeks and my face erupted in cystic acne! Ruined by whole face! I have thick pimples all over my face, cheeks, forehead, between my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not meant for sensitive skin. My skin had acne but not severe or cystic! My advice if you have sensitive skin stay away from this product, its seems to work for some - not me.</li>
            <li> It works as spot treatments. Undeniably has strong clay smell however one does not bother much after a few applications.</li>
            <li> Helps fight acne right away!</li>
            <li> Smell is more bearable than other sulfur masks.  Works great.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I&#x27;m in my forties &amp; still unfortunately have acne. This product helps out a lot. I need to reorder some now!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  I wasn&#x27;t able to leave it on for the recommended time.</li>
            <li> Currently only two, four days in time, as for the effect was not as strong as online introduction of clean power, may be to stick with it, in a word, it is also a high cost can product.</li>
            <li> this product has substantially clearned my skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in less than a week.  I use it on my whole face once a week and then spot treat as needed.  Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> This stuff is going to last for a loooong time. It&#x27;s a really thick, luxurious consistency, which means that I can take out just a little glob with two fingers and it covers my whole face. Skin definitely feels nice after washing it off (with cold water and fingertips only! Read the directions!) because of the menthol and the sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my [sensitive acne-prone] skin, the trick to getting actual results is to leave it on for at least 15 minutes and not longer than 30 minutes—the directions say 10 to 15 minutes, but less than 15 is too short to have an affect. Using it once or twice weekly is all I&#x27;ve managed so far, as I don&#x27;t want to risk negative effects from too-frequent use. It also works well as an overnight spot treatment. Not as well as some other similarly-priced products, but it certainly keeps occasional blemishes at bay and helps speed healing whether I spot treat them or do a full mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m not so jazzed about is the presence of parabens. I try to avoid them—I didn&#x27;t do as much research for this product as I normally do for skincare, out of desperation from a terrible breakout—and I&#x27;m fairly sure this contains several types. My fault for not researching more. I&#x27;m still fairly happy with the product, though, and would recommend it based on the Prime discount.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for over 15 years.  I also have SUPER sensitive skin.  EVERY other acne treatment (and in 15 years, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything) has just irritated my skin and made my acne worse.  Sulfur is the ONLY thing that has every worked for me.  This is a GREAT product.  One word of warning though:  make sure you screw the lid down tight every time you use it.  The clay can dry out (I&#x27;m probably going to store mine in a ziploc in the future).</li>
            <li> This masque gets my face squeekie clean and I love the cooling effect.  I like using it before bedtime.  I use it once a week.  You can also use it for spot treatment on periodic acne flareups.  May be a bit pricey, but the jar will last awhile. Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! I have tried a bunch of different kinds of masks that claim to clear skin, and most of them either just do an okay job or don&#x27;t really work at all, but this one is amazing! I use it every night after I wash my face and leave it on for 20-30 minutes. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all, but I put a moisturizer on right afterwards anyway. It really has cleared my skin and it does shrink pores as well! It just overall has made my skin look  lot better. Its not too expensive, so i say its definitely worth a try if you are looking for a great facial mask!</li>
            <li> I tried this as soon as I received it.  I didn&#x27;t know a clay mask could be so refreshing and not dry my skin out.  I&#x27;m tossing all my other clay masks.  The mask glides on easily, rinses easily, smells good, and leaves the skin feeling refreshed.  Red spots and acne look diminished.  The only problem is in the packaging.  The oils leaked out during shipping and ran down the sides of the container.  Maybe if the container was sealed inside it would prevent this problem.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good. I like the other one by Peter Thomas Roth better - the one that is made just for acne. That is a little more expensive. This works pretty well. My son has acne,  and  I  have him wash his face and dry it. Then  I apply this  over  the affected areas  and  I will leave it on for  several hours -  maybe  5-6.  You can take it off with  wet  paper  towels  dampened with hot water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with acne but I do have very oily skin. I use this product in the evening and the next day I find my face is less oily, then usual, by mid day. It&#x27;s a good quality cheaper substitute for DDF sulphur mask which does work better.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT. GORGEOUS SKIN. WORKS QUICKLY. DRIES UP BLEMISHES IN A SITCH! WILL REPURCHASE AGAIN AND AGAIN! DEFINITELY PART OF MY BEAUTY REGIME!</li>
            <li> This product helped clear out some stubborn deep acne. i use it as an on the spot treatment and it really helps speed up the process.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use this as an overnight mask to reduce swelling on pimples, and to clear blackheads. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but sulfur is the most effective active ingredient I have used for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular sulfur application is better than the others I have tried. This masque feels cool and comfortable, and the best part is I can use it before bed, when the outside of the masks dries slightly to the touch I don&#x27;t have to worry too much about the mask rubbing off onto my pillow or anything like that, and if a bit does come onto some fabric I can easily wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This as compared to one sulfur ointment that feels slimy on the skin, never dries, and is a terror on fabric. And a second sulfur ointment that comes suspended in a liquid and isn&#x27;t as easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try sulfur for your skin, try this product.</li>
            <li> I have rarely used a product one time and seen results. This is amazing! My skin is so soft and after two uses, my pores look so much smaller. There is a small amount of smell that does dissipate, however, the results are well worth it! Highly Recommend! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Whenever I start breaking out or my skin feels congested, I use this mask and the next day my skin is totally cleared up. This mask works great! I also love how it gently exfoliates my skin at the same time. It always gives me a little radiance boost when i need it. The only downfall is that it doesnt smell that great.  My face will smell like sulfer (gas) for a few hours after, so dont use it right before a first date!!</li>
            <li> Wow, this actually works! I think I&#x27;ve tried every form of acne treatment--benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, chemical peels, epsom salt, charcoal, tea tree oil...you name it I&#x27;ve tried it. I have suffered from large, painful, cystic acne all of my life. I&#x27;m 33 and I still get them. After just a few uses (every other day), I noticed a significant reduction in the size of my acne. A week or 2 later and my skin is completely clear! Unfortunately, I have the habit of picking at them, so I still have scars from them, but no more painful raised bumps. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t try sulfur before!</li>
            <li> good mask for cleaning. But feel bad if you put it on the skin around your eyes. It makes me crying</li>
            <li> Smells very good even though it contains sulfur, nice cooling feeling, leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed. Even my husband likes it :)</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a week and what a difference. I have acne-prone skin and I have tried just about every facial product there is but nothing has begun to rapidly clear my skin like this product. My blemishes have been reduced, the oil has decreased, and clearer, more even-toned skin has surfaced. The sulfur ingredient is the key.</li>
            <li> the smell of this product maybe not really good, but i kind like sulfur and its decent.&lt;br /&gt;it can help me clean my skin every week, what is awesome is my skin feel moisturized too.</li>
            <li> Great mask! It does what it says it does. I&#x27;ll definitely keep on using it and keep on buying it.</li>
            <li> There are better sulfur products out there that are paraben free. There is no need to slather that dangerous stuff on your skin.</li>
            <li> This really works well on those irritable bumps on the face. I sleep with it on my face over night, when I woke the next morning, the bumps were going, but the face was dry. However, my moisturizer solved the dryness problem.</li>
            <li> i wish i could upload pics to you guys what kind od s*** i&#x27;ve got    the case is totally damaged</li>
            <li> I got it today. When I took the bottle out of the box, the outside of bottle felt so oily and greasy. When I open the bottle， it was half empty somehow! I just tried it on and I couldn&#x27;t really feel the cooling feel everyone was talking about.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for adult acne and very good seller.</li>
            <li> very good, but be careful don&#x27;t keep it away from your eyes.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and helped dry some zits, but it didn&#x27;t prevent more pimples from forming and didn&#x27;t work on every pimple. Perhaps my acne is too severe for this masque. It sure felt refreshing on my face, but did nothing at all to clear my face. Except to dry one or two pimples if left overnight. Still, some pimples would still be there the next morning, sometimes bigger and redder.</li>
            <li> It works great! I though it helped me. It soothed my skin. I dont think I have many acne anymore so I stopped using it. But I still like to use it for fun. It&#x27;s great! But then again, everyone&#x27;s skin is different. I had medium oily skin and this works great.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son as he wanted something to sooth dry, chapped skin... this treatment worked great and was very soothing.</li>
            <li> good mask to dry out unwanted blemishes but I do find this mask not any Better than a $4 tube of queene Helene sulfer mask. You can forget about working out a sweat at the gym or yoga the next day because the smell of the mask lingers and comes out of your pores 12 hours after application. Not a pleasant thing at all.</li>
            <li> I had very bad cystic acne and after doing a research for many products, I came to find this product on Amazon. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it and after trying it, I felt so pleased with the results. I dont have as many pimples and healing the ones I previously had. I use it everyday twice a day</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean and pores tight.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Beware though! When you first start using it, you are going to break out. BAD. Use it just once a week to start, but no more than twice a week once you get used to it. And when I say BAD, I mean BAD. But once the product has gotten rid of that first rounds of toxins, your skin is going to clear up and look great. Don&#x27;t give up. But don&#x27;t try this for the first time before any big event!</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin. For several years my skin was pretty clear, but not sure what happened I started to break out a few months ago. I used several other products and tried numerous cremes and lotion. 3 months ago I started to use this Sulfur cooling masque every other night and it helped a lot to calm down the skin and clear the blemishes. This one has eucalptus in there, whereas the standard PTR sulfur masque does not contain it. I found that by adding the eucaplytus oil helps to keep the masque moist for a longer time and it does give a cooling effect on the skin. I just make sure that I leave it only not more than 10 minutes, as indicated on the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does dry out the skin if not used properly as it helps to dry out the blemishes. What I like to do is to apply another moisturizing masque after this one just to put back some hydration back to the skin to balance out. I found that if the skin gets dried out too much, the blemishes gets actually worse as the skin tries to produce more oil to compensate for the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that I&#x27;m conscious about is the around the eye area. I love the Vitaville [[ASIN:B00GJ48NVO Argan Oil: Virgin Cold Pressed, Grade A, Odorless. No Preservatives, No Dyes, No Animal Testing. 4 FL OZ, Super Size.]] and apply it around the eyes right after the masque so that it doesn&#x27;t get dry and wrinkly. This combination works great for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask to use for keeping your skin clear.  I have sensitive skin and it does wonders when a blemish begins to pop up and also works well as a preventative mask.</li>
            <li> when i apply it close to my eyes area, it just burn after I wash it off. but not a bad mask.</li>
            <li> I think it is good,  smell very nice and feel cool when apply it on face. but seems can&#x27;t stop break up when it occur.</li>
            <li> I use the mask on a regular basis, its a great product. But that is what is expected from Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING for my acne, from drugstore, high end, and prescription and nothing has worked as well as this product! I am now devoted too this product and will continue to use it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!!</li>
            <li> read up on parabens and you will also want to stay away from them! Peter Thomas Roth needs to get with it and use chemicals that are safe!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. I don&#x27;t use it on my whole face. I use it on acne and it kills it with in 2-3days. I use a dot an leave it over night..but only a dot on the acne</li>
            <li> This masque was delivered on time and packaged well. Unfortunately, it was a much lighter color than I remembered. It was more of a grayish tone was opposed to light green. Also, the masque was not as firm my last one purchased from Sephora. It was a little soft says if it melted. However, it may have been due to the warm climate - I do live in the Bahamas :).</li>
            <li> The smell is repugnant &amp; it really lasts no mattter how much I tried to wash away the smell. Honestly I did not find the product to be any better than the over the counter masks you can buy at any local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Great for spot treatment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this PTR sulfur mask for over five years now. I only need one per year (very cost effective). I never make a move without this sulfur mask. I use it mainly as a spot treatment anywhere I get pimples (i.e. face, back, chest, etc.). Whenever I travel this sulfur mask comes along. Great product!</li>
            <li> For Aestheticians this is one of the best products on the market. I call this the million dollar mask. I used this a lot with acne skin and after dong extractions. this mask is very cleansing and soothing and after removing the mask, the skin shows very little irritation.</li>
            <li> This mask is AMAZING.  I have been struggling with acne for the past year.  This mask clears things up and dries things out overnight.  I highly recommend it for people with oily/acneic skin.</li>
            <li> So I dunno if it&#x27;s hormones or what the heck happened but I hit a certain age and BLAMMO my skin SUCKS. I have acne that would rival any teen boy. I have tried MULTIPLE other high end products and until I tried the Peter Thomas Roth line I was not getting relief. I like that the products have medicated and homeopathic aspects to support them. They don&#x27;t have strong odors, and don&#x27;t bleach my sheets. I will be a repeat customer - oh and a little goes a long way.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this does flake REALLY bad if left on too long</li>
            <li> this is awesome for acne, and safe during pregnancy, smells much better than other sulfur products on the market, better price per ounce than Olay sulfur mask, beware drying effects if you have dry skin to start with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review much on Amazon, but I have to write about how much this product improved my skin. I recently went off the pill and almost as soon as I did, my skin exploded into the worst acne I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. My back was so broken out into deep, painful cystic acne that I was devastated. I did everything; washed my sports bras after wearing them once, washed twice a day with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide cleansers, put leave-on benzoyl peroxide gels on at night. I tried getting more sun to help dry out the skin, to no avail. The only product that gave me a glimmer of hope was a small tube of 6% sulfur mask that came with a Walgreens-brand Proactiv type kit. I searched online for more sulfur products and came across this one, which is 10% sulfur. I would put it on at night, let it dry, and then leave it on until morning when I would rinse it off with a salicylic acid (Neutrogena clear body wash). The difference was incredible. I use it every night and my skin problems have almost completely evaporated. I no longer have painful cysts, no blackheads, the skin is healthy but not overly dry. I have found that overuse of benzoyl peroxide gels can leave my skin painfully dry and cracked, this product does no such thing. I have recommended it to all of my friends, I really can&#x27;t say enough about how much of an improvement I got from using this regularly. Please, if you have tried everything and you are not allergic to sulfur, try this. It could change everything for you.</li>
            <li> It is not the first time I bought this. It is really good, even okay for normal to dry skin (like me).</li>
            <li> This mask really helps clear my skin.  I make sure to use it at least once a week and I notice a great difference in my skin when I use it.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels with this on and better yet I love the way my skin looks when I take it off!!  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Gives you a refreshing and clean feeling after use. However, better followed by hydration products to prevent skin from dehydrating.</li>
            <li> This stuff is stinky, but absolutely incredible for clearing up your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I switched to a cheaper brand after running out of the PTS sulfur mask and my face started breaking out again.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this stuff once a week for a deep clean and dab it on zits overnight, and they&#x27;ll be defeated and shriveled up by morning.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is strong, effective, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my crazy sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;AND it&#x27;s $10 cheaper here than it is at sephora or ulta. So happy I checked amazon!</li>
            <li> best stuff for any skin issue.  i sleep in the stuff.  best mask for skin bumps</li>
            <li> Awesome. ..i mean i am speechless.  You will love the cooling sensation and yuor acne going away. Its pricey but there is enough in a jar to last you a whole year. Its one of the most awesome products i have used. Makes yuor whiteheads come up.then i stick nosestrip and take it out. Great. Love it too much !!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because of all the wonderful reviews. After trying this product for myself, I can honestly say that it works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 27, have combination/oily skin, and have always had acne flareups (particularly on my cheeks and forehead), and have a difficult time finding products that I can use on my skin overnight to reduce the size of the blemish. Enter: Peter Thomas Roth! This mask woks great! I have used it for about two weeks, for a total of four times. It doesn&#x27;t over-dry or cause peeling on my skin. It has a thick texture with a strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could probably use this as an overnight cream but just \\&quot;spotting\\&quot; the areas where you are breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this purchase and would buy this product again. Alittle goes a long way, so it has certainly lasted me awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this same Peter Thomas Roth masque in stores (Sephora) before and was excited since the one that I ordered off of Amazon came at a &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; price point. That said, I believe that it is a fake product; as it came partially unsealed with a runny liquid in between the container and the plastic wrap. The masque that I ordered off of Amazon has a much stronger (almost chemical-y) scent and it may be my mind getting the best of me, but it does not seem to work as well as the masque that I had bought in-stores.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the eucalyptus would overpower the sulfur smell, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ll still use it though, it seems to help control my acne well.  I&#x27;m almost 40 and still dealing with acne, so at this point I&#x27;d almost try anything that works.  I use it 2-3 times per week on my T-zone and have noticed reduced size and duration of pimples.</li>
            <li> I feel like my pores are throroughly cleaned out after using this product. Since sulfur is involved, I get hints of an egg-like smell for a day or two, but it&#x27;s not the end of the world. The mask also doesn&#x27;t need to stay on long either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and just recently started having acne problems (sensitive break outs on cheeks, redness, and enlarged pores). I use Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s facial wash and wanted to use an exfoliate with a little more power. I purchased the PTR Sulfur Cooling Masque at a time where my face was going berserk. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3-4 weeks and use it 2x week. I&#x27;m finding that it relaxes my skin and my brown spots are slowly disappearing. It does leave a lingering sulfuric smell on my face, which I can smell the day after I&#x27;ve used the mask. I don&#x27;t mind it so much but, fair warning, the smell does linger. Overall, my skin has improved but it is not completely clear. Other than diet and wearing less makeup, I have found that being consistent with my facial products has been beneficial. I would recommend this product and advise to use sparingly depending on your skin type and acne problems.</li>
            <li> I love his products! My skin has never looked better...it even color and gives such smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and my skin has never been clearer.  This is a great brand and product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it! It helps keep my skin clear and oiliness to a minimum. My skin stays shine-free for the week, until the next time I apply this mask. It&#x27;s also not irritating to the eyes, as I&#x27;ve found some to be.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Not sure why cheaper than therapeutic mask...</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great... but a week later I experienced the worst breakout I have had in years, this wasnt just &amp;#34;purging.&amp;#34; I returned this item and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> i love using this mask it has helped regulate my oils a bit. the mask itself has a refreshing feel to it</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product! It was recommended to me in a book &amp;#34;The Skin Type Solution&amp;#34; (which I would also recommend). I have used this for about 10 years to calm my sensitive skin and combat acne. I recently gave it to my teenage kids to use when they got terrible teen acne, and they have had amazing results, and beautiful clear skin. When you put this on your irritated skin it immediately soothes it and takes that itchy, &amp;#34;squeeze-me&amp;#34; feeling away from pimples. They wear it overnight as a spot treatment, or use it as an allover masque ten minutes before washing, or (most recent finding by my daughter) keep it in the shower and wash affected areas with it (yes, keep it out of your eyes). It has micro granules in it and somewhat exfoliates your skin, calming it at the same time. I find the scent pleasant, more eucalyptus, not really sulfury at all. I agree that it&#x27;s a good value b/c a little goes a long way. I&#x27;d be wary of copies and would buy it from a reputable source-- I&#x27;ve had luck at Skinstore.com. I hope PTR never stops making this!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin that is prone to pimples. This sulfur masks helps me to dry the pimples and clear the skin. It is not for everyone, since some people may not like the sulfur smell or be allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask in the place of several Mario Badescu masks that I had tried in the past to clear up my acne. I started developing cystic acne on my cheeks and even prescription creams weren&#x27;t really helping, and were causing my skin to dry up in places and darken. This mask is the real deal. Not only do you get a ton of product for the price, a little goes a long way. I spread a thin layer over my skin, and when I had washed it off, my pimples looked &amp; felt subdued. It has a strong eucalyptus smell, but nothing that is repugnant. A little medicated, but I think the smell is fine. I also use it at night as spot treatment--in the morning when I wake up and take it off the pimples have dried up. The best part about this product is that, depending on your usage, it does not dry out your skin to the point of peeling and flaking. It feels strong &amp; works fast, but it doesn&#x27;t ruin your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as strong as i thought it would be but my face feels refreshed after using it. I use it only once a week, perhaps using more frequently would be too much but for once a week usage its good enough.</li>
            <li> This product is just OK, because I don&#x27;t like the smell. It smell not good  and make me feel uncomfortable. Also no much effects.</li>
            <li> Great mask! Takes my fine lines down 65% after one use!!</li>
            <li> As different kinds of ance caused by different reasons, no drugs or anything else could be useful for every people. It could make face feel cool, but seems not work for me.</li>
            <li> This is awesome for the day you wake up with a pimple. This gets rid of it right away.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife. She love it and said it worked as she expected. I might need order more for her. Although she has soft and smooth skin, she takes care of her skin so much</li>
            <li> Hands down the Best mask for oily, acne skin! Have used this mask for my son and daughter&#x27;s for years with great results. Does not irritate skin, if used correctly! Buy it if you have oily skin!! Can be used daily and also as a spot treatment!</li>
            <li> This has really helped my teenage son&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well. I&#x27;m a big fan of PTR products and I&#x27;d rate this somewhere in the dead center between the line&#x27;s best and worst products. It leaves a funky lingering sulfur smell after washing it off which can be a little annoying and embarrassing if you&#x27;re not keen on smelling like sulfur all day</li>
            <li> It feels comfortable to use. I want this product to help cure with my blackheads on the nose.&lt;br /&gt;Till now I have kept using it for several weeks and the condition is slightly better. The result&lt;br /&gt;remains to be seen.</li>
            <li> This masque feels great. It&#x27;s really smooth, and I could see an improvement after using it just a few times.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping product works wonders but too about a week and and to get results definitely a winning face product</li>
            <li> I really really love this product, and have been using it weekly for over a year. I&#x27;m 25, have normal to dry skin, and have occasional small hormonal breakouts and hyperpigmentation. I mainly seek a smooth texture, less noticeable fine lines, and reduced acne/redness/hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the good: it works very very well. So effective. I put on a thin layer after cleansing and leave it on for about ~20 minutes, then rinse and follow with my other products. Usually I instantly notice a clarity in my skin. My skin looks smoother, brighter, and my pores look smaller. If I have any blemishes, they usually look less inflamed, smaller, and not as red. The next morning my skin will continue to look even better, with a noticeable reduced size in pores and blemishes, faded hyperpigmentation, a smooth texture, and firmed skin. I also use it as an overnight spot treatment for particularly large/bad breakouts, placing a thick blob on the area and rinsing it off in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when used all over my face, sometimes I find this very painful for the first few minutes I have it on until it dries. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and this is one of the first products that has caused this kind of painful reaction (I think due to the eucalyptus). I have noticed that it is when I have it close to my eyes and around my mouth, so I&#x27;ve limited to putting it only on the top of my nose, cheeks, jaw, chin, and forehead and have kept it as far away from my eyes, mouth, and the sides of my nose as possible. If I do not, it burns and makes my eyes water, and I have to wait a couple minutes for the painful sensation to go away. But, all this being said, there is never any evidence of irritation when I remove it. I never have any inflammation, dry patches, etc. after using this. So, despite the occasional pain when I am not careful and put it close to my mouth/eyes accidentally (totally my fault), it is still such an effective and amazing product that I continue to use it and purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my advice is to definitely patch test and be careful when you first get it, just to make sure that it won&#x27;t burn your skin or cause any irritation, and to keep it away from sensitive areas as much as possible. After these precautions, it works wonderfully at clearing acne, fading hyperpigmentation, smoothing, and brightening the skin - much more so than many other masks I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small tub lasts a long time, about 7-9 months of weekly use all over my face with some spot treatments here and there. Amazon has the best price for it that I&#x27;ve found ($25 when I last bought it vs. $40 at Sephora).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware of the sulfur/eucalyptus/medicinal smell that can make your hair/towel smell faintly of sulfur until you shower if you&#x27;re not careful, like myself, when rinsing. It is also a thick white material that you need to completely wash away, otherwise you will get white spots on your towels (that don&#x27;t stain and do wash away easily, but are unsightly while they are there). I will also mention that when it dries, it can flake off your face and leave some small white flakes where you were sitting or on your clothes, so be aware of that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, this is my skincare routine (all products I adore), so this could affect how the product works for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning -&lt;br /&gt;PTR Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel with a Clarisonic&lt;br /&gt;PTR AHA/BHA Acne Clearing Gel all over my face&lt;br /&gt;Cerave AM Facial Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Shiseido Ibuki eye cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night -&lt;br /&gt;Cerave Foaming Facial Wash with a Clarisonic&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Capsules&lt;br /&gt;Cerave PM Facial Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Shiseido Ibuki eye cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PTR Sulfur Cooling Mask once a week for ~20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Glycolic, Lactic, and Salicylic Acids Professional Chemical Peel brand (used together) once a week for ~10 minutesase it.

            <li> 10% of sulfur proved to be too strong for my sensitive skin. Woke up the next day with swells and blisters.</li>
