            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>It was great, but I wasn&#x27;t persuaded that it wasn&#x27;t harmful.</li>
            <li>was told that this product was great for hydration of skin pre-</li>
            <li>I use it under my foundation and that works great.</li>
            <li>It sure does work for us!!</li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when it turned out be amazing!  </li>
            <li>Truth be told, the cream that she put on my hands there was amazing!</li>
            <li>It has made a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li>I was suckered into buying this at a booth at the fair.  </li>
            <li>Bought it at The CNE Exhibition fair</li>
            <li>Its supposed to be good and everything</li>
            <li>Bought it at a county fair.</li>
            <li>I agree that it is pricey, but I found it to be moisturizing as well as good for sunburns.  </li>
            <li>Bought this at our State Fair.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion at a craft fair about 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>It so good on the skin.</li>
            <li>It is a great product that also doesnt have a smell like most lotions do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li>You could get much better out there and cheaper!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>This lotion has done an amazing job keeping my skin hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought this at a fair to try since the sample made my hands look better.</li>
            <li>Thought I would be nice and buy something from someone else to see if it works like they said.</li>
            <li>If you want good hand cream, I suggest AHAVA products, also available on amazon.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m impressed as is my wife.  </li>
            <li>I also bought it at the fair and wished I&#x27;d seen some of these reviews first!</li>
            <li>and my hands feel instantly better.</li>
            <li>We bought some at a Home Show and love it.  </li>
            <li>Like most reviewers I bought this cream at a convention.</li>
            <li>I was amazed in the change and appearence of mostly my thighs.</li>
            <li>When they applied it on my hands it felt smooth, but once I put the product they sold me on at home, it made my hands sticky!  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Even the steroid creams and $450 prescriptions from the dermatologist weren&#x27;t touching it.</li>
            <li>I started using the Hawaiian Moon Aloe Cream on the spot and within about 4 days it started looking better.</li>
            <li>is looking much better.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I love this stuff, and the company is, well dishonorable.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>I get better results from the $3.00 of Suave lotion.</li>
            <li>If you have cracked skin or abrasions you&#x27;re going to get better results from using lanolin as opposed to aloe.</li>
            <li>It does what it says it will do and more.</li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I found this product from a friend.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at the dental convention and love it.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my skin and its a nice smell unlike other lotions and it is great for skin and good for rashes and burns and soars galore</li>
            <li>I loved it at first, it did seem to make my skin softer.</li>
            <li>This is non-greasy cream that is the best I&#x27;ve found for dry skin (face or hands).</li>
            <li>I have just ordered more today from their website and I loved it so much I decided to order their eye cream and try it.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, company does not honor return policy.  </li>
            <li>I got away with buying only one jar, and it&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li>I only bought it, because I was a vendor at this fair, selling Mary Kay!</li>
            <li>I love that afterwards my skin feels amazing and soft.</li>
            <li>My sister and I split the show special at the Indianapolis Gift and Hobby Show.  </li>
            <li>we were both charged full price.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because my dad, who has terribly dry, cracked skin on his hands has great success with it.</li>
            <li>and it started to stop hurting and heal quickly.</li>
            <li>So I received $30 worth of product and was charged $60.</li>
            <li>She developed an infection that lasted more than a week before it was under control.</li>
            <li>It was delivered promptly and the cream was as good as other creams.  </li>
            <li>She is still being treated for the discoloration of the right side of her face.</li>
            <li>Bought this product at a home show and it makes my skin sticky at first then drys it out.  </li>
            <li>i first bought it for my son who had a rash on his face and after applying for 2 days</li>
            <li>Cetyl alcohol is one of the first ingredients.</li>
            <li>It does not make me break out, works well under makeup, and leaves my face feeling more even overall.</li>
            <li>all I can say is I LOVE this stuff, and I am buying my second jar today.</li>
            <li>I will never buy any other kind of skin lotion again.</li>
            <li>First, this isn&#x27;t really lotion - it is aloe.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so upset, it leaves my hands sticky and even more dry than what they were.  </li>
            <li>I also use it under my eyes and on my noes which has had a bit too much sun and the skin in this area</li>
            <li>Even if this product works- their business practices leave much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I got lured in at a convention.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the stuff, but I was contacted at a convention, like many of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li>I really like this because it soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t have the same feel as lotion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Organic Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower Oil), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Carrageenan (Red Seaweed Thickener), Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot Kernel Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Silk Protein Amino Acid Blend</li>
            <li>I love it, and I am NOT an employee as a previous reviewer suggested.  </li>
            <li>I loved the lotion but at first I felt it may not be working and also skeptical that it can&#x27;t be washed off.</li>
            <li>I used it 6 times a day sparingly since I got it for 40 bucks with travel ones too even when it was normally $60.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have fairly normal skin</li>
            <li>The product itself is truly fantastic, the salesman (at the local product fair) gave me a 9 oz jar and four small travels for $40, promising me I could buy the same quantity for the same price from their website.</li>
            <li>I have a combination skin type (oily t-zone and normal</li>
            <li>and then the normal form letter for returns.</li>
            <li>However, as it advertised that ALOE, it&#x27;s supposed to be only ALOE Vera, right?</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I finally decided to look up reviews and found these on here (should have looked first).</li>
            <li>She said there was no problem with any of the ingredients and some of them are clearly beneficial.</li>
            <li>and i completely forgot about it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a sample of this cream that a friend gave me for 3 days and the spot is nearly healed.</li>
            <li>My skin is soooo sensitive and my son is a red-head, so we have tried it all....</li>
            <li>Before she could get to the doctor she developed a fever</li>
            <li>I do not typically like lotion because it often leaves excess, but I use</li>
            <li>I would recommend for those looking for an alternative to lotion that have normal to slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li>NO DRY SKIN...</li>
            <li>I put a little on before I went to bed and some first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>She applied a little the first night with no problem.</li>
            <li>My husband was the first to say that this cream leaves his hands dryer than before, and after using it a few times I have to agree.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, that tends to get very dry.</li>
            <li>My younger son gets very dry skin (might be mild psoriasis) - using this cream &amp;#34;fixes&amp;#34; his patches in a few days.  </li>

            <li> I ended up with a large container and 4 small ones for $40.</li>
            <li> , I get 3 additional large jars and 4 small jars.  </li>
            <li> I ran out and her skin has gone back to being dry, cracked, and red.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I was dense on this issue, but glad I finally found out that this stuff is not good for my hands.</li>
            <li> As a long distance runner I get chafes on my skin, especially when I compete.  </li>
            <li> The next afternoon she started feeling ill, her face began to swell, hurt and turn dark red on her nose and the whole right side of her face.</li>
            <li> The lotion left my hands dry and the company does not answer their phones or process returns.</li>
            <li> Because I regularly wash my hands, my skin has become dry and started to crack.</li>
            <li> I suffer from very dry skin and ezcema and after my dr told me this, I started putting this on daily.</li>
            <li> I was also concerned because of the long list of &amp;#34;improvements&amp;#34; they claimed.</li>
            <li> I ended up leaving my jar for her to use, and she commented that as long as she puts it on in the mornings, her skin doesn&#x27;t bother her all day.  </li>
            <li> I have had minor abrasions on my hands and it seems to heal them a bit quicker.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses it on his very rough hands and its the only thing that works for him.</li>
            <li> and my hands are so cracked and dry</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that gets so dry in the winter that it cracks and bleeds.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt help my dry hands at all.</li>
            <li> I had her use it in the morning, and her skin did not appear dry all day.  </li>
            <li> but it gets dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> You really have to keep using it daily and wash your hands with a non irritating soap (no perfumes) before you apply.</li>
            <li> It did not live up to the hype we had heard.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of my money !</li>
            <li> It keeps moving down my hand and getting ever larger.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review a lot of products, but if you are looking for a less chemical laden option for skin cream that actually does something for your skin, this is it.</li>
            <li> My mom had very dry skin on her arms that she tended to scratch.  </li>
            <li> I had a sore on my right leg that was weird and wasn&#x27;t healing.</li>
            <li> My son has HORRIBLE skin and in one application it is 80% better!!,</li>
            <li> Now I have 3 big jars and 4 small jars that will not be used.</li>
            <li> However, this product worked extremely well for other purposes.</li>
            <li> I used a little on my forehead a week after my sunburn healed and now im seriously DRY and ITCHY!  </li>
            <li> Certainly not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but soaks into my skin almost instantly, it&#x27;s not at all greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any discernable scent.</li>
            <li> have used all of the .75 jar and typically leave it at my desk at work to use every day.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted, it actually made my hands worse.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did make the eczema more dry, itchy, and painful at times.</li>
            <li> BUT, after I could not stand my worse skin, I started searching on its website and found these following ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY not smooth or moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I am disabled, a wheelchair user, and prone to pressure sores.</li>
            <li> My wife and I agree it is no better than the Aloe Vera Gel we purchase at Target for much less money.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> $80. wasted!</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t be scared off by a few negative people.</li>
            <li> The customer service response was a short we are sorry statement ... never happened before......</li>
            <li> As other reviewers stated, this stuff dries out the skin even worse than it was.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a fair because I have terribly bad eczema so bad that it would crack deep painful fissures</li>
            <li> Give it a try don&#x27;t believe the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Even though it is thick in the jar, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or oily feeling to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I like how thick it goes on.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a less expensive Aloe Vera product.</li>
            <li> After the third time i have used it, I started having really bad acnes.</li>
            <li> I noticed a improvement when I had a deep painful crack in my skin</li>
            <li> however deceptive practices are never good in business.</li>
            <li> and it is only a week or two into the really cold weather!  </li>
            <li> Makes my eczema worse, when they promised it would heal it in 5 days.</li>
            <li> Oh, did I mention the jars all have false bottoms?  </li>
            <li> Then, my skin really dried out so bad that when I itched it, my nails would leave blood blisters under my skin.</li>
            <li> My 13 yr old son had a nasty sunburn on his face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the Boston Marathon in 2014 and was skeptical (it seemed like a multilevel market type product).</li>
            <li> Use it for my mother in law who has psoriasis and terrible dry skin.</li>
            <li> He said it was antiviral if it cures warts and cold sores.</li>
            <li> I have been battling a particularly nasty spot of eczema for the past 4 months.</li>
            <li> Was VERY SKEPTICAL.  </li>
            <li> My wife than had a really bad sunburn and after one day of use my wife&#x27;s sunburn cleared up.</li>

            <li> I was shocked at the results.</li>
            <li> WORSE than my sunburn!!!</li>
            <li> Save urself the money and do not buy this crap.</li>
            <li> The company and product are awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product at the Boston Marathon in 2014 and was skeptical (it seemed like a multilevel market type product). Imagine my surprise when it turned out be amazing!  As a long distance runner I get chafes on my skin, especially when I compete.  Using the cream heals these about 3X faster than the more expensive stuff I was using before.  My younger son gets very dry skin (might be mild psoriasis) - using this cream &amp;#34;fixes&amp;#34; his patches in a few days.  Even he was amazed.  I don&#x27;t review a lot of products, but if you are looking for a less chemical laden option for skin cream that actually does something for your skin, this is it.</li>
            <li> Certainly not worth the money.  My wife and I agree it is no better than the Aloe Vera Gel we purchase at Target for much less money.  Save your money and buy a less expensive Aloe Vera product.</li>
            <li> I bought this about two weeks ago at a cooking show and she sold me on it because it was made from aloe, it was unscented, and I did like the way my hands felt after she put it on. I was hesitant so she kept throwing in extra travel size containers. I ended up with a large container and 4 small ones for $40. Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using it multiple times a day for about two weeks and my hands are so cracked and dry and it is painful and it is only a week or two into the really cold weather!  I finally decided to look up reviews and found these on here (should have looked first). I immediately stopped using it and put on some cocoa butter and my hands feel instantly better. Not sure why I was dense on this issue, but glad I finally found out that this stuff is not good for my hands. I&#x27;ll be sending it back for a refund. I hope they will honor it as they say they will. Of course, I&#x27;ll have to pay to ship it but I guess that&#x27;s what I get for being too trusting of a product like this.</li>
            <li> Bought this product at a home show and it makes my skin sticky at first then drys it out.  What a waste of money!  I bought 3 jars.</li>
            <li> This is non-greasy cream that is the best I&#x27;ve found for dry skin (face or hands).</li>
            <li> The company and product are awful.  The lotion left my hands dry and the company does not answer their phones or process returns.</li>
            <li> Not the cream I thought it was.</li>
            <li> My mother in law gave me this as a gift. I wish I could give it back. I used a little on my forehead a week after my sunburn healed and now im seriously DRY and ITCHY!  WORSE than my sunburn!!! This is HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Very good. Non greasy</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I got lured in at a convention. Truth be told, the cream that she put on my hands there was amazing! I got away with buying only one jar, and it&#x27;s a good thing! As other reviewers stated, this stuff dries out the skin even worse than it was. I&#x27;m convinced that whatever is in the jar THEY use, is NOT what&#x27;s in the jars they sell. Just my theory. Either way, save your money. This does not work. I haven&#x27;t tried to return what I have left, but will look into it. If you want good hand cream, I suggest AHAVA products, also available on amazon.</li>
            <li> I got this at a home show in Iowa recently. I have dry skin that gets so dry in the winter that it cracks and bleeds. This lotion has done an amazing job keeping my skin hydrated throughout the day. I love that afterwards my skin feels amazing and soft. There&#x27;s no residue left and it&#x27;s not sticky like a lot of lotions I&#x27;ve tried. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this from a convention like others. after I have tried for several times, my skin became drier. I felt irritated on my face. However, as it advertised that ALOE, it&#x27;s supposed to be only ALOE Vera, right? BUT, after I could not stand my worse skin, I started searching on its website and found these following ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Organic Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower Oil), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Carrageenan (Red Seaweed Thickener), Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot Kernel Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Silk Protein Amino Acid Blend (Sodium L-Pyrrolidone Carboxylate, Sodium Lactate, L’Arginine, L-Aspartic Acid, L-Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid, Glycine, L-Alanine, L-Serine, L-Valine, L-Proline, L-threonine, L-Isoleucine, L-Histidine, L-Phenylalanine), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Organic Yucca Schidigera (Yucca), Organic Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile), Organic Joeniculum Vulgare (Fennel), Organic Panax Ginseng (Chinese Ginseng), Organic Rosa Canina (Rosehip Seed Oil), Camellia Oil, Organic Calendula Succus (Calendula), Organic Usnea Spp. (Usnea), Vitis Vinifera (Grapeseed Oil), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Citric Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can these ingredients be gentle to human face? Citric Acid in Moisture Cream? After the third time i have used it, I started having really bad acnes. So, I stopped using it and started figuring this out by searching for reviews. I wish I found these helpful reviews before I used it.</li>
            <li> It was delivered promptly and the cream was as good as other creams.  It did not live up to the hype we had heard.</li>
            <li> We bought some at a Home Show and love it.  My daughter has terrible hormonal acne and it cleared it up in 4 days!  I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li> Like most reviewers I bought this cream at a convention. I like the feel of it when the demonstrator put it on my hands, but I should have been alarmed when he said one jar costs $62, put if I paid $129, I get 3 additional large jars and 4 small jars.  My husband was the first to say that this cream leaves his hands dryer than before, and after using it a few times I have to agree. Now I have 3 big jars and 4 small jars that will not be used.</li>
            <li> I lost 72 lbs in 9 months time. I was on a low fat diet and my skin got alot drier than it already was. I bought this at a fair to try since the sample made my hands look better. I was amazed in the change and appearence of mostly my thighs. that&#x27;s where I had lost alot of the weight. But I use it everywhere and it has improved my skin immensely. I went back to using Aveeno for 1 week and saw a change just in that time so I am back on the Hawaiian Moon.&lt;br /&gt;A definate must to try. It doesn&#x27;t happen overnight but you should see the difference in a weeks time.</li>
            <li> I was suspicious of whether there was some harm done to the skin because the application of this to my face brightened up the color and made my cheeks almost red. It was great, but I wasn&#x27;t persuaded that it wasn&#x27;t harmful. I was also concerned because of the long list of &amp;#34;improvements&amp;#34; they claimed. I showed the jar with its list of ingredients to my dermatologist. She said there was no problem with any of the ingredients and some of them are clearly beneficial. She also suggested it might help keep my fingernails from splitting.</li>
            <li> I was suckered into buying this at a booth at the fair.  When they applied it on my hands it felt smooth, but once I put the product they sold me on at home, it made my hands sticky!  DEFINITELY not smooth or moisturizing.</li>
            <li> bought this at neurosurgery conference.  was told that this product was great for hydration of skin pre- and post-surgery.  Overpriced for doing nothing.</li>
            <li> Use it for my mother in law who has psoriasis and terrible dry skin. Her skin has cleared up and reddness has gone away.Love this product!!!!  I ran out and her skin has gone back to being dry, cracked, and red. I can&#x27;t wait until I can restock up on this lotion!</li>
            <li> Hated it!! Bought it at The CNE Exhibition fair and it doesnt help my dry hands at all. Its supposed to be good and everything but everytime i use this my hands are drier. Save urself the money and do not buy this crap. You could get much better out there and cheaper! I bought a 9oz jar with 6 sample jars for $40. Complete waste of my money !</li>
            <li> My aunt bought two jars and gave me one. It stayed under my bathroom counter for months and i completely forgot about it.  One day my hands began itching for no reason.  Lotion was not helping and neither was benadryl. I pulled out this cream and it instantly stopped  the itching. I also just started using Retin A on the skin of my neck which caused it to itch terribly. I used the cream again and it worked perfectly. I love this.</li>
            <li> i first bought it for my son who had a rash on his face and after applying for 2 days its was cleared up. My wife than had a really bad sunburn and after one day of use my wife&#x27;s sunburn cleared up. I use it for my skin and its a nice smell unlike other lotions and it is great for skin and good for rashes and burns and soars galore</li>
            <li> Bought it at a county fair. Was VERY SKEPTICAL.  Used it 2x a day. One week later a bunch of 20 something&#x27;s tried to pick me up. I&#x27;m in my forties !  My 13 yr old son had a nasty sunburn on his face. Not only did it help his sunburn , but healed up his acne !!</li>
            <li> I also purchased this at a health convention.  I love it, and I am NOT an employee as a previous reviewer suggested.  I agree that it is pricey, but I found it to be moisturizing as well as good for sunburns.  Even though it is thick in the jar, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or oily feeling to my skin.  It soaks in immediately.  My mom had very dry skin on her arms that she tended to scratch.  I had her use it in the morning, and her skin did not appear dry all day.  I ended up leaving my jar for her to use, and she commented that as long as she puts it on in the mornings, her skin doesn&#x27;t bother her all day.  So for those who bought it and aren&#x27;t going to use it....send it my way!</li>
            <li> Great!!! I bought this at an convention and it is everything they said it would be.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first, it did seem to make my skin softer. Then, my skin really dried out so bad that when I itched it, my nails would leave blood blisters under my skin. It&#x27;s the worst lotion ever. I also bought it at the fair and wished I&#x27;d seen some of these reviews first!</li>
            <li> I bought this at a fair because I have terribly bad eczema so bad that it would crack deep painful fissures and I&#x27;m a hair dresser! My hands are always in water or washing hair/ my hands(I only cut hair). I also got blisters on my hands sometimes and it would itch badly. I tried oils and lotion, everyone at work knows me as the lotion lady. The sales rep knew what he was talking about. He said it was antiviral if it cures warts and cold sores. I loved the lotion but at first I felt it may not be working and also skeptical that it can&#x27;t be washed off. I used it 6 times a day sparingly since I got it for 40 bucks with travel ones too even when it was normally $60. I noticed a improvement when I had a deep painful crack in my skin and it started to stop hurting and heal quickly. The rest of it improved. I was shocked at the results. You really have to keep using it daily and wash your hands with a non irritating soap (no perfumes) before you apply. It takes a while to kick in at the start as your skin adjusts, people. Give it a try don&#x27;t believe the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Bought this at our State Fair. I should have known it was a scam. This stuff immediately dries out my skin. Makes my eczema worse, when they promised it would heal it in 5 days. No wonder it is so drying. Cetyl alcohol is one of the first ingredients. I should have looked closer. $80. wasted!</li>
            <li> I was at a Home Show in NJ, they had a vendor there what they put on my hands was something totally different than what I bought! I&#x27;m so upset, it leaves my hands sticky and even more dry than what they were.  I&#x27;m returning this product!</li>
            <li> I have been battling a particularly nasty spot of eczema for the past 4 months. It keeps moving down my hand and getting ever larger. Even the steroid creams and $450 prescriptions from the dermatologist weren&#x27;t touching it. I&#x27;ve been using a sample of this cream that a friend gave me for 3 days and the spot is nearly healed. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Huh - I am suprised by some of the reviews!  First, this isn&#x27;t really lotion - it is aloe.  Big difference.  That being said, I have fairly normal skin but it gets dry in the winter.  I really like this because it soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t have the same feel as lotion.  I have had minor abrasions on my hands and it seems to heal them a bit quicker.  I do not typically like lotion because it often leaves excess, but I use have used all of the .75 jar and typically leave it at my desk at work to use every day.  I haven&#x27;t done that in quite some time.  I would recommend for those looking for an alternative to lotion that have normal to slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this product at a home show. I was amazed at the results. I had a sore on my right leg that was weird and wasn&#x27;t healing. I started using the Hawaiian Moon Aloe Cream on the spot and within about 4 days it started looking better. I put a little on before I went to bed and some first thing in the morning.  I also use it under my eyes and on my noes which has had a bit too much sun and the skin in this area is looking much better. Very nice product. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable. I bought it because my dad, who has terribly dry, cracked skin on his hands has great success with it. Because I regularly wash my hands, my skin has become dry and started to crack. I&#x27;ve tried just about every product on the market to help, so I thought I would try this. It has made a remarkable difference. Next time, I will buy the big jar.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I love this stuff, and the company is, well dishonorable.  The product itself is truly fantastic, the salesman (at the local product fair) gave me a 9 oz jar and four small travels for $40, promising me I could buy the same quantity for the same price from their website. NOT.  Not only that, they don&#x27;t come close in price. 4 ounces for $30. Yikes. Oh, did I mention the jars all have false bottoms?  They look 2\\&quot; deep, but in reality, the inside is only 1 1/2\\&quot; deep. Shysters.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product as it was a gift from my cousin who said it would help with my hand eczema. Unfortunately, it did make the eczema more dry, itchy, and painful at times. However, this product worked extremely well for other purposes. I have a combination skin type (oily t-zone and normal/dry elsewhere), and I found that this product works well as a face moisturizer for am and pm. It does not make me break out, works well under makeup, and leaves my face feeling more even overall.</li>
            <li> My sister and I split the show special at the Indianapolis Gift and Hobby Show.  However, when we came home- we were both charged full price.  So I received $30 worth of product and was charged $60. The same for my sister.  Been trying to reach the company- leaving messages etc.  Even if this product works- their business practices leave much to be desired.  My error for not checking my bill at the time- however deceptive practices are never good in business.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why some people don&#x27;t like it! it is an awesome protect! and I am oh so picky. I use it every night on my face &amp; hands. I have very sensitive skin, that tends to get very dry. all I can say is I LOVE this stuff, and I am buying my second jar today. so don&#x27;t be scared off by a few negative people.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the stuff, but I was contacted at a convention, like many of the other reviewers. One thing I did notice, in the pamphlet, was that your money can be refunded if you end up not liking it.&lt;br /&gt;The people leaving 1-star reviews keep saying &amp;#34;money wasted&amp;#34;, but maybe you should try contacting them on their guarantee.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion from my mom who raved about it. I love it. I use it on my face after I wash it morning and night. My boyfriend uses it on his very rough hands and its the only thing that works for him. I have just ordered more today from their website and I loved it so much I decided to order their eye cream and try it.  I would recommend this to everyone b/c their is no girly scent so men and women can use it. I also have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift. Glad I didn&#x27;t buy it. I get better results from the $3.00 of Suave lotion. If you have cracked skin or abrasions you&#x27;re going to get better results from using lanolin as opposed to aloe. Yes, the aloe soaks in faster, but it has no staying power at all.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a gimmick BUT bought it anyway. It is amazing. My son has HORRIBLE skin and in one application it is 80% better!!,</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion at a craft fair about 2 years ago. I left it on the shelf in my bathroom for a couple months before I actually tried it. I only bought it, because I was a vendor at this fair, selling Mary Kay! Thought I would be nice and buy something from someone else to see if it works like they said. IT DOES! I like how thick it goes on. It moisturizes my skin instantly. I suffer from very dry skin and ezcema and after my dr told me this, I started putting this on daily. It soaked up the dryness instantly! It is a great product that also doesnt have a smell like most lotions do. Its a mellow scent. LOVE it! Great for romatic massages as well! great product! Thanks</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other kind of skin lotion again. I am disabled, a wheelchair user, and prone to pressure sores. I put this lotion on my legs, feet and pressure points twice a day. It&#x27;s thick but soaks into my skin almost instantly, it&#x27;s not at all greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any discernable scent. Four 9 oz. jars last me well over a year. I buy mine on the website.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream at a convention and have been nothing but IMPRESSED! My skin is soooo sensitive and my son is a red-head, so we have tried it all....we have gone through the BIG container in one year. We both use it after shaving...NO DRY SKIN...and we have used it for wasp stings, bug bites, acne, sores, fever blisters, to recover from hives....the list goes on and on. It sure does work for us!!</li>
            <li> Product does not work.  As other reviewers noted, it actually made my hands worse.  More importantly, company does not honor return policy.  Instead they try to get your credit card info so they can charge you again.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m impressed as is my wife.  It does what it says it will do and more.</li>
            <li> If I could give it no stars I would. My sister tried the HMAloe cream on her face for the beginning stages of rosacea, for which the cream was recommended. She applied a little the first night with no problem. The second night she applied it generously to the affected areas as recommended on the jar. The next afternoon she started feeling ill, her face began to swell, hurt and turn dark red on her nose and the whole right side of her face. Before she could get to the doctor she developed a fever and it had spread to the left side of her face. She developed an infection that lasted more than a week before it was under control. She is still being treated for the discoloration of the right side of her face. The customer service response was a short we are sorry statement ... never happened before...... and then the normal form letter for returns.
