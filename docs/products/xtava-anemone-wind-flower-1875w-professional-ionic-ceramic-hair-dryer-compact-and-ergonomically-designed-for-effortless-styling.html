            <li>Overall, I am happy and plan to use my complimentary discount code on another product from this friendly company.</li>
            <li>You truly get everything you need from a big dryer in one nice, compact, and elegant sized one with this.</li>
            <li>The cool shot function is probably my favorite, it really &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; your style in place.  </li>
            <li>really liked this dryer and threw my old one away the moment I got this one and tested it out.</li>
            <li>:) i love how you can also change the temperature on the actual device, and there&#x27;s a button you can press to make it cooler if need be.</li>
            <li>Try using a lower heat setting and keep your dryer 6 to 8 inches away from your face as it will get very hot.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend had been looking for some time to upgrade to a new and better hair dryer.</li>
            <li>:) Even though I was fortunate enough to receive this product in exchange for my honest feedback, all the above statements are 100% true based on my experience and observations of the product.</li>
            <li>I find it very easy to use and that it gives me such the softest appearance with hair.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and professional, yet it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like the fact that high heat does not burn and it has very powerful air flow.  </li>
            <li>I do have to mention that the first time I used it, there was a distinct burning smell</li>
            <li>This blow dryer creates soft, shiny, easy to manage hair.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is nice and small, so it is compact and easily fits even in a drawer.</li>
            <li>the hair dries very fast</li>
            <li>Mine arrived clean and brand new looking.</li>
            <li>it gets really hot.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was introduced to this specific brand.</li>
            <li>The dryer itself started getting hot but nothing blew or seemed to work.</li>
            <li>so far has been fantastic.</li>
            <li>Pretty design, however I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in lack of frizz or shine that is associated with Ionic dryers.</li>
            <li>The drying ability is high powered and drys hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and this dryer is light and dried my hair faster than most dryers.</li>
            <li>The cord is strong and sturdy so it should last</li>
            <li>I use a large toothed comb to comb through hair  </li>
            <li>have the pink and black one and it is super cute!!</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is semi lightweight, easy to use, fits comfortably in my hand, and doesn&#x27;t hurt my arm to hold up in the air for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I have ordered other hair dryers from Xtava in the past and have been really impressed with the quality and performance of the hair dryers.</li>
            <li>This is a really neat, compact hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love the pink accent color in this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It does have 3 heat selections (low, medium and high) and does have 2 speeds (gentle and strong).</li>
            <li>and I believe that the other hair dryer might have been better than this one.</li>
            <li>I am very picky and I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>Drying time much longer than normal.  </li>
            <li>a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself is very powerful..</li>
            <li>Nice hair dryer but very heavy.</li>
            <li>So what I do is do about 2-5 min without the black top diffuser and 3 minutes with it on.</li>
            <li>Although the angle of it looks like a good idea, it can sometimes get in my way when I am trying to work with a round brush on the back of my head.</li>
            <li>I love how compact it is (smaller than regular sized dryers), it is almost like a travel type of dryer.</li>
            <li>It is a little heavier than most hair dryers I have had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that you can choose between cold air and warm air and each has a high and low setting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always just accepted that is the normal...</li>
            <li>its too powerful for my short (bob) hair.</li>
            <li>I love to use mine after blow drying my hair without one for a few minutes and then finishing off with the diffuser  leaving my hair shiny and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to blow dry my hair in 15 minutes flat, and it looked smoother and shinier than normal too!</li>
            <li>but everything was new and worked as advertised.</li>
            <li>Ordered new and arrived quickly from amazon, but as soon as the amazon box was opened one could tell that the dryer was not new.</li>
            <li>I chose the pink and black design, and it is such a sleek, attractive design.</li>
            <li>It dried my shoulder length hair pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I feel that this hair dryer without the diffuser (black top) creates such a satin feel to the hair and that with the diffuser on my hair gets so shiny!</li>
            <li>This thing cut down on my blow-dry time significantly.  </li>
            <li>Wind Flower Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer provided by XTAVA.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely professional quality by observing the design and effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works nearly as well as my Conair.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how compact it was</li>
            <li>cord is long enough to be able to set at a table and dry your hair if need be</li>
            <li>I paid the extra money for the new over the used refurbished model but did not get a new one.</li>
            <li>the dryer is heavier than it seems necessary since many larger ones weigh less.</li>
            <li>however those are minor things that she can live with.</li>

            <li> I love how compact it is (smaller than regular sized dryers), it is almost like a travel type of dryer.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than most hair dryers I have had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that you can choose between cold air and warm air and each has a high and low setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always just accepted that is the normal...</li>
            <li> its too powerful for my short (bob) hair.</li>
            <li> I love to use mine after blow drying my hair without one for a few minutes and then finishing off with the diffuser  leaving my hair shiny and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to blow dry my hair in 15 minutes flat, and it looked smoother and shinier than normal too!</li>
            <li> but everything was new and worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Ordered new and arrived quickly from amazon, but as soon as the amazon box was opened one could tell that the dryer was not new.</li>
            <li> I chose the pink and black design, and it is such a sleek, attractive design.</li>
            <li> It dried my shoulder length hair pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I feel that this hair dryer without the diffuser (black top) creates such a satin feel to the hair and that with the diffuser on my hair gets so shiny!</li>
            <li> This thing cut down on my blow-dry time significantly.  </li>
            <li> Wind Flower Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer provided by XTAVA.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely professional quality by observing the design and effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works nearly as well as my Conair.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how compact it was</li>
            <li> cord is long enough to be able to set at a table and dry your hair if need be</li>
            <li> I paid the extra money for the new over the used refurbished model but did not get a new one.</li>
            <li> the dryer is heavier than it seems necessary since many larger ones weigh less.</li>
            <li> however those are minor things that she can live with.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how hard it actually blows.. it comes with settings so that you can pick the one right for you and your hair..</li>
            <li> Even though it is small it is a powerful hair dryer and does dry my hair without frizzing it.</li>
            <li> I section of my hair into smaller sections, about 5 or 6 parts so that the hair will dry faster.</li>
            <li> She says that even though it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as her other dryers that she has had, it actually dries her hair faster and her hair is less frizzy than with other driers.</li>
            <li> I can have it on and my boyfriend can still sleep in the bed, with a closed door as the only seperation between us.</li>
            <li> The cool thing about this hair dryer is that it comes with 2 diffusers (one wide and one thin), it helps cater to your hair and what you want done to it.</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer took about 15 minutes to go from damp to completely dry; the Anemone Wind Flower takes about half that time to take my hair from sopping wet to completely dry.  </li>
            <li> i have to be careful not to touch to plastic attachment and the tip of the dryer.</li>
            <li> What I received was an all pink hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Also, the cord on this hair dryer is THICK, as in it is not going to twist and kink up, it is a quality cord that it going to last a LONG time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> At the end of your styling session, use the cool shot function to blast a stream of cold air which will lock your desired look into place which I never knew why it was there to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any smell from the dryer like other reviewers</li>
            <li> one is wider than the other one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that it has black with a touch of pink on it.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this hair dryer, I ordered the black with Pink petals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also doubtful about a company that gives out so many products for reviews.</li>
            <li> This dryer is less expensive than the competitors but is very well engineered.</li>
            <li> To me it seemed a little heavy for it being such a small dryer.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer arrive scratched and looked to be previously used.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, apparently a lot of people think they buy a new one and get a used damaged one.</li>
            <li> My hair is on the normal side, not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> Wish it wasa little lighter weight.</li>
            <li> , I was a little concerned about it, but after about a minute or so into use, it stopped and I haven&#x27;t noticed it again since.  </li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m convinced this little thing has changed my life.</li>
            <li> It does come with 2 attachments 1 nozzle is long and thin and the other is shorter and wider.</li>
            <li> It has not smoked, over-heated, or gotten too heavy while I have been using it.</li>
            <li> Arguably, he is a heavy sleeper.</li>
            <li> I only give 5 stars to products I 100% stand behind.</li>
            <li> It is quite heavy though.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with sturdy material and it isn&#x27;t to heavy to handle when drying your hair.</li>
            <li> It is a tad bit heavy for its size</li>
            <li> Dries in half the time!  </li>
            <li> I did not use the concentrator nozzle for getting my hair dry, but I did use the thin nozzle with a round brush for styling purposes.  </li>
            <li> and it usually takes approximately 45 minutes to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> the only comment i have is that it heats up really bad after using it on my hair (which is long and dense).</li>
            <li> So I would never sway a potential buyer in the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> Very heavy for a small dryer</li>
            <li> I know the value of hard work, and I know every penny you earn is valuable.</li>
            <li> I only use the cold air since I don&#x27;t want to damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive the actual hair dryer that I ordered</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick crazy hair</li>

            <li> It is a little heavier than most hair dryers I have had. I like the fact that high heat does not burn and it has very powerful air flow.  Wish it wasa little lighter weight.</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer but very heavy.</li>
            <li> It is a good feel in my hand, and I suffer from carpel tunnel syndrome. I can hold it with a solid grip. The one reason it is not five stars for me is the cord. Although the angle of it looks like a good idea, it can sometimes get in my way when I am trying to work with a round brush on the back of my head. However,  I am very satisfied with my purchase, because the heat options, air flow settings, weight, sound, and looks are all attractive and smooth. It has not smoked, over-heated, or gotten too heavy while I have been using it. I can have it on and my boyfriend can still sleep in the bed, with a closed door as the only seperation between us. Arguably, he is a heavy sleeper. Overall, I am happy and plan to use my complimentary discount code on another product from this friendly company.</li>
            <li> I have received this product free to review from the website Tomoson. The power of this hair dryer is amazing!! :) i love how you can also change the temperature on the actual device, and there&#x27;s a button you can press to make it cooler if need be. You can also change the power of the wind speed. I think that this is pretty much the greatest hair dryer ever invented! :)</li>
            <li> The product is great, exceeded my expectations, thanks! Will purchase brand again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good value for the money.  It is a bit heavier than I am used to and if just got s bit hotter it would be perfect</li>
            <li> When I tell you this dryer is a beast! This thing tackeld my 4c hair in submission had my hair laid to the GODS lol</li>
            <li> it an excelent  product</li>
            <li> i like the temperature options and the speed of air. the hair dries very fast that&#x27;s for sure. the only comment i have is that it heats up really bad after using it on my hair (which is long and dense). i have to be careful not to touch to plastic attachment and the tip of the dryer. it gets really hot.</li>
            <li> This is a really neat, compact hair dryer. It dried my shoulder length hair pretty quickly.  I did not use the concentrator nozzle for getting my hair dry, but I did use the thin nozzle with a round brush for styling purposes.  I really liked that this hair dryer has 3 speed settings, 2 heat settings, and a cool shot function.  I used all 3 of these.  The cool shot function is probably my favorite, it really &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; your style in place.  The hair dryer is pretty light and the handle is ergonomically designed to feel good in your hand, and it does.  I do have to mention that the first time I used it, there was a distinct burning smell, I was a little concerned about it, but after about a minute or so into use, it stopped and I haven&#x27;t noticed it again since.  Also, the cord on this hair dryer is THICK, as in it is not going to twist and kink up, it is a quality cord that it going to last a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;  All in all, this is a really good hair dryer,  If you are looking for something on the smaller side, something lightweight, that does a great job quickly, this is a good option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANEMONE Wind Flower Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer provided by XTAVA.</li>
            <li> I have been needing a good hair dryer for quite some time now. I am so glad I was introduced to this specific brand. Out of the box, it comes with 2 nozzles and the adorable hair dryer. I chose the pink and black design, and it is such a sleek, attractive design. Not only does this hair dryer look amazing, it also performs amazing. It&#x27;s definitely professional quality by observing the design and effectiveness of the product. I have very long, thick crazy hair and it usually takes approximately 45 minutes to blow dry my hair. I&#x27;ve always just accepted that is the normal...until now. The Anemone Wind Flower 1875 W Professional Ionic Hair Dryer was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I was able to blow dry my hair in 15 minutes flat, and it looked smoother and shinier than normal too! I&amp;#34;m convinced this little thing has changed my life. :) Even though I was fortunate enough to receive this product in exchange for my honest feedback, all the above statements are 100% true based on my experience and observations of the product. I take pride in ensuring that I provide valuable feedback in my reviews because as a consumer also, I often find myself depending on the reviews of people just like me and you to help make a decision. I know the value of hard work, and I know every penny you earn is valuable. So I would never sway a potential buyer in the wrong direction. I only give 5 stars to products I 100% stand behind. I hope my review as helped you. :)</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this hair dryer! It is so cute and works really well!</li>
            <li> The chemical odor associated with this dryer is so bad, even after sitting out for a week, I had to return it.  Maybe need a different manufacturing process...</li>
            <li> Really cute hair dryer.  It is quite heavy though.  I don&#x27;t think it works nearly as well as my Conair.  Drying time much longer than normal.  This hairdryer arrive scratched and looked to be previously used.  I love the look of the dryer but not the performance.  I will return.  I&#x27;m also doubtful about a company that gives out so many products for reviews.</li>
            <li> excellent: compact and very powerful.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had been looking for some time to upgrade to a new and better hair dryer. After doing her research and reading all of the reviews out there she chose this xtava dryer. Ordered new and arrived quickly from amazon, but as soon as the amazon box was opened one could tell that the dryer was not new. I paid the extra money for the new over the used refurbished model but did not get a new one. The packaging it came in was damaged and the dryer itself looked used and damaged, scratches, fingerprints etc. Since it is a fairly inexpensive model and gets great reviews decided to try it out even though it was not new and when plugged in did not work. The dryer itself started getting hot but nothing blew or seemed to work. Too bad, apparently a lot of people think they buy a new one and get a used damaged one. Returned my order to amazon and ordered a Baby Bliss Pro, a bit more but everything was new and worked as advertised. Girlfriend couldn&#x27;t be happier after sending this xtava one back nand getting the Baby Bliss Pro.</li>
            <li> Based on the comments prior to purchasing this product I was sold.. After using it for a week, I had to put it back in the box for a return. It damaged my hair.. its too powerful for my short (bob) hair.</li>
            <li> I section of my hair into smaller sections, about 5 or 6 parts so that the hair will dry faster. I use a large toothed comb to comb through hair  make sure it is untangled and  start drying at the roots. Try using a lower heat setting and keep your dryer 6 to 8 inches away from your face as it will get very hot. Also drying too close to the hair could damage it and over-dry the scalp.Start drying downwards from the roots to the ends and always keep moving, avoid upward motions as they might cause damage. The downward technique smooths the hair cuticles which results in shinier and healthier hair. At the end of your styling session, use the cool shot function to blast a stream of cold air which will lock your desired look into place which I never knew why it was there to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this dryer and threw my old one away the moment I got this one and tested it out. It is powerful and professional, yet it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for a discount, however, all thoughts, ideas, and words expressed are indeed my own.</li>
            <li> This is actually a really great hair dryer! I love how compact it is (smaller than regular sized dryers), it is almost like a travel type of dryer. I find it very easy to use and that it gives me such the softest appearance with hair. I&#x27;m a College Student so I&#x27;m always on the go whether its going from class to class to traveling to yoga class/gym I definitely need something as flexible as I am. My hair is on the normal side, not too thick and not too thin. It is also fairly straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I feel that this hair dryer without the diffuser (black top) creates such a satin feel to the hair and that with the diffuser on my hair gets so shiny! So what I do is do about 2-5 min without the black top diffuser and 3 minutes with it on. The cool thing about this hair dryer is that it comes with 2 diffusers (one wide and one thin), it helps cater to your hair and what you want done to it. Overall this is an excellent hair dryer, everything form the Xtava line so far has been fantastic. I have received this product complimentary for my review but definitely believe that this product is great and affordable!</li>
            <li> Ok but needs improvement. the dryer is heavier than it seems necessary since many larger ones weigh less. It works great with lots of power at actually drying my hair. But there is a terrible smell that is concerning whenever I use it. It has faded a bit in two weeks of use but not gone and seems like a red flag to an unseen problem. I will return it rather than end up with a fire in my hand.</li>
            <li> Very heavy for a small dryer but quality was great- drys my hair very quickly and packs nicely. I use this as a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> This thing cut down on my blow-dry time significantly.  My old hair dryer took about 15 minutes to go from damp to completely dry; the Anemone Wind Flower takes about half that time to take my hair from sopping wet to completely dry.  It also does a great job of decreasing the amount of frizz I have to contend with.  Plus, it&#x27;s cute!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.I have very curly hair and this dryer is light and dried my hair faster than most dryers.I am very picky and I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> I really love this hair dryer. I like that it has black with a touch of pink on it. It&#x27;s made with sturdy material and it isn&#x27;t to heavy to handle when drying your hair. I only use the cold air since I don&#x27;t want to damage my hair. It&#x27;s nice that you can choose between cold air and warm air and each has a high and low setting. It also has two attachments which is perfect, depending on your preference. This a great product to use for your daily hair routine and it&#x27;s even a good size for travel. It&#x27;s a perfect gift to give any women in your life. I&#x27;m very happy with all the XTAVA products I&#x27;ve gotten to review. They&#x27;re all high-quality products and I would definitely recommend their products!</li>
            <li> Very nice hair dryer and a good value.  I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Dries in half the time!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My wife really Love this Hair Dryer. She says that even though it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as her other dryers that she has had, it actually dries her hair faster and her hair is less frizzy than with other driers. It is a tad bit heavy for its size and she said she wished the controls were on the front of the handle rather than the side because the controls poke into her hand and its a little uncomfortable however those are minor things that she can live with. Hopefully this hair dryer will last a while for her.</li>
            <li> This dryer is less expensive than the competitors but is very well engineered. The dryer is light and fits very comfortably in the palm of your hand. The drying ability is high powered and drys hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Pretty design, however I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in lack of frizz or shine that is associated with Ionic dryers.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this hair dryer, I ordered the black with Pink petals. What I received was an all pink hair dryer. I was a little disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive the actual hair dryer that I ordered and I believe that the other hair dryer might have been better than this one. I have ordered other hair dryers from Xtava in the past and have been really impressed with the quality and performance of the hair dryers. This hair dryer is nice and small, so it is compact and easily fits even in a drawer. Even though it is small it is a powerful hair dryer and does dry my hair without frizzing it. To me it seemed a little heavy for it being such a small dryer. It was actually louder than my bigger hair dryers. It does have a nice long cord so I am able to move around more and not be confined in standing in one place. It does come with 2 attachments 1 nozzle is long and thin and the other is shorter and wider. It does have 3 heat selections (low, medium and high) and does have 2 speeds (gentle and strong). The feature I like the best about the dryer is the cool air which shoots out a burst of cool air and that is why my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz when using this dryer.&lt;br /&gt; I was able to receive this hair dryer so that I can provide my honest opinion and feedback.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer that is very strong. I was surprised at how compact it was but it definitely packs a big punch. It&#x27;s 1875 watts in a compact, great for travel size. I love the pink accent color in this hair dryer. It&#x27;s cute and fun. This blow dryer is semi lightweight, easy to use, fits comfortably in my hand, and doesn&#x27;t hurt my arm to hold up in the air for a few minutes. The diffuser is great and really helps prevent frizzy flyaway hairs all over the place. This blow dryer creates soft, shiny, easy to manage hair. The two different diffusers this hair dryer comes with is a very nice bonus. You truly get everything you need from a big dryer in one nice, compact, and elegant sized one with this. I haven&#x27;t noticed any smell from the dryer like other reviewers have stated. Mine arrived clean and brand new looking. With any heat tool you will want to use a heat protecting spray so it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair. *sample provided for testing and review*</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer! It is heavier than most dryers but it is powerful and my hair looks amazing after I use it.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail and it came in a cute box packaged nice and tight.&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped in a timely manner and came to me in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I love how compact this blow dryer is... I can take it with me when I go on vacation and It wont take up valuable space in my suitcase!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have the pink and black one and it is super cute!! I love how stylish it is.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 2 attachments ( diffusers ). one is wider than the other one.&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to attach and easy to use. I love to use mine after blow drying my hair without one for a few minutes and then finishing off with the diffuser  leaving my hair shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is long enough to be able to set at a table and dry your hair if need be The cord is strong and sturdy so it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself is very powerful.. I could not believe how hard it actually blows.. it comes with settings so that you can pick the one right for you and your hair..&lt;br /&gt;I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I really think this is a great blow dryer and has a great price!!&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this for years to come!!</li>
