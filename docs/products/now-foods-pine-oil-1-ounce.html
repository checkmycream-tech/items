            <li>I love this peppermint essential oil.</li>
            <li>Peppermint oil has so many uses, but I use this in an essential oil mix and rub on my scalp to control itching and to help stimulate hair growth.</li>
            <li>Came so quickly I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effectiveness is in doubt but it definitely puts a strong scent out to discourage them.</li>
            <li>The Peppermint oil leaves your breath fresh  and the other ingredients allow you to make a fluoride-free all NATURAL antiseptic mouthwash for pennies instead of the HUGE money that is charged for Tea Tree Oil mouthwash!&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>

            <li>Just 5-10 drops in plain water make such a refreshing mouth spray!</li>
            <li>I make a natural mouthwash using (boiled and cooled soft water; you can use distilled water) :</li>
            <li>you know that rodents (squirrels ,mice etc ) can&#x27;t stand Peppermint and won&#x27;t come near your house, basement or attic if you douse it with Peppermint oil?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand to use when looking for a affordable essential oil along with Edens Garden brand as well.</li>
            <li>I sweeten the mouthwash slightly with Sweetleaf Stevia Extract Clear Liquid 120ml ( 1x4 OZ) by Wisdom Natural  !</li>

            <li> I purchased this as a suggested home remedy to control the spider population in my area (prodigious critters!).  It doesn&#x27;t kill them, but they don&#x27;t like it a bit and don&#x27;t nest wherever I have sprayed the mixture of 1 oz. peppermint mixed with 2-3 oz. of water (or as preferred---strong or weak as you like or can stand).</li>
