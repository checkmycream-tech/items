            <li>This stuff is the best.</li>

            <li>Cremo is great and a tube lasts seemingly forever.  </li>
            <li>Really as good as they claim</li>
            <li>Great shave cream, have tried many.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve even whipped up my own for a safety razor I shave with.</li>
            <li>The absolute best shaving cream there is.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild but pleasant</li>
            <li>Glad to have it now.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding... wich</li>
            <li>I love Cremo Cream.</li>
            <li>It will make using this cream a much better experience</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost like more</li>
            <li>I have tried many; all have shortcomings.</li>
            <li>and I think most guys will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time this week and love it.</li>
            <li>The layer or protection it provides between you and your razor is small but perfect.</li>

            <li>just so-so in the lubrication department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cremo Cream is as concentrated as they say and rinses cleanly without sacrificing much in the way of lubricity.</li>
            <li>Far better than any of the main name brand shaving creams I have</li>
            <li>Wet face with warm water and apply.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My shaves are closer and skin is much softer after a shave.  </li>
            <li>Not as smooth as I was hoping for, but leaps and bounds ahead of traditional shaving foam</li>
            <li>But make sure your skin is wet as directed.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to squirt out much.</li>
            <li>This one is THE shaving cream for straight edge shave fans.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly, and is what I expected.  </li>
            <li>A little more expensive but worth it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product.  My shaves are closer and skin is much softer after a shave.  I do not plan on going back to regular shaving cream. A little more expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use a different shaving cream again</li>
            <li> Not as smooth as I was hoping for, but leaps and bounds ahead of traditional shaving foam</li>
            <li> Great quality shave cream.  Wet face with warm water and apply.  Makes shaving a pleasure</li>
            <li> Magnificent shave cream. The finest (and least expensive) brand I&#x27;ve ever bought. Where was this product beginning in 1979?  Ha ha. Glad to have it now.  Kevin B., Ft Lauderdale, FL</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. Tried it for the first time this week and love it. Smooth and creamy. As advertised very little really does go a long way. But make sure your skin is wet as directed.</li>
            <li> Outstanding... wich I had found this product years ago!</li>
            <li> My new favorite shave cream to use with my electric razor. I had been using the Neutrogena stuff (both regular and sensitive skin) for a year or two but found it difficult to rinse off the razor and just so-so in the lubrication department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cremo Cream is as concentrated as they say and rinses cleanly without sacrificing much in the way of lubricity. The smell is very mild but pleasant and I think most guys will enjoy it. The 3 ounce tube lasts me several months with nearly-daily use, and it&#x27;s also TSA-approved.</li>
            <li> I love Cremo Cream. I&#x27;ve used it for a while, but I&#x27;ve always had to leave it at home when I traveled, because the tube I have is larger than what the TSA will let you carry on (and I hate checking bags). These are small enough to be TSA compliant, and now I&#x27;m never without my Cremo!</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving cream. Wish I had found this years ago. A word of advice to anyone that has never used this type of shaving cream before get a brush and cup. It will make using this cream a much better experience</li>
            <li> Great shave cream, have tried many.</li>
            <li> Far better than any of the main name brand shaving creams I have tried.over the years.</li>
            <li> Have a 6oz for home. Didn&#x27;t want to travel without it.</li>
            <li> Really as good as they claim</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent, and this size is allowed when traveling by plane.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased Cremo cream for me as a little stocking stuffer a year or two ago. Ever since then I&#x27;ve been hooked! I&#x27;ve tried the big name brands of shaving cream and I&#x27;ve even whipped up my own for a safety razor I shave with. Even after trying dozens of products this is what I come back to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular travel with my job has made me stoop as low as using soap or hotel hair conditioner to build up a lather. Once I noticed Cremo came in 3oz. travel packs I bought them right away. You don&#x27;t need to squirt out much. The packaging even says an almond size amount will do. Once you start applying the cream it&#x27;s almost like more just keeps showing up. The layer or protection it provides between you and your razor is small but perfect. I&#x27;ve cut down on the number of cuts I&#x27;ll randomly get. This stuff gets all the credit.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, and is what I expected.  I have not really started using it, but upon inspection, it looks good.</li>
            <li> Cremo is great and a tube lasts seemingly forever.  Don&#x27;t over-squirt!  A little dab will do your entire face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> The absolute best shaving cream there is. I have tried many; all have shortcomings. This one is THE shaving cream for straight edge shave fans. Get it!  This is the travel size.</li>
