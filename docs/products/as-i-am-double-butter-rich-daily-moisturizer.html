            <li>My legs feel amazing.</li>
            <li>simply an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I was perfectly content with a very dependable line I have been using for over two years.  </li>
            <li>I thought for sure this would work out for me because the creator of this line also help develop some products for Kera Care, and I liked that line when I was relaxed.  </li>
            <li>but this line kind of smells better</li>
            <li>The smell is great and the entire line of this product is great.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Its okay as a moisturizer, but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products but none of them compare to the moisture that my hair receives from using these two products.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>

            <li>I think someone else might have better results</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Ordered it twice already :)</li>
            <li>It didnt get any better once I applied the butter.  </li>
            <li>Although it will be a while because you really don&#x27;t have to use alot of product to get great results.  </li>
            <li>I also love the Coconut Co-Wash and Hydration Elevation products from this line.</li>
            <li>(My favorite is the &#x27;claspless&#x27; ones where you just wind your hair around it.  </li>
            <li>better&#x27;.....</li>
            <li>I find that with most hair products.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>/good ingredients (water as a main ingredient is great in moisturizers)&lt;br /&gt;Moisturized my hair</li>
            <li>and I can say so far my favorits are Beautiful textures</li>
            <li>Smells great not harsh.</li>
            <li>This is the main goal that I am pleased with! :)))</li>
            <li>Hopefully, I will be able to use it up quickly and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, yes the smell is fabulous, but I like the way it does the job in keeping my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li>This is the cream I use for my LOC method (I also alternate with their leave in) and it makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li>It is good for a daily moisturizer, but it absorbs into my kids hair (which is softer than my texture), much better than it does mine.</li>
            <li>I use it after my cowash and i love everything about this product and the whole</li>
            <li>I bought this product about 6 months ago and the jar is still about 3/4 full because I can&#x27;t force myself to use the rest of it.  </li>
            <li>Hahahaha I love it.  </li>
            <li>As I am has all it&#x27;s goodness listed first and the few &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; ingredients are last on the list where they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can easily find products that give great definition, but great definition AND great moisture are not easy to find.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich enough to really moisturize and penetrate the hair, and it provides great definition with minimum first day frizz.  </li>
            <li>thanks much for such a great product and the smell is not bad either.</li>
            <li>The co-wash is amazing - just ordered a few more jars of that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have used that leaves a nice sheen on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Its just the right amount of moisture.  </li>
            <li>As I Am Double Butter and Miss Jessies are the only products that I can use alone on freshly cleaned hair that gives great definition AND maintains moisture for 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li>and my hair absolutely LOVES it!  </li>
            <li>I finally tried this product and am so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my niece who has 4C and THICK hair, great product.</li>
            <li>Finally found this and am so satisfied.</li>
            <li>This brand does have a product I LOVE and use regularly - Coconut CoWash Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I do use a pretty generous amount after a wash.  </li>
            <li>I read reviews with a \\&quot;grain of salt\\&quot; but I sought out this product and used it for the first time yesterday...</li>
            <li>But this product really leaves my hair with a nice sheen and NOT so dry and thirsty looking.  </li>
            <li>You get a large quantity for the price</li>
            <li>and I did not notice much slip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to use with another product for styling.  </li>
            <li>you hair is really tangled looking\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>my hair missed this so much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have kinky curly hair but really want to &#x27;define&#x27; the curls I have.  </li>
            <li>Also if you use a curling iron at all - it will really hold the curl.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the moisture milk - but</li>
            <li>I really like Hair One Argon Co-wash as well -</li>
            <li>It really defines my curls.</li>
            <li>Very creamy.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for several years and have tried so many products.  </li>
            <li>multiple product using people are familiar with)&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a natural black women I love this product!</li>
            <li>And I didn&#x27;t use a pea size amount this time around, I used about two tablespoons, more or less.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Most models for natural hair are mixed, so if you are not mixed and looking for those types of results you will be out of luck.</li>
            <li>I pretty much found my holy grail of shampoos (Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative shampoo and Kinky Curly Come Clean for clarifying),</li>
            <li>/&gt;I may need to return to more \\&quot;old skool\\&quot; products that have less hype around them.</li>
            <li>I tried this on clean wet hair along with a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>But when used after my spray bottle mixture (water, glycerin, pure aloe vera juice, pure silk protein and a hint of wheat germ oil), it completely rejuvenates my curls allowing it to last for weeks with NO GEL NEEDED.</li>
            <li>MJBB has petroleum as the second ingredient and that is too much money to pay for Vaseline!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s day 2 and my hair is still moisturized and soft and curly!</li>
            <li>Oh I forgot to mention that I used the leave-in conditioner by the same brand first before applying the DoubleButter cream.  </li>
            <li>but I have only became  aware of all of the products out there  </li>
            <li>this product can be very tricky cause at first when i tried it on my dry TWA, it didnt do much for my curls but still left my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this product after seeing mostly positive reviews in regards to this line.  </li>
            <li>As I Am has better ingredients for half the price and works just the same on my hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for about 3 years now</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>I have been natural for about 2 yrs</li>
            <li>my hair feels soft and moisture when I apply it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable for combing.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to purchase any products given the increasing amounts of products on the market targeting the natural hair community.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing which is why I like to use it for second day hair.</li>
            <li>quick background about my hair: 4a/b/c, porous, dry, damaged ends from using a brush, fine but thick, and prone to tangles on the ends.</li>
            <li>The Double Butter Cream out performs only one other product that has been able to impart moisture to my tresses.  </li>
            <li>What I wouldn&#x27;t give for a $5 bottle of Luster&#x27;s pink oil moisturizer right about now...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not soft or silky, like you&#x27;d expect from a product like this, but rough and possibly even more tangled.  </li>
            <li>I use the co wash first, then an oil then my Eden Bodyworks  leave in conditioner and finally the double butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m washing my hair out today in hopes that my hair will go back to normal.</li>
            <li>I have mostly 4a and 4c African American hair, with a few areas of 4b.  </li>
            <li>I apply this product on wet hair, after using a rinse out conditioner and applying Hot 6 Oil.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think its greater than any other product I have used such a cantu, Shea butter or any of the other 200 products on my shelf.</li>
            <li>I typically use the daily butter daily to refresh my curls after lightly misting my hair.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be using this product again and will be tossing the useless products (hint, Carols Daughter Loc Butter) that I own.</li>
            <li>This product is very moisturizing and does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>Most moisturizers tend to weigh my hair down and causes it to look extremely dull, lifeless, and greasy; but not this.  </li>

            <li> I actually purchased this product after seeing mostly positive reviews in regards to this line.  </li>
            <li> As I Am has better ingredients for half the price and works just the same on my hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for about 3 years now</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> I have been natural for about 2 yrs</li>
            <li> my hair feels soft and moisture when I apply it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable for combing.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to purchase any products given the increasing amounts of products on the market targeting the natural hair community.  </li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing which is why I like to use it for second day hair.</li>
            <li> quick background about my hair: 4a/b/c, porous, dry, damaged ends from using a brush, fine but thick, and prone to tangles on the ends.</li>
            <li> The Double Butter Cream out performs only one other product that has been able to impart moisture to my tresses.  </li>
            <li> What I wouldn&#x27;t give for a $5 bottle of Luster&#x27;s pink oil moisturizer right about now...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not soft or silky, like you&#x27;d expect from a product like this, but rough and possibly even more tangled.  </li>
            <li> I use the co wash first, then an oil then my Eden Bodyworks  leave in conditioner and finally the double butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m washing my hair out today in hopes that my hair will go back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have mostly 4a and 4c African American hair, with a few areas of 4b.  </li>
            <li> I apply this product on wet hair, after using a rinse out conditioner and applying Hot 6 Oil.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think its greater than any other product I have used such a cantu, Shea butter or any of the other 200 products on my shelf.</li>
            <li> I typically use the daily butter daily to refresh my curls after lightly misting my hair.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this product again and will be tossing the useless products (hint, Carols Daughter Loc Butter) that I own.</li>
            <li> This product is very moisturizing and does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Most moisturizers tend to weigh my hair down and causes it to look extremely dull, lifeless, and greasy; but not this.  </li>
            <li> I would like to say that it will last you a long time but for some reason, I had to use an obscene amount and even that left my hair</li>
            <li> I am african american with 3b/3c hair, and this product I can not live without!  </li>
            <li> This product left my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all - just left it incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Sally&#x27;s after using several other products, to include Ms. Jessie&#x27;s pudding, Kinky Curl and several others.  </li>
            <li> I mean I really saturated my hair with this product, tied my hair up in a scarf to air dry and went to bed.  </li>
            <li> Shea Moisture and Miss Jessie&#x27;s shampoo and conditioners work for me, but their styling products also leave my hair dry and crunchy.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair ver dry</li>
            <li> but I still wind up with dry and brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> As the others stated, the As I Am products made my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair falls in the 3b-c range, shoulder length, and can be really dry toward the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I intend to make this a staple in my regimen and will use it for a dry twist out this evening...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth every penny to keep my hair moisturized throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just this particular one was a little heavy for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> This product is not worth buying if you have a type 4c as I can read in different reviews.</li>
            <li> When I rinse it out my hair feels worse than when I first apply it.  </li>
            <li> I had the same experience as the previous reviewer (bigtenalumnagraduate \\&quot;pseudoliterati\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it when my hair is dry and when it&#x27;s soaking wet.</li>
            <li> On wet hair and on dry hair.</li>
            <li> texture of this product is similar to slightly runny whipped cream</li>
            <li> I have severe natural dry hair that needs moisturizing at least two or three times a day and this cream does it.</li>
            <li> It comes off a little white</li>
            <li> another huge disappointment for me.  </li>
            <li> , I applied it one time while my hair was soaking wet.  </li>
            <li> This product has absolutely NO detangling properties...</li>
            <li> It may be expensive, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> If I have gone several days 3-4 days without washing the product out I will use the DB with some ECO Styler or Kinky Curl gel, to help tame the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have 4B thin hair and if use too much it weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> It is pricey however and it does build up in your hair after about 3 days but compared to almost every other product I have used this one</li>
            <li> (Some other creams take forever to work in)</li>
            <li> I do use other products with it,</li>
            <li> Big disappointment because I really like the texture and smell.</li>
            <li> Ususlly, I wash or wet my hair with water and peppermint oil, add a little oil(avocado or jojoba)</li>
            <li> The only downside is that my hair sucks it up, so I have to reapply every night.  </li>
            <li> Because of its richness, I only have to use it at least one a day.</li>
            <li> Take down</li>
            <li> Being that my mean goal is to grow out my hair, i prefer not to use any gel and to keep my styling regimen simple.</li>
            <li> After the shampoo, conditioner and leave in, my hair felt dry and stiff after my hair fully dried.  </li>
            <li> Flat twist and let dry/set for at least 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;10)</li>
            <li> Sometime &#x27;less is</li>
            <li> It never gets flaky and is a miracle for someone like me with really dry hard to keep moisturized hair.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product but was incredibly disappointed in it.  </li>
            <li> When my hair dried it felt greasy not moisturized.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever waste my money on this product again.  </li>
            <li> I can imagine that if your dousing your hair with this - it will not be moisturizing at all and would appear lifeless and limp.  </li>
            <li> you read the instructions, they want you to use VERY LITTLE and rub your hands together and scrunch.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a lite butter creme, which was not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which one caused the dryness.</li>
            <li> Not sure what made me take the plung</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to spread around and hard to work through.  </li>
            <li> What shocked me was this product contains lanolin and products contains lanolin usually makes my hair greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have 4B hair which is difficult to moisturize.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find, so I have the subscription from Amazon with auto-delivery.  </li>
            <li> It has taken 1.5 years to find a replacement for the twice as expensive</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> BTW really shocked by all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product because I have tried them all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to describe but when I apply it to my hair</li>
            <li> It was so bad that my mom commented</li>
            <li> I guess I blocked it out because I was so disappointed by the results.  </li>

            <li> I have 4B hair which is difficult to moisturize. Therefore, when I saw the name DoubleButter Cream, I knew this was the answer. Not!!! I tried this on clean wet hair along with a leave in conditioner. When my hair dried it felt greasy not moisturized. The texture of the product is creamy and I did not notice much slip. It smells like a lite butter creme, which was not overwhelming. If this was a cheaper product I would have tossed it. But I purchased the 16 oz which was 27.00. Therefore, I will continue to use it and try it different ways. Hopefully, I will be able to use it up quickly and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this product line the leave in conditioner, Intensive Elation conditioner and the Cowash are excellent products.</li>
            <li> I just started using As I Am Double Butter about 6 months ago and my hair absolutely LOVES it!  Each curl starts popping as soon as I use it.  My scalp loves it, too.  The only downside is that my hair sucks it up, so I have to reapply every night.  But that&#x27;s okay because I twist every night anyway.  It&#x27;s light enough to use with another product for styling.  This provides all-day moisture.  It&#x27;s difficult to find, so I have the subscription from Amazon with auto-delivery.  It&#x27;s so worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as the previous reviewer (bigtenalumnagraduate \\&quot;pseudoliterati\\&quot;). This product left my hair dry and brittle. After reading reviews online, I purchased this product (not from Amazon) about a month ago. I&#x27;ve tried using it when my hair is dry and when it&#x27;s soaking wet. Made absolutely no different. This product didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all - just left it incredibly dry. When I wake up the day after putting it on, my hair is just a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may need to return to more \\&quot;old skool\\&quot; products that have less hype around them. Shea Moisture and Miss Jessie&#x27;s shampoo and conditioners work for me, but their styling products also leave my hair dry and crunchy.  What I wouldn&#x27;t give for a $5 bottle of Luster&#x27;s pink oil moisturizer right about now...</li>
            <li> I used this for my twist out and I kept the style up for 9 days instead of 7 days.</li>
            <li> I am trying 3 products from different brands at the same time: Shea moisture enhancing smoothie, Taliah Waajid curly cream and AsI Am double buttercream. This buttercream is definitely not for me. I have tried it 2 ways. On wet hair and on dry hair. It makes my hair ver dry like I didn&#x27;t put any moisturizer in it. Big disappointment because I really like the texture and smell. My hair type is 4c. I will give it a last chance on twists out. May be if I use it with oil or with a hair butter.... This product is not worth buying if you have a type 4c as I can read in different reviews.</li>
            <li> Its okay as a moisturizer, but don&#x27;t expect miracles. Most models for natural hair are mixed, so if you are not mixed and looking for those types of results you will be out of luck. It is good for a daily moisturizer, but it absorbs into my kids hair (which is softer than my texture), much better than it does mine. If you have coarse hair don&#x27;t put it on a couple minutes before leaving the house, it needs time to absorb into your hair.</li>
            <li> I finally tried this product and am so glad that I did.  It has taken 1.5 years to find a replacement for the twice as expensive Miss. Jessie&#x27;s Baby Buttercreme.  I have tried many products but none of them compare to the moisture that my hair receives from using these two products.  The As I Am Double Butter and Miss Jessies are the only products that I can use alone on freshly cleaned hair that gives great definition AND maintains moisture for 2-3 days.  When I re-twist at night, I don&#x27;t have to reapply any product or oils and the next morning my hair is still defined and moist even with a sweaty PM workout.  MJBB has petroleum as the second ingredient and that is too much money to pay for Vaseline!  As I am has all it&#x27;s goodness listed first and the few &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; ingredients are last on the list where they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can easily find products that give great definition, but great definition AND great moisture are not easy to find.  As I Am has better ingredients for half the price and works just the same on my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product but I don&#x27;t think its greater than any other product I have used such a cantu, Shea butter or any of the other 200 products on my shelf. I have 4B thin hair and if use too much it weighs my hair down. The smell is great and the entire line of this product is great.  It&#x27;s just this particular one was a little heavy for my hair type.  I used it on my niece who has 4C and THICK hair, great product.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it after my cowash and i love everything about this product and the whole As I AM line.</li>
            <li> Provided my hair with great moisture.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use the entire product line. Great results. Hair feels and looks great. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This is my #1 product! Nothing moisturizes my hair. Nothing! Finally found this and am so satisfied. I use the co wash first, then an oil then my Eden Bodyworks  leave in conditioner and finally the double butter. It&#x27;s day 2 and my hair is still moisturized and soft and curly! Winning!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! After putting this in my hair, I never looked back. Best moisturizer ever!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for my 3b/c hair.</li>
            <li> This works wonders for me. I have been natural for about 3 years now and I put my hair in bantu knots a lot this is perfect for moisturizing over night and holding styles. It never gets flaky and is a miracle for someone like me with really dry hard to keep moisturized hair. It is pricey however and it does build up in your hair after about 3 days but compared to almost every other product I have used this one is the go to for me now. The only As I Am product that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Ladies (and some gents) I actually purchased this product after seeing mostly positive reviews in regards to this line.  I thought to myself \\&quot;This could be the product that would give me that elusive moisture that I have been seeking\\&quot;.  I winced at the price (since they only had the 16 oz jar at the time) but to lessen the blow, I bought it during a sale and used a 15% discount to make it cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick background about my hair: 4a/b/c, porous, dry, damaged ends from using a brush, fine but thick, and prone to tangles on the ends. I pretty much found my holy grail of shampoos (Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative shampoo and Kinky Curly Come Clean for clarifying), my go to styling product (Roots of Nature Whipped Coil Cream), but still looking for the one conditioner and moisturizer.  I am currently testing out one product conditioning and I tried this DoubleButter cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this product for almost two months and I came to the conclusion that this does not work for me at all.  I tried it in a variety of ways but I still wind up with dry and brittle hair.  I kid you not, I applied it one time while my hair was soaking wet.  And I didn&#x27;t use a pea size amount this time around, I used about two tablespoons, more or less.  I mean I really saturated my hair with this product, tied my hair up in a scarf to air dry and went to bed.  Oh I forgot to mention that I used the leave-in conditioner by the same brand first before applying the DoubleButter cream.  In the morning, it looked like I stuck a fork in an electrical outlet.  It was so bad that my mom commented \\&quot;Wow you hair is really tangled looking\\&quot;.  What shocked me was this product contains lanolin and products contains lanolin usually makes my hair greasy.  Oddly enough I did not experience this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of this product is similar to slightly runny whipped cream but it leaves a trace of oil trails if that makes sense.  The scent is pleasant but nothing memorable IMO.  I guess I blocked it out because I was so disappointed by the results.  The color of the cream is an off white and it comes in an eight ounce and sixteen ounce jar.  I would like to say that it will last you a long time but for some reason, I had to use an obscene amount and even that left my hair dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so upset that I return the product back to the store, without a receipt.  Thankfully store has a reasonably great return policy.  I had to pick out several products but it worked out in the end.  I thought for sure this would work out for me because the creator of this line also help develop some products for Kera Care, and I liked that line when I was relaxed.  I think someone else might have better results but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t and I am at a loss why that is the reason.</li>
            <li> I got this from sally&#x27;s at a hefting 28bucks for the 16oz but it works wonders on my hair. i have a 4a/b/c hair and this butter gives me instant curls while, no gel necessary. this product can be very tricky cause at first when i tried it on my dry TWA, it didnt do much for my curls but still left my hair feeling soft. But when used after my spray bottle mixture (water, glycerin, pure aloe vera juice, pure silk protein and a hint of wheat germ oil), it completely rejuvenates my curls allowing it to last for weeks with NO GEL NEEDED. Being that my mean goal is to grow out my hair, i prefer not to use any gel and to keep my styling regimen simple. BTW really shocked by all the negative reviews. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product.  I was skeptical about this product because I have tried them all.  Most moisturizers tend to weigh my hair down and causes it to look extremely dull, lifeless, and greasy; but not this.  This product is very moisturizing and does not weigh my hair down.  Its just the right amount of moisture.  I&#x27;ve owned this product for about 2 months and I still have about a half of a jar left which means you get a decent amount for multiple uses.  All in all I will definitely be using this product again and will be tossing the useless products (hint, Carols Daughter Loc Butter) that I own.</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite. I have been out for months. I have it on auto ship now. my hair missed this so much</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells okay&lt;br /&gt;Has okay/good ingredients (water as a main ingredient is great in moisturizers)&lt;br /&gt;Moisturized my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair frizzy&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t mix well with the others products I use (leaves that white residue us multiple product using people are familiar with)&lt;br /&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I ended up choosing a different product for my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As a natural black women I love this product! I am currently living abroad and they do not sell this product anywhere so I had to ship it all the way in from the US to Europe! It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flakey and it works great on bantu knots and night moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 6 months ago and the jar is still about 3/4 full because I can&#x27;t force myself to use the rest of it.  I&#x27;ll probably just throw it away.  I had such high hopes for this product but was incredibly disappointed in it.  It&#x27;s difficult to describe but when I apply it to my hair it&#x27;s hard to spread around and hard to work through.  When I rinse it out my hair feels worse than when I first apply it.  It&#x27;s not soft or silky, like you&#x27;d expect from a product like this, but rough and possibly even more tangled.  This product has absolutely NO detangling properties... another huge disappointment for me.  I won&#x27;t ever waste my money on this product again.  This brand does have a product I LOVE and use regularly - Coconut CoWash Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have 3c curly hair afican american hair. I have been natural for about 2 yrs but I have only became  aware of all of the products out there  recently and I can say so far my favorits are Beautiful textures and As I am I am products. When I want a well defined twist out, I use this product. Ususlly, I wash or wet my hair with water and peppermint oil, add a little oil(avocado or jojoba) and then I twist with this double butter creme. When I want a fuller look I use the beautiful textures creme. Either one works well on my type of hair. I producted this at the Duane Reade(Walgreen) for about 10 dollars...I think</li>
            <li> I purchased the moisturizer  in a store and never realized it was conditioner... I have been using it as lotion. My legs feel amazing. Hahahaha I love it.  I guess I should try it on my hair too.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer smell soooooooo good! I feel like eating it! my hair feels soft and moisture when I apply it. Awesome product. Ordered it twice already :)</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer without leaving the hair flaky or crunchy!!!</li>
            <li> As the others stated, the As I Am products made my hair dry.  I tried the shampoo pudding, conditioner, leave-in, butter, and milk.  I&#x27;m not sure which one caused the dryness. After the shampoo, conditioner and leave in, my hair felt dry and stiff after my hair fully dried.  It didnt get any better once I applied the butter.  I&#x27;m washing my hair out today in hopes that my hair will go back to normal.</li>
            <li> I am a product JUNKIE!  I purchased this product from Sally&#x27;s after using several other products, to include Ms. Jessie&#x27;s pudding, Kinky Curl and several others.  This is the only product that I have used that leaves a nice sheen on my hair.  I typically use the daily butter daily to refresh my curls after lightly misting my hair. I do use a pretty generous amount after a wash.  If I have gone several days 3-4 days without washing the product out I will use the DB with some ECO Styler or Kinky Curl gel, to help tame the frizz.  My hair falls in the 3b-c range, shoulder length, and can be really dry toward the end of the day.  But this product really leaves my hair with a nice sheen and NOT so dry and thirsty looking.  I really enjoy the DB and the Twist Out creme, both are Excellent!</li>
            <li> My hair loves this moisturizer. It leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable for combing. I have severe natural dry hair that needs moisturizing at least two or three times a day and this cream does it. Because of its richness, I only have to use it at least one a day. It&#x27;s expensive, but worth every penny to keep my hair moisturized throughout the entire day. And, yes the smell is fabulous, but I like the way it does the job in keeping my hair moisturized. This is the main goal that I am pleased with! :)))</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to purchase any products given the increasing amounts of products on the market targeting the natural hair community.  I was perfectly content with a very dependable line I have been using for over two years.  Not sure what made me take the plung but I am glad that I did!  I have been natural for several years and have tried so many products.  I have to say that the As I Am product line is a standout.  The Double Butter Cream out performs only one other product that has been able to impart moisture to my tresses.  This product keeps my hair moistured from week to week...simply an amazing product.  You get a large quantity for the price and I will definitely purchase again.  Although it will be a while because you really don&#x27;t have to use alot of product to get great results.  I also love the Coconut Co-Wash and Hydration Elevation products from this line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have kinky curly hair but really want to &#x27;define&#x27; the curls I have.  Also if you use a curling iron at all - it will really hold the curl.  (My favorite is the &#x27;claspless&#x27; ones where you just wind your hair around it.  Comes out awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read the instructions, they want you to use VERY LITTLE and rub your hands together and scrunch.  You&#x27;re not supposed to use a lot of this.  Sometime &#x27;less is better&#x27;.....I find that with most hair products.  I can imagine that if your dousing your hair with this - it will not be moisturizing at all and would appear lifeless and limp.  I also really like the moisture milk - but again - don&#x27;t use a lot of anything.  The co-wash is amazing - just ordered a few more jars of that.  I really like Hair One Argon Co-wash as well - but this line kind of smells better so I switch between the two.</li>
            <li> Best used at night  with a protective style. Smells great not harsh. Best used as a moisturizer but can be used to seal</li>
            <li> A++++ this product is awesome. Leaves my hair moisturized for the day. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It may be expensive, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It really defines my curls. It is very moisturizing which is why I like to use it for second day hair. I don&#x27;t have to re-wet my hair. Very creamy. Disappears fairly well. It comes off a little white but that goes away. (Some other creams take forever to work in)</li>
            <li> smells great.  use it after wash and condition my hair</li>
            <li> I read reviews with a \\&quot;grain of salt\\&quot; but I sought out this product and used it for the first time yesterday...I intend to make this a staple in my regimen and will use it for a dry twist out this evening...can&#x27;t wait to see how it turns out tomorrow...tons of product in the jar so I won&#x27;t need to purchase it again for a while...thanks much for such a great product and the smell is not bad either.</li>
            <li> I have mostly 4a and 4c African American hair, with a few areas of 4b.  I have tried Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie, but found it lacked hold and left a white residue that takes hours to disappear.  I heard about this product, and after shelling out the money at the local beauty supply store, crossed my fingers.  I love it!  It&#x27;s rich enough to really moisturize and penetrate the hair, and it provides great definition with minimum first day frizz.  I do use other products with it, although, I used the same products with Shea Moisture and didn&#x27;t get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, my routine is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash with Terressentials Lavender and condition with  Aussie Moist or Co-wash with Aussie Moist&lt;br /&gt;2) Apple Cider Vinegar Rinse&lt;br /&gt;3) Jane Carter Leave-in Spray Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;4) African Pride Olive Oil Leave-in Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;5) Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;6) Detangle!&lt;br /&gt;7) As I Am Double Butter Cream&lt;br /&gt;8) Aloe Vera Gel&lt;br /&gt;9) Flat twist and let dry/set for at least 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;10) Take down twists!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can maintain a fairly frizz-free twist out for about 3-4 days by pineappling at night and sleeping in a satin scarf/bonnet!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, cream is awesome for my hair type and it really moisturises and gives my hair a shine, which I have gotten compliments on!</li>
            <li> I have used this product over 4 times and it does leave me hair moisturized. This is the cream I use for my LOC method (I also alternate with their leave in) and it makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> I am african american with 3b/3c hair, and this product I can not live without!  I apply this product on wet hair, after using a rinse out conditioner and applying Hot 6 Oil.  I don&#x27;t even use gel on my wash and go&#x27;s if I use this product.  My curls remain in tact for atleast 3 days without gel, and up to 6 days with gel.</li>
