    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is awesome if you like to wash your hands to get it off for an hour without any luck.</li>
            <li>Good Stuff!</li>
            <li>this is a great product</li>
            <li>Works good and holds hair all day</li>
            <li>I like it in the container, but to be fair</li>
            <li>best cru around, old school!</li>
            <li>Also, if your hair is more than about 1 1/2 inches in length, it will make your hair look greasy and stringy.  </li>
            <li>As the label states, it is best suited for very short hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many many years (30 +)</li>
            <li>It adds more control and holds my hair in place.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful for your hair</li>
            <li>Or maybe Im just imagining things and need to use more of the product?</li>
            <li>Can no longer get from barber so thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and stays in place until you wash it out.  </li>
            <li>If you want a strong wax for your hair</li>
            <li>For my husband and son to touch up fly aways; works terrific.</li>
            <li>Great for second day touch ups as well.</li>
            <li>I use Groom and Clean and a fine toothed comb to get the wax out.</li>
            <li>Great product, same consistent quality as ever, great for short hair.</li>
            <li>Shampooing it out of your hair is like trying to clean up an oil spill.  </li>
            <li>This is the product my barber has used on me for years....was glad to find it from a seller at a reasonable price with shipping included.  </li>
            <li>Look\\&quot;, and nothing I&#x27;ve tried has worked as well as \\&quot;Lucky Tiger Control Wax\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will:  it stiffens the hair so that it will stand up straight, which is why it is ideal for Flat Tops.</li>
            <li>style.&lt;br /&gt;For a flat top style hair cut you cant get more control than with this.  </li>
            <li>If you have a short hair style, I think you will be thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>If you wear a flat top this is the stuff you need.</li>
            <li>I used the fashionable French stuff in tubes, also another high priced water based wax, but this stuff works far better!</li>
            <li>I did not think the only other reviewer of the product was fair, as it was not a product meant for his hair</li>
            <li>He tried some other brands but thankfully able to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>not a texture I could use for my particular styling needs.</li>
            <li>I put the product on my finger tips and tap it all over my freshly washed moist hair then run my fingers from the front to back and think it is easy to shape your hair the way you want with ease.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had trouble controlling my hair since childhood.  </li>
            <li>really soft and sticky sticky!  </li>
            <li>Unlike the other reviewer, I find it washes out easily with regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavily perfumed, like a lot of hair products on the market these days.  </li>
            <li>What finally worked for me was a short cut, \\&quot;Military, Flat Top, Police Officer</li>
            <li>Its decent wax but honestly not worth the hassle.</li>

            <li> This is a typical old fashioned oil based pomade.</li>
            <li> This is definately for folks with short hair (per other reviews)</li>
            <li> Even though the jar is small, it will last a long time because you only need to use a little bit at a time.    </li>
            <li> Feels like sticky pink grease.</li>
            <li> Husband used in in 23 years of military service.</li>
            <li> In any event if youve got quality short straight hair and not wavy and thinning crap hair like I do compliments of really $</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> perhaps a little bit thicker.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using this stuff for years and it works well on my short military-style cuts although the consistency of it seems to be somewhat weak</li>
            <li> It will stay in your hair for a few days unless you use dish detergent (DAWN) to wash it out with.  </li>
            <li> It has a very slight fragrance in the jar, but once you put it in your hair</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> compared to years gone past.</li>
            <li> Because this product is petroleum-based, it is very heavy and sticky.  </li>
            <li> Too greasy hard to wash out of your hair.  </li>

            <li> The PROS:  This product does exactly what it says it will:  it stiffens the hair so that it will stand up straight, which is why it is ideal for Flat Tops. It is not heavily perfumed, like a lot of hair products on the market these days.  It has a very slight fragrance in the jar, but once you put it in your hair it is practically  undetectable.  Even though the jar is small, it will last a long time because you only need to use a little bit at a time.    The CONS:  Because this product is petroleum-based, it is very heavy and sticky.  In fact, it has almost the same consistency as Vasaline..perhaps a little bit thicker.  Shampooing it out of your hair is like trying to clean up an oil spill.  It will stay in your hair for a few days unless you use dish detergent (DAWN) to wash it out with.  Also, if your hair is more than about 1 1/2 inches in length, it will make your hair look greasy and stringy.  As the label states, it is best suited for very short hair.</li>
            <li> i like this over bees wax</li>
            <li> best cru around, old school!</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do ya! Works good and holds hair all day</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many many years (30 +).&lt;br /&gt;After someone suggested it, then it was simply called &amp;#34;Butch wax&amp;#34;, the neighbor drugstore had to &amp;#34;special order&amp;#34; it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to shape my handle bar mustache, sort of a trade mark of mine.&lt;br /&gt;Before I used the fashionable French stuff in tubes, also another high priced water based wax, but this stuff works far better!</li>
            <li> I use this wax before I put my water based pomade.  It adds more control and holds my hair in place.  I use Groom and Clean and a fine toothed comb to get the wax out. This is a typical old fashioned oil based pomade.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome if you like to wash your hands to get it off for an hour without any luck. It&#x27;s not awful for your hair but it makes me feel like i&#x27;m ripping my hair out. So if you are losing your hair or want to start losing your hair then use this! Its decent wax but honestly not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Great product, same consistent quality as ever, great for short hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a decade.  I did not think the only other reviewer of the product was fair, as it was not a product meant for his hair style.&lt;br /&gt;For a flat top style hair cut you cant get more control than with this.  It is easy to apply and stays in place until you wash it out.  Unlike the other reviewer, I find it washes out easily with regular shampoo.  I happen to use Head and Shoulders.  I put the product on my finger tips and tap it all over my freshly washed moist hair then run my fingers from the front to back and think it is easy to shape your hair the way you want with ease.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had trouble controlling my hair since childhood.  What finally worked for me was a short cut, \\&quot;Military, Flat Top, Police Officer Look\\&quot;, and nothing I&#x27;ve tried has worked as well as \\&quot;Lucky Tiger Control Wax\\&quot;.  I like it in the container, but to be fair I have not tried the stick.  A little goes a long way.  If you have a short hair style, I think you will be thrilled with this product.  I get alot of compliments.</li>
            <li> For my husband and son to touch up fly aways; works terrific. Great for second day touch ups as well.</li>
            <li> This is the product my barber has used on me for years....was glad to find it from a seller at a reasonable price with shipping included.  This is definately for folks with short hair (per other reviews)</li>
            <li> If you want a strong wax for your hair this is a great product</li>
            <li> really soft and sticky sticky!  not a texture I could use for my particular styling needs. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Too greasy hard to wash out of your hair.  I don&#x27;t have enough words, now I do, now I do.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this stuff for years.  He used to get it from his barber, but he stopped selling it.  He tried some other brands but thankfully able to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Feels like sticky pink grease. I had no desire to put this stuff in my hair. I gave it away.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this stuff for years and it works well on my short military-style cuts although the consistency of it seems to be somewhat weak compared to years gone past. Or maybe Im just imagining things and need to use more of the product? In any event if youve got quality short straight hair and not wavy and thinning crap hair like I do compliments of really $****  genes, this stuff will do the job.</li>
            <li> Husband used in in 23 years of military service. Can no longer get from barber so thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> If you wear a flat top this is the stuff you need.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff! Recommend for short hair. USMC</li>
