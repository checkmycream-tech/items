            <li>and I am in love with the price of it</li>
            <li>Target sells a matte top coat for $2.00.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will love the polish.</li>
            <li>I recommend for anyone who likes to get creative with nails.</li>
            <li>Or getting the China Glaze Matte Magic finish coat that turns any polish into matte.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but chipped after one night</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t us</li>
            <li>top coat or the matte will go way.</li>
            <li>Love this polish.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t even stay in for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>I love matte colors</li>
            <li>I tried two coats and that was not any better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love the finish it puts on my nails.</li>
            <li>Flaked off after about 20 min, after putting on two coats AND a top coat.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>I even put a matte top coat over it and that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars for being able to achieve the desired effects.</li>
            <li>I love love love the color of this nail polish.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li>It worked great and its super fun to play with.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color and how fast it dries, shipped to me in good time.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it better than my Zoya</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying a matte color and honestly speaking I love it</li>
            <li>I love it so smooth</li>
            <li>Love everything about this and the color was just exactly how i imagined!!</li>
            <li>super great product and really works.</li>
            <li>The polish dries fast and doesn&#x27;t chip easily which is good for my job.</li>
            <li>The matte effect looks really cool though!</li>
            <li>Comes off easy.</li>
            <li>It chips way too easily.</li>
            <li>It chips off too easily</li>
            <li>It also chips rather easily</li>
            <li>BUT IT CHIPS OFF EASILY..</li>
            <li>It flakes and chips off very quickly, so</li>
            <li>The drying time was very quick also.</li>
            <li>It comes off so easily.</li>
            <li>This nail polish has a horribly strong smell and chips immediately after applying.</li>
            <li>And matted nice at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect matte black and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s me, but it does tend to chip off fairly quickly in the course of a day of pounding the keyboard, but I like the look!</li>
            <li>This polish is terribly cheap.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so cheap and chips before the day is done.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t enjoy repainting it every three hours or so.</li>
            <li>Still, I like the color and smooth texture.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it. :)</li>
            <li>Cheap price but also cheap quality.</li>
            <li>The fingernail polish is great when you first put it on, but it chips far too easily.</li>
            <li>and I really like this matte finish!!!</li>
            <li>Love it and drys super quick</li>
            <li>Although this polish was cheap it isn&#x27;t even worth buying!</li>
            <li>But once it was on, it layered down a bit and looked very good.</li>
            <li>and moving so quickly doesn&#x27;t allow me to be as accurate in image placement.  </li>
            <li>However, it looks really cool if you do matte on your whole nail and then put top coat on the tips.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish color and brand sooooooo much</li>
            <li>The polish color is really cool</li>
            <li>Good for doing your nails for a party on the same night.</li>
            <li>The only thing remotely good about it is it is matte.</li>
            <li>amazing just what i wanted only thing is it chips easily</li>
            <li>it is a beautiful matte black color</li>
            <li>I went with this as it&#x27;s usually a great pairing with other colors.</li>
            <li>the only good thing is the color the color is great but not worth the money</li>
            <li>so you have to be quick on applying it.</li>
            <li>and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>, it dries quick.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and you don&#x27;t need a lot of coats.</li>
            <li>It chipped so quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries to quick before you can finish nails</li>
            <li>but it chipped so quickly.</li>
            <li>This fries very fast!</li>
            <li>do enjoy it when I first put it on</li>
            <li>But it chips way too fast and easily, have to repaint my nails all day to keep it...</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was expecting it to be!</li>
            <li>this was exactly that in a nail polish!</li>
            <li>only problem I would have is that because you can&#x27;t put a top coat on, it can chip easy.</li>
            <li>It looks great for a few hours though.</li>
            <li>Still worth it I say, because you can always just add another coat</li>
            <li>I love to put a clear coat on my tips to make it shiny. :</li>
            <li>, I really liked the color when it actually stayed on.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll just buy a nice matte clear coat that I can put on top of any color.</li>
            <li>Chips off pretty quick</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it did work well, but chipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even get the right nails polish..</li>
            <li>I loved the color when it first went on, it dried matte, and looked great for a few days.</li>
            <li>Because pretty much right after that time, it chips off.</li>
            <li>I wish it was as good as the matte clear or the regular nail polish</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loved this matte black polish.  </li>
            <li>You may want to buy a matte clear coat though because it comes off easy.</li>
            <li>This nail polish really is matte and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast.</li>
            <li>I love this color  definitely one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>For the first hour or two.</li>
            <li>My first time ever purchasing a Matte color.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>It comes dries exactly like the picture portrays.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the color is exactly what I wanted, definitely worth the money I paid for this product.</li>
            <li>Really like the matte finish!</li>
            <li>This also works very well for stamping!</li>
            <li>so you have that edgy feel but still elegant enought to wear with your favorite dress</li>
            <li>I was certain this polish would disappoint me, but</li>
            <li>It looks great, until it&#x27;s all gone half an hour later.</li>
            <li>Very unprofessional.</li>
            <li>and I really do like the polish.</li>
            <li>Drys really fast and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>It is very clumpy and doesn&#x27;t look very matted.</li>
            <li>Chips really fast.</li>
            <li>I really wanted</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>The shipping was also fast.</li>
            <li>I like this nail polish because it give a very finished look because it is matte.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It Chips way too fast</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t mind applying more, but i can do without having to redo it every other day.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;d give it more of a 3 and a half really...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit thicker than regular nail polish, and dries super fast too.</li>
            <li>i love the look and feel of this nail polish its dark</li>
            <li>It was a really cool nail polish, especially for the price</li>
            <li>:) The only thing is this nail polish is very thick, it clumps up very easily</li>
            <li>This polish lasts much longer than most other polishes I&#x27;ve used over the years!!</li>
            <li>More looks like black white-out on your nails.</li>
            <li>Next time I will spend more and wait for OPI to be back in stock.</li>
            <li>high end nail polishes</li>
            <li>It dries to a simple matte black color and looks great for a short while after it is applied.</li>
            <li>Black is a unique color if you can rock it!</li>
            <li>It goes on very well onto the nail even though I haven&#x27;t tried using it on my natural nails</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this nail polish if you plan on wearing it for more than a few days at a time.</li>
            <li>I just finished painting my nails with my new Kleancolor Matte Finish Nail Polish</li>
            <li>It is a bit hard to come off using nail polish remover due to the fact that your gonna have to scrub the nail, but overral great investment</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest spending a little extra for a better brand.</li>
            <li>got some sparkly clear nail color</li>
            <li>unless you have a matte drying clear coat, save your money.</li>
            <li>It goes on actually matte, which is the whole reason to get it.</li>
            <li>Was old and tacky.</li>
            <li>Looks completely matte like paint - until you shower or wash your hands, etc.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I only gave this 2 starts because of the fast delivery, but it should have gotten a 1.</li>
            <li>I bought false nails and painted them instead of my own nails</li>
            <li>The amount is good for it&#x27;s price(: this also works well with false nails!</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it chips easily and the matte will wear off after a few days</li>
            <li>Pretty color, doesn&#x27;t seen to last long though.</li>
            <li>It was really thick and had a strong smell, almost like gasoline.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the matte finish, but the polish is just very very thick.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see how well this nail polish works, it only takes one coat.</li>
            <li>It is thick, so beware of clumpage - but it was cheap....</li>
            <li>Like, I painted them and they chipped right after they dried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty long lasting, but the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it actually becomes shinier the longer you wear it.</li>
            <li>It chips like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;Really not worth it, but It does dry quickly.</li>
            <li>It went on a little thick, and the smell is very strong.  </li>
            <li>and the black is very vibrant.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t even been a day since I painted my nails and already the tips of every single one of my nails are almost completely void of polish.</li>
            <li>the only negative is that it dries SO quickly that sometimes I can&#x27;t even pick the entire image off the plate.</li>

            <li> I even put a matte top coat over it and that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars for being able to achieve the desired effects.</li>
            <li> I love love love the color of this nail polish.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li> It worked great and its super fun to play with.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color and how fast it dries, shipped to me in good time.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it better than my Zoya</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a matte color and honestly speaking I love it</li>
            <li> I love it so smooth</li>
            <li> Love everything about this and the color was just exactly how i imagined!!</li>
            <li> super great product and really works.</li>
            <li> The polish dries fast and doesn&#x27;t chip easily which is good for my job.</li>
            <li> The matte effect looks really cool though!</li>
            <li> Comes off easy.</li>
            <li> It chips way too easily.</li>
            <li> It chips off too easily</li>
            <li> It also chips rather easily</li>
            <li> BUT IT CHIPS OFF EASILY..</li>
            <li> It flakes and chips off very quickly, so</li>
            <li> The drying time was very quick also.</li>
            <li> It comes off so easily.</li>
            <li> This nail polish has a horribly strong smell and chips immediately after applying.</li>
            <li> And matted nice at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect matte black and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but it does tend to chip off fairly quickly in the course of a day of pounding the keyboard, but I like the look!</li>
            <li> This polish is terribly cheap.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so cheap and chips before the day is done.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t enjoy repainting it every three hours or so.</li>
            <li> Still, I like the color and smooth texture.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it. :)</li>
            <li> Cheap price but also cheap quality.</li>
            <li> The fingernail polish is great when you first put it on, but it chips far too easily.</li>
            <li> and I really like this matte finish!!!</li>
            <li> Love it and drys super quick</li>
            <li> Although this polish was cheap it isn&#x27;t even worth buying!</li>
            <li> But once it was on, it layered down a bit and looked very good.</li>
            <li> and moving so quickly doesn&#x27;t allow me to be as accurate in image placement.  </li>
            <li> However, it looks really cool if you do matte on your whole nail and then put top coat on the tips.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish color and brand sooooooo much</li>
            <li> The polish color is really cool</li>
            <li> Good for doing your nails for a party on the same night.</li>
            <li> The only thing remotely good about it is it is matte.</li>
            <li> amazing just what i wanted only thing is it chips easily</li>
            <li> it is a beautiful matte black color</li>
            <li> I went with this as it&#x27;s usually a great pairing with other colors.</li>
            <li> the only good thing is the color the color is great but not worth the money</li>
            <li> so you have to be quick on applying it.</li>
            <li> and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> , it dries quick.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and you don&#x27;t need a lot of coats.</li>
            <li> It chipped so quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries to quick before you can finish nails</li>
            <li> but it chipped so quickly.</li>
            <li> This fries very fast!</li>
            <li> do enjoy it when I first put it on</li>
            <li> But it chips way too fast and easily, have to repaint my nails all day to keep it...</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was expecting it to be!</li>
            <li> this was exactly that in a nail polish!</li>
            <li> only problem I would have is that because you can&#x27;t put a top coat on, it can chip easy.</li>
            <li> It looks great for a few hours though.</li>
            <li> Still worth it I say, because you can always just add another coat</li>
            <li> I love to put a clear coat on my tips to make it shiny. :</li>
            <li> , I really liked the color when it actually stayed on.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll just buy a nice matte clear coat that I can put on top of any color.</li>
            <li> Chips off pretty quick</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it did work well, but chipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get the right nails polish..</li>
            <li> I loved the color when it first went on, it dried matte, and looked great for a few days.</li>
            <li> Because pretty much right after that time, it chips off.</li>
            <li> I wish it was as good as the matte clear or the regular nail polish</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loved this matte black polish.  </li>
            <li> You may want to buy a matte clear coat though because it comes off easy.</li>
            <li> This nail polish really is matte and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast.</li>
            <li> I love this color  definitely one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> For the first hour or two.</li>
            <li> My first time ever purchasing a Matte color.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> It comes dries exactly like the picture portrays.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the color is exactly what I wanted, definitely worth the money I paid for this product.</li>
            <li> Really like the matte finish!</li>
            <li> This also works very well for stamping!</li>
            <li> so you have that edgy feel but still elegant enought to wear with your favorite dress</li>
            <li> I was certain this polish would disappoint me, but</li>
            <li> It looks great, until it&#x27;s all gone half an hour later.</li>
            <li> Very unprofessional.</li>
            <li> and I really do like the polish.</li>
            <li> Drys really fast and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> It is very clumpy and doesn&#x27;t look very matted.</li>
            <li> Chips really fast.</li>
            <li> I really wanted</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> The shipping was also fast.</li>
            <li> I like this nail polish because it give a very finished look because it is matte.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It Chips way too fast</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t mind applying more, but i can do without having to redo it every other day.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;d give it more of a 3 and a half really...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thicker than regular nail polish, and dries super fast too.</li>
            <li> i love the look and feel of this nail polish its dark</li>
            <li> It was a really cool nail polish, especially for the price</li>
            <li> :) The only thing is this nail polish is very thick, it clumps up very easily</li>
            <li> This polish lasts much longer than most other polishes I&#x27;ve used over the years!!</li>
            <li> More looks like black white-out on your nails.</li>
            <li> Next time I will spend more and wait for OPI to be back in stock.</li>
            <li> high end nail polishes</li>
            <li> It dries to a simple matte black color and looks great for a short while after it is applied.</li>
            <li> Black is a unique color if you can rock it!</li>
            <li> It goes on very well onto the nail even though I haven&#x27;t tried using it on my natural nails</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this nail polish if you plan on wearing it for more than a few days at a time.</li>
            <li> I just finished painting my nails with my new Kleancolor Matte Finish Nail Polish</li>
            <li> It is a bit hard to come off using nail polish remover due to the fact that your gonna have to scrub the nail, but overral great investment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest spending a little extra for a better brand.</li>
            <li> got some sparkly clear nail color</li>
            <li> unless you have a matte drying clear coat, save your money.</li>
            <li> It goes on actually matte, which is the whole reason to get it.</li>
            <li> Was old and tacky.</li>
            <li> Looks completely matte like paint - until you shower or wash your hands, etc.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 2 starts because of the fast delivery, but it should have gotten a 1.</li>
            <li> I bought false nails and painted them instead of my own nails</li>
            <li> The amount is good for it&#x27;s price(: this also works well with false nails!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it chips easily and the matte will wear off after a few days</li>
            <li> Pretty color, doesn&#x27;t seen to last long though.</li>
            <li> It was really thick and had a strong smell, almost like gasoline.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the matte finish, but the polish is just very very thick.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how well this nail polish works, it only takes one coat.</li>
            <li> It is thick, so beware of clumpage - but it was cheap....</li>
            <li> Like, I painted them and they chipped right after they dried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty long lasting, but the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it actually becomes shinier the longer you wear it.</li>
            <li> It chips like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;Really not worth it, but It does dry quickly.</li>
            <li> It went on a little thick, and the smell is very strong.  </li>
            <li> and the black is very vibrant.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t even been a day since I painted my nails and already the tips of every single one of my nails are almost completely void of polish.</li>
            <li> the only negative is that it dries SO quickly that sometimes I can&#x27;t even pick the entire image off the plate.</li>
            <li> I love the matte colors but this product was a serious waste of money.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that you cant put clear over it or it will look like regular black nail polish.</li>
            <li> When the polish gets wet, it&#x27;s no longer matte and just looks like normal black nail polish.</li>
            <li> The black really is a matter black just as described.  </li>
            <li> Very thick first coating I didnt have to use a second coat.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly thick after first use, making it impossible to use more than once.</li>
            <li> how dry it looked with ought the gloss</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry...</li>
            <li> Even if it does happen to dry it shrinks on your nail and causes cracks.</li>
            <li> Also takes quite awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wear it for a single day without having it chip.</li>
            <li> Also bought a matte pink from this brand and that, too, took a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> After a few days it starts to lose it&#x27;s matte finish and somehow becomes shiny; it looks like you&#x27;re wearing regular black polish &amp; that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it the extra star.</li>
            <li> but I got just a clear matte instead  :/</li>
            <li> This product sucks so much i would have constantly keep reapplying my nail polish because everyday i would apply the nail polish it would chip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s matte for day one and two, but after that it starts to lose it&#x27;s finish and looks a lot like regular black polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech, so that meant taking off the polish and doing a regular black with a matte topcoat, which was what I&#x27;d been doing before.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even last a full 4 hours without chipping so bad that I had to repaint an entire hand.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even last a full 4 hours without chipping so bad that I had to repaint an entire hand.  </li>
            <li> I have to put a new coat on everyday just to have it chip within a few hours of wearing it.</li>
            <li> It just requires a little extra maintenance to keep it looking matte.</li>
            <li> Total Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Item was what I expected however delivery was to arrive between 12-21/12-24</li>
            <li> But the second time I went to use it, the formula had become too thick to do a proper manicure with.</li>
            <li> so I have mixed feelings about this polish as I love the dark black but am frustrated when I have to keep redoing the stamping.</li>
            <li> My Nail tech used the black matte with regular black tips for a formal event.</li>
            <li> Dries very fast but overall just horrible, chipped completely the same day!</li>
            <li> Not sure how anyone could give this polish a bad review, the price and quality are both outstanding.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product its not worth it.</li>
            <li> At the maintenance rate I was going, it just is not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> the average nail polish.</li>
            <li> definitely matte black which is hard to find in nail polish.</li>
            <li> I mean, it was only four dollars</li>
            <li> it is a black black.</li>
            <li> Need to change the name to black gloss.</li>
            <li> I got black with sparkles not even matte.</li>
            <li> It smells like your typical nail polish</li>
            <li> however, i found that it does chip slightly faster then</li>
            <li> I was looking for a matte black and purchased this one because OPI&#x27;s was unavailable.</li>
            <li> I bought black</li>
            <li> I ordered the product June 5 &amp; it says it takes 3-5 business days which is not true</li>
            <li> it is very dark black.</li>
            <li> pissed that i wasted money..</li>
            <li> It chipped in a few hours.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Chipped within a few days.</li>
            <li> only negative thing is that if you are slow on applying it tends to build up and look clumpy.</li>
            <li> Matte black!</li>
            <li> this is so bad at first</li>
            <li> I loved the matte look but it chipped so bad that it looked horrible by the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with the price but the quality of the Polish is terrible.</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time locating black matte polish.</li>
            <li> but if it doesn&#x27;t dry it is useless to me.</li>
            <li> Hard to find matte polish out there.</li>
            <li> The quality sucks.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any serious chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied it around 4 pm on a sunday and at about 4pm the next day it was badly chipped.</li>
            <li> Not a good quality nail polish.</li>
            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on so thick that it&#x27;s nearly impossible not to mess up the color.</li>
            <li> It was very thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> The nail technician had to add acetone to it in order to thin it out.</li>
            <li> I tried to thin it out with nail polish remover to no avail, and as soon as i washed my hands it started to chip.</li>
            <li> It was really weird.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating being</li>
            <li> The trick is to apply very thin coats.</li>
            <li> It was very dramatic.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!! Chips in less than a day.</li>
            <li> I repainted it just because I thought I was crazy, but no it is shiny by day 2.</li>
            <li> so it ends up looking bad.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s shipped really bad.</li>
            <li> so I was a bit disappointed,</li>
            <li> and I hate having to repaint every day.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> this nail polish is crap!</li>
            <li> Quality is awful.  </li>
            <li> but this product was terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this nail polish color and brand sooooooo much I enjoy it better than my Zoya high end nail polishes and I am in love with the price of it 👍👍👍👍</li>
            <li> This is a very good nail polish! it&#x27;s 100% matte! and the black is very vibrant. This fries very fast! so you have to be quick on applying it. It comes off easily with some nail polish remover! The amount is good for it&#x27;s price(: this also works well with false nails! only negative thing is that if you are slow on applying it tends to build up and look clumpy.</li>
            <li> love the matte color but the polish goes on kind of chunky</li>
            <li> Love it and drys super quick</li>
            <li> The polish color is really cool and it dries quickly. But, it chips immediately. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I loved the matte look but it chipped so bad that it looked horrible by the next morning.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Although this polish was cheap it isn&#x27;t even worth buying! It chipped off my nails instantly and didn&#x27;t even have the matte finish!</li>
            <li> Dries very fast but overall just horrible, chipped completely the same day!</li>
            <li> Chips off pretty quick but I like it</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was expecting it to be! Color stayed on perfectly (onl acrylic nails)</li>
            <li> This polish is terribly cheap. It chipped hours after applying and by the next say I looked like I had some sort of nervous habit and bit off all my polish. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I liked this nail polish but it chips really easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail polish but I got just a clear matte instead  :/</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how well this nail polish works, it only takes one coat. It&#x27;s a bit thicker than regular nail polish, and dries super fast too. It goes on actually matte, which is the whole reason to get it. It&#x27;s pretty long lasting, but the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it actually becomes shinier the longer you wear it. It&#x27;s matte for day one and two, but after that it starts to lose it&#x27;s finish and looks a lot like regular black polish. Still worth it I say, because you can always just add another coat and it&#x27;s matte again.</li>
            <li> This product sucks so much i would have constantly keep reapplying my nail polish because everyday i would apply the nail polish it would chip. Target sells a matte top coat for $2.00. Don&#x27;t buy this product its not worth it.</li>
            <li> It goes on very well onto the nail even though I haven&#x27;t tried using it on my natural nails I have used it on acrylics.</li>
            <li> I love this color  definitely one of my favorites. can do a lot with the matte color with designs and such. would definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> I just received my nail polish and I haven&#x27;t tried it out yet. I&#x27;m sure I will love the polish. My issue is that it was opened and USED before shipped. There is paint on the side of the bottle and looks like it was used sent back and then reshipped to Me. Very unprofessional. Probably never order from this company a again.</li>
            <li> Comes off easy. Loved the color though.</li>
            <li> I loved this. It worked great and its super fun to play with. I love to put a clear coat on my tips to make it shiny. :)&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I would have is that because you can&#x27;t put a top coat on, it can chip easy. Still great though!! I recommend for anyone who likes to get creative with nails.</li>
            <li> It worked for what I needed it for. Hard to find matte polish out there. This was all I could find.</li>
            <li> Not a good quality nail polish. It chips way too easily.</li>
            <li> It is a great polish. For the first hour or two. Because pretty much right after that time, it chips off. And it wasn&#x27;t as if I was doing anything after that would cause my nails to chip. I&#x27;d suggest spending a little extra for a better brand. Or getting the China Glaze Matte Magic finish coat that turns any polish into matte. It&#x27;s a smaller bottle but it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I loved the color when it first went on, it dried matte, and looked great for a few days. It didn&#x27;t chip for me until the 4th day but I figured it was because of work, not the polish quality. After a few days it starts to lose it&#x27;s matte finish and somehow becomes shiny; it looks like you&#x27;re wearing regular black polish &amp; that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it the extra star. It just requires a little extra maintenance to keep it looking matte. It&#x27;s a good price for what you get and I really do like the polish.</li>
            <li> It was okay, but chipped after one night</li>
            <li> Was old and tacky. Threw away.</li>
            <li> Looks nice for a hour. But after a hour the polish starts to chip. This product needs some type of fix</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used matte nail polish before so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. It was really thick and had a strong smell, almost like gasoline. In fact,it was kind of like painting your nails with tar. But once it was on, it layered down a bit and looked very good. Make sure you don&#x27;t us top coat or the matte will go way. However, it looks really cool if you do matte on your whole nail and then put top coat on the tips. They chipped a lot the next day so I was a bit disappointed, but oh well.</li>
            <li> Love this polish. It&#x27;s very strong and doesn&#x27;t chip easily. I have oily skin and hair so the matte only lasts about a week and it starts to get shiny. I just add another coat and it&#x27;s good to go! The color goes glossy before the polish chips</li>
            <li> It chips off too easily this is so bad at first I loved how dry it looked with ought the gloss but it didn&#x27;t even stay in for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color and how fast it dries, shipped to me in good time. But it chips way too fast and easily, have to repaint my nails all day to keep it...</li>
            <li> My first time ever purchasing a Matte color. I went with this as it&#x27;s usually a great pairing with other colors. I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it dried and how it made the stamping design pop out. Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish! Drys really fast and doesn&#x27;t chip. Also doesn&#x27;t need a top coat to look good! :)</li>
            <li> this review is based off of nail stamping with the polish. The black really is a matter black just as described.  I bought it only for stamping and I&#x27;ve found the color to be the best konad alternative so far. it is very dark black. the only negative is that it dries SO quickly that sometimes I can&#x27;t even pick the entire image off the plate. and even when I do then the image doesn&#x27;t transfer to my nail because it has dries in the stamper.  so I have mixed feelings about this polish as I love the dark black but am frustrated when I have to keep redoing the stamping. and moving so quickly doesn&#x27;t allow me to be as accurate in image placement.  but again,  the color - awesome. it is a black black.</li>
            <li> I love the matte colors but this product was a serious waste of money. I fell in love with the price but the quality of the Polish is terrible. It didn&#x27;t even last a full 4 hours without chipping so bad that I had to repaint an entire hand. At the maintenance rate I was going, it just is not worth the purchase. Its a shame too, I really liked the color when it actually stayed on.</li>
            <li> i love the look and feel of this nail polish its dark so you have that edgy feel but still elegant enought to wear with your favorite dress</li>
            <li> I applied it around 4 pm on a sunday and at about 4pm the next day it was badly chipped. It def gives you the desired effect but don&#x27;t get it if you don&#x27;t plan on repainting it every night. Good for doing your nails for a party on the same night. The matte effect looks really cool though!</li>
            <li> This polish is great when you first apply it. Looks completely matte like paint - until you shower or wash your hands, etc. When the polish gets wet, it&#x27;s no longer matte and just looks like normal black nail polish. It also chips rather easily and you need to constantly re-apply.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product June 5 &amp; it says it takes 3-5 business days which is not true bc it&#x27;s the 18 of June &amp; it&#x27;s still not here therefor I haven&#x27;t got the chance to try it I want my $$$ back I&#x27;ll go through another seller !!!!</li>
            <li> Nice polish but not matte has a glossy shine that I did not want. Need to change the name to black gloss.</li>
            <li> It chips like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;Really not worth it, but It does dry quickly. But a couple hours into the day it just starts falling off</li>
            <li> This nail polish has a horribly strong smell and chips immediately after applying. It is incredibly thick after first use, making it impossible to use more than once. The only thing remotely good about it is it is matte. 0/10 would not recommend</li>
            <li> Horrible. Do not buy. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. It is very clumpy and doesn&#x27;t look very matted. More looks like black white-out on your nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gets clumpy and  the brush doesn&#x27;t leave even coat  I wish it was as good as the matte clear or the regular nail polish</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get the right nails polish.. I got black with sparkles not even matte. I&#x27;m not even going to try ordering it again</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but it does tend to chip off fairly quickly in the course of a day of pounding the keyboard, but I like the look!</li>
            <li> Chips really fast. Doesn&#x27;t even last a day the only good thing is the color the color is great but not worth the money</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on so thick that it&#x27;s nearly impossible not to mess up the color. I love the color and the matte finish, but the polish is just very very thick.</li>
            <li> I did not even receive the &amp;#34;matte black&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I got some sparkly clear nail color&lt;br /&gt;soo..</li>
            <li> Exactly what i wanted. the only thing is that you cant put clear over it or it will look like regular black nail polish.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about how it chips and I was worried. I bought false nails and painted them instead of my own nails and I haven&#x27;t had any serious chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that by the next day I assume it&#x27;s the oil from your skin, but the polish looks shiny. I repainted it just because I thought I was crazy, but no it is shiny by day 2. Very frustrating being I really wanted matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy it when I first put it on, it dries quick. But it doesn&#x27;t stay matte and I hate having to repaint every day.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this and the color was just exactly how i imagined!! It is a bit hard to come off using nail polish remover due to the fact that your gonna have to scrub the nail, but overral great investment</li>
            <li> this nail polish is crap! flakes of a couple hours after wear! pissed that i wasted money..</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a matte color and honestly speaking I love it anddddddd it dries fast which I love !!!! Great stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> On my granddaughter&#x27;s wish list and she thinks it&#x27;s great.....but she&#x27;s 12!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so cheap and chips before the day is done.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry... it is a beautiful matte black color but if it doesn&#x27;t dry it is useless to me. Even if it does happen to dry it shrinks on your nail and causes cracks. Also even if it drys it still can be scratched. Very disappointed. Will not get again. Next time I&#x27;ll just buy a nice matte clear coat that I can put on top of any color.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loved this matte black polish.  She was very happy with the product and so were her friends that used it too!!</li>
            <li> I loved the finished look. My Nail tech used the black matte with regular black tips for a formal event. It was very dramatic. Your polish was priced the best. I had a very hard time locating black matte polish. Not even my two local beauty discount stores carried it. I am so glad Amazon did!</li>
            <li> Loveeeee this nail polish! Deffinetly my favorite!</li>
            <li> Very good . My girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;d give it more of a 3 and a half really... Polish went on nice.. And matted nice at first. Do not put a second coat on btw... It doesn&#x27;t layer up well.... But the next day the finish turned glossy??!! It was really weird. Another thing? I have no clue what everyone means by the smell... It smells like your typical nail polish</li>
            <li> Total Waste of money.  Quality is awful.  I love matte colors but this product was terrible. It didn&#x27;t even last a full 4 hours without chipping so bad that I had to repaint an entire hand.  I tried two coats and that was not any better.</li>
            <li> A good color. Dries quickly and you don&#x27;t need a lot of coats. The best one I have bought so far.</li>
            <li> I just finished painting my nails with my new Kleancolor Matte Finish Nail Polish and I really like this matte finish!!! It comes dries exactly like the picture portrays. It is thick, so beware of clumpage - but it was cheap....so you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> ive looking for matte nail polish. finally found this. I LOVE IT. super great product and really works. gives that &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish.</li>
            <li> Pretty color, doesn&#x27;t seen to last long though. Also takes quite awhile to dry. Also bought a matte pink from this brand and that, too, took a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> DRIES MATTE BUT IT CHIPS OFF EASILY..</li>
            <li> It looks great, until it&#x27;s all gone half an hour later. It flakes and chips off very quickly, so unless you have a matte drying clear coat, save your money.</li>
            <li> It applies nicely but it chips off easily</li>
            <li> The fingernail polish is great when you first put it on, but it chips far too easily. I have to put a new coat on everyday just to have it chip within a few hours of wearing it. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this nail polish if you plan on wearing it for more than a few days at a time.</li>
            <li> Item was what I expected however delivery was to arrive between 12-21/12-24 and it did not arrive until  12/30.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I love the finish it puts on my nails. It is the coolest looking color also! Thanks so much</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the color is exactly what I wanted, definitely worth the money I paid for this product. The polish dries fast and doesn&#x27;t chip easily which is good for my job.</li>
            <li> Flaked off after about 20 min, after putting on two coats AND a top coat.</li>
            <li> I was certain this polish would disappoint me, but wow. I love it!! It&#x27;s the perfect matte black and so easy to use. The trick is to apply very thin coats. The drying time was very quick also. Not sure how anyone could give this polish a bad review, the price and quality are both outstanding.</li>
            <li> i like the nail polish, especially for the price. The shipping was also fast. however, i found that it does chip slightly faster then the average nail polish. i don&#x27;t mind applying more, but i can do without having to redo it every other day.</li>
            <li> I love the color but it was literally chipping off my nails by the second day. I even put a matte top coat over it and that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality!!!! Horrible!!!! Chips in less than a day. I would not recommend this nail polish to anyone. Not good</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Very thick first coating I didnt have to use a second coat. It dries very fast.</li>
            <li> It chipped so quickly. The day after i had painted my nails with it, they needed to be done again. It looks great for a few hours though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week since this nail polish was suppose to come in and it hasn&#x27;t yet....ill be sure to write another review when I get it.....if I ever do get it.</li>
            <li> my sister&#x27;s loves this nail polish, it cames very quickly, the delivery was good!</li>
            <li> It chipped in a few hours. It was a really cool nail polish, especially for the price but I didn&#x27;t enjoy repainting it every three hours or so.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try out the matte polish, but I&#x27;ve never tried this brand. I understand nail polish chips, but this polish began chipping almost immediately after I finish painting my nails. I gave it two stars for being able to achieve the desired effects. Save your dollars and go w/a different brand that will hopefully last longer.</li>
            <li> I love love love the color of this nail polish. It dries to a simple matte black color and looks great for a short while after it is applied. However, within under an hour it began to chip. It comes off so easily. It hasn&#x27;t even been a day since I painted my nails and already the tips of every single one of my nails are almost completely void of polish. Still, I like the color and smooth texture. Just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a matte black and purchased this one because OPI&#x27;s was unavailable. The first time I used it, it did work well, but chipped quickly. It went on a little thick, and the smell is very strong.  But the second time I went to use it, the formula had become too thick to do a proper manicure with. I&#x27;m a nail tech, so that meant taking off the polish and doing a regular black with a matte topcoat, which was what I&#x27;d been doing before.  Next time I will spend more and wait for OPI to be back in stock.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this color forever..and I finally found it...I love it so smooth and it dries matte just like it says...I bought black and I LOVE it</li>
            <li> Great color but chips almost immediately. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good Matte color nail polish and this one is perfect. You may want to buy a matte clear coat though because it comes off easy.</li>
            <li> It dries to quick before you can finish nails so it ends up looking bad. I out on just abt 2 hours ago and it&#x27;s shipped really bad. Will not use this again,</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish, I love anything matte! :) The only thing is this nail polish is very thick, it clumps up very easily but I think it&#x27;s worth it. :)</li>
            <li> Chipped within a few days. Cheap price but also cheap quality.</li>
            <li> definitely matte black which is hard to find in nail polish. this was exactly that in a nail polish! it is perfect I am ordering 3 more bottles!!</li>
            <li> I like this nail polish because it give a very finished look because it is matte.  I got a lot of compliments on the color.  Black is a unique color if you can rock it!</li>
            <li> takes off the next day</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Just as described. Would order again!</li>
            <li> I only gave this 2 starts because of the fast delivery, but it should have gotten a 1. The quality sucks. It was very thick and sticky. The nail technician had to add acetone to it in order to thin it out.</li>
            <li> Really like the matte finish!</li>
            <li> This polish lasts much longer than most other polishes I&#x27;ve used over the years!! I fully intend to purchase more!!</li>
            <li> I mean, it was only four dollars but it chipped so quickly. Like, I painted them and they chipped right after they dried. But it looks nice. It&#x27;s a good matte color.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Matte black!</li>
            <li> I was concerned when this polish arrived because it does not appear to be matte when you look at the bottle.  Put it on, and it is definitely matte! Just what I was looking for! This brand of polish offers great cover and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  The color selection is awesome as well.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it on my toes!</li>
            <li> Works great! actually is matte</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wear it for a single day without having it chip.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  I tried to thin it out with nail polish remover to no avail, and as soon as i washed my hands it started to chip.</li>
            <li> It Chips way too fast it didn&#x27;t even last me 3 hours</li>
            <li> This also works very well for stamping!</li>
            <li> Nice color, chips very very easily I had it on for about 35 minutes before it started chipping</li>
            <li> amazing just what i wanted only thing is it chips easily</li>
            <li> This nail polish really is matte and dries quickly. The only downside is that it chips easily and the matte will wear off after a few days</li>
    </ol>
