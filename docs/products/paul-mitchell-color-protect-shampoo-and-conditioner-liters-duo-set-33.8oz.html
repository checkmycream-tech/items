    <ol>
            <li>Cleans well, no build up, and of course, the best part is that it protects my color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>The best for highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Really a great experience</li>
            <li>Great Value.  </li>
            <li>I like Paul Mitchell and like that I could get both of them for a good price I like it a lot</li>
            <li>Good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>Very pleased</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite go to shampoo &amp; conditioners for color protect!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell before and really liked it.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I end up having to use an additional leave in conditioner just to be able to comb through it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Kerotin conditioner much better, easy to brush through.</li>
            <li>Very easy to have this arrive at my door rather than making a special trip to pick it up.  </li>
            <li>Really a great product  Leaves hair soft and managable.  </li>
            <li>--it does really appear to help me keep my color in good shape.</li>
            <li>I have fine, colored hair.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal and even comes with the pimps</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair silky smooth and feeling clean while still holding in the dye as promised.</li>
            <li>Never feels clean, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t wash out cleanly at all.</li>
            <li>Very light, clean scent (I can&#x27;t stand those that are over-perfumed) and it keeps my hair moist, shiny, and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>I love the Paul Mitchell hair care line, but I am not entirely convinced that this is actually true Paul Mitchell product!  </li>
            <li>I tried washing my hair with it twice, thinking the first time might have been a fluke.</li>
            <li>I love it; it is half the price with more product, besides this should last me a lot longer**save money!</li>
            <li>Was happy with price and product!&lt;br /&gt;However after a few weeks conditioner left residue and felt waxy on hair...???</li>
            <li>- it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I feel like i have to put a handful to make it lather and clean my hair properly.</li>
            <li>It takes three times the normal amount of shampoo to get it into a lather.  </li>
            <li>I have used Paul Mitchell in the past bought from a hair salon and was satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I have difficulty finding it where I live, so finding these extra large bottles was a big plus.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo was ok but the conditioner not good.</li>
            <li>It left my hair greasy, waxy and frizzy, completely unmanageable...</li>
            <li>The shampoo works fine, but the conditioner leaves my hair feeling dull and gross.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The shampoo works fine, but the conditioner leaves my hair feeling dull and gross.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so dry and brittle basically to the point of being unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a high quality salon product like I know</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really Paul Mitchell Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> In my case, my highlights continue to shine for longer than with any other products I have used, hence I can go longer in between color applications, which saves time and money.</li>
            <li> Love them, but they didn&#x27;t bother to tape the tops shut before shipping and conditioner was EVERYWHERE.  :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy salon products from any other place than a salon!</li>
            <li> However, I did find a way to purchase the little pumps online, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pick up the bottle everytime.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other product but Paul Mitchell Color Protect!!!</li>
            <li> Too bad I&#x27;m stuck with a whole lot of it.</li>
            <li> Although these products are relatively expensive - the only reason I gave it four stars</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo and conditioner in the past I like Paul Mitchell products.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This product i ordered was terrible made my hair like straw (very dry)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is fake or just a bad product</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awkward in lathering and I have to use a ton of shampoo to even get it to lather evenly.</li>
            <li> Now, im using p. mitchel shampoo with leftovers of keratin conditioner, thats how bad is p. mitchel one. :(</li>
            <li> i will never buy salon  products online again a bought lesson :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Salon purchased or not this shampoo is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> This product is awful!  </li>
            <li> And the conditioner leaves my hair feeling awful.  </li>
            <li> but it makes your hair feel terrible.</li>

            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS COUNTERFEIT! DO NOT BUY!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Paul Mitchell in the past bought from a hair salon and was satisfied with them. This product i ordered was terrible made my hair like straw (very dry)  i will never buy salon  products online again a bought lesson :(</li>
            <li> Not happy with this shampoo.  I have a feeling it&#x27;s not really Paul Mitchell Shampoo.  It does not lather up at all. I feel like i have to put a handful to make it lather and clean my hair properly.</li>
            <li> Very easy to have this arrive at my door rather than making a special trip to pick it up.  Very pleased</li>
            <li> Was happy with price and product!&lt;br /&gt;However after a few weeks conditioner left residue and felt waxy on hair...???</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine. No gunky feeling at all. I can see the change in my hair color when I haven&#x27;t used it--it does really appear to help me keep my color in good shape.</li>
            <li> I like Paul Mitchell and like that I could get both of them for a good price I like it a lot</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite go to shampoo &amp; conditioners for color protect!  I will definitely order again.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle!  Very light, clean scent (I can&#x27;t stand those that are over-perfumed) and it keeps my hair moist, shiny, and very manageable.  I will never use any other product but Paul Mitchell Color Protect!!!</li>
            <li> Although these products are relatively expensive - the only reason I gave it four stars - it works very well.  In my case, my highlights continue to shine for longer than with any other products I have used, hence I can go longer in between color applications, which saves time and money.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo and conditioner duo cuz I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell before and really liked it. I wasn&#x27;t to keen about this one. You&#x27;ll need to use a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the Paul Mitchell hair care line, but I am not entirely convinced that this is actually true Paul Mitchell product!  However, I did find a way to purchase the little pumps online, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pick up the bottle everytime.</li>
            <li> Good buy for the money. I re-order over and over from time to time.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  I have difficulty finding it where I live, so finding these extra large bottles was a big plus.  Cleans well, no build up, and of course, the best part is that it protects my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Salon purchased or not this shampoo is AWFUL. It leaves a wax build up in my hair. Never feels clean, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t wash out cleanly at all. I have fine, colored hair. This shampoo is awkward in lathering and I have to use a ton of shampoo to even get it to lather evenly. I will have to use Neutrogena Shampoo Anti Residue formula to get this waxy build up out! Save your money!</li>
            <li> Does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product is awful!  It takes three times the normal amount of shampoo to get it into a lather.  And the conditioner leaves my hair feeling awful.  I end up having to use an additional leave in conditioner just to be able to comb through it.  I will probably end up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy salon products from any other place than a salon! Everything appeared legitimate but it made my hair gummy and unmanageable. Definitely not a high quality salon product like I know Paul Mitchell products to be! Now I will spend months trying to repair the damage that has been done to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it; it is half the price with more product, besides this should last me a lot longer**save money!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but for this I will...DO NOT BUY THIS. I don&#x27;t know if this is fake or just a bad product but it makes your hair feel terrible. I tried washing my hair with it twice, thinking the first time might have been a fluke. It left my hair greasy, waxy and frizzy, completely unmanageable...all I wanted to do was leave work and wash my hair immediately. I would not reccomend buying this off here, maybe from a salon instead.</li>
            <li> Love them, but they didn&#x27;t bother to tape the tops shut before shipping and conditioner was EVERYWHERE.  :(</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo and conditioner in the past I like Paul Mitchell products. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The best for highlighted hair. It does not damage your hair nor wash out the color. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this product. It made my hair so dry and brittle basically to the point of being unmanageable. I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Really a great product  Leaves hair soft and managable.  Would recommend this product for people who color their hair. Really a great experience</li>
            <li> Seems to be a knock off -- does not work as well as the last time I used Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keeps your hair silky smooth and feeling clean while still holding in the dye as promised.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal and even comes with the pimps</li>
            <li> Shampoo was ok but the conditioner not good. Kerotin conditioner much better, easy to brush through. I bought it just to change it up cause i was using keroyin shampoo and conditioner. Now, im using p. mitchel shampoo with leftovers of keratin conditioner, thats how bad is p. mitchel one. :(</li>
            <li> It works it doesn&#x27;t strip the color and I like it</li>
            <li> Great Value.  Product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works fine, but the conditioner leaves my hair feeling dull and gross. Too bad I&#x27;m stuck with a whole lot of it.</li>
