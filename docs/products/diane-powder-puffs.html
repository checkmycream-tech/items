            <li>Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and so glad I found them here!</li>
            <li>I love Amazon!  </li>
            <li>It is a good price but would have cost me more to return it than keep it.</li>
            <li>nice product.</li>
            <li>I used this puff as a replacement for the one that broke that came with the rose powder I bought.</li>
            <li>This one is plush and fits nicely in the smallish container I bought it for.</li>
            <li>It felt nice to put it in my powder box</li>
            <li>They feel  nice</li>
            <li>This is a nice puff.</li>
            <li>Nice powder puff to puff your unmentionable areas.</li>
            <li>I wanted to apply powder without having to dump the whole container out and this puff works perfect for that use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for what I needed- very cute and soft.</li>
            <li>This puff is a perfect size and very soft too.</li>
            <li>it is smooth and makes a good dress up item.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly into an old butter tub</li>
            <li>It feels great on the skin, can be washed and air dry, holds a great amount of powder..</li>
            <li>I would call this powder puff more like a medium size.</li>
            <li>size said 5.5 inches, more like 4-4.5 inches.</li>
            <li>babies will love it.</li>
            <li>it needs more flexibility</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s feel and even better</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Need to order some more.</li>
            <li>Be sure to measure your powder container before ordering, so you get the correct size puff.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a powder puff to fit a nice jar I had found.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;ll work okay in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>Barely better than some folded tissues.  </li>
            <li>This will work, There is a liffle bow on the top to hold while using the puff</li>
            <li>so I end up squishing the top of powder puff</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>and I love this puff.</li>
            <li>I love this powder puff.</li>
            <li>I guess I need to read details better.</li>
            <li>So OK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but have found better</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Most sales persons knew what we were looking for but all said they did not have them nor knew where to find them.  </li>
            <li>My mom was delighted when it arrived because its exactly what she was looking for.  </li>
            <li>they can more easily and quickly&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
            <li>the size was perfect and they were pink.</li>
            <li>Nice, but maybe worth like $2?</li>
            <li>It works great and is pink and it was a great price and is just the right size.</li>
            <li>right size really liked</li>
            <li>It picked up a lot of powder and distributed it easily.</li>
            <li>It distributes a lot of powder easily.  </li>
            <li>great to find pretty much everything I&#x27;m looking for on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fine them anywhere in the stores</li>
            <li>this is a perfect size little puff.</li>
            <li>I want a huge powder puff used for dusting powder on one&#x27;s body.  </li>
            <li>the repr√©sentation of item was accurate.</li>
            <li>This works great for the setting powder I use with the white make up.</li>
            <li>Its the size that would fit your perfumed powder.</li>
            <li>I could have sworn when I ordered this product that it was the LARGEST one available, as I wanted a puff to use for body powder application.</li>
            <li>Just fit in my powder box.</li>
            <li>in the meantime, i will enjoy this one.  </li>
            <li>great for big powder jobs</li>
            <li>this is so mught from the container and gettting it every wherech better than using the powder right out of the container and getting it every where,And it is also pretty,another plus</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this cute pink powder puff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice powder puff; not easy to rave about, but serves the purpose and is very nice.</li>
            <li>The size is good  for covering larger areas and it decorates my vanity.  </li>
            <li>This product is perfect if you want something large and fluffy.</li>
            <li>I looked at a tape measure of 3.5 &amp;#34; before I ordered and it seemed like an adequate sized for my purpose</li>
            <li>AFTER TRYING ALL THE OBVIOUS PLACES LIKE TARGET AND SIMILAR STORES, I WAS VERY HAPPY TO FIND IT HERE.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly from the seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x60;m enjoying mine and would purchase more, in the future!</li>
            <li>but it sure beats using a hand or dry washcloth, very nice to finally put on powder the right way!!</li>
            <li>works well though and is very pretty</li>
            <li>I bought it to go inside a beautiful cut glass lidded powder bowl that I picked up for just a few dollars at a flea market.</li>
            <li>This powder puff is EXACTLY what my mother had 50 years ago!  </li>
            <li>I should have checked Amazon first!</li>
            <li>Powder puff was exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>Great little powder puff.</li>
            <li>If it would be 3 times the size it may be worth the price.</li>
            <li>I make my own body powder with arrowroot powder, baking soda, and essential oils for scent, and I use this puff to apply.  </li>
            <li>Lovely and soft.</li>
            <li>and I thought it looked like it would be worth it</li>
            <li>Nice but smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li>Would have liked a larger unit.</li>
            <li>I like to package my essential oil talcs with a nice container and a puff.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked a handle, but other than that, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I would like to say it took me a long time to find a crystal (to match my vanity pieces) container to use it with until I accidentally found a round crystal jewelry box, which was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for my powder.</li>
            <li>Just what she wanted, at the right price, and arrived right away.</li>
            <li>I found a beautiful wooden powder box at the local thrift store.  </li>
            <li>The puff was a perfect fit, and adds to the bowl by giving it a slight pink glow.</li>
            <li>I rate this as a 5 since it was very inexpensive, but great quality, and of course it&#x27;s pink!!  </li>
            <li>Wish I could find bigger ones, but these are soft, and more absorbent; powder stays on puff and more goes onto skin, instead of floating in the air.</li>
            <li>Love this cute little puff.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Funny how such a little thing can make someone so happy!</li>
            <li>Thanks much! !</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>so I pinch the pretty bow</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>the puffs are ok they just needed to be bigger  was suprised by the size</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>I was so glad to finally find this item.</li>
            <li>Pretty and functional.</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase and would consider again for future purchases.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>I will probably order several more</li>
            <li>The size is just what works for me best as little ones allow makeup and powder to go under my long nails - can&#x27;t have that and now won&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>Exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have seen bigger, puffier puffs elsewhere for super cheap, like $2.  </li>
            <li>This puff is large enough for body talc (and very pretty to boot!!)</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly in the neck of a large Kingsford cornstartch container and has a pretty little pink ribbon handle.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these, one for each bathroom, and while they are on the small side as others have mentioned, they&#x27;re better than the cheap ones that come with some bath powders.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to buy large powder puff.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t large as I thought, and doesn&#x27;t have the texture I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find good quality and nice size Puffs that are not super expensive!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and from all the reviews I read on several puffs, this one seems to be the biggest, fluffiest one out there, and it came in the mail quickly!</li>
            <li>The little bow makes a nice handle.  </li>
            <li>This puff is a little smaller than the norm but a great size for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Will spend a little more money next time on a better product.</li>
            <li>cute and pink and well made.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about this.</li>
            <li>Really, how can you rate something like a powder puff?  </li>
            <li>Thanks much.</li>
            <li>most of my ties are pink and all...</li>
            <li>She was just wanting a powder puff without having to buy a whole powder set.  </li>
            <li>Difficult to find one in the local store so happy to be able to buy it on &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a replacement one and never could so thanks to you</li>
            <li>The fabric doesn&#x27;t really lend itself to holding the powder and then releasing it onto the body.  </li>
            <li>They are inexpensive, and they have reasonable shipping rates.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The old timey powder puffs seemed to be better quality and bigger.  </li>
            <li>I use powder because I live I in hot, humid Florida.</li>
            <li>It was a nice powder puff but way too small for what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Pretty soft but too pricy</li>
            <li>She uses it to apply body powder and it really helps her to apply the powder exactly where she wants without making a huge mess or having a ton of powder stuck to her</li>
            <li>It is so soft and does exactly what I bought it for</li>
            <li>I love these puffs and will buy extra now that I see their potential.  </li>
            <li>This one is nice and big an pink and puffy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>This is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The description of \\&quot;Diane Large Powder Puff\\&quot; is completely misleading.  </li>
            <li>- wish that bow was just a tad bigger  or something that could lift the puff without much effort, but I will make it work!!</li>
            <li>it is hard to hold in your hand while powdering yourself but it is nice looking and works.</li>
            <li>soft and very well made</li>
            <li>I will purchase a few more as needed.</li>
            <li>If you are just using on babies or folds, underarms, under the breasts, creases, groin area and other places that accumulate sweat you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I use it for applying baby powder, so it is big enough to hold a lot of powder and with the bow on it you can handle the puffer easily.</li>
            <li>After looking everywhere including drugstores, dollar stores and large discount stores, this was the only place I could find a large size</li>
            <li>Actually, it would be nice if it were a little softer;but</li>
            <li>Very soft and reliable.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the old large powder puff I used to have when I was younger, thanks to my grandmother, for body dusting to help with sweating.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for the face,  though it is a little tedious if using it for a whole body project.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s So soft!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted: I simple powder puff.</li>
            <li>It has a bow on one side for easy handling and it is very soft and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>I am the caretaker for a 93 yr old lady that wanted a new powder puff.</li>
            <li>I have a few bath powder puffs like this that go easily in the wash when needed.</li>
            <li>Hard to find in the stores glad I could get them.</li>
            <li>Even though the product was disappointing it would not stop me from making a better product choice and buying from this seller again as they did have a huge selection of choices.</li>
            <li>It is really soft.</li>
            <li>It is so soft against my body.  </li>
            <li>I had looked off and on for years for an old fashioned body powder  puff.  </li>
            <li>Picks up enough body  powder, not too much, and holds it to be applied</li>
            <li>My old ones can go to the trashcan in the sky now.  </li>
            <li>This one was the right dimensions and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li>Very, very small, and it cost more to ship this also than it was to purchase it</li>
            <li>Soft, pink, exact size they said.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>First I&#x27;d like to say I received a Diane 3.5&amp;#34; pink puff, just as ordered.  </li>
            <li>Pretty pink puff.  </li>
            <li>I bought several of these, they&#x27;re fluffy and hold the right amount of powder without getting too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a round piece of foam rubber covered with cheap low nap material.</li>
            <li>These puffs, though not as thick as you would remember them to be work fine.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about this because of negative reviews, but thought it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, pretty, and shows little signs of wear after having used it quite a while on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fluffy, and it&#x27;s just the right size.  </li>
            <li>This is not as fluffy, or quite as large as the old fashioned ones, but does the job, and is big enough.  </li>
            <li>Guess powder puffs are a thing from the past but this puff was just the right size for my mom.</li>
            <li>This is a huge powder puff with a small pink bow in the handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d hoped for a large fluffy puff that would hold enough powder to use as a body powder puff</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This a great powder puff.  </li>
            <li> Great</li>
            <li> great &#x3D; use with baby powder.</li>
            <li> The price is great.</li>

            <li> I  made, works great.</li>
            <li> price was great</li>
            <li> They are great</li>
            <li> This arrived and I immediately put it to good use, after my shower.</li>
            <li> Really good at collecting and distributing powder.</li>
            <li> but she loved it.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good price, too.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t seem to get a good grip on it</li>
            <li> I loved it to powder myself.</li>
            <li> The service was excellent and quick and as always amazon is the&amp;#34; best.&amp;#34; Thank you for always being number 1...</li>
            <li> but its really nice, great quality and AMAZING... as amazing as a powder puff can be anyway</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and so glad I found them here!</li>
            <li> I love Amazon!  </li>
            <li> It is a good price but would have cost me more to return it than keep it.</li>
            <li> nice product.</li>
            <li> I used this puff as a replacement for the one that broke that came with the rose powder I bought.</li>
            <li> This one is plush and fits nicely in the smallish container I bought it for.</li>
            <li> It felt nice to put it in my powder box</li>
            <li> They feel  nice</li>
            <li> This is a nice puff.</li>
            <li> Nice powder puff to puff your unmentionable areas.</li>
            <li> I wanted to apply powder without having to dump the whole container out and this puff works perfect for that use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for what I needed- very cute and soft.</li>
            <li> This puff is a perfect size and very soft too.</li>
            <li> it is smooth and makes a good dress up item.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly into an old butter tub</li>
            <li> It feels great on the skin, can be washed and air dry, holds a great amount of powder..</li>
            <li> I would call this powder puff more like a medium size.</li>
            <li> size said 5.5 inches, more like 4-4.5 inches.</li>
            <li> babies will love it.</li>
            <li> it needs more flexibility</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s feel and even better</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Need to order some more.</li>
            <li> Be sure to measure your powder container before ordering, so you get the correct size puff.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a powder puff to fit a nice jar I had found.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;ll work okay in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> Barely better than some folded tissues.  </li>
            <li> This will work, There is a liffle bow on the top to hold while using the puff</li>
            <li> so I end up squishing the top of powder puff</li>
            <li> Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Thank you :)</li>
            <li> and I love this puff.</li>
            <li> I love this powder puff.</li>
            <li> I guess I need to read details better.</li>
            <li> So OK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but have found better</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> Most sales persons knew what we were looking for but all said they did not have them nor knew where to find them.  </li>
            <li> My mom was delighted when it arrived because its exactly what she was looking for.  </li>
            <li> they can more easily and quickly&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
            <li> the size was perfect and they were pink.</li>
            <li> Nice, but maybe worth like $2?</li>
            <li> It works great and is pink and it was a great price and is just the right size.</li>
            <li> right size really liked</li>
            <li> It picked up a lot of powder and distributed it easily.</li>
            <li> It distributes a lot of powder easily.  </li>
            <li> great to find pretty much everything I&#x27;m looking for on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t fine them anywhere in the stores</li>
            <li> this is a perfect size little puff.</li>
            <li> I want a huge powder puff used for dusting powder on one&#x27;s body.  </li>
            <li> the repr√©sentation of item was accurate.</li>
            <li> This works great for the setting powder I use with the white make up.</li>
            <li> Its the size that would fit your perfumed powder.</li>
            <li> I could have sworn when I ordered this product that it was the LARGEST one available, as I wanted a puff to use for body powder application.</li>
            <li> Just fit in my powder box.</li>
            <li> in the meantime, i will enjoy this one.  </li>
            <li> great for big powder jobs</li>
            <li> this is so mught from the container and gettting it every wherech better than using the powder right out of the container and getting it every where,And it is also pretty,another plus</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this cute pink powder puff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice powder puff; not easy to rave about, but serves the purpose and is very nice.</li>
            <li> The size is good  for covering larger areas and it decorates my vanity.  </li>
            <li> This product is perfect if you want something large and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I looked at a tape measure of 3.5 &amp;#34; before I ordered and it seemed like an adequate sized for my purpose</li>
            <li> AFTER TRYING ALL THE OBVIOUS PLACES LIKE TARGET AND SIMILAR STORES, I WAS VERY HAPPY TO FIND IT HERE.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly from the seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m enjoying mine and would purchase more, in the future!</li>
            <li> but it sure beats using a hand or dry washcloth, very nice to finally put on powder the right way!!</li>
            <li> works well though and is very pretty</li>
            <li> I bought it to go inside a beautiful cut glass lidded powder bowl that I picked up for just a few dollars at a flea market.</li>
            <li> This powder puff is EXACTLY what my mother had 50 years ago!  </li>
            <li> I should have checked Amazon first!</li>
            <li> Powder puff was exactly as described!  </li>
            <li> Great little powder puff.</li>
            <li> If it would be 3 times the size it may be worth the price.</li>
            <li> I make my own body powder with arrowroot powder, baking soda, and essential oils for scent, and I use this puff to apply.  </li>
            <li> Lovely and soft.</li>
            <li> and I thought it looked like it would be worth it</li>
            <li> Nice but smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> Would have liked a larger unit.</li>
            <li> I like to package my essential oil talcs with a nice container and a puff.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked a handle, but other than that, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I would like to say it took me a long time to find a crystal (to match my vanity pieces) container to use it with until I accidentally found a round crystal jewelry box, which was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for my powder.</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted, at the right price, and arrived right away.</li>
            <li> I found a beautiful wooden powder box at the local thrift store.  </li>
            <li> The puff was a perfect fit, and adds to the bowl by giving it a slight pink glow.</li>
            <li> I rate this as a 5 since it was very inexpensive, but great quality, and of course it&#x27;s pink!!  </li>
            <li> Wish I could find bigger ones, but these are soft, and more absorbent; powder stays on puff and more goes onto skin, instead of floating in the air.</li>
            <li> Love this cute little puff.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Funny how such a little thing can make someone so happy!</li>
            <li> Thanks much! !</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> so I pinch the pretty bow</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> the puffs are ok they just needed to be bigger  was suprised by the size</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> I was so glad to finally find this item.</li>
            <li> Pretty and functional.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase and would consider again for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> I will probably order several more</li>
            <li> The size is just what works for me best as little ones allow makeup and powder to go under my long nails - can&#x27;t have that and now won&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have seen bigger, puffier puffs elsewhere for super cheap, like $2.  </li>
            <li> This puff is large enough for body talc (and very pretty to boot!!)</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly in the neck of a large Kingsford cornstartch container and has a pretty little pink ribbon handle.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these, one for each bathroom, and while they are on the small side as others have mentioned, they&#x27;re better than the cheap ones that come with some bath powders.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to buy large powder puff.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t large as I thought, and doesn&#x27;t have the texture I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find good quality and nice size Puffs that are not super expensive!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and from all the reviews I read on several puffs, this one seems to be the biggest, fluffiest one out there, and it came in the mail quickly!</li>
            <li> The little bow makes a nice handle.  </li>
            <li> This puff is a little smaller than the norm but a great size for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Will spend a little more money next time on a better product.</li>
            <li> cute and pink and well made.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about this.</li>
            <li> Really, how can you rate something like a powder puff?  </li>
            <li> Thanks much.</li>
            <li> most of my ties are pink and all...</li>
            <li> She was just wanting a powder puff without having to buy a whole powder set.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to find one in the local store so happy to be able to buy it on &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a replacement one and never could so thanks to you</li>
            <li> The fabric doesn&#x27;t really lend itself to holding the powder and then releasing it onto the body.  </li>
            <li> They are inexpensive, and they have reasonable shipping rates.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The old timey powder puffs seemed to be better quality and bigger.  </li>
            <li> I use powder because I live I in hot, humid Florida.</li>
            <li> It was a nice powder puff but way too small for what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Pretty soft but too pricy</li>
            <li> She uses it to apply body powder and it really helps her to apply the powder exactly where she wants without making a huge mess or having a ton of powder stuck to her</li>
            <li> It is so soft and does exactly what I bought it for</li>
            <li> I love these puffs and will buy extra now that I see their potential.  </li>
            <li> This one is nice and big an pink and puffy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> This is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The description of \\&quot;Diane Large Powder Puff\\&quot; is completely misleading.  </li>
            <li> - wish that bow was just a tad bigger  or something that could lift the puff without much effort, but I will make it work!!</li>
            <li> it is hard to hold in your hand while powdering yourself but it is nice looking and works.</li>
            <li> soft and very well made</li>
            <li> I will purchase a few more as needed.</li>
            <li> If you are just using on babies or folds, underarms, under the breasts, creases, groin area and other places that accumulate sweat you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I use it for applying baby powder, so it is big enough to hold a lot of powder and with the bow on it you can handle the puffer easily.</li>
            <li> After looking everywhere including drugstores, dollar stores and large discount stores, this was the only place I could find a large size</li>
            <li> Actually, it would be nice if it were a little softer;but</li>
            <li> Very soft and reliable.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the old large powder puff I used to have when I was younger, thanks to my grandmother, for body dusting to help with sweating.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for the face,  though it is a little tedious if using it for a whole body project.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So soft!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted: I simple powder puff.</li>
            <li> It has a bow on one side for easy handling and it is very soft and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> I am the caretaker for a 93 yr old lady that wanted a new powder puff.</li>
            <li> I have a few bath powder puffs like this that go easily in the wash when needed.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores glad I could get them.</li>
            <li> Even though the product was disappointing it would not stop me from making a better product choice and buying from this seller again as they did have a huge selection of choices.</li>
            <li> It is really soft.</li>
            <li> It is so soft against my body.  </li>
            <li> I had looked off and on for years for an old fashioned body powder  puff.  </li>
            <li> Picks up enough body  powder, not too much, and holds it to be applied</li>
            <li> My old ones can go to the trashcan in the sky now.  </li>
            <li> This one was the right dimensions and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Very, very small, and it cost more to ship this also than it was to purchase it</li>
            <li> Soft, pink, exact size they said.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> First I&#x27;d like to say I received a Diane 3.5&amp;#34; pink puff, just as ordered.  </li>
            <li> Pretty pink puff.  </li>
            <li> I bought several of these, they&#x27;re fluffy and hold the right amount of powder without getting too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a round piece of foam rubber covered with cheap low nap material.</li>
            <li> These puffs, though not as thick as you would remember them to be work fine.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about this because of negative reviews, but thought it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, pretty, and shows little signs of wear after having used it quite a while on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fluffy, and it&#x27;s just the right size.  </li>
            <li> This is not as fluffy, or quite as large as the old fashioned ones, but does the job, and is big enough.  </li>
            <li> Guess powder puffs are a thing from the past but this puff was just the right size for my mom.</li>
            <li> This is a huge powder puff with a small pink bow in the handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped for a large fluffy puff that would hold enough powder to use as a body powder puff</li>
            <li> I have it in a round container half full of baby powder.  </li>
            <li> It was a little small but works fine for what I needed.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what they promised, a Big fluffy pink powder puff.  </li>
            <li> It is only 3.5 inches wide and is not pink.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have normally bought a small inexpensive item online, due to the resources used to mail it, but strangely enough, I couldn&#x27;t find one locally.</li>
            <li> It is white even though the bag it came in says pink.  </li>
            <li> Barely big enough for facial application and definately NOT worth the money I spent to purchase and ship.</li>
            <li> A pink powder puff, about 3.5 inches in diameter, furry enough to deliver lots of powder to the spots needed.  </li>
            <li> package said PINK, it was white.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I use talcum powder to dry my genital area...</li>
            <li> Already washed one and it fluffed up when dry.  </li>
            <li> this is the only, big and fluffy one...</li>
            <li> Our Daughter wanted a Puff like this, so as usual, we dialed up the old Amazon, and what do you know,</li>
            <li> ; Powder Puff  Works well for the Gold Bond Ultimate Comfort Body Powder rather than by hand and making a mess of it.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something a little larger and fluffier.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is that there&#x27;s no handle- just a little bow to grab on to.</li>
            <li> It is so small you can barely hold it, no wonder they have a ribbon on it to hold on to.</li>
            <li> I am tickled pink with my pink puff.  </li>
            <li> I have no problem with the color pink...</li>
            <li> Not really much to say.</li>
            <li> I wanted a really big, fluffy body puff.  </li>
            <li> The seller seems to have gotten things sorted, because I got what I ordered - a big, fluffy, pink powder puff that is about 3.5 inches wide.</li>
            <li> but it was not the plush puff I expected.</li>
            <li> The item was as expected and is sufficient for applying body powder.</li>
            <li> Moreover functioned exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Spent days looking for these puffs in my area stores.  </li>
            <li> The puff is really thick and soft.  </li>
            <li> the only problem i have with this puff is that it is too stiff.</li>
            <li> but seriously... you guys could make it blue or white...</li>
            <li> It does work well but is not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> but it turned out to be too small with no strap on the back to hold onto while applying powder.  </li>
            <li> but this is too extreme.</li>
            <li> Too small I wanted something bigger did not realize I wanted a size 5 instead of this one which was a 3</li>
            <li> Not only was it supper small</li>
            <li> I bought one for a smiliar price at a Albertsons&#x27;s in my area before they closed down.</li>
            <li> Not large at all and certainly not worth $10.00.</li>
            <li> the package says it is a big one but not true!!</li>
            <li> charging 3x for shipping in a single envelope was disappointing but the product is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It is about half the size of it since that one was 6&amp;#34; and this one is 3.5&amp;#34; (half would be 3&amp;#34; which is why I said about) but it picks up and distributes powder just as well.</li>
            <li> you use less powder...</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve paid less than .99 for them at the discount stores.</li>
            <li> It has about 1-inch of fluffy down.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had one of these since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use a round, plastic food container for this.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fluffy...  </li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s pink.  </li>
            <li> I can still use my powder everyday.</li>
            <li> The fluffy part stays fluffy and doesn&#x27;t clump up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fluffy and just like the one my grandma used in her powder box.</li>
            <li> It feels like soft fake fur.</li>
            <li> Much less powder ends up on the floor now!</li>
            <li> just wish it wasn&#x27;t so stiff.</li>
            <li> The ribbon is not easy to grasp.</li>
            <li> A little bit small--</li>
            <li> I does have a small satin bow to hold onto instead of a strap.  </li>
            <li> The ones in the stores were so small</li>
            <li> It is no better than the ones you get in the box with a dusting powder....</li>
            <li> no more plush .</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit small</li>
            <li> too small in diamater</li>
            <li> When I got it was small</li>
            <li> This is too small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problems were in the past - reviews from 2 years ago state problems with the color and size.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize 3.5 inches was so small</li>
            <li> A tad too small</li>
            <li> I think and hard to get ahold of.</li>
            <li> not very fluffy....fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> Saw a few reviews that this was the wrong size, color, whatever.</li>
            <li> this seems to be a very hard product to find at all</li>
            <li> I have ordered the cashmere bouquet powder before and have used the product for 25 years plus and it has become a very hard item to find.</li>
            <li> who knew it was so hard to find powder puffs these days!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find powder puffs in a drugstore anymore.</li>
            <li> but I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> I like to use dusting powder but finding a puff has become difficult.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find powder puffs in the drug stores, so I bought them for me and some for my mother.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> This is the worst I have been ripped off in years.</li>
            <li> I am rejoining your customer base!</li>
            <li> This is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This works great for the setting powder I use with the white make up. It picked up a lot of powder and distributed it easily. It reminds me of the old large powder puff I used to have when I was younger, thanks to my grandmother, for body dusting to help with sweating. It is about half the size of it since that one was 6&amp;#34; and this one is 3.5&amp;#34; (half would be 3&amp;#34; which is why I said about) but it picks up and distributes powder just as well. This is perfect for the face,  though it is a little tedious if using it for a whole body project. If you are just using on babies or folds, underarms, under the breasts, creases, groin area and other places that accumulate sweat you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  I looked at a tape measure of 3.5 &amp;#34; before I ordered and it seemed like an adequate sized for my purpose but it turned out to be too small with no strap on the back to hold onto while applying powder.  I does have a small satin bow to hold onto instead of a strap.  It is a good price but would have cost me more to return it than keep it.</li>
            <li> who knew it was so hard to find powder puffs these days!!  anyway, this isn&#x27;t the fluffiest I&#x27;ve ever had but it sure beats using a hand or dry washcloth, very nice to finally put on powder the right way!! and from all the reviews I read on several puffs, this one seems to be the biggest, fluffiest one out there, and it came in the mail quickly!</li>
            <li> Looks like a powder puff, feels like a powder puff, must be a powder puff. It does powder puff type things. Works great as a powder puff.</li>
            <li> Great little powder puff.</li>
            <li> It was a nice powder puff but way too small for what I wanted.  I returned it with no difficulties. I would call this powder puff more like a medium size.</li>
            <li> I just got this.  It is only 3.5 inches wide and is not pink.  It is white even though the bag it came in says pink.  I&#x27;m returning and I never do that.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the worst I have been ripped off in years. This puff may be big enough for a doll. It is so small you can barely hold it, no wonder they have a ribbon on it to hold on to. Don&#x27;t waste your money. If it would be 3 times the size it may be worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect if you want something large and fluffy. Its the size that would fit your perfumed powder. It has about 1-inch of fluffy down. It is really soft. It has a bow you can use to hold and while using.</li>
            <li> I could have sworn when I ordered this product that it was the LARGEST one available, as I wanted a puff to use for body powder application. It&#x27;s TINY. Barely big enough for facial application and definately NOT worth the money I spent to purchase and ship. I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I ordered.  A pink powder puff, about 3.5 inches in diameter, furry enough to deliver lots of powder to the spots needed.  I have it in a round container half full of baby powder.  Works great, met my expectations perfectly, thank you.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, thank you  Mary !!!!!!!!! The ones in the stores were so small I didn&#x27;t like those</li>
            <li> replaces the smaller one from the dusting powder container.  easier to hold onto and works wonderfully with the lavender scented powder.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t fine them anywhere in the stores so I went to Amazon. These Powder Puffs do the job but they are smaller then I would like and they have no handle so I pinch the pretty bow and it slips from my fingers and falls to the floor. Powder all over the rug. I wont buy these again.</li>
            <li> I thought the description said 5 inch diameter when I ordered.  It does not say it now.  What I got is 3 to 3.5 inches.  It does work well but is not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The description of \\&quot;Diane Large Powder Puff\\&quot; is completely misleading.  Not large at all and certainly not worth $10.00.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  The little bow makes a nice handle.  I found a beautiful wooden powder box at the local thrift store.  I put the powder from a shake container into the wooden box and use the Powder Puff to apply it.  The puff is really thick and soft.  It distributes a lot of powder easily.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> hi. this is a perfect size little puff. Just fit in my powder box. cute and pink and well made.</li>
            <li> This powder puff is EXACTLY what my mother had 50 years ago!  It works great!  I use powder because I live I in hot, humid Florida. This is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> What a bargain! My talc did not have a puff and its price led me to believe it was included. This is exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> package said PINK, it was white. size said 5.5 inches, more like 4-4.5 inches. did not get what was advertised.</li>
            <li> This arrived and I immediately put it to good use, after my shower. It&#x27;s So soft! A little bit small--</li>
            <li> Looked all over town for this size powder puff, but didn&#x27;t find one.  This product was what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Just the perfect size. It&#x27;s impossible to find powder puffs in the drug stores, so I bought them for me and some for my mother.</li>
            <li> not very fluffy....fairly expensive. did not meet my expectations. this seems to be a very hard product to find at all</li>
            <li> nice product. babies will love it. it is smooth and makes a good dress up item. I am happy with it</li>
            <li> the puffs are ok they just needed to be bigger  was suprised by the size but i like it and use it</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS A REPLACEMENT GIFT FOR AN ELDERLY RELATIVE. AFTER TRYING ALL THE OBVIOUS PLACES LIKE TARGET AND SIMILAR STORES, I WAS VERY HAPPY TO FIND IT HERE.</li>
            <li> This a great powder puff.  It&#x27;s fluffy, and it&#x27;s just the right size.  It&#x27;s very soft and gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> Works like it should.</li>
            <li> I used this puff as a replacement for the one that broke that came with the rose powder I bought. Really good at collecting and distributing powder.</li>
            <li> I have a few bath powder puffs like this that go easily in the wash when needed. I think this is the best and simplest way to apply scented bath powder.</li>
            <li> the only problem i have with this puff is that it is too stiff. it is hard to hold in your hand while powdering yourself but it is nice looking and works. just wish it wasn&#x27;t so stiff. it needs more flexibility</li>
            <li> Great---I use it every day! !  Thanks much! !</li>
            <li> I make my own body powder with arrowroot powder, baking soda, and essential oils for scent, and I use this puff to apply.  It&#x27;s very soft, pretty, and shows little signs of wear after having used it quite a while on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these, one for each bathroom, and while they are on the small side as others have mentioned, they&#x27;re better than the cheap ones that come with some bath powders. Wish I could find bigger ones, but these are soft, and more absorbent; powder stays on puff and more goes onto skin, instead of floating in the air.</li>
            <li> I am tickled pink with my pink puff.  It is so soft against my body.  I love it&#x27;s feel and even better how well it holds and spreads my powder.  It is even saving me money!</li>
            <li> I have ordered the cashmere bouquet powder before and have used the product for 25 years plus and it has become a very hard item to find. The service was excellent and quick and as always amazon is the&amp;#34; best.&amp;#34; Thank you for always being number 1... I am rejoining your customer base!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about this. Really, how can you rate something like a powder puff?  Actually, it would be nice if it were a little softer;but it serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> Diane 3.5&amp;#34; Powder Puff  Works well for the Gold Bond Ultimate Comfort Body Powder rather than by hand and making a mess of it.  Thanks much.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I use that with my anti-monkey butt powder.  It just makes applying the powder a lot easier.  Need to order some more.</li>
            <li> It is no better than the ones you get in the box with a dusting powder....no more plush .</li>
            <li> This puffer is the best size. I use it for applying baby powder, so it is big enough to hold a lot of powder and with the bow on it you can handle the puffer easily.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for the container I keep my powder in.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star rating was because I wish it had a band that went across it instead of the bow - the band would allow your fingers to slip under it to hold the puff easier.  The ribbon is not easy to grasp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find powder puffs in a drugstore anymore. This one is plush and fits nicely in the smallish container I bought it for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find good quality and nice size Puffs that are not super expensive!&lt;br /&gt;This does the trick! I just wish I could get it also in &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> This puff is small, but is exactly as described by seller---3.5&amp;#34;.  It has a bow on one side for easy handling and it is very soft and fluffy.  It fits in my homemade powder deodorant container perfectly.  I use a round, plastic food container for this.  Be sure to measure your powder container before ordering, so you get the correct size puff. I&#x27;m very pleased with this order!</li>
            <li> I am the caretaker for a 93 yr old lady that wanted a new powder puff. I checked all the stores in town and found no one sells them anymore! I should have checked Amazon first! She was so delighted! Funny how such a little thing can make someone so happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy.. I have no problem with the color pink... most of my ties are pink and all... but this is too extreme. I purchased this because I use talcum powder to dry my genital area... So I kinda needed a powder puff... this is the only, big and fluffy one... but seriously... you guys could make it blue or white... but its really nice, great quality and AMAZING... as amazing as a powder puff can be anyway</li>
            <li> I was looking for a powder puff to fit a nice jar I had found. This one was the right dimensions and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> great &#x3D; use with baby powder.</li>
            <li> Oh what can I say. I haven&#x27;t had one of these since I was a little girl. It felt nice to put it in my powder box</li>
            <li> It feels great on the skin, can be washed and air dry, holds a great amount of powder.. you use less powder...</li>
            <li> I ordered this puff for an elderly lady friend.  She was just wanting a powder puff without having to buy a whole powder set.  This was just what she wanted.  I thought it was a bit small but she loved it.</li>
            <li> I had looked off and on for years for an old fashioned body powder  puff.  This is not as fluffy, or quite as large as the old fashioned ones, but does the job, and is big enough.  Picks up enough body  powder, not too much, and holds it to be applied</li>
            <li> right size really liked</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores glad I could get them. They feel  nice and I can keep them on  hand.</li>
            <li> Not really much to say. It&#x27;s a powder puff.  It works, it&#x27;s pretty, it&#x27;s fluffy...  I have seen no signs of it falling apart.  I would repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> Lovely and soft. I&#x27;d like one in white, too!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  I am happy!</li>
            <li> I was worried about this because of negative reviews, but thought it&#x27;s cheap so I would order anyway.  This is exactly what they promised, a Big fluffy pink powder puff.  They shipped immediately and it&#x27;s excellent quality.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say about a powder puff? It applies my Goldbond powder, so, I guess it works as well as one could expect</li>
            <li> This puff is a little smaller than the norm but a great size for traveling.  The ribbon bow should be replaced with a strap for easier use.</li>
            <li> Pretty soft but too pricy</li>
            <li> It was what it said it was.It was what it said it was.It was what it said it was.It was what it said it was.</li>
            <li> too small in diamater</li>
            <li> This is not a big powder puff!! When I got it was small the package says it is a big one but not true!!</li>
            <li> I have been e mailing with this co. for 2 weeks I never recieved my powder puff  I have been told toget into contact USPS facilityl ne provided their number as well as the name of the manager there, so  they can more easily and quickly&lt;br /&gt;get to the bottom of this once we start the investigation process with them.&lt;br /&gt; when I ordered I did not know I was going trace my shipment!!!&lt;br /&gt;buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a really big, fluffy body puff.  I couldn&#x27;t find one so I settled for this.  At least it&#x27;s pink.  And it will work.</li>
            <li> I should have used my measuring tape.  I want a huge powder puff used for dusting powder on one&#x27;s body.  This is too small.  I kept for guests.</li>
            <li> soft and very well made</li>
            <li> This powder puff was a gift for my elderly mother.  Difficult to find one in the local store so happy to be able to buy it on &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;.  Guess powder puffs are a thing from the past but this puff was just the right size for my mom.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;d like to say I received a Diane 3.5&amp;#34; pink puff, just as ordered.  Second I would like to say it took me a long time to find a crystal (to match my vanity pieces) container to use it with until I accidentally found a round crystal jewelry box, which was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly into an old butter tub so I can fil it with whatever powder I choose.  Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This is terrible. Very, very small, and it cost more to ship this also than it was to purchase it and I thought it looked like it would be worth it but I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to finally find this item. I have been looking for a replacement one and never could so thanks to you I can still use my powder everyday.</li>
            <li> Too small I wanted something bigger did not realize I wanted a size 5 instead of this one which was a 3</li>
            <li> The fabric doesn&#x27;t really lend itself to holding the powder and then releasing it onto the body.  But, it&#x27;ll work okay in a pinch.  It took me the longest time to actually find a body powder puff, so it&#x27;ll have to suffice.</li>
            <li> Works well with baby powder.  Pretty and functional.</li>
            <li> Pretty pink puff.  Smaller than I imagined. Nice, but maybe worth like $2? I have seen bigger, puffier puffs elsewhere for super cheap, like $2.  I think I was a bit caught up with the PUFF shopping this time.</li>
            <li> Nice but smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted: I simple powder puff. It fits perfectly in the neck of a large Kingsford cornstartch container and has a pretty little pink ribbon handle. Very soft and reliable.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have normally bought a small inexpensive item online, due to the resources used to mail it, but strangely enough, I couldn&#x27;t find one locally. I bought two and had them shipped together, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase. They are inexpensive, and they have reasonable shipping rates. I&#x27;m not sure what the problems were in the past - reviews from 2 years ago state problems with the color and size. The seller seems to have gotten things sorted, because I got what I ordered - a big, fluffy, pink powder puff that is about 3.5 inches wide. Much less powder ends up on the floor now!</li>
            <li> Quality powder puff - just what I wanted.  I had one of lesser quality that fell apart.  This one is perfect  - I use with cornstarch - works great!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a little larger and fluffier.  The old timey powder puffs seemed to be better quality and bigger.  It will serve my needs.</li>
            <li> this is so mught from the container and gettting it every wherech better than using the powder right out of the container and getting it every where,And it is also pretty,another plus</li>
            <li> Received it quickly from the seller. Was very disappointed in the quality. I think I&#x27;ve paid less than .99 for them at the discount stores. Not only was it supper small but it was not the plush puff I expected. Will spend a little more money next time on a better product. Even though the product was disappointing it would not stop me from making a better product choice and buying from this seller again as they did have a huge selection of choices.</li>
            <li> This is a huge powder puff with a small pink bow in the handle. Only issue, finding a container for it.</li>
            <li> The item was as expected and is sufficient for applying body powder. Pleased with purchase and would consider again for future purchases.</li>
            <li> I like the powder puff.  It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve bought.  The fluffy part stays fluffy and doesn&#x27;t clump up.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for quite some time in stores trying to find this item and then I went on line and found just what I needed and is perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this cute pink powder puff! I bought it to go inside a beautiful cut glass lidded powder bowl that I picked up for just a few dollars at a flea market. The puff was a perfect fit, and adds to the bowl by giving it a slight pink glow. I use the puff every day after I towel off from my shower; it feels like such an indulgence!</li>
            <li> Bought this power puff for my perfumed talc and it works perfect . Good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a round piece of foam rubber covered with cheap low nap material. Barely better than some folded tissues.  I&#x27;d hoped for a large fluffy puff that would hold enough powder to use as a body powder puff</li>
            <li> Just the right size for my powder.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I would have liked a handle, but other than that, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This is a nice puff. Perfect to use with Dusting Powder. I&#x60;m enjoying mine and would purchase more, in the future!</li>
            <li> I like to use dusting powder but finding a puff has become difficult. I bought several of these, they&#x27;re fluffy and hold the right amount of powder without getting too much. I was delighted to find them! Good price, too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I use it for my dusting powder.  The size is good  for covering larger areas and it decorates my vanity.  I will recommend to my friends. The price is great. The package arrived in perfect condition and on time.</li>
            <li> Yes!! Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Have been searching for a body powder puff.  This will work, There is a liffle bow on the top to hold while using the puff but I can&#x27;t seem to get a good grip on it so I end up squishing the top of powder puff - wish that bow was just a tad bigger  or something that could lift the puff without much effort, but I will make it work!!</li>
            <li> I bought one for a smiliar price at a Albertsons&#x27;s in my area before they closed down. I loved it to powder myself.</li>
            <li> this powder puff is as listed, but my mother is looking for something larger to use as a body puff.  in the meantime, i will enjoy this one.  excellent quality and beautiful!</li>
            <li> This puff fits perfectly in my antique powder container. It&#x27;s fluffy and just like the one my grandma used in her powder box. Will be buying more. Thank you :) Oh, I&#x27;m under my husband&#x27;s account. Just to let you know I&#x27;m a girl and I love this puff.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to buy large powder puff.&lt;br /&gt;This wasn&#x27;t large as I thought, and doesn&#x27;t have the texture I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I love this powder puff. It&#x27;s perfect for what I needed- very cute and soft. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize 3.5 inches was so small lol. works well though and is very pretty I will probably order several more</li>
            <li> Love this cute little puff. Bought it for the homemade powder  I  made, works great.</li>
            <li> My old ones can go to the trashcan in the sky now.  I love these puffs and will buy extra now that I see their potential.  The size is just what works for me best as little ones allow makeup and powder to go under my long nails - can&#x27;t have that and now won&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> My mom was looking for a larger sized powder puff...like the ones they used to sell to apply body powder.  After looking everywhere including drugstores, dollar stores and large discount stores, this was the only place I could find a large size puff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was great so I ordered it.  My mom was delighted when it arrived because its exactly what she was looking for.  She uses it to apply body powder and it really helps her to apply the powder exactly where she wants without making a huge mess or having a ton of powder stuck to her hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will definitely be re-ordered when she needs another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its great to find pretty much everything I&#x27;m looking for on Amazon!</li>
            <li> charging 3x for shipping in a single envelope was disappointing but the product is exactly as advertised.  great for big powder jobs</li>
            <li> the repr√©sentation of item was accurate. Was used to apply my scented body powder. Moreover functioned exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> I rate this as a 5 since it was very inexpensive, but great quality, and of course it&#x27;s pink!!  This puff is a perfect size and very soft too.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and does exactly what I bought it for</li>
            <li> Powder puff was exactly as described!  Just can&#x27;t seem to find &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; powder puffs anywhere and so glad I found them here!</li>
            <li> Our Daughter wanted a Puff like this, so as usual, we dialed up the old Amazon, and what do you know, There it is. Just what she wanted, at the right price, and arrived right away. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I guess I need to read details better. it states the size in heading. But...I used it anyway. So OK.</li>
            <li> Remember having powder puffs as a child, they were always much bigger... this was flimsy and disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be ordering another one...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice powder puff; not easy to rave about, but serves the purpose and is very nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. A tad too small I think and hard to get ahold of.</li>
            <li> Saw a few reviews that this was the wrong size, color, whatever. Mine was just as described. Soft, pink, exact size they said. It feels like soft fake fur. My only issue is that there&#x27;s no handle- just a little bow to grab on to.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mom, who&#x27;d been looking for a replacement for her old pink powder puff. This one is nice and big an pink and puffy. Exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> Nice powder puff to puff your unmentionable areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but have found better but you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> They are great I love them the size was perfect and they were pink. I would recommend these to a friend.</li>
            <li> I guess that I did not think it through when I opted for the 3.5&amp;#34; item.  Would have liked a larger unit.</li>
            <li> I needed one to put on body powder and purchased this one. It works great and is pink and it was a great price and is just the right size. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Spent days looking for these puffs in my area stores.  Most sales persons knew what we were looking for but all said they did not have them nor knew where to find them.  I love Amazon!  Just decided to see if there were puffs and yes there were.  These puffs, though not as thick as you would remember them to be work fine.  Already washed one and it fluffed up when dry.  Would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I wanted to apply powder without having to dump the whole container out and this puff works perfect for that use.</li>
            <li> It was a little small but works fine for what I needed.  I will purchase a few more as needed.</li>
            <li> I chose a 5 star rating for the Diane Powder Puff because for the price this is a perfect addition to my Aromatherapy business.  I like to package my essential oil talcs with a nice container and a puff.  This puff is large enough for body talc (and very pretty to boot!!)</li>
