            <li>I just love this dead sea mud mask to detox and reduce pores.</li>
            <li>Our skin was a little pinkish and soft skin from the mud working its magic we put on moisturizer afterwards.</li>

            <li>Received this item last week and tried it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and my pores are tight.</li>
            <li>My 19 yr old has an autoimmune disorder called Addisons (&amp; another called Hashemotos thyroid--</li>
            <li>She is trying to stay with a naturopath and use all natural products.  </li>
            <li>My husband who is 51 years old, is a mechanic for a ranch and works out in the fields all day and comes home covered in dust and dirt.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cleansing mask that contained natural ingredients, help nourish the skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li>After using it my face turns soft.</li>
            <li>, my 23 year old son used as well.</li>
            <li>Went and washed it off in the shower and was pleasantly surprised when I looked at my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt much smoother and my pores did appear to be smaller.  </li>
            <li>WOW what a difference it made.</li>
            <li>My kids and I decided to give it a try the other night and had a lot of fun smearing it on our faces.  </li>
            <li>but it left her skin soft soft soft!</li>
            <li>In that my pores actually seemed a little smaller after using this product, I feel it will be helpful and appropriate for my aging, combination skin.</li>
            <li>i am really looking forward to using this weekly to see the long term results.</li>
            <li>Part of my new daily skin care regimen&#x27;!</li>
            <li>I let it dry for 15 mins and by that time I could really feel it working tighting my face.</li>
            <li>Within 10 mins they were dry ready to be removed which was</li>
            <li>it gets a little itchy after about 10 minutes- as it dries, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin soft and supple, as well as toned.  </li>
            <li>I used on myself and 21 yr old daughter last night.</li>
            <li>barely there.</li>
            <li>I did find it pulled out some things and had a few blemishes after using this, but they were minor and went away quickly.  </li>

            <li> Received this item last week and tried it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and my pores are tight.</li>
            <li> My 19 yr old has an autoimmune disorder called Addisons (&amp; another called Hashemotos thyroid--</li>
            <li> She is trying to stay with a naturopath and use all natural products.  </li>
            <li> My husband who is 51 years old, is a mechanic for a ranch and works out in the fields all day and comes home covered in dust and dirt.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cleansing mask that contained natural ingredients, help nourish the skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> After using it my face turns soft.</li>
            <li> , my 23 year old son used as well.</li>
            <li> Went and washed it off in the shower and was pleasantly surprised when I looked at my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt much smoother and my pores did appear to be smaller.  </li>
            <li> WOW what a difference it made.</li>
            <li> My kids and I decided to give it a try the other night and had a lot of fun smearing it on our faces.  </li>
            <li> but it left her skin soft soft soft!</li>
            <li> In that my pores actually seemed a little smaller after using this product, I feel it will be helpful and appropriate for my aging, combination skin.</li>
            <li> i am really looking forward to using this weekly to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> Part of my new daily skin care regimen&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I let it dry for 15 mins and by that time I could really feel it working tighting my face.</li>
            <li> Within 10 mins they were dry ready to be removed which was</li>
            <li> it gets a little itchy after about 10 minutes- as it dries, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It left my skin soft and supple, as well as toned.  </li>
            <li> I used on myself and 21 yr old daughter last night.</li>
            <li> barely there.</li>
            <li> I did find it pulled out some things and had a few blemishes after using this, but they were minor and went away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and find I am often bothered by both scents and other ingredients that can actually irritate vs. do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I have used it only once, and look forward to see the long the benefits after continued use.</li>
            <li> This mask goes on thin and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin had a rough feeling and have tried different moisturizers to no avail.</li>
            <li> I look forward to the long term effects.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this wasn&#x27;t too harsh.</li>
            <li> I also dabbed a bit on cystic bump I had, left it on overnight; definitely helped it go down.</li>
            <li> Then you leave it on for 15-20 minutes and allow it to dry.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t sting my face or leave my skin dry.  </li>
            <li> It took a while to dry, but when it did I felt my skin tighten up dramatically.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount so this jar will last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Our faces were clean and dry as stated we use very little product to apply a thin layer all over face and necks.</li>
            <li> I especially like the Dead Sea Mud Mask as it does not leave your face dry and caked when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> i have really pink skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really into masks</li>
            <li> We tend to lose moisture and the nutrients due to weather, sun and misuse.</li>
            <li> Money well spent and we look forward to telling my friends/family about your item!</li>
            <li> With other masks that I have tried, you have to scrub and scrub to get it off.</li>
            <li> I have small pores and little acne, just enough to annoy me.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be drying like the other masks I have used in the past; however, this didn&#x27;t leave my face dry at all.</li>
            <li> I know that we are an extreme case, but if it works for her it will work for anybody!  </li>
            <li> also the dryness on my forehead is much less noticeable</li>
            <li> Took away the black heads and helped even my complexion.</li>
            <li> With continued use, I expect my dark spots to go away!</li>
            <li> this mask has helped to keep those little breakouts from happening.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some masks that are a little harsh on my skin</li>
            <li> My family and I made a night to do the Dead Sea Mask together.</li>
            <li> I received my Dead Sea Mud Mask yesterday , and I tried it as soon as I gotten it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not so harsh in my skin</li>
            <li> My skin looks detoxified as I can see the removal of dead skin.</li>
            <li> Other masks I&#x27;ve tried had an unpleasant chemical aroma or left my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> not sure I&#x27;m spelling</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter, who suffers from acne on her forehead and between her brows.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe how firm my face feels after using this!</li>
            <li> My sons pores shrank and I have no more acne.</li>
            <li> I applied a thin layer of the product, as directed on the instructions, and as it dried it produced a tightening effect and turned a lighter color as it worked.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight tingling sensation but it&#x27;s nothing too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> then I applied a thin layer of the mud as directed.</li>
            <li> makes your face look dirty-</li>
            <li> it absorbs the dirty from my pore.</li>
            <li> You gotta try this one, you wont be disappointed.</li>

It started working immediately. I let it dry for 15 mins and by that time I could really feel it working tighting my face. There is a slight tingling sensation but it&#x27;s nothing too uncomfortable. After I washed the mud off my face felt wonderful. I didn&#x27;t have any redness as some others might have experienced. My face felt so soft and smooth as a babies bottom . I can&#x27;t wait to try it again next week.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f87925105ff8dd9e493fd37f0144d6c3]]I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this face mask! It&#x27;s light, gentle, and HIGHLY EFFECTIVE! I am SO EXCITED to continue using this one a week!</li>
            <li> I have used several Mud mask over the years.  This is the best Mud mask I have ever used!  It leaves your skin feeling refreshed and smooth!  I love it!  I would recommend that you try it!</li>
            <li> I brought this and I&#x27;m truly impressed. I highly recommends it to everyone.  Money well spent and we look forward to telling my friends/family about your item!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time and am very pleased. My face feels clean and soft.  I look forward to seeing what the results will be with continued use.....</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Thank you for a great offer!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday and I love it! Once the mud mask dried up, I can feel my skin getting tighter. After about 10-15 minutes, I washed my face with warm water - what a complete difference! My face feels so silky smooth, tight, pores looked smaller and best of all my face felt cool. This is the same feeling I get when I used to go to the spa and pay a hefty bill. Dead Sea Mud Mask is definitely highly recommended!</li>
            <li> After using it my face turns soft.</li>
            <li> This mask goes on smooth. It doesn&#x27;t have much smell, which makes me happy. After washing it off, my face felt completely smooth and my pores looked smaller. I have sensitive skin and this wasn&#x27;t too harsh.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mud mask that I&#x27;ve tried.It&#x27;s not so harsh in my skin and it make my faces smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> Great product! Part of my new daily skin care regimen&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Awesome ..will buy again</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff. I used it for the first time this week and my skin felt great afterwards. As it dries, it will tighten and my skin started to itch a bit but it was not irritated afterwards. Again, skin looked and felt great. I also dabbed a bit on cystic bump I had, left it on overnight; definitely helped it go down. Oh and it does not take a lot to cover your face. The jar should last you for a while.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Mask is pretty awesome!  My kids and I decided to give it a try the other night and had a lot of fun smearing it on our faces.  It goes on nice and smooth- makes your face look dirty- like you&#x27;ve got ash or muck on it.  Then you leave it on for 15-20 minutes and allow it to dry.  I will say- it gets a little itchy after about 10 minutes- as it dries, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  We rinsed it off and our skin felt great!  Nice and smooth, and my pores appeared smaller.  I followed it up with a moisturizer and went to bed.  Even the next morning my pores still appeared smaller, and my skin was super smooth.  I normally have oily skin  in the T-zone area and dryer skin on my cheeks, but this seemed to neutralize it all, and make it much more even toned.  I highly recommend trying this mask!</li>
            <li> very nice mask..glides on..you can feel it tightening..easy to wash off.you can feel the difference right away..very happy!!!</li>
            <li> Cleans face very nicely</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!. I noticed instant results. My face was smooth. Took away the black heads and helped even my complexion. I have recommended this to numerous people. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This sea mud mask was more than I expected. I thought it would be drying like the other masks I have used in the past; however, this didn&#x27;t leave my face dry at all. I have only used it once, but I am a customer for life. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again next week and see more results. I could feel the mask working on my skin after the initial use. My face is now so soft and smooth. With continued use, I expect my dark spots to go away! Thanks for a wonderful product and excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> i just used this for the first time and I love it, I have used mask before but I love the results for this one. I will use it few more times and I will update my review if need it :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. Love how it makes my face look and feel.</li>
            <li> The AromaOils Dead Sea Mud Mask is a wonderful product. I used on myself and 21 yr old daughter last night. Our faces were clean and dry as stated we use very little product to apply a thin layer all over face and necks. Within 10 mins they were dry ready to be removed which was super easy warm wet washcloth took right off. Our skin was a little pinkish and soft skin from the mud working its magic we put on moisturizer afterwards. We will make this a weekly mask. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works Great.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and find I am often bothered by both scents and other ingredients that can actually irritate vs. do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  This was a great experience.  The product does not have a strong fragrance/odor and my skin was very smooth after using it.  I did find it pulled out some things and had a few blemishes after using this, but they were minor and went away quickly.  My husband has  really oily skin, and this helped to control his oil.  This will be a product in regular rotation for us!</li>
            <li> Received this 2 days ago, I used it on the day I received it. I&#x27;m not really into masks however this was wonderful! It was light weight and easy to wash off. My skin felt so smooth and soft,. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it again next week! Thanks so much AromaOils! You made an awesome mask!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product love this product. Face feels so soft and clean after using for the first time. Highly recommend. And not just for women, my 23 year old son used as well.</li>
            <li> Really great mask! Went on smoothly. My face felt like a piece of Heaven after I rinsed it off. Very smooth &amp; clean. Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Received this item last week and tried it for the first time today.  I applied a thin layer of the product, as directed on the instructions, and as it dried it produced a tightening effect and turned a lighter color as it worked.  Went and washed it off in the shower and was pleasantly surprised when I looked at my face.  It seemed to be more clearer and dare I say, almost glowing?  Am excited to see what type of results I will get from continued use.  I also want to try this product on the body as well.</li>
            <li> My face feels amazing, I can&#x27;t stop touching it. My skin is smooth and my pores are tight. I love it.</li>
            <li> Works Great!  Highly Recommend this product</li>
            <li> nice and lite not heavy like other masks i have tried</li>
            <li> This face mask goes on so nice and smooth and makes my face feel soft and pampered.  I have areas on my face that have a tendency to get oily and this mask has helped to keep those little breakouts from happening.  I&#x27;ve used some masks that are a little harsh on my skin but this one is very gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I got it last night and tried it.  One try and already I can see results, the skin on my cheeks and forehead looks clearer and smoother already.  I may just have to bathe in this!</li>
            <li> This mask goes on thin and dries quickly. After using it my face felt fresh, clean and smooth. Other masks I&#x27;ve tried had an unpleasant chemical aroma or left my skin too dry. This product had no odor to speak of and I will look forward to using it once a week. It is also important to note that it did not seem to cause or worsen acne breakouts, as some facial masques work by bringing blemishes &#x27;to the surface.&#x27; In that my pores actually seemed a little smaller after using this product, I feel it will be helpful and appropriate for my aging, combination skin. **I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Love this mud mask...it absorbs the dirty from my pore. make my skin so soft and clean feeling</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.  My skin felt much smoother and my pores did appear to be smaller.  It went on very smooth and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I just love this dead sea mud mask to detox and reduce pores. If you are looking to try a great product this is it and well worth it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice a week over the last two weeks and I can see a difference in the blackheads on my nose which is the main reason I bought this.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t sting my face or leave my skin dry.  I REALLY like this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I use it once a week and immediately after use I see a difference. My skin looks detoxified as I can see the removal of dead skin. My skin feels smooth and I&#x27;ve even noticed it clearing up blemishes extremely fast. I would definitely recommend this product because it is a safe and natural treatment for your skin that works very well.</li>
            <li> I liked how easy is was to wash off. With other masks that I have tried, you have to scrub and scrub to get it off. My face feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It made my face feel so smooth. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This mask really reduced the size of my pores.I used this product for the first time and am very pleased. My face feels clean and soft. After using it my face felt fresh, clean and smooth.Thank you so much for the product</li>
            <li> I have small pores and little acne, just enough to annoy me. My son has big pores and hitting puberty so we both put on the mask, and WOW what a difference it made. My sons pores shrank and I have no more acne. My son&#x27;s acne has almost gone away. We have been doing this every week and his acne has gone&lt;br /&gt;to barely there. Great Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for free for a honest and unbiased review, my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> It took a while to dry, but when it did I felt my skin tighten up dramatically. After washing it off my skin felt great. Guys, this is a good way to work on those pores.</li>
