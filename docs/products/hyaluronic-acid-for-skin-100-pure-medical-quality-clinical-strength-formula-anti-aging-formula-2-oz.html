            <li>Fantastic product, excellent price.</li>
            <li>I loved the effect.</li>
            <li>After applying, you need to seal it in with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think this product works as good as they say it does.</li>
            <li>Not as good as some I have tried .</li>
            <li>After reading about the benefits of hyaluronic acid, I immediately looked for a variety that has good feedback.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin and feels good.</li>
            <li>When I came across this hyaluronic acid, I read good reviews and tried it out for myself.</li>
            <li>It feels so good when I put it on.</li>
            <li>The price is good too</li>
            <li>and I just had microdermabrasion so that is surprising.</li>
            <li>I also bought two jars because of the good price and the reviews.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>This one works great and has nice packaging to boot.</li>
            <li>Do not know if it works, but makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li>received this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin</li>
            <li>To be fair</li>
            <li>In fact, with the Hyaluronic Acid film on my skin, my skin appears drier than it does with a good lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>Not so good.</li>
            <li>but this one has not done anything good for me.</li>
            <li>Good quality and good prize</li>
            <li>It has no smell, which is a good thing, as I cannot stand anything with a scent on my face.  </li>
            <li>people say it&#x27;s good..</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I did, because I have been getting the results I want and more.</li>
            <li>Love this product over my moisturizer!</li>
            <li>and they look and feel better too!</li>

            <li>this one is much better!  </li>
            <li>I have had amazing results and will continue to use it for life.  </li>
            <li>Amazing is the word I will use to describe this product.</li>
            <li>The price is great and this company is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Great product, have used many and this is the best by far</li>
            <li>okay I thought I loved this product but after using it for a week or so....</li>
            <li>This is a nice acid.</li>
            <li>I was even luckier that it was discounted just so that I can try it out and give my unbiased and honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>It really helps to keep your skin flawless and glowing.</li>
            <li>It feels nice on the skin and is not greasy at all..</li>
            <li>I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li>love it soaks in good non greasy</li>
            <li>Leaves skin nice and have noticed a reduction in visible lines</li>
            <li>This is honestly a &amp;#34;Holy Grail &amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>It seems to do a great job and seems to make my skin feel better and seems to keep my skin more moisturized and refreshed .  </li>
            <li>This comes in a nice 2oz bottle  and is made in the USA.</li>
            <li>It honestly makes my skin feel softer.</li>
            <li>I can see a tightening and nice toning of my skin.  </li>
            <li>The viscosity was off and it just wasn&#x27;t a superior product---I will give the company and the product one more chance and order another bottle in the hopes that quality control was just off on that lot/batch I received...</li>
            <li>received this item at a discount, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and can take effect within minutes of application.</li>
            <li>I am glad I was able to test this product for my unbiased opinion!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, it helps make my skin smoothe and clear.  </li>
            <li>It has a great dropper to dispense just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li>I only use this and Vitamin C cream now great price and great results.  </li>
            <li>Serum #3 from Cosmedica is also mostly water but so much more viscous and effective.</li>
            <li>Great product--so much bang for the buck!  </li>
            <li>it sounds too good to be true....</li>
            <li>This stuff works well and prevents fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li>Love it works great, my husband commented that I look better, younger or some how prettier LOL.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin very smooth</li>
            <li>My face is visibly better-looking and feels very smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>This serum is very luxurious feeling and feels great on my face.</li>
            <li>Lightens age spots and I&#x27;m almost sure the &amp;#34;Turkey wattle&amp;#34; is firming.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like watery gel.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work ok, but maybe it is all in my head.</li>
            <li>I still apply sun screen over top to protect my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this and PONDS day and night :)))</li>

            <li>Really love this.</li>
            <li>I poured out the rest of the bottle and found more floating mold.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love that its made here in the USA.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>my face just becomes more toned.</li>

            <li>I love the feeling I get after applying it.</li>
            <li>Love how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>85 going on 70 :)</li>
            <li>Feels okay going on, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>but I love the way it just soaks in to your skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Enter uVernal, I was glad to know it was made from safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping time</li>
            <li>I love this product for skin care.</li>
            <li>There are many benefits into jawing hyaluroic acid.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it .Will</li>
            <li>and it goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look hydrated and glowing, will be purchasing more for my clients who microderm to use after the microderm treatment.</li>
            <li>will order more</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It works and I am confident it will work for you too.  </li>
            <li>I love this and combine it with vit C serum.</li>
            <li>and I am looking forward to seeing more results the more</li>
            <li>Many cremes for the skin include this ingredient in the recipe.  </li>
            <li>I have been merely touching the eye-drop applicator</li>
            <li>My mother noticed that I began to look better, healthier and fresher.</li>
            <li>This product has given me a more youthful look.</li>
            <li>Love the consistency.</li>
            <li>After months of using this product, I can say with confidence that it is of top quality.</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The reason for it is how it holds our moisture, on a molecular level, leaving a healthy, plump to the skin.</li>
            <li>My face shines with more youthfulness.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d like to understand this better and will research at some point.)  </li>
            <li>Love this and will reorder when needed.</li>
            <li>Really good at tightening the skin in your face right before bed.</li>
            <li>Tried several Hyaluronic Acid serums and this is my favorite!!!  </li>
            <li>Wow, this makes my skin look so good!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker, kind of gooey, which I liked at first, but this is a &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; that has nothing to do with performance.</li>
            <li>The best thing that I noticed from using the Vernal Hyaluronic Pure Acid is that my skin did not appear to sag as much.</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbed, perfectly moisturizes the skin, the skin becomes soft, and brighter.</li>
            <li>Nice clear appearance with a good consistency; not too watery.  </li>
            <li>I am becoming a bit of an advocate for mens&#x27; products and I saw my dad&#x27;s skin wrinkle and sag.</li>
            <li>This one sure is cheap.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is, it makes my skin feel so much smoother and not itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the second bottle of acid, I am delighted with it!</li>
            <li>Very quick shipping and</li>
            <li>Makes the face look and feel smoother very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be balanced, the product is well packaged and attractive, and the product applies easily, though slightly more liquid than similar HA products.</li>
            <li>This says nothing about the integrity of the product itself, but in an age where sourcing is becoming extremely important, it breeds caution when making a purchasing decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels like silk when you first put it on your face, then once the skin soaks up the silkiness, I put on a nice moisturizer and Vitamin &amp;#34;C&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, leaving a light non greasy layer on my skin that gives it a glow and firmness.  </li>
            <li>Smooth on the skin, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I like the texture of the serum, it&#x60;s working fine.</li>
            <li>and I am now a loyal customer!</li>
            <li>QUICK ship!</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:72015539a068a766e99c4d4a0e6d68ef]]I was lucky to be able to test this product out</li>
            <li>Quick shipping too - A+ product, price, and service  in my book!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked - great product that slows down the creation of more wrinkles and love that it&#x27;s 2 oz.</li>
            <li>A huge bottle of the stuff.</li>
            <li>but I do think its way too soon to tell if there&#x27;s a HUGE difference</li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff for my skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and I feel like my moisturizer goes on smoother because of it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin smooth and holds in moisture.</li>
            <li>I like it, no miracles but gives a smooth feel.</li>
            <li>held the bottle to the light and seen bits of mold floating in the bottle</li>
            <li>Smooth out your skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s filled with mold and brown slime.  </li>
            <li>I really like the result, just amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this product becomes absorbed by the skin - I see no evidence that it improves the condition of skin over time or that it makes skin appear more youthful.</li>
            <li>It caused me light acne.</li>
            <li>And IMPORTANTLY, What those of you who don&#x27;t know should pay attention to, is that HA should be used just before a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Places nice plumping back into skin &amp; creates nice moisture in skin.</li>
            <li>By the second day I notices my skin fuller, more hydrated and shiny!!</li>
            <li>This product is very effective if used daily.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend it to the ladies out there who want to feel more beautiful.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny I paid for!</li>
            <li>Has made my skin soft, smooth, more even toned, and it has diminished the appearance of my pores!</li>
            <li>The first bottle was like water, wasn&#x27;t sure if this was what it was supposed to be like.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to see the results after I have been using the product for a extended period of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with results so far.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>This becomes significant when distinguishing products within a product line.</li>
            <li>The scent is not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;*I was given a discount or free offer for my true and unbiased opinion of this product</li>
            <li>The first, from BNatural Organics, felt so lovely and helpful to put on that I converted two friends to using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a senior, so I don&#x27;t know how younger buyers might feel, but my skin does have a nice and healthy appearance.</li>
            <li>It is easily applied and absorbed.</li>
            <li>Just an overall nice healthy look to my skin and</li>
            <li>It is very effective and makes the skin in my face be really plump and soft.</li>
            <li>Feels great on my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I am loving this product so far.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if it still contains the same good stuffs.</li>
            <li>I like to combine this hyaluronic acid with my retin-A and a dab of my favorite face cream in the palm of my hands, rubbing them together and gently applying it to my face every night.  </li>
            <li>Good moisturizer for under my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>No bad smell and no sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>Ive used other brands of hyaluronic acid with no problems and great results.</li>
            <li>Doing this twice a day will produce quick results.</li>
            <li>Ive used many different brands,but this is my favorite so far.morning and night</li>
            <li>Secondly, I find the dropper very handy, since you can control the quantity and use exactly as much as you want.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle but effective and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Thinking about trying different brand even though the one I am using is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pretty good--dnt really know if any better than coconut oil--</li>
            <li>and it feels like an instant, refreshing mini face lift!  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really notice a huge difference with my skin yet.</li>
            <li>thank you for making this available at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It has become silky smooth and much healthier than it was.</li>
            <li>As we get old we start loosing the baby skin smooth wrinkle free skin.</li>
            <li>so far I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with it, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>I think that the hyaluronic acid is way too low  to make this effective.  </li>
            <li>Quickly absorbed and skin seems moister.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 68 year old RN and find that it evens out my very sun damaged skin tone, feels good on my face, and is not grossly overpriced as most cosmetics are.</li>
            <li>It is better than my old moisturizer because of the consistency and lack of oily build up.</li>
            <li>Bought one bottle LOVED it so much ordered another as not to run out---second bottle was as if someone just placed regular tap water in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>i will attempt to make my own next time just like i did for my vitamin c serum</li>
            <li>I put it on right after cleansing face but before drying.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin right away.</li>
            <li>I tried it, it is soothing, but I just don&#x27;t feel right about it.</li>
            <li>In the morning right after I wake up and at night just before bed time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The distributor has good reviews, but has only one other unrelated health product, and mostly iPhone accessories.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had enough time to fully test it, but so far it&#x27;s been a good product.</li>
            <li>Really makes skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Paraben free and fragrance free, which is a big plus in my book.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the dark circles around my eyes are becoming more evident.</li>
            <li>and I am always looking for new, good facial products, particularly if they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It works, it really works!</li>
            <li>The exact percentage should be stated otherwise</li>
            <li>Just buy the powder - it&#x27;s not expensive and mix with water yourself</li>
            <li>Skin has definitely felt more hydrated in these drying winter months.</li>
            <li>I did notice that it smells a bit when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and is absorbed almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Save your money for the real thing!</li>
            <li>The second one was more gelatinous.  </li>
            <li>Having read about hyaluronic acid, I was scared at first.</li>
            <li>the product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>For the most part, they are all the same except the packaging.</li>
            <li>This product worked the first night I used it.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and really see a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My skin already looks better after using it for only 3 days!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what makes the texture different, but it makes it more convenient.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought I was just imagining the results.</li>
            <li>This is the first Hyaluronic Acid I have tried.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m all for supporting US</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I love the blue bottle.  </li>
            <li>Is the first time I&#x27;m gonna use this product...</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin, especially my feet.</li>
            <li>Really how well can you expect a product to work unless you have 30 days, but this stuff worked right away.</li>
            <li>have made one application of the product, and it applied easily, but with a barely noticeable stinging sensation.</li>
            <li>It does provide a unique softness and  does  smooth out minor wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I never got a chance in the past to have beautiful clear glowing skin ( was riddled with acne from 15-49).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>so you wouldn&#x27;t see mold easily and the bottle is blue.</li>
            <li>B00LUA11EI Hyaluronic Acid for Skin - 100% Pure Hyaluronic acid - Anti aging formula</li>
            <li>Will not purchase again and will stick with the pure 20% Vitamin C serums -</li>
            <li>This is the third product I have tried in the past six months and this, by far, is the best!  </li>
            <li>Skin feels nice and tight after cleaning then applying as directed.</li>
            <li>This product has really moisturized my face, even more effective than actual moisturizers that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I only have fine lines, and it made no difference on those.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid has made my face smoother and helped with fine lines when used regularly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to purchase 100 % the pure real deal, and decide for myself how little or how much without getting everything else.</li>
            <li>It really does reverse aging.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works well for me.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I am so thankful for the hyaluronic acid because I can feel the effects straight away.</li>
            <li>My face feels very moisturized</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and saw no difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li>But I held it up to a light and low and behold there were floaters!!!!</li>
            <li>I maneuvered the dropper to suction one of the floaters and release it on the stainless steel stopper in my sink.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference except for my chest...smoothed out the wrinkles..</li>
            <li>Product doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Did do much after a month&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>delivery was fast and product was just what i saw on ebay</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to really help &amp; heal sun crinkled</li>
            <li>VERY DRYING</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Really hydrates my skin and refreshes my face after a derma pen session.</li>
            <li>I am very upset with this product.  </li>
            <li>hope is that the distributor will update the product description with sourcing information and some of the science behind the product, and remove any and all customer reviews that appear to be created rather than experienced.</li>
            <li>This helps a lot thanks.</li>
            <li>Really can&#x27;t tell that this product has made any difference in my skin, may work well for some.</li>
            <li>Very drying.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be thicker, very watery.  </li>
            <li>Seems to have absolutely cured my acne.</li>
            <li>I used up the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>After much persuasion from my bestfriend, I reluctantly gave in and tried this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>i wash my face,and gently exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Although not as much as you may hope, it does seem to offer some benefit for ageing skin.</li>
            <li>All this thanks to the acid.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>I find the product really effective, especially when included in my daily face regimen.</li>
            <li>It is very product more than i expected.</li>
            <li>I went on another site and purchased Reviva Labs Hyaluronic Acid Serum and just used it one time and WOW!!!</li>
            <li>works better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands of hyaluronic acid over two years (cosmedica, Oz, skin beauty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my original brand.</li>
            <li>and I always look and feel older than I really am.</li>
            <li>I have new skin!</li>
            <li>When I tried this particular HA product, I was in awe.</li>
            <li>I do have to say, My skin was soft, and for those that wear make-up this is light enough to wear under your cosmetics..</li>
            <li>Check out my video of what I liked and disliked so far.. #TQR</li>
            <li>It is OK for the low price with such quality.</li>
            <li>I am a woman who is getting older each day that passes.</li>
            <li>So many of these reviewers have only reviewed a total of 2 products.</li>
            <li>I bought it to minimize the lines on my upper lip, which it has done tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Water&#x27;s the main ingredient, and that&#x27;s what it feels like.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I used it for a couple of months and felt like it was doing some good until I noticed little spots of grey mold in the dropper.  </li>
            <li>My 34 year old daughter wants to know why I don&#x27;t need cover up anymore.  </li>
            <li>Within just a few days, my skin felt more hydrated than ever before.</li>
            <li>Hyaluroic acid is normally found in the body.</li>
            <li>However, after a few trial runs with the hyaluronic acid, I gladly made an exception.</li>
            <li>I am pretty blessed with not a whole lot of blemishes or wrinkles, but this product made my face feel fresh</li>
            <li>HA is the little &#x27;magic&#x27; ingredient found all the fancy new products on the market.  </li>
            <li>Use on clean, dry skin, apply liberally to face, neck, decolletage, hands; let it dry - it is quick.</li>
            <li>is a new product for me</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t be soon that I will be looking for that new bottle.  </li>
            <li>However it doesn&#x27;t take very much to cover your entire face...</li>
            <li>So use it early on!</li>
            <li>Just wow effect!</li>
            <li>Only on my first order, seems to do well on my skin.</li>
            <li>But what others said about the positive reviewers is totally true, it is very strange that all of them have a history of only 2 reviews that were positive and on the same</li>
            <li>The majority of the review names are in all CAPS, and use many exclamation points and review only one other product, completely unrelated to the beauty industry (thank you L. Kirby for review).</li>
            <li>Exfoliating is the most important though, to get those old dead skin cells off prior to applying your facial creams,so that your treating the fresh new skin,and not the old dead skin.</li>
            <li>Then I use this hyaluronic acid serum first,then i use my eye cream, then i use regenerist micro- sculpting cream,letting each dry before applying the next.i am 43 and have spent many years out in the sun  </li>
            <li>MAkes my skin tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>But I ordered a large quantity and by the time I opened the last jar ......</li>
            <li>While nothing is going to make me look younger, this is certainly stopping my looks from aging.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this specific one from uVernal and give it a try, because it says it&#x27;s 100% Pure and natural.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve finding some of little white bumps that I haven&#x27;t seen in many years.</li>
            <li>It feels like the pure aloe vera gel, a little gluey, but not too sticky, so it feels very nice on your skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hyaluronic acid I&#x27;ve tried; the other two products I used, seemed to be &#x27;watered down&#x27;, but this solution is slightly &#x27;gummy&#x27; the smallest bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>so far I like the product.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin and makes it soft</li>
            <li>Leaving it feel really soft</li>
            <li>I encountered this product and was enticed by the fact that it is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The former items I purchased is much thicker than this one.</li>
            <li>This bottle is made from natural and vegan products.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>so far,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands and I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>My skin became so soft as a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I feel so young and my skin is beginning to repair itself with the help of this natural product.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re young and have oily/acne prone skin, give this a try.</li>
            <li>This is all i do to keep my skin looking young.</li>
            <li>This one is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>The others I&#x27;ve tried have had near the consistency of water.</li>
            <li>My skin really looked hydrated and my pores seemed to appear smaller.</li>
            <li>I did not expect miracle from this product, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>You only need about 3-4 drops for the whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and blemish free everyday.</li>
            <li>to harsh cleansers or physical exfoliation) and produces more oil to make up for the moisture it doesn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>but i can honestly say ive been told i look like im in mid to late 20s ,even without makeup.</li>
            <li>I am a ripe old broad, 65, and I KNOW that this stuff works!</li>
            <li>If my next bottle is like the first, it&#x27;s going back!</li>
            <li>when i use it i make sure to keep it open for as little time as possible to preserve the strength.</li>
            <li>It glides on nicely and leaves my skin feeling a little tight then the feeling melts away.</li>
            <li>It helps smooth out the small wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li>but I do hope to see some improvement one day because I really have dry skin and since winter</li>
            <li>I look very much younger than my actual age, all thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>A little &#x27;wimpy&#x27; in strength and other products did better.</li>
            <li>How is it that this company can sell it at such a low cost and other customers are willing to buy the same product at a substantially higher price.</li>
            <li>I like it because it seems to work a little in spite of my old age, is absorbed quickly and a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any big improvements, but I don&#x27;t have any big problems either, just a few fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I just started using the product, and I already see the pores minimized, the skin softened, and a general glowing aspect of my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I definitely will be reordering when I get somewhere near the end of this bottle.  </li>
            <li>However, the second I think I am anywhere near the end...</li>
            <li>I use only natural products now.  </li>
            <li>Let me preface by saying that I&#x27;m a 22 year old female.</li>
            <li>Hands down and the company is first class too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly like other review said, they all made two reviews at the same day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used much better quality Hyaluronic acid products for the same price and this one was not nearly as potent as the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I noticed grey strands and dots suspended in the clear liquid.</li>
            <li>:  As I was into my 3rd bottle, the consistency suddenly turned from the lovely gel to a thin water feel.</li>
            <li>After a week of using my fine wrinkles around the eyes become a little less.</li>
            <li>My major concern is that it just shouldn&#x27;t be selling at such a low price.</li>
            <li>I applied it while my skin was still moist and let it dry completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for two months with not much long lasting effects.</li>
            <li>, I have large pores, uneven skin.....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that it takes so little to do so much.</li>

            <li> After applying, you need to seal it in with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think this product works as good as they say it does.</li>
            <li> Not as good as some I have tried .</li>
            <li> After reading about the benefits of hyaluronic acid, I immediately looked for a variety that has good feedback.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin and feels good.</li>
            <li> When I came across this hyaluronic acid, I read good reviews and tried it out for myself.</li>
            <li> It feels so good when I put it on.</li>
            <li> The price is good too</li>
            <li> and I just had microdermabrasion so that is surprising.</li>
            <li> I also bought two jars because of the good price and the reviews.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> This one works great and has nice packaging to boot.</li>
            <li> Do not know if it works, but makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> received this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin</li>
            <li> To be fair</li>
            <li> In fact, with the Hyaluronic Acid film on my skin, my skin appears drier than it does with a good lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Not so good.</li>
            <li> but this one has not done anything good for me.</li>
            <li> Good quality and good prize</li>
            <li> It has no smell, which is a good thing, as I cannot stand anything with a scent on my face.  </li>
            <li> people say it&#x27;s good..</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I did, because I have been getting the results I want and more.</li>

            <li> The price is great and this company is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Great product, have used many and this is the best by far</li>
            <li> okay I thought I loved this product but after using it for a week or so....</li>
            <li> This is a nice acid.</li>
            <li> I was even luckier that it was discounted just so that I can try it out and give my unbiased and honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> It really helps to keep your skin flawless and glowing.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on the skin and is not greasy at all..</li>
            <li> I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li> love it soaks in good non greasy</li>
            <li> Leaves skin nice and have noticed a reduction in visible lines</li>
            <li> This is honestly a &amp;#34;Holy Grail &amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> It seems to do a great job and seems to make my skin feel better and seems to keep my skin more moisturized and refreshed .  </li>
            <li> This comes in a nice 2oz bottle  and is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> It honestly makes my skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> I can see a tightening and nice toning of my skin.  </li>
            <li> The viscosity was off and it just wasn&#x27;t a superior product---I will give the company and the product one more chance and order another bottle in the hopes that quality control was just off on that lot/batch I received...</li>
            <li> received this item at a discount, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and can take effect within minutes of application.</li>
            <li> I am glad I was able to test this product for my unbiased opinion!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, it helps make my skin smoothe and clear.  </li>
            <li> It has a great dropper to dispense just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> I only use this and Vitamin C cream now great price and great results.  </li>
            <li> Serum #3 from Cosmedica is also mostly water but so much more viscous and effective.</li>
            <li> Great product--so much bang for the buck!  </li>
            <li> it sounds too good to be true....</li>
            <li> This stuff works well and prevents fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Love it works great, my husband commented that I look better, younger or some how prettier LOL.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin very smooth</li>
            <li> My face is visibly better-looking and feels very smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> This serum is very luxurious feeling and feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> Lightens age spots and I&#x27;m almost sure the &amp;#34;Turkey wattle&amp;#34; is firming.  </li>
            <li> It feels more like watery gel.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work ok, but maybe it is all in my head.</li>
            <li> I still apply sun screen over top to protect my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this and PONDS day and night :)))</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> however I wish the top screwed on better</li>
            <li> Yesterday I ran errands all day and three different strangers stopped me to tell me how beautiful my skin looked!</li>
            <li> Really love this.</li>
            <li> I poured out the rest of the bottle and found more floating mold.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love that its made here in the USA.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> my face just becomes more toned.</li>
            <li> Not to sound overdramatic, but this product is a miracle!</li>
            <li> I love the feeling I get after applying it.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> 85 going on 70 :)</li>
            <li> Feels okay going on, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> but I love the way it just soaks in to your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Enter uVernal, I was glad to know it was made from safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping time</li>
            <li> I love this product for skin care.</li>
            <li> There are many benefits into jawing hyaluroic acid.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it .Will</li>
            <li> and it goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look hydrated and glowing, will be purchasing more for my clients who microderm to use after the microderm treatment.</li>
            <li> will order more</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It works and I am confident it will work for you too.  </li>
            <li> I love this and combine it with vit C serum.</li>
            <li> and I am looking forward to seeing more results the more</li>
            <li> Many cremes for the skin include this ingredient in the recipe.  </li>
            <li> I have been merely touching the eye-drop applicator</li>
            <li> My mother noticed that I began to look better, healthier and fresher.</li>
            <li> This product has given me a more youthful look.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency.</li>
            <li> After months of using this product, I can say with confidence that it is of top quality.</li>
            <li> and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The reason for it is how it holds our moisture, on a molecular level, leaving a healthy, plump to the skin.</li>
            <li> My face shines with more youthfulness.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d like to understand this better and will research at some point.)  </li>
            <li> Love this and will reorder when needed.</li>
            <li> Really good at tightening the skin in your face right before bed.</li>
            <li> Tried several Hyaluronic Acid serums and this is my favorite!!!  </li>
            <li> Wow, this makes my skin look so good!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker, kind of gooey, which I liked at first, but this is a &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; that has nothing to do with performance.</li>
            <li> The best thing that I noticed from using the Vernal Hyaluronic Pure Acid is that my skin did not appear to sag as much.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed, perfectly moisturizes the skin, the skin becomes soft, and brighter.</li>
            <li> Nice clear appearance with a good consistency; not too watery.  </li>
            <li> I am becoming a bit of an advocate for mens&#x27; products and I saw my dad&#x27;s skin wrinkle and sag.</li>
            <li> This one sure is cheap.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is, it makes my skin feel so much smoother and not itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of acid, I am delighted with it!</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping and</li>
            <li> Makes the face look and feel smoother very quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be balanced, the product is well packaged and attractive, and the product applies easily, though slightly more liquid than similar HA products.</li>
            <li> This says nothing about the integrity of the product itself, but in an age where sourcing is becoming extremely important, it breeds caution when making a purchasing decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels like silk when you first put it on your face, then once the skin soaks up the silkiness, I put on a nice moisturizer and Vitamin &amp;#34;C&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, leaving a light non greasy layer on my skin that gives it a glow and firmness.  </li>
            <li> Smooth on the skin, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I like the texture of the serum, it&#x60;s working fine.</li>
            <li> and I am now a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> QUICK ship!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:72015539a068a766e99c4d4a0e6d68ef]]I was lucky to be able to test this product out</li>
            <li> Quick shipping too - A+ product, price, and service  in my book!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked - great product that slows down the creation of more wrinkles and love that it&#x27;s 2 oz.</li>
            <li> A huge bottle of the stuff.</li>
            <li> but I do think its way too soon to tell if there&#x27;s a HUGE difference</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff for my skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and I feel like my moisturizer goes on smoother because of it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin smooth and holds in moisture.</li>
            <li> I like it, no miracles but gives a smooth feel.</li>
            <li> held the bottle to the light and seen bits of mold floating in the bottle</li>
            <li> Smooth out your skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s filled with mold and brown slime.  </li>
            <li> I really like the result, just amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this product becomes absorbed by the skin - I see no evidence that it improves the condition of skin over time or that it makes skin appear more youthful.</li>
            <li> It caused me light acne.</li>
            <li> And IMPORTANTLY, What those of you who don&#x27;t know should pay attention to, is that HA should be used just before a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Places nice plumping back into skin &amp; creates nice moisture in skin.</li>
            <li> By the second day I notices my skin fuller, more hydrated and shiny!!</li>
            <li> This product is very effective if used daily.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend it to the ladies out there who want to feel more beautiful.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny I paid for!</li>
            <li> Has made my skin soft, smooth, more even toned, and it has diminished the appearance of my pores!</li>
            <li> The first bottle was like water, wasn&#x27;t sure if this was what it was supposed to be like.  </li>
            <li> I am excited to see the results after I have been using the product for a extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with results so far.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This becomes significant when distinguishing products within a product line.</li>
            <li> The scent is not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;*I was given a discount or free offer for my true and unbiased opinion of this product</li>
            <li> The first, from BNatural Organics, felt so lovely and helpful to put on that I converted two friends to using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior, so I don&#x27;t know how younger buyers might feel, but my skin does have a nice and healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> It is easily applied and absorbed.</li>
            <li> Just an overall nice healthy look to my skin and</li>
            <li> It is very effective and makes the skin in my face be really plump and soft.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if it still contains the same good stuffs.</li>
            <li> I like to combine this hyaluronic acid with my retin-A and a dab of my favorite face cream in the palm of my hands, rubbing them together and gently applying it to my face every night.  </li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for under my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> No bad smell and no sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> Ive used other brands of hyaluronic acid with no problems and great results.</li>
            <li> Doing this twice a day will produce quick results.</li>
            <li> Ive used many different brands,but this is my favorite so far.morning and night</li>
            <li> Secondly, I find the dropper very handy, since you can control the quantity and use exactly as much as you want.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle but effective and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Thinking about trying different brand even though the one I am using is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Pretty good--dnt really know if any better than coconut oil--</li>
            <li> and it feels like an instant, refreshing mini face lift!  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really notice a huge difference with my skin yet.</li>
            <li> thank you for making this available at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It has become silky smooth and much healthier than it was.</li>
            <li> As we get old we start loosing the baby skin smooth wrinkle free skin.</li>
            <li> so far I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with it, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> I think that the hyaluronic acid is way too low  to make this effective.  </li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed and skin seems moister.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 68 year old RN and find that it evens out my very sun damaged skin tone, feels good on my face, and is not grossly overpriced as most cosmetics are.</li>
            <li> It is better than my old moisturizer because of the consistency and lack of oily build up.</li>
            <li> Bought one bottle LOVED it so much ordered another as not to run out---second bottle was as if someone just placed regular tap water in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> i will attempt to make my own next time just like i did for my vitamin c serum</li>
            <li> I put it on right after cleansing face but before drying.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin right away.</li>
            <li> I tried it, it is soothing, but I just don&#x27;t feel right about it.</li>
            <li> In the morning right after I wake up and at night just before bed time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The distributor has good reviews, but has only one other unrelated health product, and mostly iPhone accessories.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had enough time to fully test it, but so far it&#x27;s been a good product.</li>
            <li> Really makes skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Paraben free and fragrance free, which is a big plus in my book.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the dark circles around my eyes are becoming more evident.</li>
            <li> and I am always looking for new, good facial products, particularly if they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It works, it really works!</li>
            <li> The exact percentage should be stated otherwise</li>
            <li> Just buy the powder - it&#x27;s not expensive and mix with water yourself</li>
            <li> Skin has definitely felt more hydrated in these drying winter months.</li>
            <li> I did notice that it smells a bit when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight and is absorbed almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Save your money for the real thing!</li>
            <li> The second one was more gelatinous.  </li>
            <li> Having read about hyaluronic acid, I was scared at first.</li>
            <li> the product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> For the most part, they are all the same except the packaging.</li>
            <li> This product worked the first night I used it.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and really see a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My skin already looks better after using it for only 3 days!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what makes the texture different, but it makes it more convenient.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I was just imagining the results.</li>
            <li> This is the first Hyaluronic Acid I have tried.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m all for supporting US</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I love the blue bottle.  </li>
            <li> Is the first time I&#x27;m gonna use this product...</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, especially my feet.</li>
            <li> Really how well can you expect a product to work unless you have 30 days, but this stuff worked right away.</li>
            <li> have made one application of the product, and it applied easily, but with a barely noticeable stinging sensation.</li>
            <li> It does provide a unique softness and  does  smooth out minor wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I never got a chance in the past to have beautiful clear glowing skin ( was riddled with acne from 15-49).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> so you wouldn&#x27;t see mold easily and the bottle is blue.</li>
            <li> B00LUA11EI Hyaluronic Acid for Skin - 100% Pure Hyaluronic acid - Anti aging formula</li>
            <li> Will not purchase again and will stick with the pure 20% Vitamin C serums -</li>
            <li> This is the third product I have tried in the past six months and this, by far, is the best!  </li>
            <li> Skin feels nice and tight after cleaning then applying as directed.</li>
            <li> This product has really moisturized my face, even more effective than actual moisturizers that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I only have fine lines, and it made no difference on those.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid has made my face smoother and helped with fine lines when used regularly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to purchase 100 % the pure real deal, and decide for myself how little or how much without getting everything else.</li>
            <li> It really does reverse aging.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works well for me.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful for the hyaluronic acid because I can feel the effects straight away.</li>
            <li> My face feels very moisturized</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and saw no difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> But I held it up to a light and low and behold there were floaters!!!!</li>
            <li> I maneuvered the dropper to suction one of the floaters and release it on the stainless steel stopper in my sink.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference except for my chest...smoothed out the wrinkles..</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Did do much after a month&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> delivery was fast and product was just what i saw on ebay</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to really help &amp; heal sun crinkled</li>
            <li> VERY DRYING</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> Really hydrates my skin and refreshes my face after a derma pen session.</li>
            <li> I am very upset with this product.  </li>
            <li> hope is that the distributor will update the product description with sourcing information and some of the science behind the product, and remove any and all customer reviews that appear to be created rather than experienced.</li>
            <li> This helps a lot thanks.</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t tell that this product has made any difference in my skin, may work well for some.</li>
            <li> Very drying.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be thicker, very watery.  </li>
            <li> Seems to have absolutely cured my acne.</li>
            <li> I used up the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li> After much persuasion from my bestfriend, I reluctantly gave in and tried this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> i wash my face,and gently exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Although not as much as you may hope, it does seem to offer some benefit for ageing skin.</li>
            <li> All this thanks to the acid.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> I find the product really effective, especially when included in my daily face regimen.</li>
            <li> It is very product more than i expected.</li>
            <li> I went on another site and purchased Reviva Labs Hyaluronic Acid Serum and just used it one time and WOW!!!</li>
            <li> works better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands of hyaluronic acid over two years (cosmedica, Oz, skin beauty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my original brand.</li>
            <li> and I always look and feel older than I really am.</li>
            <li> I have new skin!</li>
            <li> When I tried this particular HA product, I was in awe.</li>
            <li> I do have to say, My skin was soft, and for those that wear make-up this is light enough to wear under your cosmetics..</li>
            <li> Check out my video of what I liked and disliked so far.. #TQR</li>
            <li> It is OK for the low price with such quality.</li>
            <li> I am a woman who is getting older each day that passes.</li>
            <li> So many of these reviewers have only reviewed a total of 2 products.</li>
            <li> I bought it to minimize the lines on my upper lip, which it has done tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Water&#x27;s the main ingredient, and that&#x27;s what it feels like.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of months and felt like it was doing some good until I noticed little spots of grey mold in the dropper.  </li>
            <li> My 34 year old daughter wants to know why I don&#x27;t need cover up anymore.  </li>
            <li> Within just a few days, my skin felt more hydrated than ever before.</li>
            <li> Hyaluroic acid is normally found in the body.</li>
            <li> However, after a few trial runs with the hyaluronic acid, I gladly made an exception.</li>
            <li> I am pretty blessed with not a whole lot of blemishes or wrinkles, but this product made my face feel fresh</li>
            <li> HA is the little &#x27;magic&#x27; ingredient found all the fancy new products on the market.  </li>
            <li> Use on clean, dry skin, apply liberally to face, neck, decolletage, hands; let it dry - it is quick.</li>
            <li> is a new product for me</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t be soon that I will be looking for that new bottle.  </li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t take very much to cover your entire face...</li>
            <li> So use it early on!</li>
            <li> Just wow effect!</li>
            <li> Only on my first order, seems to do well on my skin.</li>
            <li> But what others said about the positive reviewers is totally true, it is very strange that all of them have a history of only 2 reviews that were positive and on the same</li>
            <li> The majority of the review names are in all CAPS, and use many exclamation points and review only one other product, completely unrelated to the beauty industry (thank you L. Kirby for review).</li>
            <li> Exfoliating is the most important though, to get those old dead skin cells off prior to applying your facial creams,so that your treating the fresh new skin,and not the old dead skin.</li>
            <li> Then I use this hyaluronic acid serum first,then i use my eye cream, then i use regenerist micro- sculpting cream,letting each dry before applying the next.i am 43 and have spent many years out in the sun  </li>
            <li> MAkes my skin tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> But I ordered a large quantity and by the time I opened the last jar ......</li>
            <li> While nothing is going to make me look younger, this is certainly stopping my looks from aging.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this specific one from uVernal and give it a try, because it says it&#x27;s 100% Pure and natural.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve finding some of little white bumps that I haven&#x27;t seen in many years.</li>
            <li> It feels like the pure aloe vera gel, a little gluey, but not too sticky, so it feels very nice on your skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the best hyaluronic acid I&#x27;ve tried; the other two products I used, seemed to be &#x27;watered down&#x27;, but this solution is slightly &#x27;gummy&#x27; the smallest bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> so far I like the product.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin and makes it soft</li>
            <li> Leaving it feel really soft</li>
            <li> I encountered this product and was enticed by the fact that it is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The former items I purchased is much thicker than this one.</li>
            <li> This bottle is made from natural and vegan products.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> so far,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands and I really like this one.  </li>
            <li> My skin became so soft as a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I feel so young and my skin is beginning to repair itself with the help of this natural product.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re young and have oily/acne prone skin, give this a try.</li>
            <li> This is all i do to keep my skin looking young.</li>
            <li> This one is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> The others I&#x27;ve tried have had near the consistency of water.</li>
            <li> My skin really looked hydrated and my pores seemed to appear smaller.</li>
            <li> I did not expect miracle from this product, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> You only need about 3-4 drops for the whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and blemish free everyday.</li>
            <li> to harsh cleansers or physical exfoliation) and produces more oil to make up for the moisture it doesn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> but i can honestly say ive been told i look like im in mid to late 20s ,even without makeup.</li>
            <li> I am a ripe old broad, 65, and I KNOW that this stuff works!</li>
            <li> If my next bottle is like the first, it&#x27;s going back!</li>
            <li> when i use it i make sure to keep it open for as little time as possible to preserve the strength.</li>
            <li> It glides on nicely and leaves my skin feeling a little tight then the feeling melts away.</li>
            <li> It helps smooth out the small wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> but I do hope to see some improvement one day because I really have dry skin and since winter</li>
            <li> I look very much younger than my actual age, all thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> A little &#x27;wimpy&#x27; in strength and other products did better.</li>
            <li> How is it that this company can sell it at such a low cost and other customers are willing to buy the same product at a substantially higher price.</li>
            <li> I like it because it seems to work a little in spite of my old age, is absorbed quickly and a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any big improvements, but I don&#x27;t have any big problems either, just a few fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I just started using the product, and I already see the pores minimized, the skin softened, and a general glowing aspect of my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I definitely will be reordering when I get somewhere near the end of this bottle.  </li>
            <li> However, the second I think I am anywhere near the end...</li>
            <li> I use only natural products now.  </li>
            <li> Let me preface by saying that I&#x27;m a 22 year old female.</li>
            <li> Hands down and the company is first class too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly like other review said, they all made two reviews at the same day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used much better quality Hyaluronic acid products for the same price and this one was not nearly as potent as the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I noticed grey strands and dots suspended in the clear liquid.</li>
            <li> :  As I was into my 3rd bottle, the consistency suddenly turned from the lovely gel to a thin water feel.</li>
            <li> After a week of using my fine wrinkles around the eyes become a little less.</li>
            <li> My major concern is that it just shouldn&#x27;t be selling at such a low price.</li>
            <li> I applied it while my skin was still moist and let it dry completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two months with not much long lasting effects.</li>
            <li> , I have large pores, uneven skin.....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that it takes so little to do so much.</li>
            <li> ; It is soothing on the skin, but no more so than using pure aloe vera lotion (that you can get a large bottle of in any drug store at a fraction of the cost - it&#x27;s that green jelly like lotion found where the suntan products are).</li>
            <li> less red and flakey it feels very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I rub the acid gently all over and on my neck and let it dry, which only takes a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Hard to know if it really works,  but it couldn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling extra dry, red</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s dark, because I don&#x27;t like products that are in clear bottles, which can get damaged by the sun rays.  </li>
            <li> Due to the apparent deception in the marketing and a lack of sourcing data, I am cautious about further applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This bottle comes in 2oz that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I must add that this finish is also due to the exfoliation and cleansing of dead skin cells first.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not great either.</li>
            <li> This product does decrease tight dry delicate facial skin &amp; fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only been using the hyaluronic acid by uvernal for a little while now but have had no complaints so far with this .  </li>
            <li> However, they didn&#x27;t dry my skin and actually improved its appearance.</li>
            <li> First time using this product so not sure if it did what was expected</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops in with my daily face lotion and skin is soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> The consistency is not very thick, and feels watery with a little gel feel to it.</li>
            <li> Bummed that I don&#x27;t know how long I was applying a moldy product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived with some leaked out, but as long as it stays upright, no worries.</li>
            <li> I cannot say it works, also because I started using not too long ago, but I want to believe it does.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid when applied goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It does have a different texture than the other brand I was buying.  </li>
            <li> I opened the bottle and smelled THE most raunchy odor ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands.</li>
            <li> Sure wish they&#x27;d help me figure out what went wrong and replace this bottle!</li>
            <li> Granted I haven&#x27;t been using this for very long but my skin is already softer.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry because of the heat in size the house.</li>
            <li> If you do not see the percentage of actual active ingredient in a product, just assume you are being taken for a ride.</li>
            <li> my skin is looking younger and younger everyday and people are noticing.</li>
            <li> clean my face as usual and then apply a few drops of the hyaluronic acid, while my face is still a little damp.  </li>
            <li> It was hard not to be skeptical about the hyaluronic acid but after much convincing, I finally gave in.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I use Retin A and my skin gets very dry.</li>
            <li> But I wanted a little extra.  </li>
            <li> I was careful to always put drops into my palm and don&#x27;t think I touched the tip of the dropper to my hand in the process.  </li>
            <li> but I have only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I had been using similar products for a few of months before ordering this one and believe me when I tell you...</li>
            <li> With the other two serums I need only a few drops to cover my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Once you have lots of lines and sags, it is hard to notice the minor improvements that such products could offer.</li>
            <li> I used this through our recent, awful winter in the Northeast, and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this Hyaluronic Acid.  </li>
            <li> I use it day and night underneath my other stuff.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> I was using other Hyaluronic acid and thought I would try this.</li>
            <li> I have bought a ton of different brands of hyaluronic acid in the past 6 months for myself and as gifts.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from other products I had used.  </li>
            <li> Prompt service and received as expected!</li>
            <li> Think this is helped by the vitamin C than the other way around.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker, has a slight scent, and the cap is black instead of white.  </li>
            <li> Those positive reviews are just so weird.</li>
            <li> Not very pleasant for a facial product!</li>
            <li> the liquid turned a dark brown/black towards the end.</li>
            <li> i like that it is sold in a dark bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going down the sink.</li>
            <li> I mean my prior purchase with another brand</li>
            <li> But now, even other people have started noticing too!</li>
            <li> Half way through the bottle I noticed gray clumps.</li>
            <li> The dropper is now black</li>
            <li> It tightens up the face though I&#x27;m not too keen on the slight scent that does diminish when it dries.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s odd.</li>
            <li> because after owning this product for less than a week I  noticed mold or something  growing inside the dropper.</li>
            <li> It should be applied on a slightly damp face.  </li>
            <li> After making some changes to my skin care routine and adding hyaluronic acid, my skin is softer, plumper, and a lot less oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed by that and wrote Uvernal, but have not heard back from them in over 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> For someone who already has a regimen intact, I didn’t wanna mess with my routine.</li>
            <li> Lousy product doesn&#x27;t begin to live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> It has diminished dark pigment.!,</li>
            <li> I have had a very hard time finding something that would hydrate my skin and last.</li>
            <li> I noticed green crud in the dropper&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My face has been showing a few lines here and there.</li>
            <li> Arrived within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> No improvement in in skin after a few months use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product but a few times just once a day</li>
            <li> (Waste of money....</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll keep using to find out for sure--only been using a few weeks.</li>
            <li> All this product does is temporarily form a thin film on the skin, which initially looks wrinkly and which makes the skin taut.</li>
            <li> A few weeks into my use, I have never been happier.</li>
            <li> the dropper is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I had low expectations due to all the other disappointing products that I have tried before.</li>
            <li> i will see a dramatic changes in my overall looks!</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other formulas, but they  had other ingredients, made my face break out, and I was not happy.  </li>
            <li> I had to use very little of this product to make the effects seem workable.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is doing anything for my skin</li>
            <li> pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has struggled with skin issues in the past.</li>
            <li> Comes with a 60 day money back guarantee on the box so you cant go wrong trying this</li>
            <li> I could buy another bottle, but I am not sure if this product works for me....</li>
            <li> i seen a small amount of difference in my face..but hoping in weeks to come will..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product is absolutely worthless - question the positive reviews !</li>
            <li> Not very good looks an feels like water</li>
            <li> Hard to say what I think of this.</li>
            <li> I just find it hard to believe that this product is selling @</li>
            <li> I got on to check the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> at least I know what I am getting there.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> Not worth postage to return.don&#x27;t order could be dangerous product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worse.</li>
            <li> Then his self confidence was gone and he was a broken man by the time he was 50.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell on Google search, there is no product line, just the one product that is easily confused with Vernal HA serum, except for the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As much as I hate to admit it, I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and not as thick or hydrating as other brands.</li>
            <li> Now I don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars on expensive procedures.</li>
            <li> I get sad because I get all these lines</li>
            <li> I tried to return it to Amazon and since it&#x27;s a third party seller I&#x27;m stuck with this nasty bottle!  </li>
            <li> FAKE REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> The lines are still there, don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> This is the second of three hyaluronic acid serums I&#x27;ve used, and it is the worst.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have become a bit desperate when it comes to trying out “age-defying” products.</li>
            <li> I was getting desperate.</li>
            <li> It stinks.</li>
            <li> It is a real game changer.</li>
            <li> i mean HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to use something that smells bad.</li>
            <li> I use this product after I wash my face and before I apply moisturizer, I have really bad acne scaring and discoloration</li>
            <li> Dishonest brand!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received two bottles of this stuff and it stinks!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and returned.</li>
            <li> DISGUSTING.  </li>
            <li> All it did was break me out something horrible.</li>
            <li> When i say horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This serum is very luxurious feeling and feels great on my face. Hard to know if it really works,  but it couldn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great product.  Shipping and receiving were good</li>
            <li> Not convinced.....the liquid turned a dark brown/black towards the end. Perhaps the dropper was corroding? Not very pleasant for a facial product!</li>
            <li> This is just what the doctor ordered. My wife is a doctor and ordered me to get it. All kidding aside, this is a great product to help you prevent a chemical peel treatment. It is gentle but effective and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After daily use for several months, I think I see a difference.</li>
            <li> A huge bottle of the stuff. It glides on nicely and leaves my skin feeling a little tight then the feeling melts away. I&#x27;m hopeful for good results.</li>
            <li> Nothing else smoothed out my eyelids. I was getting desperate. Love this product over my moisturizer! Immediate results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks and I think I am beginning to see a difference. I&#x27;ll keep it up!</li>
            <li> This item may work well in some applications and for some people, but after using it for awhile, I didn&#x27;t notice any changes to the brown spots on my hands or face  that I was trying to reduce.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked - great product that slows down the creation of more wrinkles and love that it&#x27;s 2 oz. at a good price!</li>
            <li> works better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> Lightens age spots and I&#x27;m almost sure the &amp;#34;Turkey wattle&amp;#34; is firming.  Have been using for 3 weeks and plan to continue through the winter with a Vitamin C serum chaser after each application.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, excellent price. It really does reverse aging. Use on clean, dry skin, apply liberally to face, neck, decolletage, hands; let it dry - it is quick. Then apply moisturizer. Doing this twice a day will produce quick results. I have been using this product for over a year - it contributes to my looking a lot younger than my chronological age.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works well for me. Ordering and shipping has not been a problem at all.</li>
            <li> This product is just alright. I&#x27;ve used much better quality Hyaluronic acid products for the same price and this one was not nearly as potent as the other brands I&#x27;ve tried. It basically has the same affect as using aloe on your skin. I&#x27;ll be switching back.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product.  Nice clear appearance with a good consistency; not too watery.  Goes on easily, leaving a light non greasy layer on my skin that gives it a glow and firmness.  Need to update later after I&#x27;ve had time to experience the results over a period of time.</li>
            <li> Really good at tightening the skin in your face right before bed. I like putting it around my eyes a bit. I use it every night and haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful. By the second day I notices my skin fuller, more hydrated and shiny!! It is a must!!</li>
            <li> I have to say, I can&#x27;t tell if this is helping my face or not.  It does have a different texture than the other brand I was buying.  It feels more like watery gel.  Not oily or anything but I do hope to see some improvement one day because I really have dry skin and since winter is here it&#x27;s worse.</li>
            <li> Returned from a weeks vacation, pulled bottle out of my cabinet to use it.  Out came mold.</li>
            <li> This seems to work ok, but maybe it is all in my head. Once you have lots of lines and sags, it is hard to notice the minor improvements that such products could offer. So use it early on!</li>
            <li> I bought this. I loved the effect. My skin looked great. Half way through the bottle I noticed gray clumps. I poured it into a glass and found clumps of gray phlegm looking stuff. (Photo.) I&#x27;m bummed. It&#x27;s going down the sink. I&#x27;m getting another brand.</li>
            <li> Very nice on skin. I am 53.  When applied, while skin skin moist, helps to maintain pump and moist feeling. I put it on right after cleansing face but before drying. I still apply sun screen over top to protect my skin.</li>
            <li> I just started using the product, and I already see the pores minimized, the skin softened, and a general glowing aspect of my face.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t use this formula before. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in three months of continued use.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement as of yet....still hoping</li>
            <li> Omigoodness.  No need to buy the stuff with the $$$ price tags.  Add this to whatever product you use.  It works, it really works!</li>
            <li> I  like the texture of this syrum.  Not sure if it is doing anything for my skin quite yet it&#x27;s only been a week that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Skin feels nice and tight after cleaning then applying as directed. Leaves your skin feeling soft. I apply to my face.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Not very good looks an feels like water</li>
            <li> If you do not see the percentage of actual active ingredient in a product, just assume you are being taken for a ride. The exact percentage should be stated otherwise it&#x27;s no good. Just buy the powder - it&#x27;s not expensive and mix with water yourself</li>
            <li> 2 weeks of use and you will see a noticeable difference! I use this and PONDS day and night :))) very pleased!</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping and so far I like the product. Skin has definitely felt more hydrated in these drying winter months.</li>
            <li> almost done i will place in order again</li>
            <li> I am not doubting that this product works, however, I have not seen any noticeable results.  I plan to discontinue its use.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after having a facial chemical peel by my nurse practitioner.  She recommended it and vitamin c serum.  I have had amazing results and will continue to use it for life.  Thanks for a great product.  Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> no odor and seems to make lines disappear.</li>
            <li> I use this weekly and it works well vs. paying a esthetician for the service.  A little &#x27;wimpy&#x27; in strength and other products did better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I use it daily and believe it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!  Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Love it works great, my husband commented that I look better, younger or some how prettier LOL. So I think it must be doing something.</li>
            <li> Great product, have used many and this is the best by far however I wish the top screwed on better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 6 months now, I&#x27;ve noticed no changes. No improvements. I&#x27;m only 30 years old,I&#x27;ve  not been a Sun worshiper. I only have fine lines, and it made no difference on those.</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff for my skin. Yesterday I ran errands all day and three different strangers stopped me to tell me how beautiful my skin looked! I am a ripe old broad, 65, and I KNOW that this stuff works! After applying, you need to seal it in with a good moisturizer. That is all.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far. It goes on smooth and I feel like my moisturizer goes on smoother because of it. I have only used it for a week so I don&#x27;t really notice a huge difference with my skin yet. I did notice that it smells a bit when you first put it on. A bit like singed hair. However the smell goes away as soon as it soaks into your skin.</li>
            <li> The product is very good. I noticed a difference in my skin right away. I am very pleased with it. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> Really love this. I use it day and night underneath my other stuff. Keeps my skin hydrated and I am noticing my wrinkles around my eyes has softened.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and not as thick or hydrating as other brands.</li>
            <li> First time using this product so not sure if it did what was expected but it did hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> People compliment my skin.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful for the hyaluronic acid because I can feel the effects straight away. Now I don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars on expensive procedures. All I need is this product and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think this product works as good as they say it does.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and wrinkles. I have had a very hard time finding something that would hydrate my skin and last. My daughter was told by a skin care specialist she met in class that I should get hyaluronic acid.  I checked amazon and this was the highest rated formula. I have new skin! It has made my face softer, softened the wrinkles and the leftover I massage into my hands and they look and feel better too! I highly recommend this for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Hard to say what I think of this. I used it for a couple of months and felt like it was doing some good until I noticed little spots of grey mold in the dropper.  I poured out the rest of the bottle and found more floating mold.  Gross.  I was careful to always put drops into my palm and don&#x27;t think I touched the tip of the dropper to my hand in the process.  Bummed that I don&#x27;t know how long I was applying a moldy product.</li>
            <li> Like this product and can use a moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> I just received two bottles of this stuff and it stinks! I&#x27;m not going to use something that smells bad.</li>
            <li> I noticed grey strands and dots suspended in the clear liquid. Looks like the batch is contaminated.will not repurchase. I have tried many other brands of hyaluronic acid over two years (cosmedica, Oz, skin beauty solutions)- none have had this issue.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes your skin smooth and holds in moisture. I use this under my daily lotion and follow that with a primer with spf.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had enough time to fully test it, but so far it&#x27;s been a good product.</li>
            <li> I like the product except it has alcohol in it in addition to the Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;jury is still out&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin except cause bumps to appear on my skin. Lousy product doesn&#x27;t begin to live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. I use this under my moisturizer/ spf every morning. It&#x27;s very lightweight and is absorbed almost immediately. I think it has helped to even my skin and keep blemishes at bay.</li>
            <li> I like it, no miracles but gives a smooth feel.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this again!!</li>
            <li> okay I thought I loved this product but after using it for a week or so....I noticed green crud in the dropper&lt;br /&gt;I held the bottle to the light and seen bits of mold floating in the bottle and it was in the dropper as well.&lt;br /&gt;will not buy it again it was not that way when it arrived.  pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I only use this and Vitamin C cream now great price and great results.  Every ask&#x27;s what do you use.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I had a chance to purchase this Hyaluronic Acid for a great price on a promotion and Im so glad I did. I love that its made here in the USA. Ive always had skin issues and within a few weeks of using this product it has really cleared up my blemishes and has made my skin feel and look tighter. I would recommend this to anyone who has struggled with skin issues in the past.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of acid, I am delighted with it! I advise it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid is the perfect anti-aging solution. My face has been showing a few lines here and there. Not to mention the dark circles around my eyes are becoming more evident. With the help of the product, my face is slowly starting to look younger. Affordable yet effective!</li>
            <li> Amazing is the word I will use to describe this product. I had low expectations due to all the other disappointing products that I have tried before. When I tried this particular HA product, I was in awe. My face feels very moisturized and I can see the shine that I didn’t have before.</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid has done wonders for my skin! It is very easy to apply and can take effect within minutes of application. I love it and I am now a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny I paid for! It helps prevent my skin from sagging and my face just becomes more toned.</li>
            <li> This seems to be very good.</li>
            <li> As much as I hate to admit it, I have very dry skin. Thus, I always feel the need to moisturize it, especially my face. I get sad because I get all these lines and I always look and feel older than I really am. But after going through several products, I got to try hyaluronic acid. Within just a few days, my skin felt more hydrated than ever before. Not to sound overdramatic, but this product is a miracle!</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and saw no difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Has made my skin soft, smooth, more even toned, and it has diminished the appearance of my pores! It has only been about 2 weeks. QUICK ship!</li>
            <li> Using hyaluronic acid has been one of the best decisions I made in a while. I love the feeling I get after applying it. My face is visibly better-looking and feels very smooth and healthy. Two thumbs up for this excellent product!</li>
            <li> after a month I see no difference</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a nice acid. It moisturizes my skin and makes it soft</li>
            <li> Love this Stuff, Its Excellent!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;This is a new product for me so I can&#x27;t tell you how well it works yet.</li>
            <li> Zero Results. Save your money for the real thing!</li>
            <li> It stinks. It has a musty smell. I got on to check the negative reviews. I saw the mention of mold.  So I inspected my bottle. The dropper is now black so you wouldn&#x27;t see mold easily and the bottle is blue. But I held it up to a light and low and behold there were floaters!!!! I maneuvered the dropper to suction one of the floaters and release it on the stainless steel stopper in my sink. IT WAS MOLD!!!  I have been putting MOLD on my face!!! DISGUSTING.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:72015539a068a766e99c4d4a0e6d68ef]]I was lucky to be able to test this product out but I do think its way too soon to tell if there&#x27;s a HUGE difference but I&#x27;ll continue to use it daily. I was even luckier that it was discounted just so that I can try it out and give my unbiased and honest opinion.  I do have to say, My skin was soft, and for those that wear make-up this is light enough to wear under your cosmetics.. As for me, I&#x27;ll come back and update when I&#x27;m finished with the bottle..  Check out my video of what I liked and disliked so far.. #TQR</li>
            <li> The first bottle was like water, wasn&#x27;t sure if this was what it was supposed to be like.  The second one was more gelatinous.  If my next bottle is like the first, it&#x27;s going back!</li>
            <li> Used with a moisturizer, keeps skin supply and glowing.</li>
            <li> thank you for making this available at a reasonable price.  this is what works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior, so I don&#x27;t know how younger buyers might feel, but my skin does have a nice and healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference except for my chest...smoothed out the wrinkles..</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for 3 days - but I have lost a lot of weight and hope this will help the wrinkles that I have acquired lately.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 85 going on 70 :) so Let&#x27;s hope it works well!!</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t do much for me. Feels okay going on, but that&#x27;s about it. The consistency is not very thick, and feels watery with a little gel feel to it. Label on product packaging has misspellings and grammatical errors, which leads me to believe the product is not made in USA. No improvement in in skin after a few months use.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product so I haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet, but I love the way it just soaks in to your skin. Leaving it feel really soft</li>
            <li> Not as good as some I have tried . Did not penetrate as well !</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really helps to keep your skin flawless and glowing. It works great.</li>
            <li> I am glad I was able to test this product for my unbiased opinion! This stuff works well and prevents fine lines and wrinkles! A little bit goes a long ways! It feels nice on the skin and is not greasy at all..so big plus for those will oily skin! This skin works well to stop my skin from looking so baggy and saggy in my neck area! I will not go without it!</li>
            <li> After reading about the benefits of hyaluronic acid, I immediately looked for a variety that has good feedback. I encountered this product and was enticed by the fact that it is made from natural ingredients. Whenever I use it, I instantly feel the effects without worrying about any side effects from chemicals. So happy with the product!</li>
            <li> Having read about hyaluronic acid, I was scared at first. I thought, because of the name, that it is chemical and could bring about possible side effects. Enter uVernal, I was glad to know it was made from safe ingredients. After trying it, my face felt healthier and firmer. Definitely a must try.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, it helps make my skin smoothe and clear.  I definitely will be reordering when I get somewhere near the end of this bottle.  However it doesn&#x27;t take very much to cover your entire face...so it won&#x27;t be soon that I will be looking for that new bottle.  However, the second I think I am anywhere near the end...you can count on me ordering!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping time</li>
            <li> It is OK for the low price with such quality. I mean my prior purchase with another brand (Sorry, don&#x27;t remember the name) is much better than this one. This one is almost water like and I don&#x27;t know if it still contains the same good stuffs. The former items I purchased is much thicker than this one.</li>
            <li> Makes the face look and feel smoother very quickly.</li>
            <li> Just wow effect! I love this product for skin care.</li>
            <li> It tightens up the face though I&#x27;m not too keen on the slight scent that does diminish when it dries.  YOU HAVE TO APPLY some face cream.  This is meant to be used underneath your face cream.</li>
            <li> Thanks the product is exactly as described. Delivered in time requested.</li>
            <li> Hyaluroic acid for skin is a great product to use and always have at home. This bottle comes in 2oz that will last you a long time. No need to use a lot. There are many benefits into jawing hyaluroic acid.  As we get old we start loosing the baby skin smooth wrinkle free skin. Hyaluroic acid is normally found in the body. This bottle is made from natural and vegan products. It is not tested on animals and it&#x27;s made in the USA.  Prevent wrinkles with this product. Smooth out your skin. This serum can also be use to help healing wounds, buns and sun burns. It moisturizes my skin and feels good. No bad smell and no sticky feeling.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion, that being said, sometimes I might give products the benefit of the doubt. Really how well can you expect a product to work unless you have 30 days, but this stuff worked right away. I put it around me eye and face and I could literally feel the product working.It has a pleasant smell and antiseptic type fell to it. I am becoming a bit of an advocate for mens&#x27; products and I saw my dad&#x27;s skin wrinkle and sag. Then his self confidence was gone and he was a broken man by the time he was 50. I will not let that happen to me.  I [[ASIN:B00LUA11EI Hyaluronic Acid for Skin - 100% Pure Hyaluronic acid - Anti aging formula (2 oz)]]wish I had discovered this product earlier in life.</li>
            <li> I use this product after I wash my face and before I apply moisturizer, I have really bad acne scaring and discoloration so I figured I would give hyaluronic acid a try after reading several reviews. I haven&#x27;t used the product but a few times just once a day and I have found the appearance of the scarring  is starting to fad. so far I am pleased with the results. I am excited to see the results after I have been using the product for a extended period of time.</li>
            <li> My skin has changed since I started using this acid. Excellent product. Quickly absorbed, perfectly moisturizes the skin, the skin becomes soft, and brighter. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a woman who is getting older each day that passes. Needless to say, I have become a bit desperate when it comes to trying out “age-defying” products. When I came across this hyaluronic acid, I read good reviews and tried it out for myself. I am so happy that I did, because I have been getting the results I want and more. I look very much younger than my actual age, all thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> This product is superb! In a matter of weeks, I legitimately saw and felt the difference in my skin. It has become silky smooth and much healthier than it was. Expect me to buy some more!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It feels so good when I put it on. It has a calming effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> So many of these reviewers have only reviewed a total of 2 products. This product included. That&#x27;s odd.</li>
            <li> Did do much after a month&#x27;s use.  Does not work for everybody, I guess.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid has made my face smoother and helped with fine lines when used regularly. A definite must have if these are your concerns, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The best product I ever had in my life!</li>
            <li> very good ,I like it !!</li>
            <li> love it soaks in good non greasy</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  Skin feels soft and silky.  Works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> Really makes skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin nice and have noticed a reduction in visible lines</li>
            <li> I like it because it seems to work a little in spite of my old age, is absorbed quickly and a small amount is needed. The price is good too</li>
            <li> A friend referred me to it and she was a bit unrelenting.  Now I know why.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I just find it hard to believe that this product is selling @ 2oz. at such a low price. You know the saying,  &amp;#34;If it sounds too good to be true....&amp;#34; It is soothing on the skin, but no more so than using pure aloe vera lotion (that you can get a large bottle of in any drug store at a fraction of the cost - it&#x27;s that green jelly like lotion found where the suntan products are). This has no &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; to it and I just had microdermabrasion so that is surprising. Also, it has that sort of stickiness on your hands that aloe vera also has.  My major concern is that it just shouldn&#x27;t be selling at such a low price. How is it that this company can sell it at such a low cost and other customers are willing to buy the same product at a substantially higher price. I tried it, it is soothing, but I just don&#x27;t feel right about it. Will not purchase again and will stick with the pure 20% Vitamin C serums - at least I know what I am getting there.</li>
            <li> delivery was fast and product was just what i saw on ebay</li>
            <li> This product does decrease tight dry delicate facial skin &amp; fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to really help &amp; heal sun crinkled skin!&lt;br /&gt;Use it in the Vit C Night Repair Serum I make.&lt;br /&gt;However the lid is defective &amp; doesn&#x27;t fully close.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived with some leaked out, but as long as it stays upright, no worries.</li>
            <li> Very good product....so far, but I have only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> Mold ?? Stopped using ....because after owning this product for less than a week I  noticed mold or something  growing inside the dropper. Inside of cap has brown substance growing also!</li>
            <li> VERY DRYING NEVER BUY IT AGAIN!!!!!</li>
            <li> Only on my first order, seems to do well on my skin. No odor.</li>
            <li> This product is very effective if used daily. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with results so far.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Have been using it for almost a year and I truly think it makes a difference. My last shipment contained one bottle that was watery. I returned it and got a refund with no problem. Will continue to buy this item for myself and as gifts for family.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was using other Hyaluronic acid and thought I would try this. I find this so drying that I stopped using it. I applied it while my skin was still moist and let it dry completely. I also bought two jars because of the good price and the reviews.</li>
            <li> This really works. I will be reordering again. Makes your skin very smooth</li>
            <li> Great skin care product. Really hydrates my skin and refreshes my face after a derma pen session. Love it!</li>
            <li> My skin is dry because of the heat in size the house. After using this product, no breakouts anymore. And I feel different of my skin dramatically.</li>
            <li> This is great, was delivered as promised. Bought before this is a repeat order. Love it .Will continue to order. Great service.</li>
            <li> The product is great!  But I ordered a large quantity and by the time I opened the last jar ......I broke open the seal pulled out the dropper and it&#x27;s filled with mold and brown slime.  Good thing I didn&#x27;t place this all over my face!  I tried to return it to Amazon and since it&#x27;s a third party seller I&#x27;m stuck with this nasty bottle!  (Waste of money....yay!)</li>
            <li> Face and neck are hydrated all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands and I really like this one.  My only issue is that the last bottle I ordered seems to be a slightly different formula.  It&#x27;s a little thicker, has a slight scent, and the cap is black instead of white.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with it, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> I have bought a ton of different brands of hyaluronic acid in the past 6 months for myself and as gifts. For the most part, they are all the same except the packaging. This one works great and has nice packaging to boot. I put it on at night and it goes on nice and smooth. This brand&#x27;s product does not leave a sticky residue like some of the cheaper and lower quality brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> It is easily applied and absorbed. I really like the result, just amazing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful acid!  I absolutely love it. My skin became so soft as a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> While nothing is going to make me look younger, this is certainly stopping my looks from aging.</li>
            <li> I find the product really effective, especially when included in my daily face regimen. My face has never felt clearer and healthier!</li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician, and I have never found a product that works likes this. I use Retin A and my skin gets very dry. This product worked the first night I used it. It makes my skin look hydrated and glowing, will be purchasing more for my clients who microderm to use after the microderm treatment. Do not want to be without it. This is honestly a &amp;#34;Holy Grail &amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> I am very upset with this product.  I had been buying a different brand and then bought this.  I think that the hyaluronic acid is way too low  to make this effective.  This is an inferior product.  I wrote to the vendor and no response.</li>
            <li> Do not know if it works, but makes my skin feel good. I use vitamin C cream with it</li>
            <li> I have owned a MedSpa and I am always looking for new, good facial products, particularly if they are inexpensive. The importance of HA cannot be overstated to making facial skin look and become years younger. Unfortunately, after purchasing the product, I realized that most of the reviews on this product are deceptive, as is the labeling. The majority of the review names are in all CAPS, and use many exclamation points and review only one other product, completely unrelated to the beauty industry (thank you L. Kirby for review). Additionally, this product is manufactured for &amp;#34;uVernal&amp;#34;, the with &amp;#34;u&amp;#34; unnoticeable because of the artwork, not &amp;#34;Vernal&amp;#34; HA serum, with a very similar HA product. The distributor has good reviews, but has only one other unrelated health product, and mostly iPhone accessories. Furthermore, the source of the HA is never revealed, whether from humans, animals or synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have made one application of the product, and it applied easily, but with a barely noticeable stinging sensation. Due to the apparent deception in the marketing and a lack of sourcing data, I am cautious about further applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be balanced, the product is well packaged and attractive, and the product applies easily, though slightly more liquid than similar HA products. The label was applied off-set, indicating hand application over machine. The price is extremely attractive. The word &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; is not used on the front label, but is used in the directions. This becomes significant when distinguishing products within a product line. From what I can tell on Google search, there is no product line, just the one product that is easily confused with Vernal HA serum, except for the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, you have a well packaged, inexpensive HA product without sourcing information and deceptive in marketing, labeling and in customer reviews. This says nothing about the integrity of the product itself, but in an age where sourcing is becoming extremely important, it breeds caution when making a purchasing decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope is that the distributor will update the product description with sourcing information and some of the science behind the product, and remove any and all customer reviews that appear to be created rather than experienced.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the hyaluronic acid by uvernal for a little while now but have had no complaints so far with this .  It seems to do a great job and seems to make my skin feel better and seems to keep my skin more moisturized and refreshed .  This comes in a nice 2oz bottle  and is made in the USA. Comes with a 60 day money back guarantee on the box so you cant go wrong trying this .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Granted I haven&#x27;t been using this for very long but my skin is already softer. I can&#x27;t believe that it takes so little to do so much.</li>
            <li> I opened the bottle and smelled THE most raunchy odor ever!</li>
            <li> Wow, this makes my skin look so good!  Can tell a difference after only a couple of days.  I&#x27;m using it under my vitamin C during the day and over my retin A at night.  I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin but when someone heard I was 52 yesterday they almost fell out of their chair!  They were going to guess 38!!!  I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I mix a few drops in with my daily face lotion and skin is soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> This is very nice and makes my skin look and feel very nice.  I think Hyaluronic Acid is great for my skin.  It helps smooth out the small wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> I cannot say it works, also because I started using not too long ago, but I want to believe it does. Maybe that&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> great product, I use it before I put on my moisturizer.  It is very hydrating!  will order more</li>
            <li> Love it. Work overnight so my skin gets affected. This helps a lot thanks.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other formulas, but they  had other ingredients, made my face break out, and I was not happy.  I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and really see a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I am looking to buy a Hyaluronic Acid because I am about to finish mine. Thinking about trying different brand even though the one I am using is pretty good. Browsing through this brand. Those positive reviews are just so weird. Exactly like other review said, they all made two reviews at the same day. FAKE REVIEWS. Dishonest brand!!!!</li>
            <li> Product contaminated upon opening.clumps of slimy moldy substance all through liquid.foul odor. Couldn&#x27;t use. Wont order again. Not worth postage to return.don&#x27;t order could be dangerous product.</li>
            <li> Have a subscription to this product. It retains the  moisture in my face I have lost over the years. This product is great!</li>
            <li> I now feel armed for the battle of aging....everyone has to.  I am going to fight it every step of the way.  I never got a chance in the past to have beautiful clear glowing skin ( was riddled with acne from 15-49).  Never a day with a smear of gloss on my lips and a bit of mascara, until now.  I feel so young and my skin is beginning to repair itself with the help of this natural product.  I use only natural products now.  It works and I am confident it will work for you too.  I use 6 drops twice a day on my face all over and up my neck under my chin.  Any left over goes on the tops of my hands.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but I do have some, I have large pores, uneven skin.....those issues are resolving themselves. The price is great and this company is fantastic.  To be fair I used three different companies and different strengths of Hyaluronic acid, this one is supreme.  Winner.  Hands down and the company is first class too.</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t tell that this product has made any difference in my skin, may work well for some.</li>
            <li> I understand that my time period to return your product has expired, nevertheless, I am letting you know that when I tried to use your product, the dropper was blackish and the liquid totally slimish. I will not buy it again and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Pretty good--dnt really know if any better than coconut oil--but I&#x27;ll keep using to find out for sure--only been using a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Wish this worked for me. All it did was break me out something horrible. When i say horrible i mean HORRIBLE. I was getting bumps in places I&#x27;ve never had them before. Unfortunate because most people seem to like this. Ive used other brands of hyaluronic acid with no problems and great results.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed and skin seems moister.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews for this product. All this product does is temporarily form a thin film on the skin, which initially looks wrinkly and which makes the skin taut. Once it&#x27;s washed off, the skin is just as it was prior to using the product. In fact, with the Hyaluronic Acid film on my skin, my skin appears drier than it does with a good lotion. Even when I follow the instructions which are to apply it when your skin is still damp or moist after showering or cleansing my face. It does not appear to seal in the moisture. I don&#x27;t believe this product becomes absorbed by the skin - I see no evidence that it improves the condition of skin over time or that it makes skin appear more youthful.</li>
            <li> Very drying. No change in skin</li>
            <li> Just received the serum.  I thought it would be thicker, very watery.  Too soon to tell if will deliver all that it says it will.</li>
            <li> Great product--so much bang for the buck!  I&#x27;m a 68 year old RN and find that it evens out my very sun damaged skin tone, feels good on my face, and is not grossly overpriced as most cosmetics are. Looking forward to continuing this nighttime skin routine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Exactly as described.  Thank you.  Seems to have absolutely cured my acne.</li>
            <li> Did not see any changes.  Stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before but this Hyaluronic Acid did NOT do anything for my skin.  I used it faithfully for several weeks and there is no difference. I went on another site and purchased Reviva Labs Hyaluronic Acid Serum and just used it one time and WOW!!! All I can say is there is a HUGH difference. Just 1 time and I see results!!!!!</li>
            <li> WILL BUY MORE !! PERFECT ALL  THE WAY!!</li>
            <li> I really like Hyaluronic Acid, I use it everyday. It honestly makes my skin feel softer. It&#x27;s a good product that I will continue to use. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I used up the whole bottle.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from other products I had used.  It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not great either. I could buy another bottle, but I am not sure if this product works for me....</li>
            <li> It was hard not to be skeptical about the hyaluronic acid but after much convincing, I finally gave in. I definitely don’t regret that decision now. I loved the results that HA produced!</li>
            <li> I love this and combine it with vit C serum. It has diminished dark pigment.!,</li>
            <li> Not so good. It caused me light acne.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have recommended this product to friends!  It takes a bit longer to see the effects but it does made a noticeable difference in my skin.  It should be applied on a slightly damp face.  I can see a tightening and nice toning of my skin.  Yes, I am on my second bottle now and I am looking forward to seeing more results the more I use this product.  Another benefit for me is that I can use it close to my eyes with irritation.</li>
            <li> It is like water.  I was expecting a serum-like fluid but this one has not done anything good for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to purchase 100 % the pure real deal, and decide for myself how little or how much without getting everything else. I like to combine this hyaluronic acid with my retin-A and a dab of my favorite face cream in the palm of my hands, rubbing them together and gently applying it to my face every night.  My skin is so soft and blemish free everyday. I had never used this brand before. But I will continue.</li>
            <li> After much persuasion from my bestfriend, I reluctantly gave in and tried this product. For someone who already has a regimen intact, I didn’t wanna mess with my routine. However, after a few trial runs with the hyaluronic acid, I gladly made an exception. It is very effective and makes the skin in my face be really plump and soft. It also gives me a glow that I didn’t have before. Now, I thank my best friend every day for introducing me to this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who swore by this product so I decided to give it a shot. A few weeks into my use, I have never been happier. It is better than my old moisturizer because of the consistency and lack of oily build up. The use of all-natural ingredients is definitely a bonus as well. Overall, I highly recommend it to the ladies out there who want to feel more beautiful.</li>
            <li> thank you, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles are not very big on my lists of concerns or worries, but I also dont want to wait to do something until I need to. I am pretty blessed with not a whole lot of blemishes or wrinkles, but this product made my face feel fresh and my moisturizer seems to sink deeper into my skin. I feel like my skin is smoother and fresher feeling, Almost youthful feeling. I had to use very little of this product to make the effects seem workable. It has a great dropper to dispense just the right amount of product. The scent is not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;*I was given a discount or free offer for my true and unbiased opinion of this product*</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Feels like silk when you first put it on your face, then once the skin soaks up the silkiness, I put on a nice moisturizer and Vitamin &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; Serum.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am using this on my facial lines and wrinkles, before using the moisturizing cream, night and morning.  Many cremes for the skin include this ingredient in the recipe.  But I wanted a little extra.  I am 81 and not asking for a miracle.  Hyaluronic acid when applied goes a long way.  I have been merely touching the eye-drop applicator and I get enough on my finger for my use.  I believe it is softening my lines and wrinkles.  It does not burn or make my skin red.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, especially my feet.</li>
            <li> Let me preface by saying that I&#x27;m a 22 year old female. If you&#x27;re young and have oily/acne prone skin, give this a try. Sometimes skin is actually dehydrated(due to harsh cleansers or physical exfoliation) and produces more oil to make up for the moisture it doesn&#x27;t have. My skin was like this. After making some changes to my skin care routine and adding hyaluronic acid, my skin is softer, plumper, and a lot less oily. It is a real game changer. After waiting for my BHA to take affect, I then pat some water onto my face and neck and then apply the acid. Follow up with a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.Excellent product. Smooth on the skin, easy to apply.  I have been using it for a week and I believe I already see a difference on my face.</li>
            <li> Love it! My skin already looks better after using it for only 3 days!</li>
            <li> Bought one bottle LOVED it so much ordered another as not to run out---second bottle was as if someone just placed regular tap water in the bottle.  The viscosity was off and it just wasn&#x27;t a superior product---I will give the company and the product one more chance and order another bottle in the hopes that quality control was just off on that lot/batch I received...Stay tuned!</li>
            <li> Every since ive been useing hyaluronic acid serum, ive noticed a difference!!! Ive used many different brands,but this is my favorite so far.morning and night i wash my face,and gently exfoliate. Then I use this hyaluronic acid serum first,then i use my eye cream, then i use regenerist micro- sculpting cream,letting each dry before applying the next.i am 43 and have spent many years out in the sun  but i can honestly say ive been told i look like im in mid to late 20s ,even without makeup. This is all i do to keep my skin looking young. Exfoliating is the most important though, to get those old dead skin cells off prior to applying your facial creams,so that your treating the fresh new skin,and not the old dead skin. Im gonna keep buying this brand,and continue with what is and has always worked for me. It will heal and transform your skin, but it wont happen over night. It takes time to get our wrinkles,and will take time to make them go away. Keep using this serum,and you will definitely not regreat it!!!</li>
            <li> Although not as much as you may hope, it does seem to offer some benefit for ageing skin. It does provide a unique softness and  does  smooth out minor wrinkles. However, if your looking for the fountain of youth, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands. This one is my least favorite. It leaves my skin feeling extra dry, red and I&#x27;ve finding some of little white bumps that I haven&#x27;t seen in many years. It&#x27;s thicker, kind of gooey, which I liked at first, but this is a &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; that has nothing to do with performance. I&#x27;m not a chemist or cosmetologist, so I don&#x27;t know what makes the texture different, but it makes it more convenient. The others I&#x27;ve tried have had near the consistency of water. However, they didn&#x27;t dry my skin and actually improved its appearance.</li>
            <li> This is the best hyaluronic acid I&#x27;ve tried; the other two products I used, seemed to be &#x27;watered down&#x27;, but this solution is slightly &#x27;gummy&#x27; the smallest bit goes a long way.  I use it under my moisturizer, then my foundation, I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skins texture.</li>
            <li> Great results!  People think I am much younger looking than my age.</li>
            <li> The best thing that I noticed from using the Vernal Hyaluronic Pure Acid is that my skin did not appear to sag as much. It just left my skin smoother and clearer and just all over healthier skin tone. My skin really looked hydrated and my pores seemed to appear smaller. Just an overall nice healthy look to my skin and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review of the product. The opinions of the product are based on my experience with and use of the product.</li>
            <li> Saw a mold particle on my 2nd use. Very disappointed and returned.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t reduce redness as advertised, but I think it makes my skin seem softer(?)</li>
            <li> This product worked reallly well for me. I noticed a big change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Great. Places nice plumping back into skin &amp; creates nice moisture in skin.</li>
            <li> My best friend gave me this acid. I did not expect miracle from this product, but I was pleasantly surprised. After a week of using my fine wrinkles around the eyes become a little less. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> My mother noticed that I began to look better, healthier and fresher. All this thanks to the acid. Excellent tool for skin moisturizing, skin is visibly improved.</li>
            <li> This product has given me a more youthful look. At first, I thought I was just imagining the results. But now, even other people have started noticing too!</li>
            <li> This product has really moisturized my face, even more effective than actual moisturizers that I have used in the past. Kudos to the manufacturers!</li>
            <li> Very hydrating. Always feels like my skin drank water. Love the consistency. Will buy again and hoping to find with Vit C.</li>
            <li> It is very product more than i expected.Good quality and good prize</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a chance to work, so didn&#x27;t post til now.  I had been using similar products for a few of months before ordering this one and believe me when I tell you...this one is much better!  I bought it to minimize the lines on my upper lip, which it has done tremendously.  The lines are still there, don&#x27;t get me wrong...50 years of smoking have made their mark...but the are not nearly as deep and not as noticeable.  I use this on the lip area, also on the area below my eyebrow and then all over my face and it feels like an instant, refreshing mini face lift!  This is the third product I have tried in the past six months and this, by far, is the best!  Quick shipping too - A+ product, price, and service  in my book!</li>
            <li> Great value for the money</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for under my regular moisturizer. I used this through our recent, awful winter in the Northeast, and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 mos.  Its great.  My 34 year old daughter wants to know why I don&#x27;t need cover up anymore.  It literally got rid of my forehead lines and frown lines.  It does what it promises to do.  Also, it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> After months of using this product, I can say with confidence that it is of top quality. The consistency is perfect and the results are undeniable. My skin has become softer and my wrinkles have disappeared.</li>
            <li> The uVernal hyaluronic acid is a great product. Every time I use it, my skin just glows! I am very much happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Prompt service and received as expected! Will be buying additional bottles.</li>
            <li> This is the first Hyaluronic Acid I have tried.  I decided to purchase this specific one from uVernal and give it a try, because it says it&#x27;s 100% Pure and natural.  It&#x27;s Paraben free and fragrance free, which is a big plus in my book. Oh, and it&#x27;s made in the US and I&#x27;m all for supporting US manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a week, twice a day.  In the morning right after I wake up and at night just before bed time.&lt;br /&gt;I clean my face as usual and then apply a few drops of the hyaluronic acid, while my face is still a little damp.  I rub the acid gently all over and on my neck and let it dry, which only takes a few seconds.  After that, I apply my moisturizer and sunscreen (at daytime).&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I love the blue bottle.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s dark, because I don&#x27;t like products that are in clear bottles, which can get damaged by the sun rays.  Secondly, I find the dropper very handy, since you can control the quantity and use exactly as much as you want.  A little goes a long way with this Hyaluronic Acid.  You only need about 3-4 drops for the whole face and neck.  It has no smell, which is a good thing, as I cannot stand anything with a scent on my face.  It&#x27;s consistency is gel-like.  It feels like the pure aloe vera gel, a little gluey, but not too sticky, so it feels very nice on your skin.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any big improvements, but I don&#x27;t have any big problems either, just a few fine lines.  I also did not expect them to be gone by using the Hyaluronic Acid for just a week.  I&#x27;ll keep applying it and see what happens.  The good thing is, it makes my skin feel so much smoother and not itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Think this is helped by the vitamin C than the other way around.  I spilled the vitamin C and had to use this alone.  It did not do the same job as when I only had the vitamin C alone.</li>
            <li> i have been using Hyaluronic Acid for a couple of week.... i seen a small amount of difference in my face..but hoping in weeks to come will.. i will see a dramatic changes in my overall looks!</li>
            <li> a bit watery. like glue not like jelly</li>
            <li> i like that it is sold in a dark bottle.  when i use it i make sure to keep it open for as little time as possible to preserve the strength.</li>
            <li> I like the texture of the serum, it&#x60;s working fine.</li>
            <li> Tried several Hyaluronic Acid serums and this is my favorite!!!  I also purchased the Vitamin A cream to use with it!!!</li>
            <li> I will update on the product. But what others said about the positive reviewers is totally true, it is very strange that all of them have a history of only 2 reviews that were positive and on the same day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is absolutely worthless - question the positive reviews !</li>
            <li> Is the first time I&#x27;m gonna use this product...people say it&#x27;s good.. so let&#x27;s check it out!! :D</li>
            <li> Feels great on my very dry skin.  Seems to be providing great hydration.  My face looks less red and flakey it feels very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two months with not much long lasting effects. I&#x27;m going back to my original brand. I was noticing a change and when I started using this product, I noticed that the results are not the same.</li>
            <li> I can feel it tighten my skin after i put it on. my skin is looking younger and younger everyday and people are noticing. and i am only 30 yo so that should say something. I was a sun goddess in my teens as i played college tennis. i will attempt to make my own next time just like i did for my vitamin c serum</li>
            <li> This is the second of three hyaluronic acid serums I&#x27;ve used, and it is the worst.  The first, from BNatural Organics, felt so lovely and helpful to put on that I converted two friends to using it.  Then I looked for a cheaper version with Prime shipping.  This one sure is cheap.  Water&#x27;s the main ingredient, and that&#x27;s what it feels like.  With the other two serums I need only a few drops to cover my face and neck.  But Vernal&#x27;s is so watery that it takes two dropperfuls.  My skin does not look as hydrated, either.  Will not buy again.  Serum #3 from Cosmedica is also mostly water but so much more viscous and effective.</li>
            <li> Received on time &amp; works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different HA and this is my favorite.  Compared to the others, the consistency is of this one is between a liquid and gel.  The beauty of this is that it doesn&#x27;t slip through your fingers like the liquid, but nor is it sticky like the gels.  HA is the little &#x27;magic&#x27; ingredient found all the fancy new products on the market.  The reason for it is how it holds our moisture, on a molecular level, leaving a healthy, plump to the skin. My face shines with more youthfulness.  I must add that this finish is also due to the exfoliation and cleansing of dead skin cells first.  And IMPORTANTLY, What those of you who don&#x27;t know should pay attention to, is that HA should be used just before a moisturizer.  Although it helps water content of the skin, it needs to be followed by a proper moisturizer to further enhance it.  (I&#x27;d like to understand this better and will research at some point.)  I will say that moisturizer and cleanser choices factor into the health and finish of our skin.  I continue to experiment with those, fluctuating between chemical and the organic/natural  products I prefer.  If only I could find one that works and be done with it. Addendum several months later:  As I was into my 3rd bottle, the consistency suddenly turned from the lovely gel to a thin water feel. It also began to smell.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed by that and wrote Uvernal, but have not heard back from them in over 2 weeks.  Sure wish they&#x27;d help me figure out what went wrong and replace this bottle!</li>
            <li> Love this and will reorder when needed.</li>
            <li> MAkes my skin tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> I did not find this product helpful.  My skin was dryer than before I used it. It may suit some people, but it did not work for me I did not notice an improvement  in my skin after using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> It is just too watery...the dropper is a waste of time.</li>
