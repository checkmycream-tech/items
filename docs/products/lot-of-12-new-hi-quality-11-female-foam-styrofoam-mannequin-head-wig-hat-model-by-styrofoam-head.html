            <li>but this is the first time from this supplier and they were all fine.  </li>

            <li> but because of the smaller size, some masks will feel a bit loose on this mannequin head.</li>
            <li> Also cut out the eyes and put red led lights in them around other parts of the yard.  </li>
            <li> but the only down fall</li>
            <li> Just as expected, worked well for a haunted house.</li>
            <li> We use these to display mask collections, and also to build props for halloween and other events.  </li>
            <li> Very small, my wigs and hats cover the whole head and face :(</li>
            <li> At least that is what I received.</li>
            <li> - normally I receive at least one or two that look as though they have been in some terrible accident....</li>
            <li> We are using them to handle the wigs and headpieces in our dramatic production.</li>
            <li> very disappointing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is not twelve heads.  It is only one.  At least that is what I received. If you only want one head and are will to pay this much for it, you are good to go.</li>
            <li> I liked the product and the fast shipping - some of the noses were a bit smashed, tho, or I would have given this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> i was sent old heads that had dirt on them i used them as experiments as to not waste them. the quality of the heads were sub par</li>
            <li> These high quality Styrofoam heads were packed well and arrived in perfect condition, on time, and with no dents. They are very good quality, with minimal seam and mold lines.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Using these to display hats I made for sale.  Work great for my use and I felt like I got a great deal.</li>
            <li> These are good heads. The size is quite nice.  We are using them to handle the wigs and headpieces in our dramatic production. Service was excellent.  Came on schedule.</li>
            <li> We use these to display mask collections, and also to build props for halloween and other events.  Not for wigs.</li>
            <li> We bought these for a granddaughter who cosplays and has a growing wig collection.  On Christmas she.used one of them as a prop ... Quite funny :). They are lightweight, but serve their purpose quite effectively.</li>
            <li> These were great for our Halloween props.  We put masks on them and floated them in &amp;#34;bloody water&amp;#34; with a mister and lighting. Also cut out the eyes and put red led lights in them around other parts of the yard.  Very pleased.  Arrived in perfect condition and expertly packed.</li>
            <li> Very much more attractive than some I have bought historically.  And all twelve of them were perfect - normally I receive at least one or two that look as though they have been in some terrible accident....but this is the first time from this supplier and they were all fine.  I am a milliner and use them to display cocktail/small hats and headpieces .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was very speedy and packaging very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna O</li>
            <li> I placed an order when the price was just over thirty bucks. That is a great deal for 12 mannequin heads. The items arrived well packaged. The mannequin heads are of good quality. I bought these specifically as a mask holder. They work fine for certain masks but because of the smaller size, some masks will feel a bit loose on this mannequin head. But overall I am pleased with the price and quality.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, worked well for a haunted house.</li>
            <li> The title really says it all. I ordered these to use at a haunted house I work for and they arrived promptly. Also, they were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> nice quality and super fast shipping</li>
            <li> My hat collection looks great in my closet sitting on these!</li>
            <li> Very small, my wigs and hats cover the whole head and face :( very disappointing. Also looks more like alien in person.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried, before they arrived, that these would be too light to hold up. I&#x27;m a costumer and some of my wigs are very elaborate and HEAVY. I needn&#x27;t have worried at all! These heads are sturdy and beautiful and not only look good on my shelves, but stand up to quite a bit of weight and movement. You can&#x27;t style the wigs on the heads, but traveling with my wigs is a breeze now! These are perfect for storing and showing off wigs, glasses, and even some amount of prosthetics.</li>
            <li> Will order more!! Reorganized my closet.  Great for displaying hats, scarves. I can actually see what I&#x27;m looking for. Thanks</li>
            <li> Bought these wig heads For my 15 year old daughters cosplay wigs. Arrived in a timely matter and in perfect shape. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These heads are perfect for holding and displaying my children&#x27;s wigs. They are great quality and well worth the money! They were shipped fast and well packed. I would definitely buy these again from this seller!</li>
            <li> These heads are perfect for my wig collection. The only thing is there are multiple dents in multiple of the faces so if I were trying to display them I wouldnt be able to show the front. However, they are perfect for what I&#x27;m using them for and the wide base gives more durability then the others out there. I will be buying more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> I shopped around locally and couldn&#x27;t come close to this price.  The heads were shipped promptly and were just as described. As soon as I finish this review, I&#x27;m going to order two dozen more for our theatre arts program.  A cheap and effective way to preserve wigs.</li>
            <li> stryfoam head ok but the only down fall I don&#x27;t like sometime they turn color and you have to throw away only last for about week and have to change head.</li>
            <li> Great for decorating! Worth the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> I was selling a lot of hats and these heads were perfect to display my hats.  They were inexpensive (I had a lot of hats) and they store easy!  They came promptly and in great condition.  Very happy with them.</li>
            <li> These mannequin heads are a great buy.  The price is great for the quanity and the quality is very good.</li>
            <li> These styrofoam wig heads are nice and level on the bottom, so they stand nicely, even when weighted down by a heavy wig.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this product. I have a small farm store and this product was very useful and inexpensive to display my products on. They helped make the store more professional looking and had much more appeal. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> The ones i received don&#x27;t look exactly like the picture and some of them got there noses squished in shipping, but they work perfectly for what I need and were a great price. They shipped fast too!</li>
            <li> I love them....all received in tact, no damage, looks exactly like the pic. i would recommend getting the pins when purchsing this product though. the head is so smooth, the wigs slip off.</li>
            <li> Perfect price perfect product shipped quick</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and as described</li>
