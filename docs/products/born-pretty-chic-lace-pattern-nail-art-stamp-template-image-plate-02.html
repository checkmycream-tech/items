            <li>Love the lace pattern.</li>

            <li>Super cute in any color!</li>
            <li>I am happy with the plate; it is etched well and produces crisp, clean lines.</li>
            <li>Beautiful lace designs make it easy to stamp your nails at home so many different ways.  </li>
            <li>Seller is soooo great to do business with..plate stamps clean and clear....</li>
            <li>Fast shipping will be buying more!</li>
            <li>I enjoy using these nail art stamps.</li>
            <li>It is worth the effort!  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I loved this plate!</li>
            <li>But that is true of almost any &amp;#34;edge&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;border&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Now, a quick word about the lace edges on this plate.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Every intricate detail is crisp and well balanced, no thinning images here!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li>I have purchased Born Pretty products (directly from site) and have always been pleased with their products.</li>
            <li>Love this cute little stamper!</li>
            <li>but if your looking for extra discs these ones are lovely ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first experience with them</li>
            <li>I will need to hone my skills and color choices so the images show up better, but overall.</li>
            <li>These types of plates with borders do make them pretty close together, so it is an issue I&#x27;ve learned to compensate for in order to get pretty borders on my nails.  </li>
            <li>As an avid stamper I purchase many different brands of stamping plates.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more from this brand.</li>
            <li>Thanks!)</li>
            <li>Shipped pretty fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>So far, I coupled the &amp;#34;lace&amp;#34; edge with the flower patter of plate 17 and made a really pretty diagonal tip that looked like lace on my nail.  </li>
            <li>They came fast and cute little sleeves which I lovedx will buy from them again.</li>
            <li>Came early!</li>
            <li>It arrived far ahead of the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>Old school feel.</li>
            <li>Came really fast, weeks before I expected.  </li>
            <li>The design is not wide, and the polish does tend to get onto the adjacent border image, necessitating your rubbing off the excess from your stamp before applying to the nail.  </li>

            <li> For the life of me I can not get a single image to pick up even a little.</li>
            <li> Does not pick up well atleast half of the time.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little longer than anticipated, but my bad for not paying closer attention to it before purchasing.</li>

            <li> Absolutely stunning! I have purchased four plates (BP-02, BP-03, BP-17, BP-28) on 12/21 and received them 7 days later, although Amazon order estimated four weeks.  Very fast shipping!  I loved all of the unique designs as well as the size of images.  They cover my entire nail bed, including thumbs, with ease. I have tested each plate and they transfer beautifully!  Every intricate detail is crisp and well balanced, no thinning images here! I am very happy and highly recommend those Born Pretty plates to any discerning nail art enthusiast!</li>
            <li> Really great plate.  Came really fast, weeks before I expected.  So far, I coupled the &amp;#34;lace&amp;#34; edge with the flower patter of plate 17 and made a really pretty diagonal tip that looked like lace on my nail.  [I&#x27;ll try to post a photo later].  Now, a quick word about the lace edges on this plate.  I must admit that it took multiple tries to always pick up the border image.  The design is not wide, and the polish does tend to get onto the adjacent border image, necessitating your rubbing off the excess from your stamp before applying to the nail.
