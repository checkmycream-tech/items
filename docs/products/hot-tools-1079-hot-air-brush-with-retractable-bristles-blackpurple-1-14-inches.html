            <li>but this one is perfect!!!!</li>
            <li>VERY happy!</li>
            <li>but  over all it is a very good item</li>
            <li>This is a great air brush.</li>
            <li>Works great for giving my kinky, curly hair a smoother look.</li>
            <li>great for synthetic hair; heats and curls it without burning, bristles retract</li>
            <li>IT LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>For people like me with very fine tangly hair it is a perfect conception.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy to say I buy it from Amazon now! :-)</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product and because of the easy release, my waist-length hair never tangles.</li>
            <li>I read some of the reviews and thought a couple sounded good...</li>
            <li>The heat on it was good.  </li>
            <li>The brush is good.  </li>
            <li>Good item</li>
            <li>I was delighted when I found this one.....</li>
            <li>She loved it and was going to buy one too.</li>
            <li>Its made nicely and I love it for smoothing out my hair!!</li>
            <li>Over all I think this product is great, but there&#x27;s always more room for improvement.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>should also come in more than one size people!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>but maybe not the best choice for those of us with fine hair that are looking for that perfect possibly mythical one step tool</li>
            <li>They used to allow a customer to ship the item (at their own expense) to Helen of Troy with a receipt and the product would be replaced or repaired at no cost to the customer.</li>
            <li>This tool gives me a nice curl and lots of body.</li>
            <li>and I liked them a lot.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to drop.  </li>
            <li>I have mid-length hair with layers, but it&#x27;s very fine.  </li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>This is a great hot air curling brush.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE</li>
            <li>and I love how the cord is</li>
            <li>the curl that was there did not stay more than 10 min.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that you can push the bristles release button so that your hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled around the bristles.</li>
            <li>I think this is an ingenious idea, the retractable brush.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Works great and leaves your hair smooth with great curls that last.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure after I use it some more</li>
            <li>love this tool.</li>
            <li>I have more tools than I care to admit, but am gladly buying 2 more of this one, just to make sure I have a back-up.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>so I could curl more hair at one time.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say HOW MANY times I have gotten my hair tangled in them no matter</li>
            <li>But this one is so much better.</li>
            <li>I love the retractable bristles--</li>
            <li>I will definitely get another one because its so perfect!!</li>
            <li>My all time favorite and rapid hair tool accessory.  </li>
            <li>so you get best of both with only one tool</li>
            <li>and I can HONESTLY say that THIS ONE is a WHOLE LOT BETTER!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m out of words how good this hot air brush is and yet amazed me on how underrated it is.</li>
            <li>This gives me the best blow dry...</li>
            <li>Most importantly what I love about it is the retractable bristles</li>
            <li>adjustable heat/speed buttons for maximum control, much easier and more effective than blow dryer and brush, minimize damage with ceramic/ion tech, 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel is the perfect size for big body or curls</li>
            <li>I was glad when Amazon notified me that this product was available again.</li>
            <li>I have tried many hot air brushes at many different price points and this one is the best for me</li>
            <li>, WAY COOL!  </li>
            <li>Finally I found the perfect hot air brush styler!</li>
            <li>and I was amazed at how easy it was to use and how it didn&#x27;t tangle my hair</li>
            <li>The retractable bristles make it easy to pull it out without pulling you&#x27;r hair.</li>
            <li>, barrel detaches easily to pack/store or clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>I liked this hot air brush more than I thought and a lot of it has to do with the retractable bristles and the cool shot feature.</li>
            <li>I love the ion button and cool shot button for setting the style.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, shoulder length and curly.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the difference between working and not working for my fine chin length hair.  </li>
            <li>, it is light weight for what it is considering its a hair brush/dryer/curler all in one.</li>
            <li>I liked that it is reasonably priced</li>
            <li>On days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I spray on a thermal styling spray and use the brush with the same great results.</li>
            <li>It is easy to inadvertently hit the cool button, leaving you without a curl when you thought you would get one.</li>
            <li>If my hair was long it would be great.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews for this and most said it gripped the hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>It gives so much body to my hair which is very fine.</li>
            <li>Being able to simply retract the bristles so that I can keep the hair rolled and simply pin it to cool is AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>You gather up a section, curl it, hit the cool shot, retract the bristles to hold the curl.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it has a cool switch to lock the curl in.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair body and a nice soft curl.</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of using it and not getting my hair caught; it gave me gorgeous curls that last for 2 days.  </li>
            <li>so hair does not get tangled and like the shot of cool air to set your style.  </li>
            <li>Although I love all of the other hot tools products I own, this one doesn&#x27;t make the cut!</li>
            <li>It dries hair quickly</li>
            <li>Love how it works - but never last more than 6mo to a yr.</li>
            <li>I do like it for quickly drying and adding body-curls to my hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth and shiny and I feel pretty all day.</li>
            <li>With the hot air brush, it smooths my hair but leaves it with body and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>I love the long cool tip for gripping.  </li>
            <li>Quick heat, curls as much or little as you like and can just do my ends and bangs super quick but looks great and lasts ALL day.  </li>
            <li>: Makes great curls/waves, leaves hair shiny, heats almost instantly, LOVE the retractable bristles, dries as you smooth or curl, curl holds longer when styled from damp to dry, cooling button sets curl well, long cord lets you move around</li>
            <li>I REALLY DO like it, LOTS!!</li>
            <li>It might be ok to use on someone else, but to use it on myself, I&#x27;d need three big, strong hands and a lot of practice.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the dryer too large to hold comfortably.  </li>
            <li>works very good,makes hair smooth and no frizzy.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair so soft and silky and shiny</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth shipping back at my own expense.      </li>
            <li>The retraction is the best part as the others can tangle thin (and thinning) hair.</li>
            <li>Bought this item for myself but my hair was too short for the product to be effective ( wear a wedge).  </li>
            <li>but I like this one FAR better.</li>
            <li>When I use the Hot Tools 1079 on damp hair, I get a nice, smooth blow dry with some fun shaping in under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Its powerful unlike most that are between 200-800 watts and don&#x27;t get my hair smooth because they don&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li>The Hot Tools Hot Air Brush 1079 is identical to the Wigo 1000 Watt Anti-Static Ion Ceramic Hot Air Brush WG5120, which is no longer available.</li>
            <li>so hair slides right off and doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li>the curl just pops right off the barrel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But Amazon&#x27;s service was impeccable, easy and fast as usual.</li>
            <li>why I only gave it a one star is that it is very easy to get tangled in your hair.  </li>
            <li>What attracted me to this Hot Air Brush is the part that it is retractable bristles</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s much better suited for someone with short hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty noisy.</li>
            <li>I have probably owned eight of the Hot Tools</li>
            <li>1079 Hot Air Brushes.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a rotating hot air brush, which it is not.</li>
            <li>This worked well at first, but then the bristles started breaking off and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a product that would allow me to replace hot rollers as I wanted volume and some curls.  </li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this product as the first one pooped out after many years.</li>
            <li>This is exactly like the Wigo brush that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>I was hopeful about the Hot Tools brush</li>
            <li>Gotta go with what works and the Hot Tools Hot Air Brush doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>she was so upset when her Wigo hot air brush stopped working</li>
            <li>This was my first hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>The first time this happened</li>
            <li>Overall a much better product than the 800w hot air brush by Hot Tools that doesn&#x27;t have retractable bristles.</li>
            <li>I paid almost $100 for my wigo hot air brush.</li>
            <li>exactly like the wigo but a different color and love the price.</li>
            <li>I had an hot air brush that I had to replace for this one</li>
            <li>I know that all of these hot hair brushes say they WON&#x27;T tangle your hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine long hair</li>
            <li>On the positive side...I do like the way the brush smooths my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it frizzy.</li>
            <li>I love hot tools products so after 4 years of using my hot tools heated curling iron (no air) I finally needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>I should add that my hair is between short and medium length, very straight and fine.  </li>
            <li>grip is a little too large for me, but due to the great result, I give it a 5!</li>
            <li>I have perfectly good manual dexterity, but my hands are medium to small.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use rather than having roller comb on one hand and dryer on the other.</li>
            <li>Basically I wanted a new curling brush to replace one that rarely got used but broke anyway.  </li>
            <li>In just a few days, I was pleased with my bouncy curls!</li>
            <li>I also love that I don&#x27;t loose a lot of hair in the bristles of the brush</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the product is available on Amazon for less than the $25 charge + the $12.95 shipping charge</li>
            <li>Durable, works great on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Holds the style for my medium short fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This hot air brush with retractable bristles has a high and low setting which governs high and low heat and high and low blower force, plus a switch to turn ions on or off, plus it has a cool button to cool down the curl, then the bristles retract to permit a perfectly shaped curl.  </li>
            <li>This one dries my hair in half the time and the retractable bristles are Very COOL!</li>
            <li>Too much air on my face and neck and not on the hair.</li>
            <li>I was very relieved and grateful when I found out about this product through people&#x27;s online comments.</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t suggest purchasing this to anyone.</li>
            <li>My whole head takes about 2-3</li>
            <li>and I really like the retractable bristles</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel that I was risking too much to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I think this tool is an absolute must for drying and curling hair.</li>
            <li>The brush detaches so it can be used as a blow drier and then is very compact for traveling.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Over all I am very</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously - you won&#x27;t go back to your old favorite.  </li>
            <li>The only improvement I would make would be to have a medium setting, instead of just cool and hot.</li>
            <li>but, alas, like so many others - it blows the air so forcefully that the hair isn&#x27;t able to stay wrapped around the device.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it gets quite hot enough as my curls don&#x27;t last more than a day.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think it would be hot enough or have strong enough air flow, but it scores high on both of these!</li>
            <li>and since I dry it 365 days a year, that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly, allowing you to style at the same time.</li>
            <li>This Hot Tools airbrush is exactly the same as the Wigo one except the barrel is purple.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and so many of these hair gadgets tangle my hair and cause a mess.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.........</li>
            <li>This all works together very quickly, so it cuts down on my &amp;#34;prep time&amp;#34; getting ready for work in the morning.</li>
            <li>I will admit it is kind of bulky but not too hard for me to manage or handle</li>
            <li>Soft, wavy curves with no frizz or totally straight depending on the product  </li>
            <li>This might work easier for someone with normal to curly hair that is thicker and longer.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it will last as long as the wigo, but at this price that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I am forever searching for a hot air brush that will hold onto my very course very thick hair (I can&#x27;t use the kind with soft bristles, they aren&#x27;t strong enough to grab and hold the hair) and produce enough heat to style it.  </li>
            <li>This hot air brush made my hair very soft, very manageable that I can comb through my coarse hair with NO PAIN!</li>
            <li>#34;can&#x27;t live without it&amp;#34; item.  </li>
            <li>I keep trying new models but always end up replacing my Helen of Troy brushes so I can use them for 3-6 months.  </li>
            <li>I do dry my hair until it&#x27;s about 80% dry and then use the hot air brush to smooth and style.  </li>
            <li>my short/medium length hair which is very fine and hard to manage.  </li>
            <li>With this hot air brush, you can achieve close to the same effect as having a stylist blow-dry and style your hair.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>(only had it for two weeks), I will know exactly where the buttons are while styling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked around for hot air brush types and used different kinds</li>
            <li>In fact I love it so much that I have several of them - 1 for the gym bag, 1 for everyday use and a backup in case</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple other hot air brushes and this is my hands down favorite.</li>
            <li>I like the size, the way it drys, and the special features, but it&#x27;s handle is very large and hard to hold.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length thick hair and it takes about 10 minutes to dry it, which is good.</li>
            <li>The wand is rather large for my smaller hand, but you need the size for the wattage.  </li>
            <li>So far its doing wonders for me.</li>
            <li>my mirror is far away from the plug in.</li>
            <li>as far as curls it doesn&#x27;t do anything like that....for the price I paid for it I was expecting a miracle....</li>
            <li>I have used this brush several times now and really like the performance and versatility.  </li>
            <li>It barely gets hot enough to keep any volume in my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the retractable bristles, no more tangles!  </li>
            <li>The hot tools curling air brush was exactly what Ive needed to dry and style my hair in half the time that it normally takes.  </li>
            <li>If I let it dry naturally, it looks out of control and messy (cute on some, but not on me.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased that I found this item on Amazon for as cheap as it was because I would hate to have to spend a lot of money on something that I wouldn&#x27;t know if I would like it or not, yet.</li>
            <li>This is becoming hard to find, so get them while you can.  </li>
            <li>Some months ago I had to buy a new one only because I dropped my old one and broke.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s possible that this item will curl other hair types but for mine it just slightly curled the ends and made the rest look kind of frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Everytime I have to open a new box (either the spring goes on the retraction or the motor burns out)</li>
            <li>I have had other hot air brushes with non-retractable bristles and always got my hair tangled in the bristles</li>
            <li>they actually &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; completely!</li>
            <li>The buttons take some getting used to and the controls are a little bulky but the RETRACTABLE BRISTLES make it all worth the learning curve.  </li>
            <li>Went back to my old Conair .</li>
            <li>I have long thick wavy hair and this beats every hot air brush!!!</li>
            <li>Little bulky, some buttons/controls take time to locate at first</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;release\\&quot; button on the round brush styler lets you set the curl with the hot air without having to then \\&quot;unwind\\</li>
            <li>but then I have short, slick hair, so it may be my hair, not the brush, but it&#x27;s been relegated to the old hot tools drawer for a time that I might have longer hair (probably never) or the next garage sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great idea, too bad it&#x27;s so cheaply made and so expensive.</li>

            <li> and she was so happy!</li>
            <li> Amazon is the greatest!</li>
            <li> She used it on the babies hair and it was perfect for her as well and kept it from getting tangled.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found that smooths (and shapes)</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I am a very happy shopper.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!!!</li>
            <li> but this one is perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> VERY happy!</li>
            <li> but  over all it is a very good item</li>
            <li> This is a great air brush.</li>
            <li> Works great for giving my kinky, curly hair a smoother look.</li>
            <li> great for synthetic hair; heats and curls it without burning, bristles retract</li>
            <li> IT LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> For people like me with very fine tangly hair it is a perfect conception.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy to say I buy it from Amazon now! :-)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and because of the easy release, my waist-length hair never tangles.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews and thought a couple sounded good...</li>
            <li> The heat on it was good.  </li>
            <li> The brush is good.  </li>
            <li> Good item</li>
            <li> I was delighted when I found this one.....</li>
            <li> She loved it and was going to buy one too.</li>
            <li> Its made nicely and I love it for smoothing out my hair!!</li>
            <li> Over all I think this product is great, but there&#x27;s always more room for improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> should also come in more than one size people!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> but maybe not the best choice for those of us with fine hair that are looking for that perfect possibly mythical one step tool</li>
            <li> They used to allow a customer to ship the item (at their own expense) to Helen of Troy with a receipt and the product would be replaced or repaired at no cost to the customer.</li>
            <li> This tool gives me a nice curl and lots of body.</li>
            <li> and I liked them a lot.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to drop.  </li>
            <li> I have mid-length hair with layers, but it&#x27;s very fine.  </li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> This is a great hot air curling brush.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> IT LOVE</li>
            <li> and I love how the cord is</li>
            <li> the curl that was there did not stay more than 10 min.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that you can push the bristles release button so that your hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled around the bristles.</li>
            <li> I think this is an ingenious idea, the retractable brush.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Works great and leaves your hair smooth with great curls that last.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure after I use it some more</li>
            <li> love this tool.</li>
            <li> I have more tools than I care to admit, but am gladly buying 2 more of this one, just to make sure I have a back-up.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> so I could curl more hair at one time.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say HOW MANY times I have gotten my hair tangled in them no matter</li>
            <li> But this one is so much better.</li>
            <li> I love the retractable bristles--</li>
            <li> I will definitely get another one because its so perfect!!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite and rapid hair tool accessory.  </li>
            <li> so you get best of both with only one tool</li>
            <li> and I can HONESTLY say that THIS ONE is a WHOLE LOT BETTER!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out of words how good this hot air brush is and yet amazed me on how underrated it is.</li>
            <li> This gives me the best blow dry...</li>
            <li> Most importantly what I love about it is the retractable bristles</li>
            <li> adjustable heat/speed buttons for maximum control, much easier and more effective than blow dryer and brush, minimize damage with ceramic/ion tech, 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel is the perfect size for big body or curls</li>
            <li> I was glad when Amazon notified me that this product was available again.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hot air brushes at many different price points and this one is the best for me</li>
            <li> , WAY COOL!  </li>
            <li> Finally I found the perfect hot air brush styler!</li>
            <li> and I was amazed at how easy it was to use and how it didn&#x27;t tangle my hair</li>
            <li> The retractable bristles make it easy to pull it out without pulling you&#x27;r hair.</li>
            <li> , barrel detaches easily to pack/store or clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li> I liked this hot air brush more than I thought and a lot of it has to do with the retractable bristles and the cool shot feature.</li>
            <li> I love the ion button and cool shot button for setting the style.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, shoulder length and curly.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the difference between working and not working for my fine chin length hair.  </li>
            <li> , it is light weight for what it is considering its a hair brush/dryer/curler all in one.</li>
            <li> I liked that it is reasonably priced</li>
            <li> On days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I spray on a thermal styling spray and use the brush with the same great results.</li>
            <li> It is easy to inadvertently hit the cool button, leaving you without a curl when you thought you would get one.</li>
            <li> If my hair was long it would be great.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this and most said it gripped the hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> It gives so much body to my hair which is very fine.</li>
            <li> Being able to simply retract the bristles so that I can keep the hair rolled and simply pin it to cool is AWESOME!  </li>
            <li> You gather up a section, curl it, hit the cool shot, retract the bristles to hold the curl.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it has a cool switch to lock the curl in.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair body and a nice soft curl.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of using it and not getting my hair caught; it gave me gorgeous curls that last for 2 days.  </li>
            <li> so hair does not get tangled and like the shot of cool air to set your style.  </li>
            <li> Although I love all of the other hot tools products I own, this one doesn&#x27;t make the cut!</li>
            <li> It dries hair quickly</li>
            <li> Love how it works - but never last more than 6mo to a yr.</li>
            <li> I do like it for quickly drying and adding body-curls to my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth and shiny and I feel pretty all day.</li>
            <li> With the hot air brush, it smooths my hair but leaves it with body and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> I love the long cool tip for gripping.  </li>
            <li> Quick heat, curls as much or little as you like and can just do my ends and bangs super quick but looks great and lasts ALL day.  </li>
            <li> : Makes great curls/waves, leaves hair shiny, heats almost instantly, LOVE the retractable bristles, dries as you smooth or curl, curl holds longer when styled from damp to dry, cooling button sets curl well, long cord lets you move around</li>
            <li> I REALLY DO like it, LOTS!!</li>
            <li> It might be ok to use on someone else, but to use it on myself, I&#x27;d need three big, strong hands and a lot of practice.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the dryer too large to hold comfortably.  </li>
            <li> works very good,makes hair smooth and no frizzy.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair so soft and silky and shiny</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth shipping back at my own expense.      </li>
            <li> The retraction is the best part as the others can tangle thin (and thinning) hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for myself but my hair was too short for the product to be effective ( wear a wedge).  </li>
            <li> but I like this one FAR better.</li>
            <li> When I use the Hot Tools 1079 on damp hair, I get a nice, smooth blow dry with some fun shaping in under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Its powerful unlike most that are between 200-800 watts and don&#x27;t get my hair smooth because they don&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools Hot Air Brush 1079 is identical to the Wigo 1000 Watt Anti-Static Ion Ceramic Hot Air Brush WG5120, which is no longer available.</li>
            <li> so hair slides right off and doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li> the curl just pops right off the barrel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But Amazon&#x27;s service was impeccable, easy and fast as usual.</li>
            <li> why I only gave it a one star is that it is very easy to get tangled in your hair.  </li>
            <li> What attracted me to this Hot Air Brush is the part that it is retractable bristles</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s much better suited for someone with short hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty noisy.</li>
            <li> I have probably owned eight of the Hot Tools</li>
            <li> 1079 Hot Air Brushes.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a rotating hot air brush, which it is not.</li>
            <li> This worked well at first, but then the bristles started breaking off and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product that would allow me to replace hot rollers as I wanted volume and some curls.  </li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product as the first one pooped out after many years.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the Wigo brush that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful about the Hot Tools brush</li>
            <li> Gotta go with what works and the Hot Tools Hot Air Brush doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> she was so upset when her Wigo hot air brush stopped working</li>
            <li> This was my first hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> The first time this happened</li>
            <li> Overall a much better product than the 800w hot air brush by Hot Tools that doesn&#x27;t have retractable bristles.</li>
            <li> I paid almost $100 for my wigo hot air brush.</li>
            <li> exactly like the wigo but a different color and love the price.</li>
            <li> I had an hot air brush that I had to replace for this one</li>
            <li> I know that all of these hot hair brushes say they WON&#x27;T tangle your hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine long hair</li>
            <li> On the positive side...I do like the way the brush smooths my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it frizzy.</li>
            <li> I love hot tools products so after 4 years of using my hot tools heated curling iron (no air) I finally needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> I should add that my hair is between short and medium length, very straight and fine.  </li>
            <li> grip is a little too large for me, but due to the great result, I give it a 5!</li>
            <li> I have perfectly good manual dexterity, but my hands are medium to small.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use rather than having roller comb on one hand and dryer on the other.</li>
            <li> Basically I wanted a new curling brush to replace one that rarely got used but broke anyway.  </li>
            <li> In just a few days, I was pleased with my bouncy curls!</li>
            <li> I also love that I don&#x27;t loose a lot of hair in the bristles of the brush</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the product is available on Amazon for less than the $25 charge + the $12.95 shipping charge</li>
            <li> Durable, works great on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Holds the style for my medium short fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This hot air brush with retractable bristles has a high and low setting which governs high and low heat and high and low blower force, plus a switch to turn ions on or off, plus it has a cool button to cool down the curl, then the bristles retract to permit a perfectly shaped curl.  </li>
            <li> This one dries my hair in half the time and the retractable bristles are Very COOL!</li>
            <li> Too much air on my face and neck and not on the hair.</li>
            <li> I was very relieved and grateful when I found out about this product through people&#x27;s online comments.</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t suggest purchasing this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My whole head takes about 2-3</li>
            <li> and I really like the retractable bristles</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel that I was risking too much to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I think this tool is an absolute must for drying and curling hair.</li>
            <li> The brush detaches so it can be used as a blow drier and then is very compact for traveling.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Over all I am very</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously - you won&#x27;t go back to your old favorite.  </li>
            <li> The only improvement I would make would be to have a medium setting, instead of just cool and hot.</li>
            <li> but, alas, like so many others - it blows the air so forcefully that the hair isn&#x27;t able to stay wrapped around the device.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it gets quite hot enough as my curls don&#x27;t last more than a day.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it would be hot enough or have strong enough air flow, but it scores high on both of these!</li>
            <li> and since I dry it 365 days a year, that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly, allowing you to style at the same time.</li>
            <li> This Hot Tools airbrush is exactly the same as the Wigo one except the barrel is purple.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and so many of these hair gadgets tangle my hair and cause a mess.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.........</li>
            <li> This all works together very quickly, so it cuts down on my &amp;#34;prep time&amp;#34; getting ready for work in the morning.</li>
            <li> I will admit it is kind of bulky but not too hard for me to manage or handle</li>
            <li> Soft, wavy curves with no frizz or totally straight depending on the product  </li>
            <li> This might work easier for someone with normal to curly hair that is thicker and longer.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it will last as long as the wigo, but at this price that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I am forever searching for a hot air brush that will hold onto my very course very thick hair (I can&#x27;t use the kind with soft bristles, they aren&#x27;t strong enough to grab and hold the hair) and produce enough heat to style it.  </li>
            <li> This hot air brush made my hair very soft, very manageable that I can comb through my coarse hair with NO PAIN!</li>
            <li> #34;can&#x27;t live without it&amp;#34; item.  </li>
            <li> I keep trying new models but always end up replacing my Helen of Troy brushes so I can use them for 3-6 months.  </li>
            <li> I do dry my hair until it&#x27;s about 80% dry and then use the hot air brush to smooth and style.  </li>
            <li> my short/medium length hair which is very fine and hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> With this hot air brush, you can achieve close to the same effect as having a stylist blow-dry and style your hair.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> (only had it for two weeks), I will know exactly where the buttons are while styling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked around for hot air brush types and used different kinds</li>
            <li> In fact I love it so much that I have several of them - 1 for the gym bag, 1 for everyday use and a backup in case</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple other hot air brushes and this is my hands down favorite.</li>
            <li> I like the size, the way it drys, and the special features, but it&#x27;s handle is very large and hard to hold.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length thick hair and it takes about 10 minutes to dry it, which is good.</li>
            <li> The wand is rather large for my smaller hand, but you need the size for the wattage.  </li>
            <li> So far its doing wonders for me.</li>
            <li> my mirror is far away from the plug in.</li>
            <li> as far as curls it doesn&#x27;t do anything like that....for the price I paid for it I was expecting a miracle....</li>
            <li> I have used this brush several times now and really like the performance and versatility.  </li>
            <li> It barely gets hot enough to keep any volume in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the retractable bristles, no more tangles!  </li>
            <li> The hot tools curling air brush was exactly what Ive needed to dry and style my hair in half the time that it normally takes.  </li>
            <li> If I let it dry naturally, it looks out of control and messy (cute on some, but not on me.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased that I found this item on Amazon for as cheap as it was because I would hate to have to spend a lot of money on something that I wouldn&#x27;t know if I would like it or not, yet.</li>
            <li> This is becoming hard to find, so get them while you can.  </li>
            <li> Some months ago I had to buy a new one only because I dropped my old one and broke.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s possible that this item will curl other hair types but for mine it just slightly curled the ends and made the rest look kind of frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Everytime I have to open a new box (either the spring goes on the retraction or the motor burns out)</li>
            <li> I have had other hot air brushes with non-retractable bristles and always got my hair tangled in the bristles</li>
            <li> they actually &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; completely!</li>
            <li> The buttons take some getting used to and the controls are a little bulky but the RETRACTABLE BRISTLES make it all worth the learning curve.  </li>
            <li> Went back to my old Conair .</li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair and this beats every hot air brush!!!</li>
            <li> Little bulky, some buttons/controls take time to locate at first</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;release\\&quot; button on the round brush styler lets you set the curl with the hot air without having to then \\&quot;unwind\\</li>
            <li> but then I have short, slick hair, so it may be my hair, not the brush, but it&#x27;s been relegated to the old hot tools drawer for a time that I might have longer hair (probably never) or the next garage sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great idea, too bad it&#x27;s so cheaply made and so expensive.</li>
            <li> , I use a reg dryer until almost dry and then this tool to curl bangs, sides and back bottom and staighten frizzies on back.  </li>
            <li> making it lifeless and flat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given up on flat irons, brushes, and the InStyler.</li>
            <li> This replaces my flat iron which crushes and bakes my hair while damaging it and taking away all the volume.  </li>
            <li> I used to blow it dry and then flat iron, but my hair was left flat.  </li>
            <li> Was under the impression that this could not only dry my hair but curl it too</li>
            <li> I can once again blow dry my hair without wrestling and straining and can get my hair smoother and silkier than with a regular blow dryer and brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not coordinated enough to use two hands to blow dry (one on brush and one on dryer).  </li>
            <li> Dry and curl at the same time!</li>
            <li> Lower wattage air-brushes will burn out faster because it takes longer to dry your hair and style at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The hand grip is to large, which makes it hard to turn</li>
            <li> I am so afraid I won&#x27;t able to find them.</li>
            <li> really long cus</li>
            <li> I have think long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and this makes it easier to do my hair in the morningings.</li>
            <li> 2.curler  is too wide for short hair</li>
            <li> Recently after coloring my hair for me, a friend of mine used hers to dry my wet hair</li>
            <li> It would constantly get tangled in other hot-air brushes, even if the barrel rotated.  </li>
            <li> However the handle is so very wide that I can&#x27;t wrap my hand around it and curl at the same time.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair in the morning, let it air dry while I&#x27;m getting my breakfast, then use this thingie to finish it.</li>
            <li> It also works on dry hair for touch ups.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product (formerly a WIGO brand) and was so afraid it was no longer available.  </li>
            <li> My hair is medium thick, straight by nature and now just below shoulder with slight bangs, tapered sides and back along bottom.  </li>
            <li> dry AND style!</li>
            <li> My workaround to avoid tight curls is to retract the bristles for just a second when I roll up the hair</li>
            <li> The handle is very fat, and the gizmos on it are just very hard to coordinate.  </li>
            <li> And the price for $9.95 with free prime shipping is crazy.</li>
            <li> Have had this tool for a couple of years and it works very well drying and helping to avoid tangling, but the bottom area near the vent and cord has started cracking and seems as if it could be dangerous...</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> HOW careful I try to be</li>
            <li> Minuses are: 1.the hand is too big and too heavy ,</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to work with as the handle portion is a little large, but it is workable and you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick in the back and never seems to get dry enough with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> couple of design problems though; too big, cool shot and on/off button in a bad spot.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd hot brush,but I have to say that it is disappointing.  </li>

            <li> As other reviewers have suggested it does take a bit of practice to use this drying-curling hair tool.  </li>
            <li> The hand barrel on it IS rather larger then the usual, but you can get use to it.  </li>
            <li> like I did with all the other brands.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money, didn&#x27;t even dry my hair, which is very thin and short, and made no different</li>
            <li> It was a little awkward at first, but it didn&#x27;t take long to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it four stars, because like some other reviewers, I find the control a little hard to find when you are using the brush.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a must have item for me.  In fact I love it so much that I have several of them - 1 for the gym bag, 1 for everyday use and a backup in case they should stop making them.  I have medium length, thick, semi-coarse hair that takes quite a while to dry and requires some finesse to style.  It&#x27;s always been difficult for me to use a round brush and hand dryer and this tool has solved that problem.  When I use it at the gym I always get questioned about it.  Yes, the handle is bulky.  I admit that initially I had difficulty adjusting to that, but within a small amount of time it&#x27;s become a &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without it&amp;#34; item.  It was delivered on time and arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> This is a great air brush. I had one before but it died after several years of use, and I had been unable to find a replacement online. I was glad when Amazon notified me that this product was available again. With this hot air brush, you can achieve close to the same effect as having a stylist blow-dry and style your hair.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this product. Didn&#x27;t know this existed until she told me. Very easy to use rather than having roller comb on one hand and dryer on the other. So far its doing wonders for me. Saves a lot of time and effort. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Holds the style for my medium short fine hair.  With combination of titanium to lock in style, and blow dryer, I get the results i want.&lt;br /&gt;The handle grip is a little too large for me, but due to the great result, I give it a 5!</li>
            <li> What attracted me to this Hot Air Brush is the part that it is retractable bristles however my hair seems&lt;br /&gt;to be to short.  If my hair was long it would be great.</li>
            <li> I love hot tools products so after 4 years of using my hot tools heated curling iron (no air) I finally needed a new one.  I found the hot air brush on Amazon as well as other sites; Amazon&#x27;s price was 9.99 compared to 45.00 and 39.99 on other sites.  I have extremely thick, wavy, medium length hair that always goes frizzy when using a hair dryer and round brush to straighten it.  The hot tools curling air brush was exactly what Ive needed to dry and style my hair in half the time that it normally takes.  Soft, wavy curves with no frizz or totally straight depending on the product  I put ony hair before using the curling brush.LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair so soft and silky and shiny and it gives it volume and you can make ur hair straight or put a few curls and waves. It heats up enough like it should. Most importantly what I love about it is the retractable bristles so my hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck &#x3D;D and I love how the cord is really long cus my mirror is far away from the plug in. I will admit it is kind of bulky but not too hard for me to manage or handle and it is sort of heavy but not too bad, it is light weight for what it is considering its a hair brush/dryer/curler all in one. I&#x27;m very pleased that I found this item on Amazon for as cheap as it was because I would hate to have to spend a lot of money on something that I wouldn&#x27;t know if I would like it or not, yet. Over all I think this product is great, but there&#x27;s always more room for improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Dries hair quickly, allowing you to style at the same time. The \\&quot;release\\&quot; button on the round brush styler lets you set the curl with the hot air without having to then \\&quot;unwind\\&quot; it after you set it.  Works great for giving my kinky, curly hair a smoother look.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times.  When my last one broke, I tried unsuccessfully to replace it from the local retailers.  I hated every hot air brush with bristles that I purchased.  I finally found this at Amazon.  The other hot air brushes blow air at the base not directly through the brush.  Too much air on my face and neck and not on the hair.</li>
            <li> Was under the impression that this could not only dry my hair but curl it too and that&#x27;s just not the case.  I have very fine long hair so it&#x27;s possible that this item will curl other hair types but for mine it just slightly curled the ends and made the rest look kind of frizzy.  Not only that but the curl that was there did not stay more than 10 min.  Two stars because it does work well as a dryer but maybe not the best choice for those of us with fine hair that are looking for that perfect possibly mythical one step tool</li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  I have think long hair.  It over smooths my hair. making it lifeless and flat.  My biggest complaint and why I only gave it a one star is that it is very easy to get tangled in your hair.  I think it&#x27;s much better suited for someone with short hair.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush made my hair very soft, very manageable that I can comb through my coarse hair with NO PAIN! I&#x27;m out of words how good this hot air brush is and yet amazed me on how underrated it is. Just try it out and you&#x27;ll see for yourself. And the price for $9.95 with free prime shipping is crazy. Other website is like $50 and that&#x27;s excluding shipping charges. You just can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this and most said it gripped the hair pretty well. Well, it didn&#x27;t grip mine at all, but then I have short, slick hair, so it may be my hair, not the brush, but it&#x27;s been relegated to the old hot tools drawer for a time that I might have longer hair (probably never) or the next garage sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Amazon&#x27;s service was impeccable, easy and fast as usual.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 air brushes both broke within 3 months. I like the brush but the quality is really bad!!</li>
            <li> I like the size, the way it drys, and the special features, but it&#x27;s handle is very large and hard to hold. I probably wouldn&#x27;t get another one.</li>
            <li> I was devastated when my Wigo airbrush broke and I couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere, so I was very relieved and grateful when I found out about this product through people&#x27;s online comments. This Hot Tools airbrush is exactly the same as the Wigo one except the barrel is purple.  I can once again blow dry my hair without wrestling and straining and can get my hair smoother and silkier than with a regular blow dryer and brush.</li>
            <li> Blew out my hotel lights. BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> I liked this hot air brush more than I thought and a lot of it has to do with the retractable bristles and the cool shot feature. I wash my hair in the morning, let it air dry while I&#x27;m getting my breakfast, then use this thingie to finish it. I have a lot of hair and so many of these hair gadgets tangle my hair and cause a mess. This one doesn&#x27;t. You gather up a section, curl it, hit the cool shot, retract the bristles to hold the curl. Leaves my hair smooth and shiny and I feel pretty all day.</li>
            <li> Although I love all of the other hot tools products I own, this one doesn&#x27;t make the cut! It barely gets hot enough to keep any volume in my hair. It&#x27;s also pretty noisy. I really wouldn&#x27;t suggest purchasing this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have probably owned eight of the Hot Tools 1079 Hot Air Brushes. They used to have a three year no questions asked warranty and typically lasted nine months, tops. Either the heating element goes out or the brush breaks off from the unit and is unusable (it does have a detachable function but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m talking about). They used to allow a customer to ship the item (at their own expense) to Helen of Troy with a receipt and the product would be replaced or repaired at no cost to the customer. The last time I tried to send it back it was returned to me with a note that there was now a $25 charge for the warranty repair/replacement. Okie dokie. Fortunately, the product is available on Amazon for less than the $25 charge + the $12.95 shipping charge so I just buy it from Amazon. On the positive side...I do like the way the brush smooths my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it frizzy. I have shoulder length thick hair and it takes about 10 minutes to dry it, which is good. I feel that the ion feature does help my hair look healthier and since I dry it 365 days a year, that&#x27;s a huge plus. I have tried many hot air brushes at many different price points and this one is the best for me so that&#x27;s why I keep buying it about every nine months.  It retails at Ulta for $55 so I&#x27;m happy to say I buy it from Amazon now! :-)</li>
            <li> This thing has cut my styling time in half.  Being able to simply retract the bristles so that I can keep the hair rolled and simply pin it to cool is AWESOME!  I can&#x27;t believe this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that does it.  I WISH, WISH, WISH that they would make this with a larger barrel !!!  My workaround to avoid tight curls is to retract the bristles for just a second when I roll up the hair so it loosens the wave somewhat.  Then just hold the curl in place while retracting the iron and clip it.  My whole head takes about 2-3 min!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously - you won&#x27;t go back to your old favorite.  You need a retractable brush.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews and thought a couple sounded good...I am so truly disappointed in this product it does nothing for my hair..as far as curls it doesn&#x27;t do anything like that....for the price I paid for it I was expecting a miracle....and nothing came of it.&lt;br /&gt;I had one like this years ago 10 at least years ago, and one time when I traveled about a year ago it broke. And you can&#x27;t find anything like that anymore....</li>
            <li> I have had other hot air brushes with non-retractable bristles and always got my hair tangled in the bristles so I gave up on using them. Recently after coloring my hair for me, a friend of mine used hers to dry my wet hair and I was amazed at how easy it was to use and how it didn&#x27;t tangle my hair so I immediately ordered one for myself. It dries and curls your hair at the same time and I love the fact that you can push the bristles release button so that your hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled around the bristles. I also like the fact that it has a cool switch to lock the curl in. It gives my hair body and a nice soft curl. I only wish it came in a smaller size for shorter hair. My hair is very thick in the back and never seems to get dry enough with a blow dryer. This has solved that problem for me.</li>
            <li> I find it bulky and difficult to use. I thought it was a rotating hot air brush, which it is not. Went back to my old Conair .</li>
            <li> This worked well at first, but then the bristles started breaking off and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just threw it away.  Great idea, too bad it&#x27;s so cheaply made and so expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product that would allow me to replace hot rollers as I wanted volume and some curls.  This product allowed me to accomplish that.  It dries hair quickly and I really like the retractable bristles so hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled.  In addition, the barrel works like a curling iron and it also has a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button to helps set the curl.  It is a little hard to work with as the handle portion is a little large, but it is workable and you get used to it.  I liked that it is reasonably priced and I didn&#x27;t feel that I was risking too much to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Have had this tool for a couple of years and it works very well drying and helping to avoid tangling, but the bottom area near the vent and cord has started cracking and seems as if it could be dangerous...not sure if I want to buy another one.</li>
            <li> The dryer burned out after 6 weeks.  Helen of Troy worked with me and replaced the unit. It took a bit of time, but they honored their warranty.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product as the first one pooped out after many years. I&#x27;d buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> I think this is an ingenious idea, the retractable brush. For people like me with very fine tangly hair it is a perfect conception. However the handle is so very wide that I can&#x27;t wrap my hand around it and curl at the same time. I gave it to a friend with a lot bigger hand, I haven&#x27;t heard back from her.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. Thank you. It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the Wigo brush that I have used for years.  Works great and leaves your hair smooth with great curls that last.  Love love love!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest invention ever!  I don&#x27;t have the coordination to use a brush while blow drying at the same time, so this product solves that problem for me.  The only improvement I would make would be to have a medium setting, instead of just cool and hot.</li>
            <li> I am forever searching for a hot air brush that will hold onto my very course very thick hair (I can&#x27;t use the kind with soft bristles, they aren&#x27;t strong enough to grab and hold the hair) and produce enough heat to style it.  The closest I have found is the one made by Helen of Troy.  I like their products...while they are working.  The problem is, after about 3 months, they start to overheat after less than 5 minutes of use and shut off.  I was hopeful about the Hot Tools brush but, alas, like so many others - it blows the air so forcefully that the hair isn&#x27;t able to stay wrapped around the device.  It also doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  I keep trying new models but always end up replacing my Helen of Troy brushes so I can use them for 3-6 months.  Gotta go with what works and the Hot Tools Hot Air Brush doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of using it and not getting my hair caught; it gave me gorgeous curls that last for 2 days.  It takes a little time to navigate.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing. It was a little awkward at first, but it didn&#x27;t take long to get used to it.  My hair is fine, shoulder length and curly. If I let it dry naturally, it looks out of control and messy (cute on some, but not on me.)  When I use the Hot Tools 1079 on damp hair, I get a nice, smooth blow dry with some fun shaping in under 10 minutes. I&#x27;ve tried a couple other hot air brushes and this is my hands down favorite. It also works on dry hair for touch ups. AND  I&#x27;ve gotten unsolicited compliments.  The Hot Tools Hot Air Brush 1079 is identical to the Wigo 1000 Watt Anti-Static Ion Ceramic Hot Air Brush WG5120, which is no longer available. Same company, different color.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom b/c she was so upset when her Wigo hot air brush stopped working and she found out they longer made it. I did my research and found this one on amazon for her and she was so happy! She had tried a few other before I found this one but those had all failed her miserably! Amazon is the greatest!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. She used it on the babies hair and it was perfect for her as well and kept it from getting tangled.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest, clumsiest-to-use hair dryer I have ever seen.  I could not have imagined how hard it would be to use.  I have perfectly good manual dexterity, but my hands are medium to small.  It might be ok to use on someone else, but to use it on myself, I&#x27;d need three big, strong hands and a lot of practice.  The handle is very fat, and the gizmos on it are just very hard to coordinate.  I&#x27;m packing it back up and donating it to a charity.  It isn&#x27;t worth shipping back at my own expense.      I should add that my hair is between short and medium length, very straight and fine.  This might work easier for someone with normal to curly hair that is thicker and longer.    The heat on it was good.  The brush is good.  But this thing is just a monstrosity to handle, a really bad design.</li>
            <li> This was my first hot air brush.  I have thick, shoulder-length, wavy, frizzy hair.  I used to blow it dry and then flat iron, but my hair was left flat.  With the hot air brush, it smooths my hair but leaves it with body and frizz free.  I like that this one has retractable bristles so hair does not get tangled and like the shot of cool air to set your style.  I only gave it four stars, because like some other reviewers, I find the control a little hard to find when you are using the brush.  I&#x27;m sure after I use it some more (only had it for two weeks), I will know exactly where the buttons are while styling.  I do dry my hair until it&#x27;s about 80% dry and then use the hot air brush to smooth and style.  On days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I spray on a thermal styling spray and use the brush with the same great results.</li>
            <li> It gives so much body to my hair which is very fine. The body lasts all day and night....love it!</li>
            <li> Good item but I feel that the heat not 1000 watt  it is a little  bit weak heat but  over all it is a very good item</li>
            <li> I think this tool is an absolute must for drying and curling hair. The brush detaches so it can be used as a blow drier and then is very compact for traveling.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money, didn&#x27;t even dry my hair, which is very thin and short, and made no different what so ever in fullness. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this tool for over 1 year.  This is my 3rd hot brush,but I have to say that it is disappointing.  The hand grip is to large, which makes it hard to turn and it&#x27;s very easy to drop.  The worst part about this brush is that when the bristles get hot they bend inside the barrel gettin it stuck in a retracted position.  The first time this happened I found the bent one and cut it, so it released but this last time I have been unable to find the bristles that are stuck so here it sits useless.</li>
            <li> Love how it works - but never last more than 6mo to a yr. before it has to be replaced.  But I like it enough to keep replacing it.</li>
            <li> love this tool. great for synthetic hair; heats and curls it without burning, bristles retract so hair slides right off and doesn&#x27;t tangle. couple of design problems though; too big, cool shot and on/off button in a bad spot. should also come in more than one size people!</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for over 15+ years (owned at least 4) and am now ordering another.  The retraction is the best part as the others can tangle thin (and thinning) hair. Everytime I have to open a new box (either the spring goes on the retraction or the motor burns out), I immediately order another. I can get at 4 or maybe 5 years out of each I am so afraid I won&#x27;t able to find them. ;-/</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have suggested it does take a bit of practice to use this drying-curling hair tool.  I do like it for quickly drying and adding body-curls to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product (formerly a WIGO brand) and was so afraid it was no longer available.  (The low setting quit working on the one I have.)  This is the best product I have found that smooths (and shapes) my short/medium length hair which is very fine and hard to manage.  I have more tools than I care to admit, but am gladly buying 2 more of this one, just to make sure I have a back-up.</li>
            <li> This is a great hot air curling brush.  Durable, works great on wet or dry hair.  Takes a little bit of time to get the hang of using it, but its something I will always have on hand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Some months ago I had to buy a new one only because I dropped my old one and broke. I use it every day and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Newer/better version of tool I&#x27;ve bought b4.  After my last wore out, I tried other similar types and was disappointed.  My hair is medium thick, straight by nature and now just below shoulder with slight bangs, tapered sides and back along bottom.  Not a blowdryer but a styling tool, I use a reg dryer until almost dry and then this tool to curl bangs, sides and back bottom and staighten frizzies on back.  For me it&#x27;s easier than a round brush and dryer.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for myself but my hair was too short for the product to be effective ( wear a wedge).  I gave it to my daughter who has a bit longer than shoulder length hair and she loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only styling tool I use! I&#x27;ve given up on flat irons, brushes, and the InStyler. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I have long, thick hair.  This tool gives me a nice curl and lots of body. I love the long cool tip for gripping.  I don&#x27;t find the dryer too large to hold comfortably.  The bristles grip the hair well.  I love the retractable bristles, no more tangles!  The cons:  I don&#x27;t think it gets quite hot enough as my curls don&#x27;t last more than a day.  Second, I wish the barrel was an inch or so longer so I could curl more hair at one time.  It is easy to inadvertently hit the cool button, leaving you without a curl when you thought you would get one. Overall a much better product than the 800w hot air brush by Hot Tools that doesn&#x27;t have retractable bristles.</li>
            <li> This gives me the best blow dry...closest thing to a salon finish that I could imagine.  I&#x27;m not coordinated enough to use two hands to blow dry (one on brush and one on dryer).  This is an awesome product and because of the easy release, my waist-length hair never tangles.</li>
            <li> I paid almost $100 for my wigo hot air brush. It quit after 5 years and it has been discontinued. What was I going to do? I was delighted when I found this one.....exactly like the wigo but a different color and love the price. Don&#x27;t know if it will last as long as the wigo, but at this price that&#x27;s ok. I am a very happy shopper.</li>
            <li> The package says 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel.  The barrel is only 1 1/16&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s the difference between working and not working for my fine chin length hair.  Very disappointing.  If your hair is shorter you might like it.</li>
            <li> I had an hot air brush that I had to replace for this one and I can HONESTLY say that THIS ONE is a WHOLE LOT BETTER! This one dries my hair in half the time and the retractable bristles are Very COOL! I know that all of these hot hair brushes say they WON&#x27;T tangle your hair but I have found that to be completely WRONG! I can&#x27;t say HOW MANY times I have gotten my hair tangled in them no matter HOW careful I try to be but this one retracted the bristles and released my hair, WAY COOL!  I&#x27;ve looked around for hot air brush types and used different kinds but I like this one FAR better. The hand barrel on it IS rather larger then the usual, but you can get use to it.  I REALLY DO like it, LOTS!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! I have had a couple of the hot air brushes in the past (different brand) and I liked them a lot. But this one is so much better. The retractable bristles make it easy to pull it out without pulling you&#x27;r hair. I have long hair and this makes it easier to do my hair in the morningings. Dry and curl at the same time! Plus no fizzy hair. I would highly recommend this product.........in fact, I did this morning to my hair stylist! She loved it and was going to buy one too.</li>
            <li> This is becoming hard to find, so get them while you can.  I have mid-length hair with layers, but it&#x27;s very fine.  It would constantly get tangled in other hot-air brushes, even if the barrel rotated.  I love the retractable bristles--the curl just pops right off the barrel.  The wand is rather large for my smaller hand, but you need the size for the wattage.  Lower wattage air-brushes will burn out faster because it takes longer to dry your hair and style at the same time.  It just takes some practice to get used to this size and where the switches and lever is.  In just a few days, I was pleased with my bouncy curls!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!!! OMG! Finally I found the perfect hot air brush styler! Its powerful unlike most that are between 200-800 watts and don&#x27;t get my hair smooth because they don&#x27;t get hot enough but this one is perfect!!!! I love the ion button and cool shot button for setting the style. I have long thick wavy hair and this beats every hot air brush!!! I&#x27;ve tried the Jilbere, Conair, Babyliss, Revlon and this is the winner! Its made nicely and I love it for smoothing out my hair!! It looks like I&#x27;ve got a salon blow out every time I use it. This replaces my flat iron which crushes and bakes my hair while damaging it and taking away all the volume.  My search for an alternative is over! I also love that I don&#x27;t loose a lot of hair in the bristles of the brush like I did with all the other brands. I will definitely get another one because its so perfect!!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite and rapid hair tool accessory.  This hot air brush with retractable bristles has a high and low setting which governs high and low heat and high and low blower force, plus a switch to turn ions on or off, plus it has a cool button to cool down the curl, then the bristles retract to permit a perfectly shaped curl.  This all works together very quickly, so it cuts down on my &amp;#34;prep time&amp;#34; getting ready for work in the morning.</li>
            <li> works very good,makes hair smooth and no frizzy. Minuses are: 1.the hand is too big and too heavy , 2.curler  is too wide for short hair</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it would be hot enough or have strong enough air flow, but it scores high on both of these! VERY happy! The retractable bristles are terrific - they actually &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; completely! And the ionization switch helps, too! I do two jobs at once: dry AND style!</li>
            <li> Basically I wanted a new curling brush to replace one that rarely got used but broke anyway.  I have used this brush several times now and really like the performance and versatility.  Quick heat, curls as much or little as you like and can just do my ends and bangs super quick but looks great and lasts ALL day.  The buttons take some getting used to and the controls are a little bulky but the RETRACTABLE BRISTLES make it all worth the learning curve.  Over all I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Makes great curls/waves, leaves hair shiny, heats almost instantly, LOVE the retractable bristles, dries as you smooth or curl, curl holds longer when styled from damp to dry, cooling button sets curl well, long cord lets you move around (ie: stand and flip hair upside down, etc), adjustable heat/speed buttons for maximum control, much easier and more effective than blow dryer and brush, minimize damage with ceramic/ion tech, 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel is the perfect size for big body or curls so you get best of both with only one tool, barrel detaches easily to pack/store or clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Little bulky, some buttons/controls take time to locate at first</li>
