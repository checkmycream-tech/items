            <li>It&#x27;s still a very good moisturizer, except the smell is different now, the so-call &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; smell is quite intolerable in the matter of fact, it&#x27;s kind of stinky and unpleasant.</li>

            <li>I really like this lotion</li>

            <li> Great deal. At the time of purchase, this pack cost considerably less than what I&#x27;d pay in a store for the same quantity. (A single bottle costs $10-12 locally.)</li>
            <li> When you have dry skin, this is the best lotion you can get , and our supplier was out of it for a long time , so we were happy to find them.</li>
            <li> Lob thid produuct bt ggees its harf to type wen youp finges slik off th keyborf. Dos a goog job greasnig up my whol bodr.</li>
            <li> My husband is very allergic, but this lotion works well for him, with no reactions.</li>
            <li> only thing that helps our hands in the winter</li>
            <li> Great lotion. Its not greasy and soaks in.  Great price!</li>
            <li> Seems like a virtually inexhaustible supply. Happy with it and continue to purchase as a medical condition requires daily use.</li>
            <li> Use this brand of Eucerine for years, and get a good deal with Amazon.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Eucercin products to me several years ago. As an older adult, I have dry skin. The Daily&lt;br /&gt;Replenishing Moisturizing Lotion does what the label states it will do. It is part of my daily bath routine.</li>
            <li> Satisfied, feel goodã€‚</li>
            <li> Nice lotion.  I use this everyday because winter in Vermont is harsh  on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and have tried all kinds of lotions available on the market. This product is my favorite. It&#x27;s not greasy yet keeping the skin hydrated for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a great value. Anyone with dry skin can appreciate a lotion that is not oily, doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your skin &amp; - most importantly - it works great. Really effective for midwestern winters.</li>
            <li> Really light and nice. Great for dry skin</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple of months ago for the first time, I don&#x27;t remember if it was from de same seller, the thing is that this lotion used to smell so good first time I bought it. Now I don&#x27;t know what happened, but they smell so bad that I can&#x27;t use it. My husband hates and and I hate it too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not buying this again.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be thicker, but overall great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, it has no smell, its light enough to use any time day or night, feels good on my skin and I think it makes my skin look better. I noticed a difference quickly.  I will buy this again. The price is good too.</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent, not greasy at all. Very lightweight and absorbs super easily. My skin really loves this lotion, plus the three pack size is a great value!</li>
            <li> have always loved this product.  amazon has it for an awesome price.  will order from amazon, again!</li>
            <li> A light, effective cream that is greaseless and satisfying. It does everything it says.  The price is right and I leave each bottle in a place where I can use it freely.  Give it a try.  I doubt you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great Price for the best lotion product out there!</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended this to my husband, I tried it, and I immediately adopted it as the only body lotion that kept my dry (and aging) skin feeling smooth and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to like vanilla scented lotions, but once I felt how this lotion nurtured my skin, I didn&#x27;t want to use anything else. So I add a little vanilla oil to my Eucerin, and it gives the sweet scent to the best lotion ever.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion on my legs with Lymph Edema for a few years now and was happy to see it at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I needed a daily lotion to moisturize, and I tried pretty much every one I could find.  Hands down, this is the best for me.  No oily residue, no smell, absorbs nicely into my skin and keeps my skin healthy.  Also, the bottle design itself is fantastic.  The pump handle is slightly over-sized making it very easy to use.  Plus, by twisting the handle one can lock out the dispensing so that the bottle can be safely stored in a suitcase with no risk of leaking.  Note to Eucerin..... please don&#x27;t EVER change the product formula or bottle design!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - love this lotion.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin try this it works really well if you use it.  My husband has really dry hands it is hard to get him to use it but when he does it works really well.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! I placed the three bottles in different rooms in the house, as it is very much needed in this dry climate. It instantly soothes my skin, bringing back the moisture. It is &amp;#34;good stuff!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price,  I use it all the time and in the summer, I use the one with SPF 15 in it.</li>
            <li> Great on my family&#x27;s sensitive skin! I love that there is no scent. This was a must during this past year&#x27;s harsh winter. Great price too!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll do for most dry skin .</li>
            <li> Does what other lotions don&#x27;t do. Repairs and last. This winter has been rough on my skin and it heals without that greasy feeling and last without constant reapplication.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizing lotion that I like and I&#x27;ve tried lots. It is not perfumed and also not greasy. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my granddaughter who has very dry skin.  So far it seems to give her itch relief for most of day.</li>
            <li> I began using this product after my surgeon suggested it and I most likely will not use any other lotion. It is a great product and the ability to have 3 in one pkg was great.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister who has breast cancer. She is going through radiation and they told her that this was the best lotion to use for the burns. She said she would try, but its really expensive. I found this great deal and since I am clear across the country and I can&#x27;t be with her, this was my way of helping.</li>
            <li> This lotion used to be my favorite, however, something changed since a couple of month ago. It&#x27;s still a very good moisturizer, except the smell is different now, the so-call &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; smell is quite intolerable in the matter of fact, it&#x27;s kind of stinky and unpleasant. I noticed that name on bottle also slightly different, newer version is &amp;#34;body lotion&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;moisturizing lotion&amp;#34;, and it&#x27;s made in Mexico now. I no longer using it and looking for another good moisturizer now.</li>
            <li> This is all I can use on my skin because I am so sensitive to everything else. It does a really good job on my skin. I use it every single day. Love that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Nice three pack. Gentle and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing without leaving a greasy feeling, and I use a lot of hand lotion, so am rather particular.</li>
            <li> light, non-greasy, healing, and leaves my skin feeling noticably softer all day.</li>
            <li> Hydrates well without leaving skin slimy. Also, doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY lotion that works for my daughter&#x27;s eczema! I tried every other lotion/cream made, organic, coconut oil, Johnson&#x27;s baby lotion, etc. Eucerin is the only lotion that made any difference on my daughter&#x27;s skin. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I will order this again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years recommended by a leading dermatologist.  Replenishes my skin on a daily basis leaving my skin feeling soft and moisturised.  I have very dry skin and this product is the best moisturiser I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. I like to buy them in bulk because they are less expensive. I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Good value.  Much cheaper than to purchase at a retail store.</li>
            <li> Useful, not greasy, moisturizing effect is good</li>
            <li> what can i say. Its a good deal for a pack of 3</li>
            <li> great price for a quality product. I purchase it through my subscribe andsave to get more of a discount. I get a shipment every  six months.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and not too heavy. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on sale. This lotion is amazing. I have always used a&lt;br /&gt;different popular brand. This lotion is very smooth and dries quickly. The dry lines on&lt;br /&gt;my legs are beginning to fade. I have found a new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my skin.</li>
            <li> Good price, Will recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I find this lotion great for my dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Got the awesome subscribe-and-save price for this 3 pack, not realizing that this was not the &amp;#34;Intensive Repair&amp;#34; heaviest lotion but the &amp;#34;Daily replenishing&amp;#34; lightest version.  Oh well, it&#x27;s not bad of course, similar to Lubriderm&#x27;s lotion though slightly less slimy-feeling, but not nearly as effective at stopping rashes as the &amp;#34;intensive Repair&amp;#34; version...wish that version was also offered in this great 3 pack price.  Strange that it&#x27;s not because in my local Target and Walmart stores, all the Eucerin lotions are priced the same, about nine bucks per seventeen ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> Repeat buyer.  Like this product for every day use.</li>
            <li> I wish AMAZON would bring this product back!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the only lotion on the market that my dry, super-sensitive skin can tolerate with no burning or irritation. I can&#x27;t imagine living without it... and that&#x27;s not hyperbole - I&#x27;m serious, it&#x27;s such a blessing. I am so grateful for for this product.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for a good price. Both my kids have eczema and we can use this lotion daily without any issues. Very light too.</li>
            <li> love eucerin, been using this product for over 20 years for my sensitive dry skin.  every day after every shower i lotion head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;i have rosascea and i use the calming cream for my face.  great products.  i recommend this to everyone and babies as well</li>
            <li> Best lotion if you have skin issues, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> What can I say, except that when products have been around for over 100 years it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re good and Eucerin is no exception.  These are just a great products.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for the hands</li>
            <li> This is a nice light moisturizing lotion that doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent.  I think I need something a little more heavy duty for the winter months because my husband tends to keep it like a oven in the house, so my skin can get really dry. I find myself echoing my mother&#x27;s mantra of \\&quot;put on a sweater if you are cold\\&quot;, but it falls on deaf ears.  Thus the need for heavier lotion...</li>
            <li> great quality at a great price!!!  in our dry area of the country, we use a lot of lotion.  Eucerin is much better than most.  Non-greasy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The item came on time and packaged well. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and love it. It moisturizes my skin without any perfume smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this company&#x27;s  product for years.  I was turned on to it by my doctor when undergoing radiation [Advance Therapy] - I use the lotion also.</li>
            <li> We will definitely be looking out for this convenient deal again.</li>
            <li> The BEST lotion out there. Doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy and you can feel an instant difference in your hands. Nothing else works like Eucerin.</li>
            <li> One in the bathroom, one in the kitchen, one in the bedroom--I use it constantly on my hands and after shower on feet and legs and arms.  Obviously, I like it and really appreciate that it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
            <li> Being put to good use.  Should last a while.</li>
            <li> Great product for winter gator-skin, bought on sale for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Great product...non-greasy and Fragrance FREE!!!  It doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin, requiring you to incessantly rub your hands trying to get it to soak in.  It&#x27;s not quite as light as Cerave, but for 1/3 the cost, it works well for me!!</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift to my Mom.  Prior to receiving this item, she told me that with this three pack she was going to give one to each of my two brothers that still reside under her roof.  When it arrived she said &amp;#34;This isn&#x27;t the lotion, it&#x27;s the moisturizer.  It&#x27;s way to good to give away.  I have to keep it to myself, those boys will have my moisturizer all over the house and when I need it I won&#x27;t be able to find it&amp;#34;.  So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve given it 5 stars.  My Mom loves it.  That&#x27;s a job well done.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dr. for dry skin. I was hesitant, I thought it was greasy, but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s cleared up my skin, as I use it daily.</li>
            <li> delivered on time,  excellent product  satisfied with purchase</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have raved about Eucerin many times.  Ditto.</li>
            <li> suitable for summer..</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Was recommended by my dermatologist and now it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. I have very dry skin, and I also have a very obsessive mind that can&#x27;t deal with texture issues, and this lotion absorbs in a way that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling gummy or sticky, so I can actually use it, although I still don&#x27;t put it behind my knees or inside my elbows.</li>
            <li> Suitable for winter use</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, I buy this often.  It goes on smoothly and the dry skin feels better right away.</li>
