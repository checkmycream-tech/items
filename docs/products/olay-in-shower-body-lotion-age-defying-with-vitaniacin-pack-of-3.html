            <li>After reading all the wonderful reviews, I just had to try it for myself.  </li>

            <li>I discovered this lotion while visiting my mother and was so impressed with it that she let me take it home with me.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Being able to apply and then rinse this off is perfect.  </li>

            <li>that is often the case with favorite things; they either improve it so that you no longer like it or they discontinue it.  </li>

            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>

            <li>Glad I bought a few online as I have not been able to find it at any store.</li>
            <li>I borrowed this from my grandma and didn&#x27;t give it back because my boyfriend gave me a hug and said I smelled really good (and he still compliments it even though I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days:)</li>
            <li>when i first tried this product last year, i fell in love with it immediately.  </li>
            <li>IT LAST A LONG TIME AND IS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very upset that Olay no longer makes this.</li>

            <li>I understand they are not manufacturing this particular version anymore.  </li>

            <li>(it&#x27;s just soft enough to glow without being overly sparkly and</li>
            <li>I have a 3 year old and can never find enough \\&quot;alone time\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My husband even asked me what I was doing different to keep my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>This works much better than slathering up with lotion every day only to have your skin still dry a few hours later.</li>
            <li>After 3 days of use my husband commented on how soft my skin was so it didn&#x27;t take long to make a difference!  </li>

            <li> I recommend this to everyone I know who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have dry skin</li>
            <li> This product now saves my skin from the dry, windy weather.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the local Target stopped carrying it, so I&#x27;m stuck buying online and paying shipping, but it&#x27;s worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it left my skin feeling a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> Be careful because it can make the shower floor slippery.</li>
            <li> This product eliminates the messy and lengthy process of putting moisturizer on your entire body every day.</li>
            <li> I am in the water everyday and my skin gets so dried out (especially in the winter)</li>
            <li> NOT PAYING SHIPPING AND GETTING 3 FOR LESS THAN $20.00</li>
            <li> I use less body lotion and the scent</li>
            <li> because you use it in the shower, all the messy parts of the application process are eliminated, literally down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I live in the cold North.  </li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I find it difficult to apply regular moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in store.  </li>
            <li> This product virtually eliminates the need for a lubricating lotion except on areas with relatively thick skin like heels and elbows.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I think Olay has stopped making it as you can&#x27;t find it anyplace now....</li>

            <li> I borrowed this from my grandma and didn&#x27;t give it back because my boyfriend gave me a hug and said I smelled really good (and he still compliments it even though I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days:) It doesnt take much product for full body coverge.  I had problems finding it,Safeway didn&#x27;t have it. But, I finally got it today at Walmart for about 5$,not to shabby...</li>
            <li> I happen to like it and so do houseguests...it saves a step in the shower to moisturize, especially in winter when you need it.</li>
            <li> when i first tried this product last year, i fell in love with it immediately.  it smells divine, is easy to use and doesnt leave your skin feeling greasy like so many other lotions do.  because you use it in the shower, all the messy parts of the application process are eliminated, literally down the drain.  it leaves your skin soft, moisturized and smelling wonderful all day long.  i get compliments on the scent often and i catch myself smelling \\&quot;me\\&quot; alot too!  they have recently discontinued this item, and replaced it with a lesser product that doesnt work as well nor smell as heavenly,  so i bought a large supply while the getting was good.  that is often the case with favorite things; they either improve it so that you no longer like it or they discontinue it.  ATTENTION OLAY:  please keep this product on the market.  i will keep you in business all by myself! i highly recommend this lotion! (bet you couldnt tell!)</li>
            <li> Love but became a bit to expensive to maintain.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this product is for you.  Olay in-shower body lotion eliminates dry, flaky skin and is easy to use.  While the conditioner is in your hair, slather some body lotion on.  Rinse your hair and your body and you are done.  Be careful because it can make the shower floor slippery.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this product!  It&#x27;s a real time saver in the morning to be able to moisturize in the shower.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so much that I have it on auto order! Cannot find it in any store although Walmart used to have it in&#x60;a different fragrance. This product virtually eliminates the need for a lubricating lotion except on areas with relatively thick skin like heels and elbows. Smells nice but can clash with fragrances.  Great for dry skin due to hot showering! Highly recommend it! Absorbs within 15 minutes w/o greasy feel, just a nice satiny smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone I know who has dry skin. It goes on quickly and easily in the shower, and smells nice but not too strong. It lasts all day, much longer than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin is silky smooth, and there is never any need to reapply body lotion for the rest of the day. This product eliminates the messy and lengthy process of putting moisturizer on your entire body every day. I dont know what I&#x27;d do without it. I&#x27;m very upset that Olay no longer makes this. Please bring it back to stores!!! I&#x27;ll have to stock up while I still can.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Hard to find in store.  Makes skin smoother and softer after shower.  Bought some as gifts, and they liked it also.  Please keep selling it.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T SEE ANY REASON TO GET 3 BOTTLES A MONTH.. IT LAST A LONG TIME AND IS A GREAT PRODUCT. NOT PAYING SHIPPING AND GETTING 3 FOR LESS THAN $20.00 WAS A REAL DEAL TO ME.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I am in the water everyday and my skin gets so dried out (especially in the winter) but you could never tell since I started using it. My mother alwasys uses baby oil in the shower but I find it too oily and it leaves this residue but the Olay In Shower lotion is amazing. I use less body lotion and the scent is wonderful( my husband loves it too)! I also love the golden speckles you can see when the light hits my skin (it&#x27;s just soft enough to glow without being overly sparkly and the quench and shea in shower ones don&#x27;t have the sparkle so the anti aging is my favorite). I use about three a month so I like to buy lots and I always try to stock up on my favorite items because you never know when they might be discontinued(hopefully never, because I will use this &#x27;til the day I die)!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have dry skin and we either forget or don&#x27;t have time to apply lotion after a shower.  This is so easy to wipe on and rinse off in the shower and I stay moisturized for the day.  What a life saver!</li>
            <li> After reading all the wonderful reviews, I just had to try it for myself.  I understand they are not manufacturing this particular version anymore.  Anyhow, I was not that impressed.  The smell was so-so and I thought it left my skin feeling a little greasy.  My daughter also tried it and felt the same way about it.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since it was put on the market and just love it.  Unfortunately, I think Olay has stopped making it as you can&#x27;t find it anyplace now....Boo!!</li>
            <li> The lotion works really well &amp; smells good also.  Glad I bought a few online as I have not been able to find it at any store.</li>
            <li> I love this in-shower lotion because it saves me precious minutes in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work. I always turn to Amazon now when I can&#x27;t find a product I want in the store any longer.</li>
            <li> This is the best solution to itchy, dry skin I have found.  Like another reviewer, I find it difficult to apply regular moisturizers.  Either I don&#x27;t put on enough to do the job, or I put on too much and am left all sticky.  Being able to apply and then rinse this off is perfect.  I just hope Olay keeps making this useful product.</li>
            <li> I discovered this lotion while visiting my mother and was so impressed with it that she let me take it home with me.  I have a 3 year old and can never find enough \\&quot;alone time\\&quot; so get any lotion on me so being able to use this in the shower makes life so much easier!  After 3 days of use my husband commented on how soft my skin was so it didn&#x27;t take long to make a difference!  Buy it as fast as you can!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - unfortunately Olay seems to have discontinued manufacture.  Hope there is a replacement soon.</li>
            <li> I live in the cold North.  This product now saves my skin from the dry, windy weather.  My husband even asked me what I was doing different to keep my skin so soft.
